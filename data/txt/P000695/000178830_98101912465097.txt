I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) was
established in November 1970 as a result of the merger of Ethiopia's two
development finance institutions; the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) and
the Ethiopian Investment Corporation (EIC). World Bank Group assistance to
Ethiopia for development finance company development however pre-dates
AIDB. In 1950, the Bank made a loan of $2.0 million to Government to
finance its share capital contribution to the newly formed DBE.   This was
followed by a direct loan of $2.0 million to DBE in 1961. The merger of DBE
and EIC in 1970 to form AIDB was on the advice of the Bank, which also
assisted in the implementation of the decision by seconding a staff member
to the Financial Intermediaries Reorganization Commission set up to
implement the merger. The Bank provided the foreign resources to get AIDB
started with a $11 million IDA credit in 1972 1/ for onlending to
industrial and agricultural projects, and appraised a follow up credit for
industrial lending in late 1973 before the 1974 revolution. This would have
been the fourth development finance credit to Ethiopia, and the second to
AIDB.
1.02      The upheavals and uncertainties which accompanied the revolution
inevitably affected AIDB, and created sufficient uncertainty about its
survival and future role to warrant stopping the processing of the proposed
fourth credit. In 1979 when the situation in Ethiopia was more settled, and
Government had enacted a new law reestablishing AIDB and clarifying its role
and powers, IDA again appraised AIDB for a line of credit.  The processing
of the credit was delayed for two years because of an interruption in new
lending operations in Ethiopia.  Thus AIDB had to be re-appraised in 1981
when lending operations resumed.
1.03      This report, which is based on the findings of the 1981 mission,
recommends an IDA credit of US$30.0 million to the Government of Ethiopia to
be passed on to AIDB. Of this, $28.0 million would be utilized for
onlending to industrial and construction enterprises, and $2.0 million would
be used for technical assistance and training. Although agricultural
projects would not be financed under the proposed credit, the report
includes a brief overview of the agricultural sector to facilitate a review
of AIDB's extensive involvement in that sector.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. The Agricultural Sector
2.01      Role and Performance.  Agriculture is the most important economic
sector in Ethiopia. It contributes approximately 50% of GDP, 90% of
exports, and employs about 85% of the labour force. About eighty percent of
agricultural GDP comes from food and export crops and 20% from livestock.
Cereals are the major foodcrops, and account for about 80% of crop tonnage.
/  See Audit Report of OED No. 2120.  The main conclusion of this report is
that IDA's concern in assisting in the establishment of an independent
financial intermediary in Ethiopia and fostering its development by
contributing to its foreign exchange resources proved, on balance,
sound.

Coffee is the most important export crop, and total coffee production
currently amounts to an estimated 4-5% of world output. Coffee exports have
increased steadily from 71,747 metric tons in 1975/76 to 78,505 metric tons
in 1979/80 and contribute between 30-70% -- varying with world price
movements -- of Ethiopia's export earnings.
2.02      The production of major foodcrops declined from about 5.3 million
tons in 1975/76 to around 4.3 million in 1978/79 due mainly to the
discolations caused by the war, internal conflicts and drought.
Subsequently output has been increasing and is expected to reach some
6 million tons in 1980/81.
2.03      Institutional and Policy Framework.  The organization of
agricultural production has undergone important changes since the 1974
revolution. First, although the bulk of output is still produced by
millions of individual farmers, they now have user rights (limited to 10
hectares per farm family) over the land they till. Second, more strenuous
efforts are being made to organize these peasant farmers into service and
producer cooperatives. There are now about 4,000 service cooperatives, but
only about 40 producers cooperatives acounting for less than 1 percent of
cultivated acreage. Third, state farms have become an integral part of the
production system. Set up initially to ensure continuity of operations of
large scale private commercial farms which were nationalized, they have been
gradually expanded and new ones set up, to bring total acreage under state
farms to about 4% of total cultivated area. These state farms operate in
the whole spectrum of agricultural activities - foodcrops, export crops,
livestock - in Ethiopia.
2.04      These changes in the organization of production have been
accompanied by changes in the organization for sector planning, policy
formulation and other support functions. There are three ministries
directly involved in the sector. A Ministry of Agriculture is primarily
responsible for policies that affect the peasant producers, as well as soil
and water conservation and forestry. A Ministry of State Farms is
responsible for development, management and operational control of state
farms. A Ministry of Coffee and Tea Development specializes in overseeing
all aspects of development of these export crops. In addition to these
ministries, three autonomous public corporations provide important support
services. The Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) markets cereals,
oilseeds and pulses bought locally to stabilize prices and to assure proper
food distribution, and procures and distributes fertilizer, seeds and
pesticides to peasant farmers under a minimum package program. The
Ethiopian Seed Corporation is responsible for implementing a national seed
multiplication program, and AIDB provides short and long term finance to
peasant associations, cooperatives and state farms for production purposes.
2.05      Government considers agricultural development its primary economic
goal, and seeks to attain self sufficiency in food grains and expand and
diversify production of export crops. Its major emphasis is to be placed on
stimulating output in the dominant peasant sector and its main policy
instruments are the provision of improved seeds, fertilizers, subsidized
credit and increased extension services.

B. The Medium and Large Scale Manufacturing Sector
2.06      Role, Structure and Performance.  Ethiopia's medium and large
scale manufacturing sector _/ is at an early stage of development, and
accounts for only 5% of GDP, 2% of exports, and 0.6% of employment.
According to the latest comprehensive survey (1978/79), the sector comprises
417 firms the majority of which produce basic consumer goods for the
domestic market, relying largely on domestic agricultural inputs. Food
processing, textiles and beverages are the most important subsectors
contributing 32%, 20% and 19% respectively of the sector's value added.
Other important subsectors are leather, wood and paper and tobacco each of
which contributes about 5%.  The pattern of enterprise location indicates
concentration in 3 out of 14 regions; Shoa (including Addis Ababa) with 66%
of employment, Eritrea with 15% and Hararghe with 9%.
2.07      Sector performance over the past 12 years has been mixed.  In real
terms production increased at an impressive rate of about 11% per annum
during the five years 1968/69 - 1972/73. Thereafter it fell by some 8%
annually in all years up to 1975/76, retained the 1975/76 level through to
1977/78, then rose by 25% and 13% respectively in 1978/79 and 1979/80.  The
growth in 1980/81 is expected to be only 6%. As with the overall economy
the decline after 1972/73 was the direct result of the upheavals of the
period. First, the revolution led to nationalization of medium and large
scale enterprises, and an exodus of previous owners, managers and skilled
workers, most of whom were expatriates. Second, scarce resources of skilled
manpower and materials had to be diverted to the internal security and
defence efforts. Third, transport in some areas was hazardous, and in
Eritrea in particular but also in Hararghe insecurity all but precluded
industrial activity. The textile industry was most severely affected with
production in Eritrea declining by as much as 90%. The sharp recovery in
1978/79 was the direct outcome of production recovery campaigns (zemechas)
which started that year after significant improvement in the security
situation. The expected reduction in the rate of growth of production in
1980/81 will be due to the attainment of full capacity in textiles, tobacco,
beverages, and many food producing firms, and to continued raw materials
shortages for the output of wood, leather and metal products.
2.08      During 1968/69 - 1972/73 investment in manufacturing was strong
and represented on average, 16% of gross domestic investment. In 1973/74
however, investment fell precipitously due to the uncertainties surrounding
the revolution, and has remained well below previous levels since then.
Considering the increasing cost and real depreciation of equipment, net real
investment in manufacturing probably became negative in about 1975/76 and
may have remained so at least through to 1978/79 3/. Since 1979/80 the
level of investment, especially in the public sector, has been stepped up to
compensate for the reduction of capital stock created by six continuous
years of low investment,
2/ Comprises firms employing 10 or more people using power driven machinery.
To illustrate, the value of net fixed assets of public sector industrial
enterprises increased by only 8.5% in current prices between 1976/77 and
1978/79, compared to domestic inflation of 53.4% over the period. This
suggests that net real investment over this period was negative.



2.09      Because of weaknesses in the data base, a comprehensive series on
productivity in medium and large scale manufacturing is difficult to
deduce. From the limited data available however, it appears that since
1977/78 output has grown faster than both the labor force and the value of
capital invested in the sector, indicating rising productivity of both labor
and capital. This was mainly due to the use of previously idle capacity and
is unlikely to be sustained now that a fair amount of plant capacity is
fully used, unless new capacity is installed. Specific data available on
some subsectors also confirm this improving productivity and suggest that a
fair number of Ethiopian industrial enterprises are efficient enough to be
reasonably competitive internationally. For example, a 1980 study of the
textile industry concluded that for two types of plain cotton sheeting,
fabrics produced in Ethiopia had lower manufacturing costs due to lower
conversion costs, than similar producers in Hong Kong and Pakistan.
2.10      Institutional Framework.  As noted above (para. 2.07) one of the
major economic changes that accompanied the 1974 revolution was the
transfer to full or majority Government ownership of all major industrial
enterprises, both Ethiopian and foreign owned. As a result, a sizable
public manufacturing sector was created which, as of May 1981, consisted of
141 individual enterprises, and is estimated to account for about 90% of
value added in medium and large scale manufacturing. The institutional
arrangements that have been put in place to manage this important public
sector reflect both the inevitable expediency that accompanied the sudden
take over of a sizable number of enterprises, and the post revolution
preference for a greater degree of central direction of economic
activity. 4/
2.11      The 141 enterprises are organized under 14 holding corporations,
13 of which are specialized by subsector (e.g. textiles, food, chemicals).
The 14 corporations in turn report to a Ministry of Industry which has
primary responsibility in the civil administration, for making industrial
policy and for promoting industrial development. Each enterprise is an
autonomous legal, production and financial entity, but relies on its parent
corporation for services such as recruitment and training of key staff,
investment planning, purchasing and marketing, where a sub-sector approach
to management is feasible. For these services, corporations receive fees
calculated as a proportion of enterprise sales.  Neither corporations nor
enterprises have Boards of Directors, and the Minister of Industry is in
principle responsible for their proper management. In practice, he appoints
the chief executive of each corporation, who in turn appoints the General
Manager of each enterprise.
2.12      In line with the system of economic management that is emerging,
and especially since 1978 when the national production campaigns were
started, a comprehensive system of annual public sector production and
financial planning is being developed. Under this system each enterprise
4/ For detailed information on the system of Economic Management in
Ethiopia, see report No. 2609A-ET entitled Economic Memorandum on
Ethiopia.



- 5 -
submits to the Ministry through its parent corporation, its annual
production plan and operating budget. These are then reviewed, discussed
and consolidated into a public sector industry operations and financial
plan and submitted to Government's Central Planning Supreme Council and the
Council of Ministers for final review and approval. The production and
financial plans as approved then become the yardsticks for evaluating actual
performance of enterprises. In practice this system has so far worked more
as a tool for determining what financial contributions the public industrial
sector can make to the Government budget, or what support they would require
from the budget. In this sense it has been a useful system in that it
permits Government to review properly how its resources in these enterprises
are being spent. As a tool for stimulating production however, its utility
and effectiveness is doubtful.
2.13      A parallel system of investment planning is also being developed,
the key features of which are (i) to require approval by the Central
Planning Supreme Council of all public industrial investment projects and
(ii) to permit independent review and approval or rejection by local lending
institutions if loan financing is required from them. Under this system,
public sector industrial investment proposals will continue to emanate from
the Ministry of Industry and its various corporations and enterprises. The
Ministry is expected to prepare and evaluate these investment proposals, 5/
drawing upon expertise in the corporations, enterprises, and outside
consultants as necessary, and to submit them to the Central Planning Supreme
Council for further evaluation, 6/ and final approval or rejection.
Approved projects can then be implemented. However, it is up to the
Ministry of Industry and the sponsoring corporation or enterprise to submit
separate requests for Government equity or loan funds to the Ministry of
Finance for the appropriate budgetary allocation, and to local and external
lenders, for other loan financing. This system has two main advantages.
First, it enables Government to effectively monitor public sector
investments and ensure that they conform to national priorities. Second, it
permits three separate appraisals of these investments; in the Ministry of
Industry, in the Central Planning Supreme Council, and in the lending
institutions. This is likely to lead to better investment decisions. A key
disadvantage is the potential delays it may cause in the processing of
projects.
2.14      Performance of the Public Sector.  The overall economic
performance of the public sector industries has so far been satisfactory.
Data provided by the Ministry of Industries on the 14 corporations show
their gross output in real terms increasing steadily by about 5% per annum
between 1975/76 and 1977/78, by 34% in 1978/79, and by 14% in 1979/80.
Estimates for 1980/81 indicate that real growth would be minimal, reflecting
capital stock constraints. The significant increase in output in 1978/79 is
5/ The Ministry has a planning department responsible for project
preparation.
6/ The Central Planning Authority has a specialized autonomous agency, the
Development Projects Study Agency, which undertakes technical,
financial, and economic evaluation of Government investment projects in
all sectors.



- 6 -
accounted for mainly by three corporations (textiles, food and beverages),
and reflects a combination of factors; improved security in Eritrea
(textiles), the coming on stream of new projects (beverages) and the effects
of the national production campaigns. Investment trends in the public
sector reflect the overall low levels of industrial investment in recent
years. Using the changes in net fixed assets of 12 corporations as a proxy
of public sector investment trends, the figures indicate declines in capital
stock between 1975/76 and 1977/78, followed by slight additions in 1978/79
largely because of the investments by the Beverages and Textiles
Corporations.  On productivity, real output per net fixed assets for 12
public corporations increased on average by 20% per year between 1975/76 and
1978/79, largely reflecting the decline in capital stock. Labour
productivity has also been improving since 1976/77, as indicated by an
increase in real output per employee from about Birr 12,000 in 1976/77 to
Birr 16,000 in 1979/80. 7/
2.15      The financial performance of the 14 corporations has also been
satisfactory. Their worst year was 1977/78, and even then they made, on a
consolidated basis, net profits which yielded a return of 2.7% on their
equity. In 1975/76, 1976/77, and 1978/79, the return on equity averaged
12%. In 1978/79, all 14 corporations operated with satisfactory gross
margins averaging 20%, but 3 made small net losses because raw material
supply problems forced them to operate below breakeven levels. As at the
end of 1978/79, the financial situation of these corporations, on a
consolidated basis, was satisfactory. Their long term debt/equity ratio was
only 0.2, and their total debt to equity ratio was 1.4. So far the public
sector has been a net contributor to Government revenues.
2.16      Strategy and Policies.  Because it has only been possible
recently, after improvements in internal and external security, for
Government to turn its attention to economic development issues, its long
term development strategy is still in the process of formulation and
articulation. A long term industrial development strategy is therefore yet
to be adopted, although a recently prepared 10 year perspective plan accords
industrial development second priority after agriculture. For the short and
medium term (3 to 5 years) however, Government has already set clear
objectives for the manufacturing sector, and has indicated how it proposes
to meet these objectives. The basic goal is to increase local production of
basic consumer goods (textiles, sugar, etc.) to reduce existing substantial
shortfalls in meeting domestic consumption requirements. The rationale is
to help stimulate further growth of the agricultural sector by providing
incentive goods for peasant farmers. In essence this is a continuation of
the import substitution strategy which has been followed in Ethiopia since
the industrialization effort was started. Given the still early stage of
industrial development, and the fact that in Ethiopia import substitution
industries tend to be domestic resource based, there remains considerable
scope for efficient import substitution development. This strategy is
therefore appropriate. The public sector enterprises are expected to be the
main vehicles for achieving this medium term objective for two reasons.
7/ Total employment in the public corporations was 60,844 in 1976/77 and
77,567 in 1979/80.



- 7 -
First, the complex question of the role of the private sector in the future
development of medium and large scale industry in Ethiopia will take time to
resolve. Second, Government feels that it is better able to plan for
investment and production along the lines desired, with public sector
enterprises.
2.17       Industrial policies are also still evolving and generally reflect
a combination of ideology, pragmatic response to existing sector problems,
and adjustments of pre-revolution practices to meet changing circumstances.
2.18       In the commercial area, the general licensing of imports of most
industrial goods, the application of import tariffs (ranging from 30-80%),
and the excise taxes levied on such imported manufactured goods, which were
the key elements in the protection system designed to promote domestic
import substitution industries before the revolution, are still in
operation. In addition, because of the scarcity of foreign exchange, a
system of centralized foreign exchange rationing for imports has been
introduced which serves to reinforce protection. The policy on distribution
of locally manufactured goods is a combination of centralized allocation
through the Ministry of Trade and special distribution corporations for some
scarce basic items (textiles, beverages, building materials), and the use of
normal commercial channels, involving private wholesalers and retailers for
other items.
2.19      In the fiscal area, the tax rate applicable to profits of
industrial enterprises has not changed. However, new Government financial
policies covering all public enterprises have been adopted, which directly
affects the public sector industrial enterprises. These policies include a
5% annual capital charge on Government equity capital in such enterprises,
and a requirement that they pay all surplusses at the end of each fiscal
year (after accumulating reserves of 30% of capital) to Government. These
policies are designed to ensure that these enterprises make financial
contributions for other development needs.
2.20      On pricing, the existence of shortages has necessitated price
control for most industrial goods. Prices are set by a National Price
Commission on the basis of actual production costs of enterprises, and have
therefore been generally adequate, except for prices of some sensitive goods
(flour, edible oil) where they have been held below costs on occasion. It
is now Government policy to remove all forms of price subsidies, and it is
therefore expected that full cost pricing will now be the norm for all
industrial goods. Finally, Government is preparing a comprehensive national
wage policy which is expected to define the role of wages as a production
incentive in Ethiopia's economic system.  In the meantime, all wages above
Birr 450 per month are frozen, and in industry, a series of ad hoc policies
which vary from sub-sector to sub-sector are in force (e.g. piece rate
system for non-managerial workers in some textile factories, and straight
salaries in others).
2.21      On the whole, the set of policies described above have not
seriously hampered the performance of existing industries, suggesting that
the import substitution strategy Government is pursuing in the medium term
is appropriate. Strong indications of this come from the near capacity



- 8 -
operation of most industrial plant and the satisfactory financial
performance in the public sector. Pending a more comprehensive and thorough
study of Ethiopian industry, it is difficult to make any judgements about
what specific policy changes are needed to further improve sector
performance. However, even without immediate policy changes, it is our
judgement that the current capacity constraints in the sector, and the
limited dependence on imported inputs by the sector justify the allocation
of funds for investments, especially for rehabilitation and expansion, in
the sector.
2.22      Constraints and Prospects.  The main problems that constrain
further short term growth of medium and large scale manufacturing are
skilled manpower and foreign exchange shortages. The skilled manpower
constraint is pervasive, but tends to be most severe in engineering and
other technical fields, both in the areas of project preparation and in the
operation and maintenance of factories. In 1980 for instance the public
sector corporations had a total of 195 professional engineering and
technical specialists, and had projected their additional requirements over
the next 5 years as 320. While skilled manpower shortages are not unusual
for a country at Ethiopia's stage of development, in the case of Ethiopia it
has been aggravated by two developments; the departure of expatriate techni-
cians after the nationalization measures, and the disruption in normal
output of local institutions of higher learning which accompanied the
revolution. The long term solution is increased and sustained training, but
in the short term Government is effectively dealing with the problem in
three ways. First a crash program for training professional engineers and
other scientists was launched about three years ago in which about 1,000
high school science students are sent abroad each year for university
training. The first batch of these should be returning soon. Second, a
National Productivity Centre was created in 1977 under the Ministry of
Industry to provide management and vocational training for industrial
enterprises. The Centre is assisted by UNDP, and provides short (4 to 6
months) courses and inplant training. Third, Government is now more willing
to use expatriate consulting and direct technical assistance, especially for
project preparation.
2.23      The foreign exchange shortage mainly constrains investment, since
almost all capital goods required by industry are imported. Of late, it
appears to be affecting availability of imported raw materials and spare
parts also.  Since Ethiopia's export sector is not likely to generate in the
foreseable future all the foreign exchange needed for the development of the
country, Government will have to seek and receive more external aid to
provide adequate resources for industrial development.
2.24      Because of current large unsatisfied demand for basic manufactured
goods which can be produced locally, the prospects for further substantial
growth in industrial output and employment over the next five years is good,
provided the necessary investments are made to expand or build new capacity.
In the public sector, such an investment drive is already underway. As
of June 1981 14 projects involving fixed investments of Birr 596 million
were under implementation. These were in four subsectors; food processing,
beverages, textiles and building materials. The Government's 10 year



- 9 -
perspective plan calls for new investments starting in FY81/82 of another
Birr 875 million (of which Birr 699 million for sugar) again mainly in the
food processing subsector. Major projects being studied for investment
beyond 1983 include a textile mill, a pulp and paper plant and a fertilizer
project, and investment costs for these would exceed a billion Birr. The
longer term prospects for industrial development are however difficult to
determine, especially in the absence of a long term strategy. It is to be
expected however that as the opportunities for import substitution in basic
consumer goods are exhausted, output growth will slow down, unless the
policies and institutions conducive to export oriented industrialization
have been put in place. During negotiations of the proposed credit, an
understanding was reached with Government on a satisfactory framework for
future dialogue between IDA and Government on its longer term industrial
strategy and policies.
2.25      Bank Experience.  The Bank Group has had very little recent
lending experience in Ethiopia's manufacturing sector. In the 1960's IFC
made loans and equity investments amounting to $14.1 million in three
industrial projects, and in 1972 IDA provided $6.7 million through AIDB for
onlending to industrial projects.   Since then there has been no lending to
the sector, although sector developments have been monitored through Bank
economic work.
C. The Small Scale Manufacturing Sector
2.26      Role, Structure and Performance.  The small scale manufacturing
sector comprises small scale industries (SSI) having less than Birr. 200,000
in fixed assets and all handicrafts enterprises. It is estimated, based on
a 1978 sample survey of SSI's in 23 urban areas that there are about 3,000
SSIs nationwide, employing about 35,000 persons and contributing about
Birr. 200 million per year to the GDP. A similar survey of handicrafts
enterprises indicates a total employment of about 350,000, and annual value
added of about Birr 400 million. The whole small scale manufacturing sector
therefore probably provides about 400,000 jobs or 3% of Ethiopia's labour
force, and produces a value-added of about Birr. 600 million or 6.5% of GDP
at market prices. 8/  Given its apparent large size, the structure of
output in the small manufacturing sector is surprisingly undiversified.
Enterprises producing basic consumer goods, particularly maize, flour,
clothes, furniture and cooking utensils predominate.  To illustrate, a
survey of 1,600 small industries indicated the following distribution of
employment: food products - 52%, wood products - 10%, textiles and fibres -
9%, metal products - 7%, and leather products - 6%.  For handicrafts, the
distribution, based on 7,100 enterprises surveyed was: weaving - (60%),
tailoring - (27%), knitting - (3%), metalworking - (2%) and woodworking
-(2%). The sector relies heavily on domestic raw materials, and exports a
negligible proportion of its total output.
2.27      It is difficult on the basis of information available, to
comprehensively analyze the economic performance of the sector. It is
however estimated that value-added on average accounts for about 50% of
8/ The official National Accounts indicate a lower figure of 4.5%,
obtained by applying a conservative growth rate to an old estimate
of the value added.



- 10-
gross production for both SSIs and handicrafts, and that average value-added
per employee is well above that of the whole economy. In terms of
employment, the sector is characterized by its labour intensity. The
average investment cost per job created for recent investments is Birr
7,800 for SSIs, and is generally below Birr. 3,000 for handicrafts.
2.28      Institutional and Policy Framework.  The private sole
proprietorship and partnership are the dominant form of institutional
ownership of small enterprises, accounting for an estimated 90% of ownership
of all small enterprises.  With Government support, however, cooperatives
are developing rapidly, with particular success in urban handicrafts.
Craftsmen with the same skills (e.g. tailors) generally benefit by way of
increased financial security and access to supplies from grouping into
cooperatives. In addition, several urban dwellers' associations (kebeles)
are operating small industries in their communities (e.g. bakeries and grain
mills).
2.29      The main institutional channel of Government support for the
development of the sector is the Handicrafts and Small Industries
Development Agency (HASIDA), an autonomous agency under the supervision of
the Ministry of Industry. Set up in 1977, HASIDA has responsibilities for
policy formulation, project preparation, technical assistance and licensing
for small industries, and the promotion, registration and supervision of
artisans cooperatives. HASIDA is well funded by Government and has
adequately qualified staff. As of May 1981 it had a staff of 670 including
38 professionals, and it had a total budget of Birr 3.8 million for the
1980/81 fiscal year. It is also assisted by UNDP which has provided US$1.8
million over 1978-82 for financing expatriate experts, equipment and
training. HASIDA has lived up to this support in its operations. In 1978
it sent a team, including AIDB staff to India to identify and prepare
profiles of 100 SSI activities that could be introduced to Ethiopia. It has
been promoting these proposals to entrepreneurs, and in 1979/80 licenses it
approved for new enterprises included 10 drawn from the 100. HASIDA also
assists SSI's in securing various raw materials (.e.g. yarn,wood, imported
metals and plastics) from the public corporations, and provides management
and technical advice to entrepreneurs in the operation of their
enterprises. The other major national institution supporting small-scale
manufacturing is AIDB, which provides credit. Its activities are well
coordinated with HASIDA's.
2.30      The Government considers the promotion of small scale industries
an important element of its development strategy for a number of reasons.
First, they lend themselves better to mass forms of organization of
production. Second, since they are spread out geographically they can
better supply the consumption needs of the vast majority of peasants.
Third, because they are less dependent on imported inputs, their development
would not put as severe a strain on Ethiopia's balance of payments as
development of medium and large industries. The creation of HASIDA and the
generous support so far given to it are indicative of this preference for
small industries. Other accompanying policy measures necessary to stimulate



- 11-
rapid sector development are however yet to be announced, apart from a law
relating to ownership, enacted as part of the nationalization measures after
the revolution. Under this law, all traditional small-scale activities,
except leather working, can be privately owned, provided assets (excluding
buildings) do not exceed Birr. 0.5 million and the owners have only one
business.  The preferred form of private ownership is, however, the
cooperative. A comprehensive policy proposal for the development of SSIs is
now under consideration by Government. This proposal, prepared by HASIDA, is
expected to include preferential treatment of SSIs for taxes, interest
rates, Government procurement, allocation of raw materials both imported and
domestically produced, and some relaxation of the restrictions on private
ownership.
2.31      Constraints, Prospects, and Bank Strategy.  The main constraint on
SSI development appears to be the hesitance of private investors to start
new businesses, because of uncertainty about Government's intentions
regarding the private sector. This is understandable, given the
post-revolution record of nationalizations and worker takeovers. The
situation is more settled now, and the Government is preparing an investment
code. Credit, particularly of foreign exchange, for investment is also a
constraint. This constraint is however not severe enough to hamper overall
sector growth. With Government support, the prospects for development of
small industries are promising because being more scattered than large
industry, they are in a good position to meet the growing demand for basic
consumer goods in rural areas.
D. The Construction Sector
2.32      Role and Structure.  The construction sector contributes about 4%
of GDP. Of this, approximately 30% is produced by the informal sector
(self-construction, artisans) mostly as housing in rural areas. In the
formal sector, construction is mainly of buildings and housing
(approximately 60%), and roads (25%). About half of the construction is
done by private contractors, and the balance by Government agencies.
Foreign-based contractors have been virtually inactive in Ethiopia since the
revolution, leading to a highly concentrated firm structure in the local
private large scale sector. Thus, among officially registered private
contractors, only 5 qualify for contracts in excess of Birr 15 million, and
only 3 qualify for contracts between Birr 2.5 million and Birr 15 million.
At the other end of the scale there are about 160 small scale contractors
the vast majority of whom are qualified only for contracts of between Birr
50,000 and Birr 1.0 million, i.e. for building construction. Typically, a
large scale contractor would have some 100 professionals, 500 skilled
workers and Birr. 10 - 20 million in fixed assets, while an established
small-scale contractor qualified for contracts of Birr. 100,000 or less
would have on average 5 professionals, 25 skilled workers and around Birr.
200,000 in fixed assets. About 75% of the turnover of established small
scale contractors is in constructing government buildings while the very
small contractors (qualified for contracts below Birr.100,000) have
concentrated on private housing and maintenance.



- 12-
2.33      Institutional and Policy Framework.  Since 1978, the Government
has engaged in major efforts to rationalize and expand its own construction
activities, in order to ensure the implementation of its investment
programs. Under a proclamation of August 1980, it centralized into three
new agencies -- the Ethiopian Building Construction Authority (EBCA), the
Ethiopian Transport Construction Authority (ETCA), and the Ethiopian Water
Construction Authority (EWCA) -- the responsibilities for construction work
and the reoulation of the industry formerly distributed among various
agencies. Y/ In building and housing construction where private
contractors are most active, EBCA is responsible for deciding which public
projects to put out to tender for private contractors and which to undertake
itself. It now has some 545 construction professionals including 85
qualified engineers and architects, and employs more than 3,000 skilled
workers. The Government's current intention is to continue strengthening
EBCA so that it may take charge of all major public building works (e.g.,
industrial and high-rise buildings), while private contractors would
undertake the smaller works, particularly outside Addis Ababa. The ETCA is
responsible for the construction of roads and the EWCA for major irrigation
and other water works projects.
2.34      Constraints and Prospects.  The public construction agencies and
the larger private contrators already receive adequate financial resources
for equipment and working capital, and are generally adequately staffed with
skilled manpower. If properly managed therefore, they should not face any
major constraints in expanding their operations. It is the small scale
contractors who face significant constraints. First is finance. They have
virtually no access to long term finance and limited access to short term
finance under stringent conditions from the commercial bank. They can
borrow up to 50% of the value of their heavy equipment (e.g. trucks) but
using the full value of such equipment as security. The maturity of such
loans coincide with the duration of the contract undertaken, which is
normally less than a year for the types of contracts they qualify for.
Where they undertake Government contracts, they have to post performance
bonds, and the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation requires at least 130%
security for such bonds. In effect, small contractors are forced to rely on
their own inadequate resources to finance equipment and working capital
needs. This severely constrains their ability to grow. The second
constraint is skilled manpower. Because of their size, and the insecurity
inherent in their operations, small contractors have difficulty to attract
and keep construction industry professionals of various kinds, and have more
difficulty in managing their businesses. Third, small contractors report
intermittent shortages of building materials such as bricks, gravel and
reinforcing iron. Supply of construction materials is however reported to
be improving and this should go a long way in reducing this constraint.
2.35      Whilst growth in overall construction activity will depend on the
performance of the economy, and significantly on Government financial and
administrative ability to carry out its planned public investment program,
it is expected that the recent upsurge in construction demand for private

development.



- 13-
housing will be sustained for a long time. Thus, depending mostly on the
availability of finance for equipment and working capital and the supply of
construction materials, there is scope for growth of private contractors.
E. The Financial Sector
2.36      Institutional Structure.  The financial system was completely
nationalized in 1975 in line with a policy of restricting banking and
insurance activities to the public sector, and was subsequently restructured
in accordance with the provisions of a new Monetary and Banking law passed
in 1976. Subsequently the commercial banking sector was further
restructured by the merger of the two public commercial banks. As a result
the financial system now comprises five functionally specialized
institutions: the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) -- the central bank; one
development bank -- the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank
(AIDB); one commercial bank (CBE); one home mortgage concern -- the Housing
and Savings Bank (HSB); and one insurance firm -- the Ethiopian Insurance
Corporation (EIC). Although each of these institutions has separate legal
personality, the 1976 banking law created a single Board consisting of nine
members and chaired by the Minister of Finance to serve as the board for
each institution, and empowered NBE to serve as the supervisor of the other
institutions. The effect of this unique arrangement is to create an apex
structure with the Board on top and the NBE as the senior institution
supervising and controlling other members of the family.
2.37      The NBE is responsible for the planning and coordination of all
banking activity and is empowered to make policies and issue guidelines on
the allocation of credit and foreign exchange and the setting of interest
rates.  It has authority to review and approve all loans by other banking
institutions to state enterprises and cooperatives if the amount exceeds 10%
of the lending banks capital, and to private individuals and foreign
companies if the amount exceeds 5% of the bank's capital.  The NBE issues
currency, manages foreign exchange reserves, extends credit to banks and to
the Government for balancing state revenue with expenditure, and performs
other traditional central banking functions.
2.38      The CBE has a network of over 140 branches and operates in the
traditional mould -- collecting savings and making advances and short term
loans.  As of December 1980, 52% of its deposits were on demand, 33% in
savings and 15% in fixed deposits. On the allocation size, loans for
domestic trade and imports represented 53% of credit granted, followed by
exports, industry and agriculture with 15%, 13% and 9% respectively. The
main source of its deposits is private individuals and enterprises with 47%
of deposits, compared with 27% for public enterprises and 6% for
cooperatives. By contrast, the main borrowers are the public enterprises
with 66% of loans compared to 32% to the private sector and 1% to
cooperatives.  CBE also keeps about 1% of its deposits with HSB, and is
empowered to lend surplus funds to AIDB on a medium to long term basis.
Although CBE provides some credit for transport and construction, it has no
capability to appraise manufacturing industrial (including small scale
industry (SSI)) projects and intends to leave that field to AIDB.



- 14-
2.39      The AIDB, which is evaluated in detail in this report, is the only
development bank, and hence the only medium and long term lender for
agriculture and industry.  It also is a major short term lender to the
agricultural sector. It does not operate any savings deposit schemes. The
HSB is the main source of long term credit for building and purchasing
private housing. It offers both savings and fixed deposits, but with only 6
branches countrywide, obtains only 7% of its resources from private
depositors. The bulk of its resources, about 63%, comes from EIC, some 13%
from the Government Pension Fund and another 12% from CBE.  The EIC is the
only insurance concern in the country and although it provides all normal
types of insurance, marine and motor vehicle insurance comprise most of its
business. A large portion of its surplus funds is passed on to HSB as time
deposits.
2.40      Resource Mobilization and Credit Allocation.    The decade before
the revolution witnessed a growing monetization of the economy and a spread
of banking, lo/ leading to rapid growth in financial savings. In the 10
years up to 1974 time and savings deposits grew at an average of 45% per
annum. Since the inflation rate as indicated by the Addis Ababa retail
price index averaged 5.5% a year over the period, the rate of increase of
savings in real terms was truly significant. Since 1974 the growth of
savings has been slower, following an erratic pattern from year to year. In
1975 savings declined by 21% due probably to the uncertainties following the
revolution. 1976 recorded a 49% increase, most likely a result of the
conversion of the Ethiopian dollar to the Birr, which required that all old
notes be redeemed at a bank. From 1977 to 1979 the savings grew by 5%, 2%
and 5% respectively, at a time when inflation ranged between 10% and 22%.
In 1980, a growth rate of 17% was experienced, probably the result of the
recovery of production and of incomes at a time when imports of consumer
goods were controlled to conserve foreign exchange.
2.41      The financial system is seen as an instrument for implementing
Government economic policies and priorities. Therefore, the allocation of
credit is governed by guidelines set annually by the NBE. As of December
31, 1980 allocation between the main users was public sector 70%, private
28% and cooperatives 2%; and by economic sectors -- agriculture 44%, service
(trade and miscellaneous items) 37%, industry 11% and housing 8%. Because
of the unsettled situation over the past seven years some allocation
decisions were taken to meet short term emergency type situations rather
than satisfy long term economic efficiency criteria. The extension of
credits amounting to over Birr 600 million for state farm development is one
such decision. Credit allocation decisions are generally made by lending
institutions on economic merit, within the broad guidelines set by
Government.
2.42      Interest Rates and Inflation.  Nominal deposit rates in Ethiopia
range from 4-6% and lending rates from 9-9.5%. 1ll/ As domestic inflation,
as measured by the Addis Ababa retail price index, has been falling over the
10/ Commercial bank branches increased form 29 in 1961 to 109 in 1971.
_T/ The rate for private deposits above Birr 20,000 is however fixed at
4%. This is bound to be a disincentive to private savers.



- 15-
past five years (annex 1) these interest rates now yield marginally negative
and positive real deposit and lending rates respectively. The inflation
rate is more likely to start rising again, as the level of investment
increases, over the next few years. It may be necessary therefore for the
level of interest rates to be increased to avoid inefficiency in resource
mobilization and allocation. The Government, however, has been hesitant to
raise interest rates for a number of reasons. It considers that on the
savings side the interest rate would not influence the savings performance
of the growing public sector, which is expected to increase its share of
domestic savings in the 1980's. Private savers are also considered to
respond more to availability of banking facilities than to interest rates.
Expansion of the branch network of the banking system is therefore
considered to be a more effective means of increasing savings mobilization.
With regard to resource allocation, the Government considers that since the
bulk of credit goes to the public sector, central direction, if properly
planned and implemented, would be a more effective tool of credit rationing
than interest rates. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes that whilst
increased public ownership and more centralized decision making in respect
of credit rationing may make the interest rate a less important resource
mobilization and allocation tool than in an open economy, the bulk of
employment, output and incomes are still generated (and will continue to be
generated) in numerous small private individual units of production and
distribution, mainly in the agricultural sector. In the longer term, as
indicated in a draft ten year plan, the Government has projected the
domestic private sector to generate the savings required to finance about
27% of the total investment program, although only about 15% of this program
is projected to be private investments. Private sector savings will
therefore continue to be important, and negative real deposit rates are
likely eventually to discourage such savings.
III. THE AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (AIDB)
A. Institutional Aspects
Objectives and Role
3.01      AIDB, originally established as a wholly government-owned share
company under Ethiopia's 1960 commercial code, was reestablished as a public
corporation under a proclamation of 1979. Its basic objective, as stated in
this proclamation, is to extend loans to the agricultural, industrial and
other sectors of the economy, financing such loans by raising resources at
home and abroad. The authorized capital, already fully subscribed and paid
up by Government, is set at the Birr. 100 million with which AIDB was
originally established.
3.02      Other activities envisaged for AIDB under the proclamation are: to
manage funds on behalf of Government or international agencies for a fee; to
make equity investments with the approval of NBE; to undertake project



- 16-
identification and promotion in cooperation with other agencies; and to
participate in the dissemination of technical, managerial, and financial
knowledge. AIDB's expected role in the financial system is therefore that
of a multi-purpose development finance institution. In practice, however,
in the medium term, it is unlikely to do more beyond providing short,
medium and long term loan finance to industry and agriculture, and managing
various funds.  This is because first, there is little need for AIDB to
actively engage in project identification and promotion at this time since a
shortage of projects is not yet a constraint on its operations. Second,
most of its clients, both public and private can obtain equity for their
projects elsewhere.  Third, AIDB has not got the additional manpower to
devote to dissemination of managerial and financial knowledge.
Board and Management
3.03      As already noted (para. 2.36) all financial institutions in
Ethiopia have one Board, chaired by the Minister of Finance. The other
members of this Board are the Governor of NBE who is the vice chairman, six
ministers, including those for industry and state farms, and a key official
of the Central Planning Supreme Council. Because of this high level
composition, the board meets infrequently, and routine supervision and
guidance of AIDB's management has been delegated to the Governor of NBE.
The Government does not intend to change this structure to permit a separate
board for each financial institution or to change the composition of the
current Board to enable it to meet more frequently. For AIDB, the main
problem created by this arrangement is that lending decisions which would
normally require final Board approval do not always get appropriate
independent review beyond the management of AIDB. To solve this problem,
the Association recommended to AIDB and the Government that a special
subcommittee of the Board be set up comprising senior people with expertise
in business and finance, to review and make final decisions on those loans
which would normally require the Board's approval, but which the Board is
unable to meet on. Government has agreed to set up this committee which
would include the NBE Governor, his deputy, the general manager of AIDB and
three others.
3.04      A general manager appointed by the Government on the
recommendation of the Board, is the chief executive officer of AIDB and has
full powers to run it on a day-to-day basis.
3.05      The present general manager is assisted in the decision-making on
lending by a loan committee chaired by the head of the legal department and
comprising heads of other departments. This committee considers all project
proposals and recommends a course of action to the general manager who takes
the final decision if the amount involved is less than Birr. 3.0 million, or
sends it up to the Board for larger loans. In addition, a management
committee, consisting of all heads of departments and chaired by the general
manager, meets at least once a week to review important issues on all
aspects of the Bank.  These two committees function as an effective part of
the management system.



- 17-
Organization and Staffing
3.06      AIDB is organized into four departments, five support units and 8
branches outside Addis Ababa, all reporting directly to the general
manager. The four departments are Agriculture, Industry, Finance and
Banking and Controller's; and the five units are Legal, Research and
Planning, Engineering, Public Relations, and Administration. The structure
is appropriate for AIDB. As of April 1981 it had 99 professional staff.
3.07      The Agricultural Department is organized into three divisions.
The state farms and cooperatives divisions are responsible respectively for
appraising loans in their respective subsectors, whilst a follow-up division
is responsible for supervision of all agricultural loans. The 8 branches
are also staffed with agricultural staff, and have authority to appraise and
approve agricultural loans up to Birr. 300,000, and Birr. 150,000 for coffee
processing loans. As of April 1981 the department had a staff of 18
professionals, and there were in addition 25 professionals in the branches.
Recruitment plans call for the addition of 12 professionals for agricultural
lending by the end of 1982.
3.08      The Industrial Department has three divisions:  Medium and Large
Scale, Small Scale Industries, and Follow-Up. The Medium and Large Scale
division is responsible for appraising projects with a fixed cost of above
Birr. 200,000 and the Small Scale Industries division for projects below
this cost. The Follow-Up division supervises all industrial loans. As of
April 1981, the department had only 12 professional staff, which has
proven adequate for current levels of industrial lending. More staff are
however needed for the planned expansion of industrial lending. Allowing
for training time, it is estimated that the department should recruit 8 more
professionals. AIDB has started recruitment for these positions and has
agreed to employ all 8 additional staff for the department by December 1982.
3.09      The Finance and Banking Department which until recently also
performed the control function has two divisions: the Accounts division
which handles all management and financial accounts and loan disbursement
and collection, and the Banking division which handles the few commercial
banking activities that AID Bank still undertakes. The department has 12
professional and para-professional staff. Three more senior level
professionals are under recruitment.
3.10      The Control Department, recently hived off from the Finance and
Banking department, has two divisions: Audit and Inspection and Management
Accounts and Credit Information. The department's establishment calls for a
professional staff of 17, of which five were in post as of April 1981. A
recruitment drive is underway. In addition to internal audit and general
control, the department participates in follow-up activities and provides
extension services by way of helping to set up accounting systems in client
firms.
3.11      The five support units, with the exception of the engineering
unit, are adequately staffed.  The engineering unit, created in 1978, was
never properly established due to the acute shortage of engineers in



- 18-
Ethiopia. In 1981, its only remaining engineer was temporarily transferred
to NBE to assist in reviewing operations of local contractors.  The question
of the role and staffing of the unit therefore needs reconsideration.
Whilst the agriculture department retains its own agricultural engineers,
the industry department was expected to use the engineering unit. Since the
unit cannot be reestablished soon, the industrial department would need its
own engineering expertise, especially for appraisal of medium and large
scale projects. Because of the shortage of Ethiopian engineers, expatriate
technical assistance is needed initially to fill this position, and it is
proposed that the cost of two years of such assistance be financed under the
technical assistance component of the proposed credit. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with AIDB on this proposal.
3.12      Staff Development.  After the revolution and the attendant
expansion of the public sector, AIDB was perhaps the main institution whose
staff was tapped to run the newly created public institutions. Over the
past 5 years therefore, a number of its experienced professional staff moved
on to senior positions in other public corporations.  In spite of this AIDB
still has a sizable cadre of experienced development bankers.   Of the 99
professionals on board in April 1981, some 44 have been with AIDB for 9 or
more years (many with service going back to AIDB's predecessor banks); 14
for 5 - 8 years; and 31 for 4 years and under. Yet the staffing must be
regarded as in need of strengthening -- in numbers to fill existing gaps and
to satisfy AIDB's expected future growth, and in quality through training of
the less experienced staff, and new recruits.  While it is unlikely, because
of the overall skilled manpower constraints in Ethiopia, that the desired
number and experience of staff would be available to AIDB, it is expected,
given the Government's resolve to strengthen AIDB that a majority will be
available, especially from new graduates. Both Government and AIDB's
management appreciate the importance of training, and AIDB has a system of
sending less experienced staff to specialized training courses abroad.  The
training funds under the proposed credit will assist AIDB expand and
continue these training activities.
Investment and Financial Policies
3.13     A policy statement adopted by its Board in August 1976, sets
general and specific guidelines for AIDB's lending operations and financial
management. The important policies are the following: AIDB will extend
credit on its own account only to projects that have received a thorough
appraisal and are found to be technically feasible, financially viable and
economically beneficial. Under exceptional circumstances, and on a
selective basis, it may at appropriate fees, manage funds of other
Government institutions and international agencies to be used for special
lending purposes. It will normally provide credit for fixed assets,
permanent working capital, and for seasonal working capital for agriculture
not related to marketing or distribution of crops. The repayment period on
all loans it grants shall not exceed fifteen years including any grace
period, and lending shall be on the basis of collateral on fixed assets, or
Government guarantees. AIDB shall pass on the exchange risk on foreign
lines of credit to sub-borrowers, and also maintain an exchange
equalization fund to offset changes in exchange rates in thoses limited



- 19-
cases 12/ where this risk falls directly on it. It can however only
undertake foreign borrowings with the prior approval of NBE.
3.14      These guidelines are typical of what one would expect for a
development bank and underscore a principle clearly set out in the
re-establishment proclamation; that AIDB is expected to be a financially
viable entity operated in accordance with normal investment and financial
policies considered prudent for a banking institution. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with AIDB on the following additional policy
guidelines, designed to further reduce its portfolio and financial risks.
(a) That AIDB's total financial commitments in a single project would
not normally exceed the lowest of 20% of its net worth or 80% of the
project's total capital cost; and
(b) that AIDB's outstanding long term debt will not at any time exceed
four times its net worth.
Operating Procedures
3.15      Appraisal:  During implementation of the previous IDA credit, AIDB
developed with IDA assistance, suitable guidelines for appraisal of medium
and large scale industrial and agricultural projects. These involved
thorough review of the technical, commercial, financial and economic aspects
of projects, including calculation of financial and economic returns using
discounted cash flow concepts. Although these guidelines are still
available within AIDB, and there are enough staff experienced in their use,
AIDB's recent appraisals have not followed them fully. Both in industrial
and agricultural appraisals, the financial and economic rates of return have
not been calculated, suggesting that AIDB is not using these as criteria for
investment. In the case of industrial projects for instance, financial
analysis has concentrated on projected cash flows and debt service
capability, and economic analysis has been limited to partial indicators
like employment creation and foreign exchange savings. To ensure that
proper financial and economic criteria are applied in the selection of
projects for financing as clearly required in AIDB's proclamation and
policies, AIDB has agreed in principle to begin using the financial and
economic rates of return concepts again in appraising medium and large scale
industrial and agricultural projects. During negotiations, this agreement
was confirmed. Presently the Central Planning Authority uses 10% as the
cut-off rate in its review of public investment programs.
3.16      Regarding appraisal of small scale industries, AIDB has developed
a suitable and simplified system which should facilitate timely processing
of a large number of small loans. This system is adequate for processing
loans under the small industry component of the proposed project. Because
lending for small contractors, and administration of training and technical
assistance funds will be new activities for AIDB, IDA will help it develop
suitable appraisal guidelines for the proposed project components in these
areas.
12/ Refer to Japan Government loans administered by AID Bank since 1972, to
be eventually transferred together with exchange losses to the Civil
Aviation and Water Resources authorities (par. 3.35).



- 20-
3.17      Follow-up.  AIDB's system of following up on its agricultural
portfolio is adequate. Field trips are undertaken to all assisted farms
three times in any crop year (at planting, flowering and harvesting) and
follow up reports on each trip discuss the utilization of funds, compare
operations to plans, review management and financial problems and make
recommendations for dealing with these for consideration by AIDB's
management committee. For medium and large industry loans follow-up
consists of receiving and analysing periodic operating and financial
reports from clients, coupled with selective field visits to problem
projects and defaulting clients for more in depth and on the spot review of
their problems. AIDB is still grapling with the problem of how to supervise
its small industries portfolio. The number of clients is already large and
scattered, and this type of borrower is less apt to provide periodic
information according to specified formats. This is an area where AIDB
could draw further on the cooperation of HASIDA, and where IDA plans to
assist AIDB during implementation of the proposed project to develop and
introduce a system of selective but intensive follow up of small borrowers
with serious problems.
3.18      Procurement and Disbursement.  Whilst it is the responsibility of
project promoters to identify and select suppliers of goods and services to
be financed with an AIDB loan, AIDB ensures during its appraisal of
projects, that the machinery and equipment to be purchased or the building
to be constructed is at the lowest possible cost as well as suitable to the
planned operation of the project. If the procurement is of a substantial
amount, AIDB would normally insist that the award should be on tender basis
with at least 3 bids being invited, and that the tender analysis be
submitted for its review.
3.19      AIDB disburses at the request of the borrower and attempts, as
much as possible, to disburse directly to the suppliers to minimize the
risk of misappropriation by project promoters. Depending on the size of a
loan, the promoters' competence and the location of a project, AIDB would
also undertake site visits to verify progress in project implementation
before disbursing. These procurement and disbursement procedures are
adequate.
Accounting and Auditing
3.20      AIDB's accounts are kept in accordance with normal commercial
practice as specified in the commercial code of Ethiopia. Its accounting
system is mechanized and is satisfactory for all control and reporting
purposes. As a public corporation, audits of AIDB's annual accounts are the
legal responsibility of the Auditor General, or an auditor designated by
him. Since 1977 the Ethiopia Audit Services Corporation (EASC), a public
audit corporation, has been the designated auditor of AIDB. EASC is
responsible for auditing the accounts of all public corporations, but
contracts some of its work to some of the few remaining private audit
firms. EASC however gives priority to audits of institutions like AIDB
which receive foreign financing, and undertakes these audits itself.
Reflecting the skilled manpower shortage in Ethiopia, EASC has less
professional accountants than it would desire, although its management and



- 21-
senior auditors have had years of experience with well known international
private audit firms.  It is competent to audit AIDB's accounts and has
demonstrated this with satisfactory audits of the accounts for 1977 and
1978.
3.21      AIDB is required to submit its audited accounts to NBE within 6
months of the end of its fiscal year, and has agreed to submit these to IDA
within 12 months of the end of its fiscal year.
Lending Terms
3.22      Since interest rates in Ethiopia are set and controlled by NBE
(para. 2.37), AIDB has no interest rate policy of its own. It currently
lends at 9.5% per annum for all loans except short term loans to state farms
for which it charges 9% per annum.  It does not charge commitment fees.  The
9.5% is also the rate charged by other banks in Ethiopia for most lending.
With the approval of NBE however, AIDB does charge rates which differ from
these for onlending of foreign lines of credit, provided the appropriate
agreement is sought by the foreign lender.  Thus, AIDB for instance charges
12% per annum on loans to small farmers under the second IDA MPP project.
3.23      AIDB's lending rates give it an adequate lending spread, given its
own average cost of borrowing of about 6% per annum. As discussed in
paragraph 2.42, however, the structure of interest rates in Ethiopia needs
review and some upward adjustment in light of past and expected inflation.
Meanwhile, IDA reached agreement with Government and AIDB during
negotiations of the proposed credit that the credit funds be onlent at 11%
per annum. This rate takes account of projected domestic inflation of about
10% per annum over the commitment period of the credit.
3.24      AIDB's term lending has been for an average of 7 years, about half
the maximum of 15 years permitted under its policy. It does not normally
carry exchange risks on foreign lines of credit, and would either pass these
on to subborrowers, or let Government carry them. In the case of the
proposed credit, agreement was reached with Government during negotiations
to carry the risk.
B. Operations and Finance
Operations
3.25      Annex 2 summarizes AIDB's operations since its inception through
March 1981.
3.26      Agriculture.  Agricultural lending has been AIDB's major
business. Through March 1981, cumulative loans approved for this important
sector amounted to Birr 1.5 billion, representing some 80% of total
cumulative lending. Agricultural lending assumed this dominant share in
AIDB's operations after the political changes in 1974 (up to the end of its
1974 fiscal year agricultural lending accounted for 41.5% of cumulative
approvals) because of the role AIDB was given as the institutional channel



- 22-
for funds for the setting up and operation of State farms. Thus, State farm
lending accounted on a cumulative basis for 85% of total agricultural
lending through March 1981 13/ compared to 5% for cooperatives and 5% for
other borrowers.
3.27      AIDB has been required to finance all the financial needs of State
farms as approved centrally in annual budgets.  Its loans have therefore
been utilized for both investments and operating expenses, and have been
both long and short term. Long term loans, accounting for about 40% of
approvals, have been used to finance land clearing, equipment, tractors and
fixtures. The beneficiary farms are operating mainly in the cotton,
cereals, coffee, tea and livestock subsectors.  The loans to   co-operatives
have also been on short and medium term, and have been in the oil seeds,
crops, sugar and coffee subsectors.
3.28      Industry.  AIDB's lending to the industrial sector, which was its
primary business before the 1974 changes (loans to this sector accounted for
48.5% of cumulative approvals through fiscal year 1974) was sharply reduced
between 1974 and 1976 because of the reduced level of industrial investment
caused mainly by the institutional changes then taking place in the sector.
Thus, during the 2-1/2 years from July 1974 to December 1976, only Birr. 5.7
million of industrial loans were approved by AIDB. Since 1977 however,
AIDB's industrial lending has been increasing steadily, and reached a level
of about Birr 63 million on an annualized basis in 1980. The significant
increase in agricultural lending has, however, led to a major decline in the
share of industry in AIDB operations, and its cumulative approvals for the
sector represented only 13% of its total cumulative approvals as of March
1981.
3.29      Since 1978, AIDB's lending to industry has only been medium and
long term.  Of this, about 98% has been for medium and large scale
projects.   In 1979 and 1980, AIDB approved 26 loans totalling Birr 88.5
million for such medium and large scale projects. 14/ The textiles, food
and beverages subsectors accounted for 37%, 28% and 23% respectively of
these approvals, largely reflecting their respective importance in the
sectoral structure of Ethiopian industry. Also in reflection of the
increased public ownership of medium and large scale projects, 20 of the 26
loans were to public enterprises. AIDB exercises adequate autonomy in its
lending to these public enterprises, and rejected 4 of their projects in
1980. In keeping with the Government investment strategy of expanding
existing industries, 22 of the 26 loans were for expansion and replacement
projects.
3.30      AIDB lending to small industries has been increasing steadily
since it was started six years ago. In 1979 and 1980 it approved a total of
49 such loans, or an average of 25 per year. This compares to an annual
average of 10 loans in 1977 and 1978 and 5 loans in 1974 and 1975. AIDB's
lending in this sector is still concentrated in the traditional small
industry subsectors in Ethiopia, as evidenced by the predominance of oil

mills (24%), metal works (20%), flour mills (12%) and tailoring (10%) in the
distribution of approved loans in 1979 and 1980. In contrast to medium and
large scale lending, private sole proprietors have been the largest small
borrowers (40 out of the recent 49), and these have been for about an equal
share of new and expansion projects. The average loan size increased from
Birr 24,000 in 1978 to Birr 33,000 in 1980.
3.31      Other Sectors.  AIDB lending outside the agriculture and
manufacturing sectors has increased significantly since 1977 because of
lending for the purchase of trucks to the National Road Transport Company.
These loans accounted for 60% of AIDB's other sector loans through March
1981. Other important borrowers have been two large scale private
contractors to finance equipment, and the Ethiopian telecommunications
service to finance an air satellite station.
Resources
3.32      As of March 31, 1981, AIDB's total resources amounted to Birr
1,306.1 million, of which Birr 1,219.3 million (94%) was local currency and
Birr 86.8 million (6%) foreign currency (see basic data).   Only Birr 21.4
million (2% of this total) of local currency resources was not committed.
3.33      Since 1975, the NBE has become the major lender to AIDB.  Of the
Birr 1,219.3 million of local resources AIDB had received as of March
1981,Birr 1,010.7 million (83%) was from NBE. These NBE loans have been
provided mainly to finance AIDB's State farms operations, but have also been
the main resources available for industry and other sector lending. They
have been at a rate of 6.5% per annum with repayments tied to the repayment
term of AIDB's subloans. The remaining local resources consisted mainly of
AIDB's paid-in capital and reserves, and various loans and grants from the
Ministry of Finance for specific projects.
3.34      AIDB currently has no foreign currency resources for normal
operations, having long ago committed what had been available from IDA.
IDA has been the principal source of foreign resources, mainly through its
third line of credit of US$11.0 million for industrial and agricultural
lending.  In addition 6 other IDA credits totalling US$11.5 million and
ranging in size from $400,000 to $3.0 million have been channelled through
AIDB as components under 4 agricultural and 2 highway projects for onlending
respectively to small farmers and four large contractors. Interest rates
charged by Government to AIDB on these IDA credits have ranged from 6.5% for
the earlier credits to 8.5% for the latter ones. Repayment of these credits
are in accordance with repayments of subloans made out of them. The
Japanese Government has provided two loans amounting to US$16.5 million
equivalent at 4% per annum, repayable in semi-annual amounts through May
1994.  These loans were tied to the financing of an expansion of the Addis
Ababa airport and a water well project and are only being administered by
AIDB. It is the intention to transfer these loans, once fully disbursed,
respectively to the Civil Aviation Authority, and the Ethiopian Water
Resources Authority. Finally, USAID has a 4% loan of US$3.5 million
outstanding, which is to be fully repaid by February 1988. This loan was
used to finance agricultural projects and was guaranteed by the Ethiopian



- 24-
Government. All these foreign resources were obtained by AIDB before the
changes of 1975. 15/ Since then it has been unable directly to raise
foreign funds for its normal operations. This failure has been mainly a
result of the very restricted aid Ethiopia has received of late, and until
the re-establishment proclamation of 1979, also of the uncertainty about
AIDB's future and the role it was likely to play in Ethiopia's changing
economic system.
Portfolio
3.35      As of March 31, 1981, AIDB's loan portfolio amounted to Birr 884.7
million distributed as follows: agriculture Birr 667.1 million; industry
Birr 113 million; and other sectors Birr 104.1 million. A summary of this
portfolio and the arrears situation is shown as Annex 3.
3.36      Agriculture.  The agriculture loans portfolio includes two groups
of loans; those approved prior to 1975 (old loans), and those approved since
then (new loans). The old loans consisted of Birr 17.9 million approved
for various private commercial farms before the land reform and
nationalization measures of 1975. These measures affected the ownership of
these farms and as a result the original borrowers either cannot be traced,
or even if traced, are in no position to repay the loans until they are duly
compensated by Government. AIDB has stopped accruing income on these loans,
and has adequately provided against them.
3.37      The new agricultural loans consist mainly of short, medium and
long term loans to State farms, co-operatives, and the Agricultural
Marketing Corporation (AMC). The distribution of these loans among these
beneficiaries, and the record of arrears of principal on them as of March
31, 1981 are summarized in Annex 3.
3.38      AIDB's lending to State farms has been on the basis of Government
instructions. The size and quality of the State farm portfolio does not
therefore reflect independent decisions by AIDB. The arrears on the State
farm portfolio was substantial until December 1980 when Birr 154.9 million
of these arrears were rescheduled into long term loans of 10 years
maturity. As a result only 9% of principal outstanding as of March 31, 1981
was in arrears over 12 months, compared to 54% as of September 30, 1980.
The rescheduling had been agreed to by AIDB on the grounds that the original
repayment schedules (ranging from 1-5 years) were unrealistic because the
funds received had been used mainly for investments with long gestation
periods. Whilst the term structure of some of these loans was a major
reason for the arrears, there are indications that many of the arrears are
just symptoms of more fundamental operating and financial problems of State
Farms. The most important of these problems are:
15/ Except for some of the IDA funds channelled through AIDB as components
of agricultural and highway projects. AIDB's role under these projects
has been secondary and it received these funds indirectly because it
was the only institution available.



- 25-
(i)  for some grains, even though the selling prices
approved by Government for State farms are
higher than what the peasant farms get, the
State farms are still unable to lower their
costs, thus making the operations unprofitable.
The outlook for significant cost reductions on
State farms are not promising.  Additionally,
the AMC has been rather lax in settling debts
to State farms for output sold to it;
(ii) all State farms were set up without equity
capital, and were fully debt financed. Unless
they are substantially capitalized therefore,
the debt service burden will remain excessive
even for profitable farms; and
(iii) the vulnerability of State farms to pressures
to increase jobs or expand acreage even where
there is little economic justification is high
because of possible political objectives in the
State farms program.
3.39      These problems are underscored by results from long term financial
projections recently prepared by the Ministry of State farms in conjunction
with proposals for the rehabilitation and consolidation of State farms.
These show that 5 out of the 9 State Farms covered would still have
cumulative cash deficits amounting to about Birr 57 million at the end of
the new repayment schedules of 10 years, unless the problems noted above
were adequately addressed.
3.40      Given this outlook, the rescheduling exercise seems to merely
postpone the potential losses on the State farms portfolio, and does not
solve AIDB's problems. A more appropriate approach to this problem, which
was agreed with Government during negotiations, is that Government would
directly bear the risks on loans to State Farms, since AIDB had no autonomy
in making these loans and would have rejected them without direct
intervention and instructions from Government. Specifically, it was agreed;
(i)  that AIDB will only repay interest and
principal on loans received from NBE for State
farm lending if and when the State farms repay
AIDB;
(ii) that any write offs of interest and principal
in respect to State farm loans would result
automatically in write offs of AIDB's
corresponding liabilities to NBE; and
(iii) that any rescheduling of State farm loans would
lead to an automatic rescheduling of the
corresponding NBE loans to AIDB.



- 26-
3.41      The outstanding loans to co-operatives amounted to Birr 10,7
million. Of this, Birr 2.9 million, representing 27.1% of the portfolio
outstanding in co-operatives was affected by arrears over 12 months. Since
this amount has been affected by arrears over a long period, it is doubtful
whether it could be collected through normal channels. Therefore AIDB plans
to start writing them off from its accounts starting in June 1983, if
litigation to recover the amounts is not successful by then. Meanwhile
provisions against these loans are adequate.
3.42      The amount outstanding in AIMS which is wholly in arrears,
represents balances on two loans made in 1974 and 1975 for the distribution
of fertilizer. Since AIMS has been liquidated, appropriate steps are being
taken by AIDB to recover these amounts from GovernmenLt or to write it off.
AIDB plans to review and collect, reschedule or write off the other
agricultural loans in arrears over 12 months, by June 1983, and will report
quarterly to IDA on its progress in this area.
3.43      Industry.  The industrial loan portfolio as of March 31, 1981,
also consisted of two groups of loans. These were loans (Birr 17.9 million)
taken over from the Ethiopian Investment Corporation (old loans), and loans
AIDB has made since its inception (Birr 95.6 million).The breakdown of these
new loans between the public and private sectors, and the arrears situation
as of March 31, 1981 is provided in Annex 3.
3.44      The loans outstanding in state and majority state owned
enterprises also correspond to amounts outstanding in medium and large scale
projects. As of March 31, 1981, 3% of the principal of these loans was in
arrears over twelve months, and the proportion of affected loans was 11%.
Whilst this level of arrears is acceptable, AIDB has not made provisions
against the Birr 3.1 million actually in arrears over 12 months. In this
connection, an understanding was reached with AIDB during negotiations to
change its provisions policy and start making provisions on the principal of
these public enterprise loans with effect from June 30, 1982.
3.45      The loans outstanding in cooperatives and private borrowers
amounting to Birr 2.3 million represent AIDB's small industry portfolio as
of March 31, 1981.  The principal arrears over twelve months on this
portfolio was Birr 0.7 million which is 30% of the portfolio and is quite
high. The proportion of affected loans was consequently also high at 43%.
Even though small industry lending is generally more risky and therefore
more prone to defaults and arrears, the situation of AIDB's small industry
loan portfolio also indicates laxity in follow-up on AIDB's part.
As noted in para. 3.17, the introduction of an effective system of follow up
on small industry loans is one area where IDA will be assisting AIDB during
implementation of the proposed project. Meanwhile, AIDB is undertaking a
case by case review of small industry loans in arrears, and is instituting a
vigorous collection effort, to reduce the proportion in arrears over 12
months to under 5% by June 1983. AIDB will submit quarterly reports on its
progress to IDA.



- 27-
3.46      The loans taken over from the Ethiopian Investment Corporation of
Birr 17.9 million is almost all in arrears over 12 months. As these loans
date back to ten years, a good number of them may be genuine write-off
cases. AIDB is taking steps to write off those loans which are
incollectible, by June 1983.
3.47      Other Sectors.  AIDB loans outstanding in other sectors of Birr
104.1 million were predominantly in the transport sector and consisted
mainly of loans to the National Transport Company (NATRACOR) for the
purchase of trucks. As of March 31, 1981 6.5% of these other sector loans
were in arrears over 12 months, and the proportion of affected loans was
43%. The main defaulter in this group is Natracor, which is experiencing
financial difficulties. AIDB is in a process of rescheduling these loans,
but may eventually have to call up its Government guarantees on them.
Financial Performance and Situation
3.48      Annexes 4 to 6 show financial statements and ratios for AIDB for
1976 through 1981. AIDB has in every year since its inception earned enough
income to cover its interest costs and administrative expenses.  Its actual
yearly lending spread has ranged from 1.8% to 6.6% during the period, and
this has enabled it generate adequate pre-tax profits. During its first
three years it also generated net profits after taxes and provisions which
yielded average annual returns on total assets of 1.8%. As a result, by the
end of its 1974 fiscal year, it had built up reserves amounting to Birr 9
million (10% of its paid-in capital). The changes of 1974/75 necessitated
substantial provisions against the portfolio in FY1975 (Birr 10 million, or
90% of gross income for the year was set aside for provisions) with the
result that AIDB showed a net loss of Birr 6.1 million in 1975, and saw its
accumulated reserves reduced to Birr 3 million (3% of paid-in capital). In
FY1976 AIDB reverted to profitability with a modest net profit yielding 0.3%
on average total assets. Its performance has been declining since, as the
net profit to average total assets ratio declined to 0.05% in 1977, and
0.02% in 1978. In 1980 it made a net loss of Birr 4.0 million, and the
draft accounts for 1981 show a net loss of Birr 11.4 million. The main
cause of this declining financial performance is the rapid increase in the
arrears on AIDB's portfolio which has accompanied the rapid increase in the
level of its operations. This has led to substantial charges against income
for provisions, without a corresponding substantial increase in its lending
spread.  The effect of this trend is a gradual depreciation of AIDB's equity
base, which at Birr 96.3 million as of June 30, 1981, was Birr 3.7 million
less than the paid in capital of Birr 100 million. It should be noted
however that AIDB has been generating enough internal funds through
provisions to meet its debt servicing obligations, and even provide
surplusses for new lending. Nevertheless, a major financial goal for AIDB
in the coming years would be to reverse this trend by improving the quality
of its portfolio and thereby reducing the need for provisions.



- 28-
3.49      AIDB's financial structure and situation has changed in three
important ways since the revolution. First, its total assets have grown
rapidly from Birr 170.4 million in FY74 to Birr 1,082.1 million in FY81
largely because of the growth of its portfolio. Second, the composition of
the portfolio has changed. At the end of FY74, it consisted of Birr 96.7
million in long term loans (58%) and Birr 70.3 million in equity investments
(42%), mainly in the industrial sector. In contrast, at June 1981, it had
no equity portfolio, short term loans (Birr 261.2 million) had become an
important component, and the Birr 709.8 million in long term loans was
mainly in the agricultural sector. Third, while its capital base has
remained virtually unchanged (at around Birr 100 million) since 1974, its
total liabilities have increased from Birr 68.8 million as of end FY74 to
Birr 985.8 million as of June 1981 leading to a total debt to equity ratio
of 10.2/1, and a long term debt to equity ratio of 5.9/1. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with AIDB to limit its long term debt to
four times its equity (para 3.14).
C. Economic Performance
3.50      Economic Impact.  On the basis of the data available, it is
possible to assess the contribution of AIDB's lending in industry, transport
and construction to capital formation and employment, but not to output.
In small industries, where AIDB only started lending in 1974, its cumulative
lending of Birr 2.4 million through December 1980, had financed investments
amounting to Birr 3.9 million (62%). The projects assisted are estimated to
have created about 600 additional jobs, for an average investment cost per
job created of about Birr 6,500 ($3,140) which is good. In medium and large
scale industry, transport and construction, AIDB loans of Birr 250.3 million
between January 1974 and December 1980 financed investments of Birr 479.4
million (52%). The estimated employment generated by these investments is
4,434, for an investment cost per job created of Birr 108,000 ($52,000).
This is high, but reflects the large proportion of replacement investments
financed by AIDB. Before 1974, AIDB's industrial lending also financed
about 50% of the capital investments in the beneficiary projects, but the
employment effects of these investments have not been assessed.
3.51      The economic contribution of AIDB through its agricultural
operations is more difficult to assess quantitatively. AIDB has been the
main financier of all State farms, but as has already been argued (para.
3.38), it should neither be held responsible for these operations, nor be
given credit for their conception and economic effects. Its role has been
to review the investment and operating proposals submitted by the State
farms to ensure that resources provided by the Government would be utilized
in the most economic way feasible. AIDB's assistance to agricultural
co-operatives started after 1974, as an inevitable consequence of land
reform and the socialization measures.  Agricultural producers' cooperatives
however account for less than 1 percent of total agricultural output or
acreage, suggesting that AIDB's operations in this area is yet to yield
significant production benefits.



- 29-
3.52      Performance Under IDA Projects.  IDA made a line of credit of $11
million (304-ET) to AIDB in 1972 to finance industrial and agricultural
subprojects, and a consulting study on agricultural credit. 16/ It
satisfactorily loaned $6.7 million for 22 industrial projects (compared to
$5.5 million originally allocated to industry). Although the credit was not
closed until mid-1977 because of disruptions following the change in
Government, this industrial component had been largely committed by 1974 and
disbursed by 1975. The IDA funds helped finance fixed investments of $15.5
million equivalent in these projects, thereby facilitating the mobilization
of $8.8 million equivalent of other resources for capital investment in
industry. Actual employment data as of 1975 is available for only 10 of
these 22 projects. These 10 had total employment of 943, and fixed assets
of $18 million equivalent for an average actual fixed investment per job of
$19,088, which is reasonable. Despite the nationalizations and exodus of
technicians and managers, these subprojects realized on average about 90% of
the output turnover forecast at the time of investment for the initial years
1975-76, and to date they have no significant arrears on their loans from
AIDB, except for a textile plant in Asmara which could not be operated for
some time because of security problems.
3.53      AIDB was less successful in utilizing the agricultural component
of the credit. Of the $5.3 million originally allocated for financing
agricultural subprojects, only $4.1 million was utilized, and of this only
$0.9 million onlent for 5 agribusinesses was according to plan. An amount
of $1.7 million was lent to 170 commercial farms, compared to $3.8 million
planned because medium and long term lending to commercial farmers was slow
to develop. An amount of $0.5 million allocated for lending to very small
farmers organized as co-operatives was never utilized because AIDB failed to
develop operations in this area, fearing that the cooperatives' lack of
financial sophistication created too high a risk. This amount, and part of
the balance of unutilized funds for commercial farms were reallocated after
the land reform to finance part of the costs of an emergency plan by EPID to
provide plowing oxen, implements and other inputs to many of the new tenant
farmers who were settled on former commercial farms. The remaining amount
was reallocated to industrial lending.
3.54      During the implementation of the project AIDB developed into a
strong development bank noted for the high calibre of its professional staff
and the efficiency with which it carried on its operations. It was
therefore frequently utilized by Government and other donors to channel
development funds for a variety of other purposes. In this regard it has
served as a financial administrator of IDA agricultural credit funds
totalling $6.5 million mostly for small farmers under 5 projects, and for
credit funds to large contractors totalling $4.0 million under 3 highway
projects.17/ It has satisfactorily performed the tasks assigned to it
under these projects.
16/  For a full review of its performance under this credit refer to OED
report No. 2120.
17/  The agriculture projects were (i) Addis Ababa Dairy Development -
269-ET; Washed Coffee Project - 290-ET; Agricultural Minimum Package I
- 416-ET; Second Wolamo Agricultural Development Project - 486-ET; and
Lower Adiabo Development Project - 516-ET. The highway projects were
the fifth - 332-ET; sixth - 552-ET; and seventh projects - 708-ET.

D. Prospects
3.55      Strategy.  AIDB has emerged from the post-revolution reform of
Ethiopia's financial system with virtual monopoly over medium and longterm
lending for agricultural and industrial development, and possibly for
construction and transport. This monopoly should provide AIDB with a good
opportunity to influence national policies and investment decisions in these
sectors, but also imposes a responsibility to provide financial support for
appropriate national programs, once decided by Government, in the best
manner feasible for an autonomous development bank. AIDB seems best able to
influence and support programs through its lending activities, and should,
over the coming three years, pursue a lending strategy which would
emphasize:
(i) increasing lending for peasant agricultural
production; increasing lending to medium and
(ii) increasing lending to medium and large scale
industrial enterprises, to expand production of
basic consumer goods necessary to satisfy
domestic demand, especially in the rural
sector, so as to provide appropriate incentives
for agricultural production;
(iii) increasing lending to small and cottage
industries to help expand their output, improve
productivity and absorb more labour, especially
the urban unemployed; and
(iv) widen the scope of its lending to contractors
by reaching down to smaller contractors who do
the bulk of the work in private housing and
other private sector construction jobs.
3.56      This strategy fits in well with the medium term development
strategy of the Government in industry, and would help balance the current
tilt in the construction sector towards large scale publicly owned
construction agencies. It is a strategy worth the Association's support.
3.57      Forecast Operations.  In line with the agreement (para. 3.40) to
recognize the special nature of AIDB's state farm lending operations, the
projections of AIDB lending for FY82 through FY85 (Annex 8) separate these
special operations from normal operations on which AIDB is expected to bear
the risks. In agriculture, AIDB's projected normal lending is to producer
co-operatives, and will cover both short term seasonal and long term fixed
investment needs. As in the past AIDB expects to lend mainly for production
of oil seeds, sugar, and coffee.
3.58      Industrial lending in nominal terms, is projected to increase
steadily from an average annual level of Birr 35 million in 1977 and 1978,
to about Birr 40 million by 1982 and 1983, and reach Birr 60 million by
1985. As in the recent past lending for medium and large scale projects



- 31-
is expected to account for about 95% of the annual value of approvals, with
the rest  going to small industries.  In terms of number of projects,
however, AIDB plans to increase the number of annual SSI loan approvals from
the present average of about 25, to about 50 by 1985. Medium and large
scale borrowers will be mainly public enterprises, and in line with
Government's medium term strategy of expanding domestic production of basic
consumer goods, it is expected that AIDB 's lending over the next 3 to 4
years will continue to be mainly in such subsectors as food processing,
textiles and building materials.  Projects currently under study or
preparation in the public sector which are likely to require loan finaning
from AIDB by 1982 or 1983 include an oil mill and cake factory, a sorghum
and wheat flour mill, three textile mills to produce yarn and fabrics, and a
brick factory.  Small scale industry lending will be mainly for private
enterprises in traditional activities as grain milling and tailoring, as
well as in newer type small industries as soap and plastic button making.
AIDB receives a large number of applications for such loans each year.
3.59       The projected lending in other sectors is small, mainly because
only planned lending for contractors is included. AIDB may however become
active in lending for private truck and bus operators, leading to higher
other sector operations than currently estimated.
3.60       The projected special operations assume that the present form and
level of Government financial assistance to State farms will continue.
Government has however indicated that its policy is to consolidate the
existing farms and try to make them financially viable. If this policy is
successfully implemented, the need for annual Government financial
assistance to these farms would be reduced, and the amount of funds likely
to be channelled through AIDB for special operations would be less than
projected. AIDB would however still continue to manage the existing state
farm portfolio.
3.61       Forecast Financial Results.  Financial projections for AIDB for
FY82-85 and the underlying assumptions are shown as Annexes 7 to 12. The
income statement projections show that with a lending spread of about 3.2%,
AIDB will generate enough income from normal operations to cover its opera-
ting expenses, including payment of 5% capital charges to Government, _8/
even after fairly conservative assumptions about bad debt losses. It is
assumed that the spread on loans to state farms will represent AIDB's fees
for managing these operations on behalf of Government. After adding AIDB's
income from such fees 19/ to its normal income the projections show it will
make profits after taxes and provisions which will yield an annual return on
net worth averaging 4.5%; a significant improvement on its financial
performance over the past four years. The cash flow projections indicate
that AIDB would generate adequate normal operational inflows to meet -its
debt servicing obligations, and also provide some of the funds needed for
l8/  AIDB is seeking exemption from the 1979 proclamation which prescribed
such charges for all wholly Government-owned enterprises.
19/  Because of the financial situation of State Farms 38% of the possible
fees to AIDB are written off each year as bad debts in the projections.
The assumption is that AIDB would not be able to collect these.



- 32-
disbursements against new loans.  The debt service coverage ratio will be
adequate under normal circumstances, and would only be tight (1982) and
unacceptable (1983 and 1984) if loan collections should be half of what is
projected in these years. Such a problem is only likely to occur if
security problems should again lead to a massive diversion of national
resources from economic development, and possibly to a shut-down of
factories. It is however expected that in such a situation, AIDB would
seek appropriate rescheduling of its own debt obligations, thereby solving
any debt servicing problems.
3.62      After appropriately excluding NBE funds for State farm lending
from AIDB's normal debt, the projected long term debt to equity ratio is
reduced to 3.4/1 at the end of FY85, within the agreed 4:1 limit. The level
of provisions is projected to increase from 5% of the portfolio as of June
1981 to about 16% as of the end of FY85. This very conservative approach is
being taken since the planned review of AIDB's portfolio, may require larger
than usual loan write offs over the next few years.
E. Evaluation
3.63      Although the political and economic changes that took place in
Ethiopia in 1974 initially created uncertainty about AIDB's future role,
this uncertainty has now been removed through the 1979 re-establishment
proclamation which clearly states that AIDB would continue to perform as an
autonomous development bank. AIDB still has a sizable cadre of experienced
professionals, and except for the special problems with state farm lending,
generally undertakes its operations in accordance with policies and
procedures. required of a properly functioning development bank. Largely
because of increased arrears on its portfolio, AIDB is currently financially
weak, and should take steps to improve its financial condition. Various
measures have been discussed and agreed with IDA for achieving this
improvement in its financial situation by June 1983, and for strengthening
other aspects of AIDB. These measures are summarized in Annex 13.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The proposed project has two main objectives.  The first is to
strengthen AIDB to more effectively fulfil its role as the only development
finance institution in Ethiopia lending for agricultural and industrial
development. In this connection improvements in the quantity and quality of
AIDB staff, improvements in its analysis of investment projects, and
improvements in its portfolio and financial condition will receive
particular attention. The second objective is to assist Government through
financing of industrial investment and technical assistance, in its efforts



- 33-
to expand the capacity of the manufacturing sector to satisfy some of the
demand for basic consumer goods. In addition to these objectives, the
project will assist AIDB start an experiment in financing small contractors.
B. Description of the Project
4.02      The proposed project will comprise the following five components
totalling US$30.0 million, for commitment within the two-year period July
1982 - June 1984. Reallocations between components will be permitted with
IDA approval if needs change during project implementation.
(i) US$25.0 million line of credit to AIDB to cover
part of its foreign resource needs for lending
to medium and large scale industrial
enterprises. The investments to be financed
under this component will be for rehabilitation
and expansion of existing enterprises, but new
projects with strong links to existing projects
would also be considered on a selective basis.
(ii) US$2.0 million line of credit to AIDB to cover
part of its needs for lending to small scale
industrial enterprises;
(iii) US$1.0 million line of credit to AIDB to launch
an experimental scheme for financing the
equipment requirements of small scale
contractors;
(iv) US$500,000 training funds to help AIDB and
other public sector institutions involved in
the industrial sector 20/ upgrade the quality
of their professional staff in project develop-
ment, project management, and accounting;
(v) US$1.5 million for consulting services and
technical assistance to help alleviate the
critical shortage of manpower for sector and
subsector studies, sector planning, feasibility
studies and enterprise management and
operation.
The proposed Line of Credit for medium and large scale manufacturing
projects
4.03   This line of credit is the main component and will finance AIDB's
loans for capital investments in manufacturing projects with total capital
costs exceeding US$250,000 equivalent. It will carry the following terms
and conditions:
20/ Other beneficiaries envisaged include the Ethiopian Audit Services
Corporation and the National Productivity Institute.



- 34-
(i) Relending Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk:
AIDB will onlend for subloans at a minimum of
11% per annum. With projected domestic
inflation of 9-10% per annum, this will yield
positive real rates of 1-2%. Government will
onlend the funds to AIDB at 8% per annum, and
will bear the exchange risk.
(ii) Free Limits: IDA will approve all subloans
proposed by AIDB under this component, which
exceed US$200,000, up to an aggregate of US$2.0
million.
(iii) Other Limits: To ensure that AIDB will not use
this component for a few large projects, no
more than US$4.0 million will be onlent to any
one project.
(iv) Amortization Schedule: AIDB will repay funds
onlent by Government under this component
according to an adjustable composite amortiza-
tion schedule that will conform substantially
with the aggregate of the amortization schedule
of subloans. The individual amortization
schedules will be subject to a maximum of 15
years, including appropriate grace periods.
The Proposed Line of Credit for Small Industries
4.04      This line of credit will finance AIDB loans for capital
investment in small scale manufacturing projects, i.e. those with capital
costs below $250,000. The relending rates and treatment of exchange risk
would be the same for the component for medium and large industries (para.
4.03(i)). Other special terms and conditions are:
(i) Free Limits: Because AIDB already has a
suitable system for appraising small loans, and
the average loan size under the component is
expected to be small, subloans would not
require prior IDA approval.
(ii) Disbursement: Because of the large number of
small disbursements this component will
generate, disbursements by IDA to AIDB will be
based on periodic statements of expenditure
from AIDB. AIDB's accounting and control
system is adequate for this form of
disbursement, and IDA supervision missions will
review the supporting documents.



- 35-
(iii) Amortization Schedule: Because of the large
number of small loans expected to be financed
with this component, an amortization schedule
based on the amortization schedules of
individual loans would not be very practical.
AIDB would therefore repay funds onlent under
this component according to a fixed schedule of
10 years, including 4 years of grace, starting
from the date of credit effectiveness. The
projected average duration of each subloan is
five years, and the four years grace period is
expected to be adequate for AIDB to fully
commit and disburse these funds.
The Proposed Line of Credit for Small Contractors
4.05      This line of credit will finance AIDB loans for equipment
purchases by contractors qualified by registration with the Government for
contracts not exceeding Birr 2.5 million (approximately US$1.25
equivalent). This component would carry the same terms and conditions as
the component for small industries (para. 4.04) except that because AIDB is
inexperienced in financing small contractors, IDA would initially approve
all subloans under this component. Additionally a loan limit of US$150,000
would be applied per enterprise to ensure that the proceeds are not used by
only a few contractors.
The Proposed Training Component
4.06      This component will help AIDB and other institutions concerned
with the development of industry, to upgrade the quality of their
professional staff in project development and management, accounting and
finance. It will finance external training, typically of 6 to 12 months
duration, as well as training to be provided under courses organized
locally. The funds under this component will be passed on as a grant from
Government to AIDB and IDA will approve all training proposals to be
financed therefrom.
The Proposed Technical Assistance Component
4.07      This component will help alleviate the critical shortage of
professional manpower for planning and implementation of industrial
development. It will finance consulting services for general sector and
subsector studies, project identification studies, project feasibility
studies, project rehabilitation studies, and any other studies for which
consulting services would be required. It will also finance direct
expatriate technical assistance for institutions involved in sector planning
and project preparation, and for the operation of enterprises. The
principal clients for this component are expected to be public sector
industrial corporations and Government planning agencies. The funds will be
passed on as a grant from Government to AIDB, and IDA will approve all
proposals therefrom.



- 36-
C. Project Costs and Financing
4.08      The size of the proposed credit component for medium and large
industries is based on AIDB's projected approvals for such borrowers for the
two year period July 1982 through June 1984. The expected approvals will be
about Birr 100 million, of which an estimated 80% would be for imports of
capital assets and would require foreign exchange. Since AIDB would not be
financing more than 80% of the capital cost of each project (para. 3.14),
the minimum capital investment that its lending would help finance during
the two year period would be about Birr 125 million. Based on its recent
experience of financing about 50% of project costs however, the capital
investment is more likely to be around Birr 200 million. The breakdown of
AIDB resource requirements and financing for medium and large scale
industries during this period is as follows:
In Birr Million
Local      Foreign      Total
Loan approvals                           28          72         100
Financed by
IDA credit                                         52          52
Unidentified                                       20          20
Internal cash generation               28           -          28
28         72100
The proposed IDA credit of US$25.0 million for this component will therefore
finance 72% of the foreign exchange requirements, and about 52% of the total
approvals. The projected foreign exchange shortfall of about $9.7 million
equivalent after IDA financing, is likely to be financed with a first line
of credit from the European Investment Bank.
4.09      For small industries, AIDB plans to approve loans to about 70
projects between mid 1982 and mid 1984. The estimated costs of these
projects is Birr. 7.4 million, of which Birr. 3.3 million is in foreign
exchange. AIDB plans to lend about Birr. 4.2 million to these projects to
finance about 57 percent of their costs. The proposed IDA credit of US$2.0
million will finance all of AIDB's projected lending.
4.10      The experimental component for small contractors is planned to
assist about 20 established contractors each borrowing an average of $50,000
to purchase equipment such as mixers and vibrators. The cost of subprojects
may vary widely depending on the context within which the equipment purchase
is planned. It will range from a single replacement purchase (e.g. of a
mixer), to a purchase of new sets of equipment required for expansion of
operations. The proposed IDA credit of US$1.0 million for this component
will fully finance all AIDB loans to this category of contractor. In line
with AIDB's policy however, borrowers would be required to contribute at
least 20% of the total cost of investment. The IDA allocation per project
would therefore not exceed 80% of costs.



- 37-
4.11      The proposed training component is not designed for basic
training, but for short term skill upgrading. The amount of US$0.5 million
allocated is based on (i) the estimated costs of tuition, subsistence and
travel for about 10 AIDB staff going on 6 month courses abroad, and (ii)
similar programs for about 25 other staff from various public agencies.
Attempts would be made however to organize some of the courses locally so as
to benefit more people, and the IDA funds would be used for local cost
financing in such cases.
4.12      The US$1.5 million proposed for technical assistance is based on
150 manmonths of such assistance at an average manmonth cost of US$10,000,
including salary, international travel and subsistence.
D. Project implementation
4.13      AIDB will be responsible for implementing all components of the
project. The small industry borrowers would also receive technical
assistance for project preparation and operation from HASIDA, in line with
existing cooperation arrangements between AIDB and HASIDA. For the training
and technical assistance components, AIDB will appoint a full time project
officer (para. 3.08) to review and process applications for summission to
IDA. The detailed procedures for implementing these components shown in
annex 16 will be agreed upon during negotiations.
4.14      Reporting Requirements.  AIDB's reporting under existing IDA
credits have been regular and thorough, and it will be required to continue
providing such reports. These include (i) quarterly reports on its
operations, portfolio, resources and financial condition, and (ii) audited
accounts within 12 months of the end of its fiscal year. In addition AIDB
would be required to prepare and submit a completion report on the project.
4.15      Procurement.  Procurement for subprojects financed under the
credit components will be in accordance with AIDB's procedures which require
competitive shopping for large procurement packages and are adequate for the
size of procurement packages expected (para. 3.18). Consultants and other
experts hired under the technical assistance component would be qualified
and experienced and would be hired under terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA.
4.16      Disbursements.  The proceeds of the credit to be used for medium
and large scale industries will be disbursed to finance 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of imported goods; 80% of the total costs of previously
imported goods and 60% of the total cost of civil works. The proceeds of
the credit for other components would finance 100% of the total cost of
goods and services. Projected disbursements for the credit is shown as Annex
15, and is based on the disbursement experience under the previous credit to
AIDB as modified by the general IDA disbursement profiles for development
finance company and technical assistance credits. Disbursements are
expected to be completed by June 1989.



- 38-
E. Benefits and Risks
4.17      The main direct economic benefit of this project would be the
increased production of basic manufactured goods that it would make possible
through its provision of foreign exchange for increased investment,
especially in medium and large scale projects. Shortages of such goods
threaten the efforts of Government to stimulate peasant agriculture because
material incentives are weakened. A second direct benefit would be the
employment effects. Assuming AIDB continues to finance about 50% of project
costs of medium and large industries, then the $25 million from the project
would lead to about $50 million in capital investment. At the $52,000 per
job created recently experienced by AIDB, and allowing for inflation, this
level of investment could create about 960 jobs.  It should be noted however
that the $52,000 is high and reflects a lot of replacement investment
(para. 3.50) which AIDB is likely to finance less of under the proposed
credit. The employment effects as estimated should therefore be considered
conservative. The small industries component would finance about US$3.6
million of investment. Taking AIDB's recent experience of $3,140 investment
cost per job created in small industries, and allowing for inflation, the
small industries component could lead to the creation of about 1100 jobs
The experimental component for small contractors will also create jobs, but
because of AIDB's lack of experience in this area, the number of jobs likely
to be created is difficult to quantify in advance.
4.18      Project benefits will not be limited to increased production and
jobs. To the extent that AIDB's capabilities to act as an independent check
of public investment programs through strict application of sound investment
criteria is enhanced by the resumption of IDA financial and technical
assistance, the project will yield significant economic benefits to
Ethiopia, because it will have strengthened one of its important financial
institutions. The training and technical assistance to be provided to other
institutions other than AIDB would also improve overall sector management.
4.19      The project faces no specific risks that are greater than can
normally be expected with operations of this type, although unexpected
shortages of domestic or imported supplies could possibly hamper the ability
of industrial enterprises to undertake investment plans, and adversely
affect their operations and thus the health of AIDB's portfolio. Secondly,
even in normal times, small industry and contractor loans present high
default risks, and AIDB needs to exercise caution in expanding in this
area.  These risks are however not unusual, and the potential project
benefits make them worth taking.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
5.01      An IDA credit of US$30.0 million to the Government of Ethiopia to
be-passed on to AIDB for the proposed project is recommended.
