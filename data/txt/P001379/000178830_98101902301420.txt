Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:      Kingdom of Lesotho
Amount:        US$6.0 million
Terms:         Standard
Project
Description:  The Basic Agricultural Services Program (BASP) is aimed at
increasing output of five major crops (maize, sorghum, beans,
peas and wheat) in six development blocks, covering 75 percent
of Lesotho's arable land and encompassing about 66 percent
of the countryts population, through the provision of agri-
cultural inputs, training, credit, extension, stores, roads,
and marketing facilities. Investment in the six development
blocks would be financed by cofinanciers (EEC, the Federal
Republic of Germany and the U.K.); however, each would follow
the same pattern of operations, coordinated centrally by the
strengthened MOA. The proposed IDA credit would assist
specifically the improvement of the institutional capabilities
of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) by (a) establishing a
Basic Agricultural Services Program Division and strengthening
the Administrative, Accounting and Crops Division; (b) es-
tablishing a Central Credit Management Unit within MOA; (c)
establishing a Planning and Evaluation Division, and (d) support-
ing a training component within MOA's Extension and Information
Division, in order to enable MOA to coordinate and supervise
BASP.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
FOR A BASIC AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Lesotho for the equivalent of US$6.0
million on standard IDA terms for a basic agricultural services project.
The Federal Republic of Germany is expected to provide a grant of US$1.8
million, and a credit on IDA terms of US$2.9 million. The European Devel-
opment Fund has agreed to provide a grant equivalent to US$3.8 million.
The United Kingdom Overseas Development Ministry has agreed to provide
a grant equivalent to US$3.9 million, and UNDP has agreed to provide tech-
nical assistance equivalent to US$0.2 million.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Economic Memorandum
on Lesotho" (No. 1083a-LSO) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
July 8, 1976. A special mission visited the country in September 1976,
as part of a study on regional migration in southern Africa; its report
was distributed to the Executive Directors in February 1978. An updating
economic mission is scheduled to visit Lesotho in May 1978. Country
data are shown in Annex I.
3.        Lesotho is a country with few natural resources and is one of the
29 countries designated as "least developed" by the United Nations. Sur-
rounded by the Republic of South Africa, it is mountainous, with less than
15 percent of its land area suitable for crop cultivation; population pressure
on the land is considerable. In 1976, the population was estimated at 1.2
million with a growth rate of 2.2 percent a year. GNP per capita in 1976 was
estimated at US$170.
4.        The economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture and by migration
for employment mainly in the mineral and agricultural sectors of South Africa.
Subsistence agriculture and livestock rearing provide the main economic
activity of about 90 percent of the resident population and account for about
50 percent of the domestic product. However, due to severe constraints (see
para. 16), Lesotho agriculture has remained very unproductive.
5.        While Lesotho's lack of natural resources hinders rapid development,
its unique migrant labor situation remains the Government's most formidable
problem. About 200,000 Basotho (including more than half the country's male
labor force) are estimated to be employed as migrant workers in South Africa;
this contrasts sharply with only about 28,000 gainfully employed in the
modern sector of the domestic economy. With few opportunities for domestic
earnings comparable to those in South African mines, the rising wages in



-2-
South Africa in recent years have spurred even greater migration. Between
1970 and 1976, the number of Basotho workers in the mines increased by 28,000
while domestic wage employment is estimated to have grown by about 6,000.
6.        Lesotho has benefitted from migration through substantial remit-
tances which have become critical to improving the living standards of a
large segment of the population. The value of migrantstremittances is almost
equivalent to the country's domestic product; 60 percent of these remittances
are compulsorily repatriated to the Government-owned Lesotho National Bank and
are becoming an important source of development finance. However, the migra-
tion of such a large proportion of the country's able-bodied population occurs
at the same time as a domestic shortage of both skilled and semi-skilled man-
power and compounds the problem of long-term development of the economy.
Furthermore, the country is now extremely vulnerable to developments affecting
migration in South Africa over which the Lesotho Government has no control.
This was brought home sharply in the beginning of 1974 when, because of dis-
orders at some South African mines, between 10,000 and 15,000 migrant workers
suddenly returned to Lesotho. Although the emergency situation was quickly
resolved and most of the migrant workers resumed work in South Africa the
Government remains seriously concerned with the likelihood of similar occur-
rences, which might be of longer duration, Also, increasing mechanization
in South African mines and greater recruitment of South African workers since
1974 (the proportion of South African workers in the mining labor force has
increased from 24 percent to 50 percent), are expected to lead to a slackening
in the future demand for foreign migrant labor. Because of these uncertain-
ties, the Lesotho Government established in 1977 with IDA support under the
Second Highway project, a labor-intensive construction unit within the Ministry
of Works. The operations of the unit, comprising 35 professional and tech-
nical personnel and about 200 unskilled workers, will be experimental and
will be closely monitored. The unit is expected to develop the Government's
organizational capacity to cope with any future emergency employment situa-
tions, while providing the opportunity for training in much needed supervisory
skills. It should also provide a basis for a long-term strategy to accelerate
domestic employment and gradually reduce the critical reliance on migration to
South Africa.
7.        Together with Botswana, South Africa and Swaziland, Lesotho belongs
to the Southern Africa Customs Union, established in 1910, which provides for
free movement of goods between member countries. Also, under this union, all
customs, excise and sales duties are paid into a common revenue pool and
allocated to members in relation to the value of their imports and excisable
production. Merchandise trade, which is mainly with South Africa, has shown
a substantial increase in recorded imports, from US$32 million in 1970 to an
estimated US$154 million in 1976; this stands in sharp contrast to a corre-
sponding rise in the value of exports (mainly wool and mohair) from US$6
million to US$12 million. However, the trade deficits have been more than
offset by migrant workers' remittances and official transfers.



-3-
8.        The Customs Union is the source of about 60 percent of Government
revenue, which increased from US$16 million in 1969/70 to US$35 million in
1975/76. Recurrent expenditure in the same period rose from US$16 million
to US$32 million. United Kingdom grants in support of the current budget
were discontinued in 1973/74 when a surplus of US$8 million was realized;
in 1974/75 the current surplus was US$15 million but dropped to US$3 million
in 1975/76 as recurrent expenditure increased sharply following an upward
revision of public service salaries.
9.        Given the economic stagnation of the previous decade, results of
the First Five Year Plan have been encouraging. Between 1969/70 and 1974/75,
GDP growth in real terms was about 5 percent a year; this was due mainly to
increased agricultural output in 1974/75, following very favorable weather,
and to a lesser extent, expansion in the government and tourism sectors.
Investment (most of which was in the public sector) increased from 10 percent
to about 15 percent of GDP following a marked improvement in the Government's
implementation capacity. Manufacturing, mining and construction together
account for only about 5 percent of GDP. However, the investment of US$30
million in developing a diamond mine at Letseng-la-Terai in the northeast is
expected to boost industrial output and create about 500 jobs; production
began in late 1977. Also between 1969/70 and 1974/75, GNP increased at about
8 to 10 percent a year, largely as a result of substantial migrants' remit-
tances. In addition to output growth, there have been a number of other
favorable developments: the educational system is being reformed to better
serve the country's development needs; the chronic budgetary deficits were
eliminated; the financial system as well as the domestic resources mobiliza-
tion effort have been strengthened; and most importantly, the Government's
implementation capacity has improved significantly.
10.       The Second Five Year Development Plan (1976-81), which calls for
a GDP growth rate of 8 percent a year, extends the basic objectives contained
in the First Plan. Briefly, it aims at (i) raising agricultural output;
(ii) increasing employment opportunities at home; (iii) improving the quality
of education and expanding vocational training and educational opportunities
in rural areas; and (iv) improving communications among regions within the
country. Total public investment is estimated at US$93 million (1975 prices)
of which one-third is allocated to agriculture and rural development. In
September 1977, the Government revised its capital program which is now
estimated at about US$185 million (in 1975 prices) following the report of
a United Nation's mission which recommended substantial additional assistance
to help the country reduce its dependence on South Africa. The Government
recognizes the difficulties in raising agricultural incomes to a level com-
parable with earnings in South Africa as well as the limited employment
effects of agricultural programs. However, these investments are part of a
long-term process towards viability in agriculture, which would have to absorb
most of the migrants if there were a significant reduction in migrant labor in
South Africa.



-4-
11.       In the past, the country's low absorptive capacity was itself
a serious constraint to economic growth. However, in recent years, the
Government has increased its capacity to identify investment opportunities.
The results of a number of pre-investment studies on sector potential (trans-
portation, tourism, power, minerals, telecommunications) have enhanced the
project content of the second Plan. With a substantial program of technical
assistance in education, training, and government administration, we expect
the country's overall implementation capacity to continue improving over this
Plan period.
12.       At the end of December 1976, Lesotho's external public debt (dis-
bursed only) amounted to US$15.4 million on which service payments were
US$0.4 million; this represents less than 2 percent of recurrent revenue (in
Lesotho's circumstances a more meaningful concept than the relationship to
foreign exchange earnings). Over the next several years, Lesotho is likely
to continue to receive most of its capital assistance as grants or conces-
sionary credits. Servicing of external public debt is therefore expected
to remain about 2 percent of Government recurrent revenues.
13.       Lesotho's lack of natural resources and the constraints imposed
by the migrant labor situation underline the difficult task of development.
Current revenue remains critically dependent on the Customs Union, the
future of which is uncertain. While the recent amendment to the revenue
sharing formula will improve the revenue situation, revision of public
service salaries in 1975 and again in 1977 (because of increasing skilled
labor migration to South Africa) will seriously reduce the budgetary surplus
originally envisaged to help finance the Government's capital investment
program. In addition, the country's growing absorptive capacity and, in
particular, the recurrent budgetary commitments of an expanding public
investment program call for a more rapid increase in revenue and greater
diversification of revenue sources. However, given the country's limited
resources and narrow tax base, these objectives can only be realized in the
long term. In the meantime, donor agencies should consider financing in most
projects not only all foreign costs, but also a substantial part of local
costs. If Lesotho is to sustain its development, it will need continuing
concessionary financing on grant and IDA terms.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       To date Lesotho has received IDA credits totalling US$29.2 million
for six projects. The first, in 1966, was a US$4.1 million credit for a
highway project which provided for paving a section of the main north-south
road; the project was successfully completed in 1969. The second was a
US$5.6 million credit made in 1973 for the Thaba Bosiu rural development
scheme. The project is currently meeting its objectives of providing
12,000 rural families with a minimum package of inputs, credit and extension
services (see para. 23). The third, in 1974, was a US$4.0 million credit for
an education project. The project has progressed well in expanding Lesotho's
vocational and commercial training capacity and improving the country's rural



-5-
educational program. The fourth was a US$5.5 million credit for a second
highway project and the establishment of a labor-intensive construction unit.
The credit was signed in March 1976 and project implementation has made a
good start. The fifth, a US$2.5 million credit approved in April 1977,will
assist Lesotho's industrial development by providing financial assistance to
the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC) and its subsidiary, the
Basotho Enterprises Development Corporation (BEDCO). The sixth, a US$7.5
million credit was approved in November 1977 for a second education project.
It will assist the government in its efforts to restructure Lesotho's educa-
tional system to meet the country's development needs. At the end of 1975,
IDA's share of Lesotho's total external public debt (disbursed and outstand-
ing) was 61 percent (due to the fact that most external aid in the past has
been provided on grant terms). Servicing of IDA credits accounted for 12
percent of total debt service. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA
credits and notes on the execution of the ongoing projects.
15.       Future operations will continue to support the Government's de-
velopment objectives (para. 10). Preparatory work is underway on a third
highway project to improve part of Lesotho's national highway network and the
project is scheduled for appraisal in May 1978. In addition, preliminary
discussion has begun on a third rural development project which may focus on
land use, livestock or soil conservation. The Bank Group also expects to
continue financial assistance to LNDC and BEDCO. In the meanwhile we are
also reviewing possibilities of co-financing a rural water supply development
project with Germany.
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Characteristics
16.       The sector is dominated by subsistence agriculture and livestock
rearing, which account for 50 percent of the domestic product and about 70
percent of the country's export earnings. Subsistence agriculture consists
mainly of maize and sorghum but production is inadequate for domestic needs
and Lesotho has to rely heavily on food imports from South Africa. A va-
riety of cash crops such as asparagus and potatoes have been introduced and
acceptance by farmers is encouraging, although their overall impact is small.
Livestock plays a major role in Lesotho's culture and economy. Close to 75
percent of total land area is classified as pasture. In 1975, exports of
wool, mohair, cattle and other livestock products accounted for about 50
percent (about US$7.0 million) of Lesotho's export earnings. The livestock
population is equivalent to about 1.2 million adult cattle units, which is
greatly in excess of the estimated national carrying capacity of 0.9 million.
About 90 percent of rural households are involved in agriculture; however,
because of the high rate of migration for work in South Africa (see paras. 5
and 6) male labor is scarce and women and children comprise the core of the
agricultural labor force. Remittances from migrants contribute substantially
to rural household incomes.



-6-
17.       In view of agriculture's importance, the Government gives highest
priority to its development; 30 percent of total expenditures in the Second
National Development Plan are for agriculture. However, there are serious
obstacles to developing Lesotho's agriculture. One of the most serious is
soil erosion through which the country loses a significant part of its soil
fertility. Overgrazing by cattle, poor cultivation practices, limited mixed
farming and the traditional land tenure system (where all the land is owned
by the King) all contribute to Lesotho's erosion problem. Besides erosion,
frequent wind and hail storms and uncertain rainfall add further considerable
risks to farming. As a result, Lesotho's agriculture is one of the world's
least productive and in fact recorded yields per acre have declined by about
40 percent during 1950-70.
Agricultural Services
18.       The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for formulating agricul-
tural policies and programs and providing extension services. The Ministry
is seriously understaffed which limits the range and quality of services pro-
vided. The improvement of the Ministry's services other than research, is a
major focus of the Project (see para. 27). Although research activities are
inadequate, a research component is not included in this project because a
separate "Farming Systems Project", which will strengthen the Ministry's
Research Division, is expected to be funded by the USAID from mid-1978.
19.       In 1973, the government established the Produce Marketing Corpora-
tion (PMC) to (i) organize and regulate marketing of agricultural produce,
(ii) export and import pulses, grain and grain products; and (iii) advise
MOA on pricing of agricultural products and grading systems. PMC operations
are expected to be strengthened with the assistance from USAID at the end of
1978, which will facilitate efficient distribution of inputs. The timing of
future assistance is not expected to cause problems to the Project, since pro-
vision within the Project would suffice to handle interim recuirements (see para. 34)
20.       Training in the agricultural field is provided through various
institutions under the Ministries of Agriculture and Education. However,
both the present and expected output are far short of projected requirements.
Improvements in the training program are a major focus of the IDA-financed
part of BASP (see para. 33).
21.       Agricultural credit is available through commercial banks, credit
unions, thrift societies, farmers' associations, agricultural contractors
and mostly through area-based projects. Apart from the commercial banks and
area-based projects, credit is badly managed with poor repayment records.
Demand for seasonal credit from the formal sector does not appear substantial
due to remittances from migrant workers in South Africa. Requirements for
medium- and long-term credit, however, are considerable.
Government's Strategy for Agriculture and IDA Assistance
22.       The government's objectives for the agricultural sector as stated in
the first Five-Year Plan were to (i) increase domestic incomes; (ii) expand
employment opportunities; and (iii) attain self-sufficiency in food. The



-7-
Government has tried to achieve these objectives primarily through the estab-
lishment of area-based projects and a Cooperative Crop Production Program
(CCCP). The Senqu River Project financed by UNDP was completed in 1977 and
aimed at improving general agricultural standards and animal husbandry in
the Mohales Hoek and Quthing districts. It involved provision of seasonal
credit for block farming by farmers' associations, and medium-term credit to
finance purchases of livestock and agricultural equipment by individuals.  The
Khomokhoana project which is financed by SIDA began in 1975, following a pilot
phase,and is expected to be completed by 1980. It covers an area of 64,500
acres and approximately 8,000 households. The project aims at improvement of
crop and animal husbandry practices. It involves extension, provision of
inputs including credit, improvement of roads, soil conservation, and live-
stock development. The Cooperative Crop Production Program started in 1976.
The Government experimented with a program of mechanical and modernized winter
wheat cultivation. The program was based on sharecropping, with Government
and farmers as partners. According to Government evaluation the scheme led to a
significant improvement in yields of wheat, and the Government would like to
extend the project scope to cover other crops like maize, potatoes and fodder.
However, so far the scheme has not attracted external support.
23.       The Thaba Bosiu Rural Development Project supported by IDA with a
credit of US$5.6 million and a USAID grant of jS$2.8 million started in 1973,
to promote agricultural development in an area containing 75,000 cultivatable
acres with a population of 17,000 farm families.  It included provision of
extension service, input supplies, seasonal and term credit, marketing facil-
ities, research, road construction and improvement, livestock development,
soil conservation, and introduction of special crops (asparagus). The
project is making satisfactory progress and farmer participation exceeds
appraisal estimates. Research indicates that, through higher fertilizer
rates and improved husbandry practices, yields and farmer incomes can
increase economically. Conservation work which started late due to delays
in machinery deliveries is now on schedule. Funds are expected to be fully
disbursed in the first quarter of 1978. The Government has indicated that
activities related to livestock development, soil conservation and promotion
of asparagus production will be continued by the appropriate divisions of
MOA; and the Government is actively seeking financial assistance to support
these activities. Although CIDA and IFC have indicated interest, so far no
firm pledges have been made. A Project Completion Report and Performance
Audit will be prepared during 1978.
24.       Area-based projects have added significantly to farmers' exposure
to improved farming practices, and have demonstrated the viability of the use
of fertilizer and improved seeds. They also have assisted in establishing
better marketing facilities. However, they covered small parts of the country
with disproportionate input of expertise, and their separate administration
hindered the strengthening MOA.



-8-
PART IV: THE PROJECT
25.       The Project was prepared by the Government with the assistance of
the Bank's resident mission in Eastern Africa. The Government's request for
IDA assistance was received in August 1976 and the Project was appraised in
the field in October/November 1976. Several donors are cooperating in assist-
ing the borrower to implement the Project (see para. 38). Unfortunately the
several sources of support for the Project and the limited capacity of the
Borrower to coordinate them have resulted in considerable delay. The co-
financing arrangements have involved very extensive discussions, including
the two post appraisal visits (in April and October 1977) to Lesotho to re-
view the project with Government and the other financiers. In addition, two
donors' meetings were held in Brussels, London and Frankfurt (in July 1977
and January 1978) to resolve issues. Negotiations were held in Washington
from March 28-30, 1978. Lesotho delegation was led by Mr. A.M. Monyake
Permanent Secretary for Planning and Statistics, and included Messrs. G. Ntsane,
Deputy Permanent Secretary for Agriculture, N. Thokoa, Budget Controller,
Ministry of Finance and V. Rose,Adviser to BASP Director.
26.       A report entitled "Lesotho - Appraisal of the Basic Agricultural
Services Project," No. 1524a-LSO dated April 11, 1978 is being distributed
separately.
Objectives and Description of the Basic Agricultural Services Program (BASP)
and the Project
27.       As area-based projects (paras. 22-24), in view of their capital and
manpower intensity,cannot be replicated to meet the basic overall sectoral
needs, the Government has embarked on a more broad-based program called a
Basic Agricultural Services Program (BASP). The program aims at arresting
declining productivity and increasing output of major food crops (maize,
sorghum, beans, peas and wheat) on which the country has experience, through
provision of basic agricultural services over a period of 25 years. The
services would include provision of agricultural inputs, training, credit,
extension, stores, roads and marketing facilities. BASP would cover 75
percent (730,000 acres) of Lesotho's arable land. About 66 percent of the
country's population (130,000 farming families) live in the program area.
The proposed project forms the core of a five year slice of BASP. It would
improve agricultural services, provide rural infrastructure and strengthen
central management for rural development. Specifically, the project would:
(a) improve the institutional capabilities of the Ministry
of Agriculture through: (i) establishing a BASP Division
within MOA; (ii) strengthening the Accounting and Crops
Divisions; (iii) establishing a Planning and Evaluation
Division within MOA; (iv) establishing a Central Credit
Management Unit; and (iv) supporting a training component
within MOA's Extension and Information Division;



-9-
(b) strengthen and develop extension services and marketing
facilities for five major crops: maize, sorghum, wheat,
beans and peas;
(c) provide incremental agricultural inputs including fer-
tilizers, seeds and pesticides;
(d) improve credit services for farmers; and
(e) develop and maintain feeder roads.
Project Area and Field Services
28.       The Project area covering the whole of the lowlands has been divided
along geographical and agricultural lines into six Development Blocks. In each
of the Blocks, the activities enumerated in (b) to (e) above would be under-
taken. Although the blocks would be financed by different donors (see para.
38), each would follow the same pattern of operations.
Detailed Features
29.       Central Services.  To strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture which
is expected to coordinate and supervise the implementation of BASP, a BASP
Division has been established in the MOA, headed by a locally recruited
Director, who is being assisted by a UNDP adviser (both already appointed).
The Project would provide for two Agricultural Development Advisers whose
functions would include liaison with the various field blocks. Replacements
of the BASP Director and his adviser would be made in consultation with IDA
(Section 3.02 (a) and (b) of the draft Credit Agreement). The project would
also provide for an internationally recruited Workshop Manager to ensure that
all BASP vehicles and equipment remain in good working condition. The appoint-
ment of the Workshop Manager would be made after consultation with IDA (Section
3.02 (a) and (b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
30.       The Central Accounting and Credit Division has been strengthened
by the addition of an internationally recruited Financial Controller. The
Division is establishing an accounting system to reflect Government procedures
and the requirements of the different financing agencies. The Controller
also is responsible for the management of the Central Credit Unit until such
a date as the credit activities are transferred to the Lesotho Agricultural
Development Bank (LADB), when LADB is competent to handle these activities.
The credit activities would be transferred to LADB only after agreement with
IDA (Section 3.06 of the draft Credit Agreement). The appointment of the
financial controller was made after consultation with IDA. Any replacement
would be appointed only after consultation with IDA (Section 3.02 (a) and (b)
of the draft Credit Agreement).
31.       The Planning and Evaluation Division is expected to play a vital
role in all MOA activities (including BASP), and should have competent plann-
ing and evaluation staff. In order to strengthen it and make it effective,



- 10 -
the Project would provide for two internationally recruited senior Agricul-
tural Economists, whose appointments would be made after consultation with IDA
(Section 3.02 (a) and (b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
32.       The Project would also provide for incremental supporting staff,
housing, vehicles and equipment for each of the above Divisions.
33.       Extension and Information.  Under the Project, extension services
would be improved through the introduction to the Training and Visit Method,
which would provide farmers on a regular basis, with up-to-date advice on
improved farming practices. The Project would provide for the appointment of
an internationally recruited Extension Adviser. He would be responsible to
the Head of the Crops Division and would work closely with various district
crops officers and the BASP Division on all matters related to the Training
and Visit Extension System. His appointment would be made after consultation
with the Association (Section 3.02 (a) and (b) of the draft Credit Agreement). The
Project would also provide for an internationally recruited Training Adviser,
who would be responsible for developing curricula and planning of courses.
The three Farmers' Training Centers (FTCs) under the Division would be
strengthened by the addition of five internationally recruited trainers
and the purchase and operation of vehicles and motorcycles. Selection of
the Training Adviser and the five trainers and formulation of the training
program should take into account the fact that the majority of the agricul-
tural labor force are women and children. In addition, funds would be pro-
vided for the improvement of the activities of mobile audiovisual teams and
for the production of leaflets and radio programs. The appointment of the
Training Adviser and the five trainers would be made after consultation with
the Association (Section 3.02 (a) and (b) of the draft Credit Agreement). In
the past MOA has not been involved in selection of its staff. To ensure em-
ployment of competent staff, the Public Service Commission would consult
formally with the MOA regarding the professional competence of new staff
prior to their engagement (Section 3.02 (c) of the draft Credit Agreement).
34.       Production Inputs and Marketing.  The present distribution of seed,
fertilizers and agricultural chemicals and the policies for setting their
prices are unsatisfactory. Under the Project, funds would be provided to
improve the distribution system as well as marketing facilities for farm
produce by constructing 18 depots and village-level lock-up stores. The
Produce Marketing Corporation (PMC) would also be strengthened under an
expected USAID financed project (see para. 19). The National Fertilizer
Committee, which includes the Permanent Secretary of MOA and representa-
tives of Co-op Lesotho, is inadequately staffed to effectively perform its
functions of determining fertilizer requirements and pricing policies. By
September 30, 1978 the National Fertilizer Committee would be strengthened
by the inclusion of representatives of the Ministry of Finance, BASP Management,



- 11 -
the MOA Research Division, PMC, Co-op Lesotho and representatives from ongoing
projects (Section 4.03 of the draft Credit Agreement). To ensure that appro-
priate production incentives are maintained (see para. 49), the Association
would be consulted at least once a year regarding the pricing of production
inputs and of agricultural commodities taking into account farmers production
costs and forecasts for changes of related international prices (Section 4.02
of the draft Credit Agreement).
35.       Credit.  The project would provide funds for incremental credit
requirements for seasonal inputs like fertilizer, seeds, insecticides and
animal feeds. Interest would be charged in the form of a 12 percent mark-
up on the cost of delivered inputs. Medium-term credit (2-3 years) would
be provided for farm implements and animal contractors. Medium-term credit
would bear interest at 10 percent per annum requiring a deposit of 50 percent.
Longer term credit (4-5 years) would be provided for such items as tractors
with implements. Long-term credit would bear interest at 10 percent per annum
also, but would require a deposit of 25 percent. The funds would be administered
by the Central Credit Management Unit (see para. 30).
36.       Roads.  The project would provide funds for the improvement and
maintenance of about 1,000 km of agricultural roads. The main investment
items would be materials, equipment, operating costs, labor and the employ-
ment of three roads engineers.
Cost Estimates and Financing
37.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated
at US$26.4 million of which US$15.2 million (58 percent) would be for expenditures
on goods and services from outside Lesotho. Physical contingencies of 10
percent have been allowed for all items except personnel. Price contingencies
for vehicles, equipment and all other operating costs have been calculated at
8 percent per annum through 1979, and 7 percent thereafter, civil works 12 percent
through 1979 and 10 percent thereafter; and staff 10 percent per annum. A
breakdown of costs is given in the Credit and Project Summary
38.       The Federal Republic of Germany is expected to provide the equiva-
lent of US$4.7 million (18 percent of the total cost) to finance the costs
of Blocks II, III and IV and a part of the costs of the central services.
Of this amount, it is expected the US$1.8 million will be a grant and US$2.9
million a credit on IDA terms. The FED in June 1977 agreed to grant Lesotho
the equivalent of US$3.8 million 14 percent of the total project cost) to
finance Blocks V and VI for the first three years of the Project. The FED
also is expected to provide additional funding (perhaps US$3.0 million) to
cover the remaining costs of Blocks V and VI..through project completion)
following a mid-term project review scheduled for March 1981. The United
Kingdom Ministry of Overseas Development has agreed to grant US$3.9 million
equivalent (15 percent of the total project cost) to finance Block I and part
of the costs of the BASP central services. The UNDP has provided technical
assistance equivalent to US$0.2 million. The proposed IDA Credit of US$6.0
million would finance 23 percent of the total project cost and 74 percent of



- 12 -
the estimated costs of the central services (see para. 39). Of the US$6.0
million, US$4.0 million would finance foreign expenditures and US$2.0 million
would finance local costs. Farmers in the area are expected to contribute the
equivalent of US$1.1 million (4 percent of the total project costs). The
Government is expected to finance up to the equivalent of US$6.7 million,
or 26 percent of the total. This figure, however, includes US$3.3 million for
the estimated costs of Blocks V and VI after the first three years which the
FED is expected to finance and US$1.7 million in duties and taxes payable to
the Southern Africa Customs Union, which under the Customs Union agreement
will eventually flow back to the Lesotho Government. Taking these two factors
into account, the Government's net contribution to the Project is expected to
be about US$1.7 million. The approval process of the Federal Republic of
Germany's contribution is expected to be completed several months after IDA's
approval. Since the project components are independent and their implementa-
tion could start separately, it is not necessary tb delay project implementation
by requiring 100 percent availability of other donorst contributions all at
once. It would be a condition of effectiveness of the Credit Agreement that
at least US$7.6 million (60 percent) of the US$12.6 million to be obtained from
external financiers, other than IDA, are available to the Borrower (Section 6.01
of the draft Credit Agreement).
39.       In March 1977, the Association granted advance funding in an amount
of US$280,000 equivalent under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The
funds were to cover the salaries and wages of local and internationally
recruited staff, recruiting costs of new staff, supporting equipment, and the
construction of four housing units. The facility has facilitated appointment
of some key staff (see para. 29). As of January 30, 1978, about US$22,000
had been disbursed from the Facility. The funds advanced will be refinanced
out of the proposed IDA Credit, as soon as it becomes effective.
Organization and Project Implementation
40.       BASP would be implemented by the strengthened Ministry of Agricul-
ture (see para 29). At the central level, all divisions of the MOA would be
involved, with BASP Division performing the coordinating role. At the field
level BASP activities would be managed by the District Crops Officer (DCO),
who will be responsible for all activities relating to the five crops -- maize,
wheat, sorghum, beans and peas -- in his district. He would liaise closely
with the District Agricultural Coordinator, who is responsible for coordinat-
ing all agricultural activities in his district. At the Block level, the
various DCOs would be responsible for BASP activities in their districts,
as they relate to the five crops under the Project. The DCOs would report
directly to BASP Division. District Crops Officers would be responsible for
the construction of the store program and management of the stores, including
the efficient storage and control of both inputs and outputs.
41.       The basic tool of management for BASP would be the annual work plan,
which inter alia will specify the numbers of farmers, volume, type and value
of inputs, acreages and cropping pattern, stores, road program, credit and
staffing requirements. At district level, plans would be prepared by the
District Crops Officer in liaison with the District Agricultural Coordinator



- 13 -
and the District Stores Supervisor.  The overall BASP annual plans will be
finalized by a Working Committee, which would include the Deputy Permanent
Secretary (Technical) as chairman, senior staff of BASP Division, all MOA
Division Chiefs and representatives of all other affected agencies. The
Working Committee would be established by July 31, 1978 and it would meet
monthly to review ongoing plans (Section 3.05 (a) of the draft Credit Agree-
ment). The annual work plans would be submitted to IDA for approval suffi-
ciently in advance of the period to which they apply in order to make ade-
quate budgetary allocations (Section 3.04 (c) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Credit requirements for each year would be identified in the annual work plans
and credit allocation would be determined by the Credit Committee consisting
of the Director of BASP (Chairman), the Financial Controller, and the District
Crops Officers.
42.       The Government would provide farmers in the project area with simple
crop packages designed to improve agricultural incomes under the prevailing
soil and climatic conditions. Farmers would be expected to move from their
present unimproved practices of using their own seeds planted by broadcast
(Model I), to applying fertilizers using insecticides and improved planting
techniques (Model II). This package, coupled with improved credit, marketing
and transport facilities, is expected to increase production of the five
crops (maize, sorghum, wheat, beans and peas) by at least 50 percent from current
production levels resulting in increased marketing crops valued at about
US$11.0 million at full development. The Project expenditures are within
MOA's expected future budgetary allocations.
43.       In order to monitor BASP progress, the Government would submit to
IDA quarterly progress reports; and not later than March 1981, the Government
will call for a joint review of BASP by the Government and all the financing
agencies (Section 3.04 (b) (iii) and Section 3.05 (b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
44.       For Project components financed by IDA, contracts for the procure-
ment of vehicles (US$0.5 million) and equipment exceeding US$50,000 equiva-
lent would be awarded after international competitive bidding (ICB), in
accordance with Bank Group procurement guidelines. Contracts for goods and
services amounting to less than US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded in
accordance with government procedures which are satisfactory. In view of
their small size and remoteness of locations, civil works contracts (US$1.2
million) would be awarded in accordance with Government procedures which are
satisfactory. Draft tender documents for all contracts exceeding US$50,000
would be submitted to IDA for approval before invitations to bid were invited
(para. 2 (a) of Schedule 3 of the draft Credit Agreement). Procurement for
parts of the projects financed by the other donors would be in accordance
with standard procedures of the respective institutions.
45.       The Association would disburse against:  (a) 100 percent of foreign
exchange costs or 90 percent of local costs for vehicles and equipment; (b)
100 percent of foreign exchange cost of internationally recruited staff; (c)



- 14 -
75 percent of total costs of operating expenditures including incremental
salaries and wages; and (d) 75 percent of total costs for civil works.
Disbursements against foreign exchange costs under (a) and (b), local costs
under (a) and total costs under (d) would be fully documented. Disbursements
against total costs under (c) would be made against appropriate certificates
of expenditure certified by the Director-BASP, the documentation of which
would be made available for inspection by the Association during supervision.
Within three months of completion of disbursements under the IDA project, the
Government would prepare a Project Completion Report in accordance with IDA
guidelines (Section 3.04 (d) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Accounts and Audits
46.       Separate accounts would be kept reflecting the expenditures financed
by the different agencies. The Project-related accounts of MOA would be
audited by the Auditor General (which arrangement is acceptable to the Asso-
ciation), and would be submitted to the Association within six months of the
end of each fiscal year (Section 4.01 (b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Benefits, Justification and Risks
47.       The most important quantifiable benefit would result from the
reversal of the decline in soil fertility. This would first prevent agricul-
tural income levels from falling, and second, it would result in increased
production and marketing of crops valued at US$11.0 million in year 2001/02.
Without the Project imports of grain products at full development would in
crease by about 70,000 tons per annum as a result of declining production
(30,000 tons) and increased consumption because of rising population (40,000
tons). As a result of the Project, these import requirements would be reduced
by about 50,000 tons per annum. Exports of beans and peas without the
Project would fall from 6,000 tons to 3,000 tons per annum. As a result of
the Project, these exports are expected to be at 9,000 tons per annum. The
reduction in import requirements and increased exports are expected to occur
evenly over the lifetime of the Project. It would increase the supply of
trained personnel in the supervisory and technician cadres by about 440 and
580 respectively, and thereby strengthen the MOA. About 130,000 families
would benefit from BASP of whom about 70,000 would benefit directly through
increase in their farm incomes. The project would generate firect employment
for 500 persons. A major unquantifiable benefit and justification would be
that by developing a network of essential services and infrastructure, the
project would lay the base for exploiting technological improvements which
research (see para. 18) is expected to produce.
48.       Taking into account only the directly measurable benefits, the
economic rate of return of BASP is estimated at 13 percent over 25 years.
With a 10 percent increase in costs or 10 percent reduction in benefits,
the rate of return would fall by 2 percentage points.
49.       The risks include uncertainty regarding adequate farmer acceptance
of the BASP innovations due to initially relatively low return. Provision
for this risk has been made by using a slow rate of farmer participation



- 15 -
in economic analysis. Until recently, commodity prices of Lesotho's main
trading partner (South Africa) have been below international prices by about
15 percent. Currently, RSA and international prices are equivalent, and have
been assumed to remain so in the economic analysis. Notwithstanding these
risks this project offers at present the main hope for developing the agri-
cultural sector under conditions of Lesotho.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of
Lesotho and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
51.       Features of special interest are referred to in Section III of
Annex III of this report.
52.       Availability to the Borrower of at least US$7,6 m4Ulion equivalent
of external funds other than IDA's, is a special condition for the effectiveness
of the Credit Agreement (Section 6.01 of the draft Credit Agreement).
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 361-LSO    Thaba Bosiu Rural Development Project:  US$5.6 million;
March 23, 1973; Effectiveness Date:  August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The Project is well administered and the number of participating
farmers exceeds the appraisal targets. Crop yields have been disappointing,
partly because soils are exhausted and fertilizer usage has been inadequate.
A high proportion of families in the project area derive their main source
of income from employment in the mines in South Africa. This, combined
with the low agricultural potential in the project area, has caused people
to be uninterested in farming. In the last few years the proportion of
fallow land has increased significantly. The Project has initiated a com-
prehensive series of crop trials aimed at identification of more profitable
crop production methods. The dairy and beef fattening schemes continue to
make good progress. The Project's soil conservation component is progressing
well. Project funds have been exhausted. A project Completion Report and
Performance Audit will be prepared during 1978.
Credit No. 497-LSO    Education I Prolect; US$4.0 million; July 25, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: January 23, 1975; Closing Date:
March 31, 1979.
Project progress continues to be satisfactory. Most of the acade-
mic facilities at all project sites are ready for occupation about nine months
ahead of the appraisal schedule, and procurement of furniture and equipment is
virtually complete. Several minor building contracts were awarded during June
1977 and physical completion is expected by July 31, 1978. Educational objec-
tives, e.g., diversification of secondary school curricula, coordination of
adult and non-formal education programs are being achieved. Bilateral donors
involved in the project are all successfully implementing their programs.
*          1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 619-LSO    Second Highway Project; US$5.5 million; March 10, 1976;
Effectiveness Date:
Date: December 31. 1980
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. The civil works contract
is progressing in accordance with the implementation schedule agreed at nego-
tiations. The Labor-Intensive Construction Unit (LCU) component which started
about four months behind schedule, mainly due to delay in selection of con-
sultants, is now operational. Practically all the funds earmarked for the LCU
have been committed.
Credit No. 702-LSO    Development Finance Company Project (DFC):  US$2.5
million; May 20, 1977; Effectiveness date: August 23,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
So far US$47,320 have been committed. Because of a recent management
change and delays in recruiting key staff, LNDC Has made slow progress in improving
its organization, staffing, procedures, and portfolio. LNDC's financial situation
has not yet improved, but it will continue to get financial support from
Government as expected.
Credit No. 748-LSO    Second Education Project:  US$7.5 million; November 30,
1977; Effectiveness Date: February 28, 1978; Closing
Date: December 3, 1981
Project implementation has got off to a good start.
