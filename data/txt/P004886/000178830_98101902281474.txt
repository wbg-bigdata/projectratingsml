REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent
of US$41.5 million to help finance a second highway project. The loan would
have a term of 17 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.2
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Memorandum of the Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Algeria" (1315-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on February 10, 1977, which was based on the findings of the updating eco-
nomic missions which visited Algeria in April and November of 1976. The main
conclusions of the missions are given in the following paragraphs. A further
updating economic mission is planned to visit Algeria in May/June 1977.
Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        In 1966, Algeria's Revolutionary Council defined the fundamental
objectives which the country intended to pursue during the period ending
1980. There were reaffirmed in detail in the National Charter approved by
referendum in June 1976. In brief, these objectives are (i) to expand and
organize the production base, enabling the economy to reach, by about 1980,
a stage of self-sustained growth with full employment; (ii) to achieve
economic independence, which implies that the country would rely first on
its own resources for development, although international economic relations
would be expanded and diversified; and (iii) to improve income distribution,
particularly among regions. These objectives, and the strategy which has
evolved towards their implementation, take into account the country's physical
and socio-economic potential; the country's leadership is deeply committed
to them.
4.        The rapid establishment of a diversified and highly integrated
industrial base, the education and training of all Algerians for the require-
ments of modern tasks and austerity in consumption are the main elements
of Algeria's long-term development strategy. The National Charter places
emphasis more particularly, however, on the following aspects of the strategy.
Whereas priority goes to hydrocarbon development as a means of accumulating
financial resources, investments in other industries must henceforth be
tailored more closely to the national capacity to prepare and implement
projects, to the availability of financial resources, and to the rates of
development in non-industrial sectors. The National Charter specifically
underscores the importance of agriculture for creating jobs, for increasing
incomes and improving their distribution and for substituting agricultural

imports. Decentralization will be implemented in all areas of economic and
social life so as to achieve the country's development objectives with maximum
efficiency, while the principle of central planning of the economy will be
maintained. Workers' participation in new management structures, which were
introduced in 1971, is to be progressively expanded. The control of people's
assemblies over economic planning and management, which was already effective
at local government level, has been introduced at national level by the new
constitution approved in November 1976. Private enterprise's contribution
to national economic development will be encouraged in small agricultural,
industrial and retail trade enterprises.
5.        Algeria is implementing currently its second four-year Plan (1974-77).
The Plan estimates that total investment should reach at least DA 85 billion
(US$20.4 billion) in 1973 prices during the 1974-77 period, and thus be about
2.3 times larger than it was during the 1970-73 Plan. The Plan also specifies
a maximum investment target of DA 110 billion ($26.4 billion), with supple-
mentary projects to be undertaken if the implementation capacity could be
raised above the estimated maximum level. The share of industrial investments,
including hydrocarbons, is expected in the Plan to decrease to 44 percent in
the 1974-77 period, from 54 percent in 1970-72, while the share of other
sectors is to increase. The Plan fixes a minimum of 10 percent, and a maximum
of 12.5 percent, for the GDP growth target during 1974-77, based on expected
output from sectoral investment programs. A decline to 4 percent in the non-
agricultural unemployment rate in 1977 and a marked reduction in agricultural
unemployment is anticipated in the Plan, as a result of new employment to be
created. The Plan also provides for an acceleration of consumption growth
(7.7 percent per capita a year) and a reduction of regional disparities.
6.        Algeria's financial situation improved substantially when the price
of crude oil, its main export product, rose sharply during the last quarter
of 1973. The country's hydrocarbon export receipts rose from $1.7 billion
in 1973 to $4.3 billion in 1974. Algeria increased its foreign reserves to
$1.3 billion at the end of 1974 and repaid in advance a part of its debt to
commercial banks contracted in 1972 and 1973, despite rises in its import bill
due to sharp increases in import requirements (24 percent) and import prices
(33 percent). The domestic financial situation also improved, particularly
the position of the Treasury which captures most of the oil revenues. Based
on this improvement, the Revolutionary Council decided to accelerate imple-
mentation of planned development projects and structural reforms in the
second Four Year Plan (1974-77).
7.        During the first two years of the Plan period, 1974-1975, the
country scored solid successes in regard to investment and employment, by
comparison with the Plan objectives. Investment increased from US$3.3 billion
in 1973 to $6.4 billion in 1975 at current prices. Employment creation was
also substantial. The unemployment rate in non-agricultural sectors dropped
to 11 percent in 1975, from 15 percent in 1973. In the agricultural sector,
Agrarian Revolution cooperatives provided new permanent jobs to some 100,000
beneficiaries. Although precise data are lacking, the increase in employment,
coupled with the tax and budget measures taken in 1974 and 1975 (tax relief



measures, higher producer prices for agricultural products, substantial price
subsidies for basic commodities, and large expenditures on rural public
services) seem to have raised, as planned, living standards and consumption
levels of the least privileged population groups. As envisaged in the Plan
and emphasized in the National Charter, initial measures to decentralize and
improve economic and financial management were implemented with vigor. For
instance, in agriculture, increased autonomy was given to self-managed farms,
which, like the cooperatives of the Agrarian Revolution, are now responsible
for their own production and investment plans, under supervision of the
regional authorities and the local branches of the agricultural credit bank.
In industry, procedures for the socialist management of enterprises, including
wider responsibilities in financial management, are now in effect in most
national enterprises. Domestic trade in industrial products, like that in
agricultural commodities, is currently being reorganized with a view to give
the production units more responsibility for selling their products and
purchasing their supplies. Finally, in the context of regional development
policy, the wilayate (provinces) have been granted extensive financial and
economic powers, and they now have planning units and technical directorates
to prepare, implement and supervise local plans covering all economic sectors,
under supervision of the wilayate people's assemblies and the coordination,
at national level, of the Secretariat of State for Planning.
8.        Some less satisfactory results were also obtained.    Due to unex-
pected technical and commercial difficulties, hydrocarbon export receipts
declined from $4.3 billion in 1974 to $4 billion in 1975, falling short of
the Plan targets. Due mainly to absorptive capacity constraints, investment
in the non-industrial sectors was insufficient. Consequently, imbalances
in the pattern of Algeria's development persisted. Fixed investment became
very high in relation to GDP (49 percent in 1975) and the availability of
skilled labor. Investment in industry continued at too rapid a pace as
compared to investment in other sectors. Overall GDP growth in 1974-75 was
relatively slow (Annex I, page 3). Hydrocarbons, registered a decline in
output in 1974 and 1975. Real growth in other sectors was less than 7 per-
cent per annum. This rate was of the same order as that achieved in 1970-73,
quite modest in relation to investment for two main reasons. Firstly, the
investment program included a large number of projects in capital intensive
industries, in agricultural infrastructure and in urban and social services,
wihch had long gestation periods. Secondly, difficulties were experienced
in bringing industrial projects into operation, due to insufficient industrial
experience, skilled labor shortages, limited management capability and, espe-
cially, to constraints caused by delays in developing the sectors accompanying
industrialization -- economic infrastructure, housing and social infrastructure.
9.        As a result of the unexpected shortfall in export receipts and ex-
pansion of domestic demand and imports, pressure on the country's domestic
and external financial resources increased sharply in 1975. After a surplus
in 1974, the balance of payment current account showed a deficit of $1.6
billion in 1975, more than 12 percent of GDP. Despite increased external
borrowing, net foreign exchange reserves decreased by $250 million in 1975.



- 4 -
The Government's budget also showed a large deficit. Although price subsi-
dization made it possible to moderate increases in external and domestic
prices to consumers, especially of essential foodstuffs, the consumer price
index accelerated its growth to 11 percent in 1975, from an average of 6.5
percent a year in 1971-74.
10.       The Government introduced an investment stabilization program in
1976 to bring the economy back into real and financial balance. Industrial
investment was held almost at the same level ($3.2 billion) as in 1975, while
investment in other sectors increased to $3.4 billion, from $2.3 billion in
1975, indicating marked progress in implementation capacity. The proportion
of investment in non-industrial sectors achieved in 1976 was, thus, more in
line with the Plan objective, while total investment growth decelerated
markedly. There was also an appreciable acceleration of GDP growth in 1976
(about 11 percent in real terms) and an increase in hydrocarbon exports, in
both quantity (13 percent) and prices (6 percent). Together, these factors
reduced the resource gap in 1976 and eased the pressures on the balance
of payments that had developed in the course of 1975. External borrowing
requirements decreased substantially in 1976 and net foreign reserves rose
to $1.9 billion at the end of the year, representing more than three months
of 1976 imports. There were corresponding developments in the domestic
financial situation. While government investment in infrastructure rose by
45 percent, total budgetary expenditures increased only by about 7 percent,
since transfers to public enterprises and price subsidization were reduced
from their high 1975 levels. The overall Government deficit remained stable
in relation to GDP, and to cover it the recourse to financing from the banking
system remained moderate. The employment situation further improved in 1976
with the unemployment rate in non-agricultural sectors declining to an esti-
mated 9 percent.
11.       A new increase of about 10 percent in crude oil export prices in
early 1977 gave the country additional resources (about $0.5 billion) to
step up investment. Following the slowdown in investment growth which took
place in 1976, the 1977 Government Budget provides for a rather large in-
crease in total public investment expenditure (about 30 percent in current
prices over the 1976 level). Despite improvements in implementation capacity,
the budgeted amount is however not likely to be entirely spent. The trend
begun in 1976 towards a more balanced sectoral distribution of investment is
accentuated in the 1977 budget. The bulk of the increase in capital expendi-
ture is budgeted in the non-industrial sectors, especially transportation,
education and training, housing, infrastructure and regional development.
A decrease is budgeted in real investment in non-hydrocarbon industry. As a
result, investment in the non-industrial sectors would account for 52 percent
of total investment in 1976-77, compared with 40 percent in 1974-75 (Annex I,
page 3). Current Bank forecasts are that, in view of the above, the balance
of payments current account deficit and the overall budget deficit would
remain of the same order of magnitude as in 1976.



- 5 -
12.       Algeria's economic and financial prospects beyond 1977 will be
reflected in the next Plan (1978-1981) currently in preparation. Tentative
Bank projections based on the country's overall objectives, its long term
development programs for the main sectors, and the policy decisions taken in
1976-77 are attached (Annex I, pages 3 and 4). Algeria's prospects depend
upon three main factors: the growth of hydrocarbon production and exports,
the level and composition of the country's investment and the pace of improve-
ments in the efficiency of the economic system. Prospects for the hydrocarbon
sector, which accounted for 84 percent of exports and 30 percent of GDP in
1975, seem assured in both quantities and prices. The sector's export receipts
are conservatively projected to rise to $9.9 billion in 1980 and $18.4 billion
in 1985 from the estimated $4.9 billion in 1976. In these totals exports of
liquefied natural gas (LNG) would rise to $1.5 billion in 1980 and $5.6 billion
in 1985, based on sales contracts under implementation or signed for future
exports. Regarding investment, the government is expected to pursue the
policy cf overall and sectoral balance developed in 1976-77. Investment
requirements will remain large, however, in the next five to six years, to
develop hydrocarbon exports, particularly gas. Investment in economic and
social infrastructure, where there are considerable investment needs to ease
the constraints on the use of existing and planned production capacities, is
also expected to increase. Investment in non-hydrocarbon industry would,
by contrast, remain moderate until the early 1980's. Overall, total fixed
investment would gradually decline in relation to GDP.
13.       Recent improvements in planning and management (para. 7) provide
grounds for expecting progress in economic efficiency. Policies are being
implemented to accelerate training of technical and middle level management
staff. Considerable efforts are being made to improve project preparation,
implementation and operation, and to develop intersectoral and intrasectoral
project coordination. Under the 1976 and 1977 Finance Laws, measures towards
an economically more rational price and fiscal system are being introduced.
Financial institutions are strengthening their supervisory role vis-a-vis
production enterprises. Decentralization, which involves shifting the focus
of central supervision from day-to-day management to programming and follow-
up of the operations of decentralized enterprises and institutions, is being
increased. The investment program, however, include capital intensive proj-
ects in industry (hydrocarbons especially) and substantial investments in
infrastructure, which imply that the capital-output ratio of the economy will
remain high.
14.       Under these circumstances, GDP growth may average 8 percent yearly
in 1977-80, accompanied by sizeable but manageable external borrowing re-
quirements. After 1980, GDP growth would slow down because crude oil output
is expected to level off close to the maximum technical rate. Growth in the
non-hydrocarbon sectors would, however, remain rapid, especially in industry,
during the 1980-85 period. Consumption growth would be relatively rapid,
considering the effects of continued Government policies to foster living
standards of the low income groups, the projected growth of domestic supplies,
and employment creation. With population growing at 3.3 percent per annum,



- 6 -
per capita real consumption could increase by 5 percent a year during 1977-
1985. Based on detailed projections of exports and import requirements, the
resource gap of the economy is projected to average $1.2 billion during
1977-80. This deficit is likely to diminish thereafter and turn into a
surplus by 1984 due to the combined effects of declining import requirements
for gas development, large increases in gas exports and import substitution.
15.       Algeria is expected to pursue an active external borrowing policy.
Requirements are tentatively projected by the Bank to average around $3.0
billion yearly in 1977-82, on a disbursement basis. Large inflows of external
capital will be required in the next five to six years to expand LNG export
capacity. Gas contracts which Algeria has entered into or which are under
negotiations, provide for the financing of gas liquefaction plants, and there
should not be major problems for Algeria to mobilize the amounts involved for
gas development. Such amounts could represent, on the basis of Bank projec-
tions, more than 50 percent of total external loan disbursements in 1977-82.
Suppliers' credits should be available to finance other industrial investments
most of which will probably be implemented by foreign contractors. Borrowing
from official sources would be relatively small. Official sources include
OECD and centrally planned countries, the African Development Bank, the World
Bank, and the EEC, which signed a financial and trade agreement with Algeria
in April 1976. Algeria would cover any remaining financing gap by recourse to
commercial bank loans which should be easily available in view of its borrowing
capacity, long-term creditworthiness and good relations with commercial banks.
Commercial sources, however, offer relatively short maturities and high
interest rates. Algeria will therefore face total borrowing requirements at
a decreasing, but still relatively high level, well into the 1980's.
16.       Algeria's total external debt, outstanding and disbursed, was $4.5
billion ($9.0 billion including undisbursed), equivalent to 34.5 percent of
GDP, at the end of 1975. Debt service has fallen in relation to the substan-
tially increased exports of goods and non-factor services from 14.2 percent
in 1973 to 9.3 percent in 1975. With the above new borrowings, debt service
would rise to a level somewhat above 20 percent of exports by the early
1980's. It would follow a gradually declining trend subsequently, as the
large gas and petrochemical projects, presently underway or planned, begin
to generate increasing export revenues. By 1985, the likely receipts from
gas exports would exceed projected debt service payments. Algeria's external
borrowing needs will be large in the next few years, but can be accommodated
in view of the considerably enhanced capacity to carry debt which the country
has acquired as a result of the new relationship between the prices of hydro-
carbons and other commodities in world markets, and of the long-term prospects
for gas exports. Algeria is creditworthy for continued Bank lending.
PART II -- BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ALGERIA
17.       Lending to Algeria resumed in FY1973 and the Bank has since lent
$461.0 million in ten loans for transport, power, education, industry and
rural development. Annex II contains a summary statemeut of Bank loans as of



- 7 -
February 28, 1977 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. While the
physical execution of most projects is progressing well, effectiveness and
disbursements for some loans have been slow.
18.       The Bank's future lending to Algeria can only meet a small part of
its considerable external financial requirements, as mentioned above, though,
in FY1976 it substantially exceeded the relatively low FY1975 level of $48
million (which resulted from delays in project preparation) and reached
$150.5 million. In the present fiscal year proposals for new commitments
are expected to remain equally important as a result of Algeria's increasing
familiarity with Bank procedures and the Bank's increasing understanding of
the Government's economic and social development policies. At the end of 1975
the portion of Algeria's total debt outstanding and disbursed owed to the Bank
was estimated at one percent; this share will rise somewhat over the next
years, but is projected still to be below 5 percent at the end of the decade.
19.       The provision of technical assistance and institution building sup-
port in connection with lending operations is a major objective in the Bank's
strategy in Algeria, to which the Government attaches special importance.
The aim is to assist the Government to relieve bottlenecks in lagging sectors,
such as transportation, education, urban public services, and rural develop-
ment, and to expand the contribution of institutions in these areas to national
development. Bank operations are expected also to be associated with the in-
troduction of sounder criteria for financial performance and for project pre-
paration, appraisal and implementation, and to aid Algeria in making more
economic use of its resources. Finally, future lending will aim at reducing
sectoral imbalances in support of the socio-economic transformation of Algeria
which the Government is undertaking, particularly in the rural areas.
20.       In past years, the level of awareness and understanding of the
Bank's methods of work and objectives varied considerably among government
agencies and the establishment of a program of Bank lending operations proved
a complex task. The recent increase in lending has substantially improved the
dialogue with the Government and is leading to closer cooperation in project
preparation with the executing agencies.
21.       In FY1977, the Executive Directors have already approved a loan of
$48.5 million for a third education project. In addition to the project pre-
sented in this report, a second port project is also expected to be submitted
to the Executive Directors during this fiscal year. In subsequent years,
projects are contemplated in education, power, transport, industry, urban
public services, and agriculture (including rural development); those projects
will continue to stress objectives going beyond the mere transfer of resources.
As the pipeline of projects is strengthened, the lending program is expected
increasingly to include directly productive projects and those with a social
character.
22.       Most projects to be presented to the Executive Directors are expected
to have one or more technical assistance components. This is also exemplified
in the project proposed in the present report. In addition, special technical
assistance activities have included a joint Bank-IMF mission which visited



- 8 -
Algeria in the spring of 1974 at the request of the Government, to study the
financial planning system. Acting on one of the mission's recommendations, in
late 1974 the Economic Development Institute held a course in Algeria dealing
with various aspects of financial planning at the central government, banking
and project levels. The authorities showed considerable interest in this
course. At their request, the EDI organized two industrial project courses,
with the Government bearing the cost, during 1976, and is now organizing
further courses as well.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
23.       The Algerian transport system consists of 78,700 kilometers of
national, regional and local roads, eight major ports, 6,000 kilometers of
petroleum and gas pipelines, 4,000 kilometers of railways, and four inter-
national and ten secondary airports. The country has one national shipping
company and one national airline. The road and rail networks connect all
major Algerian cities and regions and connect Algeria with Tunisia and
Morocco. Road freight represents about two thirds of the total land trans-
port while 90 percent of railway traffic consists of long-distance bulk
cargo. About forty-six percent of the road network is paved but maintenance,
particularly of regional and local roads, is often inadequate to meet the
increasing traffic demand.
24.       The Algerian transport system, mainly concentrated in the densely
populated northern coastal region, needs rehabilitation to meet the burgeoning
needs of the economy. Since the mid-1960's, the Algerian development effort
has generated a rapid increase in transport demand. However, expenditures to
improve and maintain existing transport facilities have been relatively low.
As a result, sections of the road and rail networks, which already have insuf-
ficient design standards, have deteriorated and are at present inadequate in
view of the traffic they carry. As a first step towards improving the situa-
tion, the Government is according high priority to maintenance and improvement
of the infrastructure and purchase of new equipment.
25.       Transport planning is the responsibility of the Ministry of Trans-
port, while the final decision on transport investment policy is taken by
the Secretariat of State for Planning in the overall framework of development
plans. The Ministry of Public Works and Construction (MPWC) is responsible
for the preparation of investment proposals and execution of infrastructure
works in highways, ports and airports. Planning still suffers from insuffi-
cient data and coordination between agencies as well as a shortage of staff,
although improvements have been made through the Bank projects in the transport
sector. For instance, the First Highway Project included an extensive program
of studies and technical assistance to the MPWC for project preparation and
road network development and maintenance planning.
26.       Except for a few private truckers, practically all transport is
handled by public agencies. Public transport agencies are under the general
supervision of the Ministry of Transport, while various industrial enter-
prises under the Ministry of Industry and Energy operate their own trucks.



- 9 -
Road freight and passenger transport are entrusted respectively to the Societe
Nationale des Transports Routiers and the Societe Nationale des Transports de
Voyageurs, both semi-independent state enterprises under the control of the
Ministry of Transport. The Ministry of Industry and Energy controls the size
of the vehicle fleet through limitation of imports and through the assembly
of trucks and buses in Rouiba. Although the total vehicle fleet in Algeria
has increased at an annual rate of 7.5 percent since 1965, the ratio of one
vehicle to 45 inhabitants is somewhat lower than other countries with about
the same per capita income. Current industrial development together with the
past growth rates of the vehicle fleet and fuel consumption indicate that road
traffic may grow at an average annual rate of 9 percent over the next ten
years, compared to about 8 percent during 1970-75.
27.       The Bank is involved in three transport projects now in execution.
The first, involving a $18.5 million loan signed in June 1973 (Loan 912-AL),
comprises improvement of road sections, studies and purchase of equipment.
This First Highway Project is being carried out satisfactorily. Construction
and improvement of the nine road sections have been completed by local and
foreign contractors. Reconnaissance and inventory, feasibility studies,
detailed engineering, maintenance and general technical and economic studies
and technical assistance provided under the project are being carried out by
foreign consultants. The purchase of highway maintenance vehicles, spare
parts, and laboratory equipment has been completed. In June 1974, two other
transport loans were signed - $70 million for the construction of a port at
Bethioua for the export of liquified natural gas and for technical assistance,
and $49 million for a railways project to procure rolling stock equipment and
consulting services, and rehabilitate track (Loan 996-AL). The execution of
the construction works of both projects is satisfactory. A fourth loan for
the new Jijel port is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors
before the end of the current fiscal year.
28.       The Highway Subsector.   The road network consists of 18,500 kilo-
meters of national roads, 21,700 kilometers of regional roads and 38,500
kilometers of local roads. MPWC has overall responsibility for the road
network, while specific responsibility for construction and maintenance is
entrusted to the Provincial Directorates for Infrastructure and Land Use.
The increasing volume of construction works and maintenance is imposing great
strain on the limited planning and executive capabilities of some of these
organizations, and organizational improvements are being considered by the
Government. To improve road planning MPWC has already instituted systematic
data collection, but further improvements are desirable. The cost of road
improvement and construction works is high compared to neighboring countries.
The Government is aware of this and, as a first step, has recently encouraged
the formation of joint ventures of foreign and domestic construction firms to
improve efficiency and reduce construction costs. The Government also intends
to undertake a comprehensive study of the domestic construction industry's
efficiency.



- 10 -
29.       Financing of road construction, improvements and maintenance is
provided by the central, provincial and local government budgets. The central
government provides all funds for national roads and 80 percent of the funds
for improvement of the regional roads. Provincial authorities finance the
balance for regional roads, while local authorities finance the full cost
of all local roads. Local authorities can, however, obtain funds from the
central government when deteriorated local roads require substantial recon-
struction. As a result, many local authorities postpone maintenarce of local
roads until substantial reconstruction is needed. The Government is aware of
this practice and plans to correct the situation.
30.       The Office for Infrastructure Projects (SETI) of the MPWC is res-
ponsible for the planning, feasibility and design of highway, port and airport
projects but lacks sufficient staff to carry out adequately these functions.
To improve SETI's capabilities the First Highway Project provided consulting
services to assist in the preparation of road feasibility studies, a mainte-
nance program and a twenty-year road development plan. Since SETI's staffing
situation will remain a problem for some time, additional assistance from
consultants is envisaged under the proposed project to assist in the imple-
mentation of recommendations of these studies.
31.       The various road user charges yield revenues about four times larger
than expenditures on roads, leaving a substantial contribution to the central
budget. The existing system of road user charges is being examined by con-
sultants under the First Highway Project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission in April 1976
and prepared by the Government with the assistance of consultants. It was ap-
praised in December 1976. Negotiations took place in Washington in March 1977.
The Algerian Delegation was headed by Mr. Rachid Hassam, Director General of
the Ministry of Finance. A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway
Project in the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria" (No. 1461-AL dated
April 1, 1977) is being distributed separately. A loan and project summary is
attached as Annex III, aad a supplementary project data sheet as Annex IV. A
map showing the location of the road to be constructed under the project is
also attached.
33.       Objectives and Description of the Project.   The proposed project
would be a logical sequence to the First Highway Project. It would support
the Government's objectives of developing the road network as required by the
rapid development of transport demand in recent years, and strengthening the
capabilities of the MPWC. Civil works under the project would consist of the
construction of 40 kilometers of road, in the dense traffic corridor between
the eastern and western parts of the country. The project would also include
training of personnel and technical assistance to the MPWC for implementing
the recommendations of studies on road maintenance and planning.

34.       Road Construction.   The project road is an important link between
eastern and western Algeria, particularly between Algiers and the Tizi Ouzou
and Constantine areas. The existing road can only accommodate present traffic
at low service levels, although improvements have been made over the years to
attempt to meet increasing traffic demands. The deficiencies are: inadequate
number of lanes, sections with narrow pavements (5.5 m) and shoulders, sharp
curves, substandard sight distances, steep grades, occasional flooding of
certain sections, and unrestricted roadside development in urban areas.
35.       The road construction under the project would replace:    (i) the
existing two-lane road between Boudouaou and the intersection with National
Road 12 in the neighborhood of Thenia (20 km), with a modern divided four-
lane highway with climbing lanes and bypasses for the rapidly growing towns
of Boudouaou and Thenia; and (ii) the remaining 20 km of the existing road
to Lakhdaria with a modern two-lane highway with passing and climbing lanes.
Expected traffic volumes in the near future between Boudouaou and Thenia re-
quire immediate construction of four lanes while expected traffic volumes
between Thenia and Lakhdaria could be accommodated for the next decade on
a two-lane highway with climbing and passing lanes. Widening to four-lane
standards of the latter section has been postponed until the end of the
1980's, when it is likely to be required by traffic demand.
36.       Construction works on the road east of the project road between the
intersection with National Road 12 and Tizi Ouzou are presently underway,
thereby ensuring the free flow of traffic from the project road. Similarly,
at the western end of the project road a new four-lane divided road to Algiers
and vicinity is under construction. Thus the project road would be an in-
tegral part of an improvement program for the route from Algiers to the Tizi
Ouzou and Constantine areas. Detailed feasibility and design studies were
undertaken by consultants (Ingeroute, France) under the First Highway Project.
Several alternatives were considered, to arrive at an optimal solution.
37.       Technical Assistance and Training.   About 144 man-months of consult-
ing services would be provided under the project for technical assistance, as
follows: (a) 48 man-months over a period of three years to assist the MPWC in
supervision of the road construction works; (b) 72 man-months over a period of
two years to assist the MPWC in on-the-job training of maintenance personnel
in three or four maintenance centers; and (c) 24 man-months over a period of
one year to assist the Office for Infrastructure Projects of the MPWC in im-
plementing such recommendations of ongoing maintenance - organizaticn and road
planning studies as shall be approved by the Bank. The estimated average man-
month rate for consulting services, including all costs for overheads, fees,
and taxes, is $7,000, which was the rate pertaining at end-1976 in Algeria.
The proposed project would also provide fellowships to train highway engineers
of the MPWC and national construction companies with public agencies and
related industries abroad. The Government will submit to, and agree with, the
Bank details of this training program (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04);
its submission is expected shortly.

38.       Cost Estimates and Financing Plan.   The total cost of the project
is estimated at $101.6 million including $72.9 million for the road construc-
tion works, $1.7 million for consulting services and training, $0.9 million
for right-of-way, and physical and price contingencies of $26.1 million. The
proposed Bank loan of $41.5 million would finance the full foreign exchange
cost of the project. The local cost would be financed by the Algerian Govern-
ment. UNDP financing is not available for the consultancy and training com-
ponents. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Annex III.
39.       Project Implementation.   The Government would carry out and super-
vise the project through its competent Ministry, which is the Ministry of
Public Works and Construction (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.01). The
Government is expected to set up, prior to the start of the construction
works, a single organization to be responsible for the supervision of the
entire works. The Government agreed to make available all right-of-way as
needed for the timely implemeutation of the project.
40.       Highway Planning, Maintenance and Standards.    Studies on maintenance-
organization and road planning are being carried out to improve operational
efficiency, which if not achieved, would require an increase in the maintenance
budget.  The Government agreed to continue to take every technical, administra-
tive, or financial measure necessary to define and implement the maintenance
and development program of its road network (draft Loan Agreement, Section
3.08), and to maintain the project road in an appropriate manner. Although
there is no evidence that the single axle load of 13m tons is not observed,
the Government will, in conformity with its regulations, ensure that dimen-
sions and axle loads of vehicles using its roads do not exceed the road design
limits.
41.       Procurement and Disbursement.   For the construction works, unit price
contracts would be awarded after international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Works have been broken down
into suitable lots to encourage participation in bidding from both local and
foreign bidders, and contracts would be awarded per lot, for a combination of
lots or for the entire works. Pre-qualification of bidders in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank is now taking place. Consultants would be
engaged according to conditions and terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank.
42.       Disbursement of the proposed loan would be made over a period of
five years on the basis of (i) 41 percent of the cost of the road construction
works, representing the estimated foreign. expenditure component and, (ii) 100
percent of foreign expenditures on consultants' services and training.
43.       Benefits and Risks.   The proposed road construction would reduce
vehicle operating costs, journey times and accidents. In addition, it would
prevent serious congestion problems, facilitate the transportation of indus-
trial products, processed agricultural commodities, bottled beverages and
fuels, and assist industrial development in the road's zone of influence.
Most of the benefits from the proposed road construction would accrue, in the
first instance, to the state trucking and bus companies, and to industrial



- 13 -
state enterprises in other sectors of the economy. Since the tariffs of state
trucking and bus companies relate to distance, vehicle operating costs and
journey times, it is expected that benefits from reduced vehicle operating
costs would gradually accrue to the users of road transport services. The
benefits from road construction (98.3 percent of project costs) are estimated
to yield a 20 percent economic return. Sensitivity analyses show that the
economic return remains acceptable under assumptions of a 25 percent invest-
ment cost increase, a reduction of 25 percent in total benefits, and a 10
percent investment cost increase combined with a 10 percent reduction in
total benefits. Benefits from consulting services and training have not been
quantified, but they are expected to improve project preparation and execution,
road maintenance and the organizational efficiency of the MPWC. No unusual
risks are foreseen.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Democratic and Popular Republic
of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.
45.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex IV.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 912-AL Highway Project; US$18.5 million Loan of JurLe 19, 1973; Effective
Date: October 26, 1973; Closing Date: (Original) December 31,
1976, (Current) December 31, 1977.
The overall progress of the project is satisfactory. The project
originally included feasibility studies of the Oran-Arzew and Algiers South-
west expressways, additional economic studies of the Trans-Sahara road,
detailed engineering of the Algiers Southwest expressway and feasibility
studies of an additional 400 km of principal roads.    Upon Government's request
and with Bank approval, these elements have been replaced by a reconnaissance
study and inventory of about 7,000 km of principal roads, a general, technical
and economic study in the highway sector and feasibility studies and detailed
engineering for improvement of about 600 km of priority road sections. To
allow completion of these replacement studies, the Closing Date was postponed
from December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1977.
Loan 913-AL First Education Project; US$6.0 million Loan of June 19, 1973;
Effective Date: October 26, 1973; Closing Date: (Original)
December 31, 1976, (Current) December 31, 1977.
Implementation of this project is behind schedule, due mainly to
managerial shortcomings. In particular, progress has been slow on equipment
procurement for the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (University of Annaba)
and the Institute of Agricultural Technology (IAT). However, the preinvest-
ment study for the Institute of Light Industry has been completed, equipment
procurement is well advanced for the technician centers for plastics tech-
nology and natural gas and tenders were invited in December, 1976, for the
construction of workshops and field units for the IAT.
Loan 995-AL Port Project: US$70.0 million Loan of June 19, 1974; Effective
Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Work is progressing satisfactorily and consultants are supervising
construction. Disbursements are somewhat behind schedule but are expected to
catch up in the near future. The project cost, based on contracts already
received, may be slightly below the appraisal estimates of May 1974.
Loan 996-AL Railway Project; US$49.0 million Loan of June 10, 1974; Effective
Date: November 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The execution of the construction works of the project, which sup-
ports the railway's rehabilitation program, is satisfactory and procurement
is proceeding ahead of schedule. Some consultancy studies have been delayed,
and four may not be completed before the present closing date. Passenger and
freight traffic is increasing slowly while the financial situation is im-
proving. In March 1976, Government by decree, dissolved the railway entity
(SNCFA) and established two new entities (SNTF for operations and SNERIF for
construction). A legal opinion, confirming that all obligations of SNCFA have
been transfered to the two new entities, has been received.

Loan 997-AL First Power Project; US$38.5 milion Loan of June 10, 1974; Effec-
tive Date: December 20, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The project comprises high voltage substations, gas turbine plants,
dispatch facilities, and consulting services for management and engineering
services. Physical progress of the project is satisfactory. All main con-
tracts have been awarded. Delays have been encountered in the provision of
financial information due to SONELGAZ's lack of experienced staff and inter-
departmental changes of personnel. There are some delays in construction
but the project's completion date is not expected to be affected.
Loan 1158-AL Development Finance Company Project; US$40 million Loan to
Banque Algerienne de Developpement of September 4, 1975;
Effective Date: January 5, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
This project has faced difficulties. The setting up of the project
appraisal unit within BAD has suffered delays and consequently commitments and
disbursements have lagged. In March 1976 the unit started operations with the
assistance of one Bank-seconded expert. A recent mission has discussed this
problem with BAD, and follow-up measures are now being taken. The flow of
sub-projects to the Bank for approval has begun and commitments amounting to
$5 million have already been made.
Loan 1159-AL Technical Assistance (Rural Development) Project; US$8.0 million
Loan of September 4, 1975; Effective Date: January 5, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Consulting firms have been selected and contracts negotiated on
three of four sub-projects for which planning, preparation and execution by
integrated expert teams will be required. Proposals submitted by consulting
firms for the fourth sub-project on pastoral development of the steppe are
presently being evaluated by Government. The expatriate advisor to the
project coordinator has recently assumed his position as a consultant to
the Bank, until terms of contract, currently under discussion with the Bank,
are finalized.
Loan 1185-AL SNMC Expansion Project: US$46 million Loan of January 7, 1976;
Effective Date: April 7, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Construction of the cement plant is underway approximately accord-
ing to schedule. Training has been delayed due to lack of Algerian personnel.
The distribution component is being reformulated. Financial measures are
being taken by SNMC and the Government to ensure respect of the agreed per-
formance targets. Signature of the contract for the technical assistance
program for the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC) has been delayed as a
result of managerial difficulties in SNC; lack of housing for consultants may
be a problem during implementation.

Loan 1209-AL Second Education Project: US$47 million Loan of March 9, 1976;
Effective Date: June 4, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Implementation of this project is progressing satisfactorily. The
consultant architects are expected to submit shortly the master plan for con-
struction of the Institute of Electricity and Electronics at Tlemcen thus
completing Phase I on schedule.   Equipment procurement is proceeding ahead of
schedule at temporary accommodation in Boumerdes.    Implementation of most
technical assistance components has commenced and discussions on the execution
of those remaining are under way.
Loan 1293-AL   Second Power Project;  US$57.5 million Loan of July 8, 1976;
Effective Date: December 2, 1976; Closing Date: December 30,
1980.
The Project consists of the transmission/substation component of
SONELGAZ's 1976-1980 program comprising about 3,300 km of transmission lines
and 4,000 MVA of substation capacity, and studies of SONELGAZ's organization
and management methods. Overall progress is satisfactory. Procurement for
substations to be financed from the loan has been approved by the Bank, but
some delays have occurred in construction. SONELGAZ has not yet submitted to
the Bank a financial plan indicating how the financial covenants agreed upon
will be achieved.
