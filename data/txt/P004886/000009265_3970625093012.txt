ALGERIA
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT - LOAN 1407-AL
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation and imple-
mentation of the Second Highway Project in Algeria, for which Loan 1407-AL for
US$41.5 million was made in April 1977. The Closing Date was December 31,
1982. The loan amount was fully disbursed.
The report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office of the Bank on the basis of a review of the regional files,
information provided by the Directorate of Infrastructure (DI) of the Ministry
of Public Works (MPW), and discussions with staff involved with the project.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
COED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

PROJECT C0MPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT - LOAN 1407-AL
HIGHLIGHTS
The purpose of the project was to improve traffic conditions on the
Algiers-Constantine road, which is a part of the inter-regional highway bet-
ween the Central and Eastern zones of the country. This was achieved through
reconstruction to higher standards of the 40 km section between Boudouaou and
Lakhdaria. The project also included technical assistence to the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) and training.
The project was completed satisfactorily, although with delay and a
cost overrun in the execution of the road construction component. Technical
assistance and training were completed satisfactorily. The delay in road con-
struction was partly due to the lengthy procurement procedure and partly to
the extension of contract time. The project cost overrun of 44Z in terms of
US dollars was due largely to price increases caused by the 38 month delay in
completion and, to a lesser extent, to extra works. The project remains eco-
nomically justified with the reestimated economic return of 21Z.  MPW also
derived considerable indirect benefits from the project through the experience
it gained in international procurement, supervisir- of large contracts, in-
creased construction capacity by employment of fore ,.. contractors, and stabi-
lization of construction prices which resulted from wider competition. MPW's
improved ability to administer large and complex contracts helped the imple-
mentation of subsequent highway projects. A number of MPW staff were formed
under the project, and discussions were initiated leading to the MPW organi-
zational reforms which are still being implemented.
Points of particular interest highlighted in the project completion
report are:
(i) lengthy delays in the procurement of civil works contracts (paras.
3.01-3.08); and
*          {ii)  indirect benefits accrued to the Highway Authority through interna-
tional procurement of civil works, and to the construction industry
through employment of foreign contractors (paras. 5.01-5.02).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA: SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 1407-AL)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The highway network of Algeria consists of about 80,000 km of roads,
25Z of which are classified as national roads (RN). Road density is high in
the northern part of the country where about 9O0 of the population are concen-
trated.   The railway system includes about 4,000 km of standard and narrow
gauge lines and carries principally long distance bulk cargo which represents
90Z of all  rail  freight.   Roads carry short haul bulk cargo and general
goods. Road transport is about five times larger than rail transport in terms
of ton-kilometers.
1.02     During the first decade after independence the road network was ne-
glected because other national needs were given higher priority.   However,
since the early seventies road traffic volumes increased rapidly, reaching a
16X annual average growth in the period 1970 to 1975. The necessity for ur-
gent measures to maintain and improve the road network became imperative. The
First Highway Project, Loan 912-AL, approved in June 1973, included in addi-
tion to improvement of priority road sections a substantial program of highway
preinvestment and maintenance studies. Preinvestment studies consisted of re-
connaissance and inventory of about 7,000 km of principal roads and feasibi-
lity studies and detailed engineering for about 400 km of high priority sec-
tions. The highway development plan prepared under the First Highway Project
provided the basis for the Second, Third and Fourth Highway Projects. Mainte-
nance studies identified the long term requirements of organization, equipment
and staffing on which were based the reforms of regional public works divi-
sions, which are still in process of implementation. The First Highway Pro-
ject was completed satisfactorily in March 1979, albeit with a delay of about
two years.  The delay was due to the Government's concern to build up local
capability in highway studies through participation of Algerian engineers,
which slowed down the project progress.
1.03     The Second Highway Project included reconstruction to improved stand-
ards of the Boudouaou-Lakhdaria road, identified in preinvestment studies as
the highest priority improvement.  The project also included training of the
MPW and public construction companies sta!f, technical assistance for con-
struction supervision and assistance to the Directorate of Infrastructure (DI)
of MPW.
1.04     Total lending for the transport sector in Algeria since 1970 amounts
to US$495.0 million.  It includes four highway projects, two of which are now
completed, one railway project completed December 31, 1981, and two port pro-
jects, one of which was completed while the other was cancelled when the major
complementary investment in a steel manufacturing complex was delayed. Of the
total lending, US$206.5 million (42%) was disbursed as of end 1983, US$87.0
million (18X) was cancelled and the remaining 402 is expected to be disbursed
by December 1986.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
Preparation
2.01     The Second Highway Project was identified through highway development
and maintenance studies carried out under the First Highway Project in 1975/76
by a group of consulting engineering firms: BCEOM (France), INGEROUTE
(France), ITALCONSULT (Italy). After some deliberations, the Government and
the Bank agreed in April 1976 that the main component of the project would be
the reconstruction to higher standards of the 40 km Boudouaou-Lakhdaria sec-
tion of RN5 between Algiers and Constantine. This road section, of an average
7 m total width, had substandard geometry and a distressed pavement, and pro-
vided a very  low  level  of  service.   In  1976 traffic on the 20 km from
Boudouaou to the junction with RN12 leading to Tizi-Ouzou reached 10,500 vpd,
and 4,600 vpd on the remaining 20 km section. The proposed project was a part
of overall improvements of the RN5 between Algiers and Constantine and of the
RN12 between RN5 Junction and Tizi-Ouzou, which have been undertaken under the
DI investment budget.
2.02     The French consulting firm INGEROUTE, entrusted with pre-investment
studies in the Central Region, was commissioned to carry out the feasibility
study and detailed engineering of the proposed road. The consultant was as-
sisted by the National Cartographic Institute and the National Materials Labo-
ratory (LNTPB). Several alternative alignments and design standards were con-
sidered to achieve the most economic solution.  The DI and Bank cooperated
closely in the review of the consultant's recommendations.
2.03     The road design standards were selected with due consideration to
traffic and terrain.  The 20 km section Boudouaou-Thenia (RN12 Junction) was
designed as a four-lane divided highway with 7.5 km of climbing lanes, with
three grade-separated interchanges and seven at-grade intersections. The 10.5
km Thenia-Beni Amrane section was designed as a three-lane highway, the third
lane provided to serve either as a climbing or as a passing lane. The 9.5 km
Beni-Amrane-Lakhdaria section located in narrow winding gorges was designed as
a two-lane highway, with 2.5 km of climbing/passing lanes. In order to limit
land expropriation, the new road alignment was selected close to or on the ex-
isting road.  The bypasses at Boudouaou, Thenia and other realignments were
located on agricultural land to minimize the cost of the right-of-way.
2.04     To reduce the construction cost, a time-phased improvement concept
was applied in the design of the Thenia-Beni Amrane section: the three lane
road could be widened in the future to four lanes. A bitumer. surface treat-
ment wearing course was adopted initially for the first stage of road improve-
ment. However, during construction it was recognized that the saving in stage
construction of the road pavement would be minimal because surface treatment
would require  excessive maintenance  and an  early  strengthening.   The  DI
decided, with the Bank's concurrence, to replace the proposed surface treat-
ment with a 10 cm premix wearing course.



-3-
Appraisal
2.05     The  project,  appraised  in December  1977,  comprised the following
components:
(M) construction of the Boudouaou-Lakhdaria road;
(ii) consulting services including 48 man-months over a period of three
years to assist MPW in construction supervision, 72 man-months over a
period of two years to assist MPW in training maintenance personnel,
and about 24 man-months to assist the DI planning office in imple-
menting the recommendations of the preinvestment and maintenance
studies carried out under the First Highway Project; and
(iii) fellowships abroad for about 75 engineers from MPW and national con-
struction companies.
NeRotiations
2.06     Negotiations  took  place  in Washington  from March  21  through 24,
1977. The Algerian delegation queried the level of price contingencies in the
final cost estimates, which at the December 1976 appraisal were estimated on
the basis of assumed price inflation of 13% for 1977 decreasing to 10X in
1980; these were reduced in the final cost estimates to 9S in 1977-1979 and 8%
thereafter, in accordance with updated Bank guidelines.  The difference in the
gross estimate of construction cost due to this change was about 72 of the to-
tal cost, and the loan amount was reduced proportionally.  It appeared subse-
quently that actual price adjustments applied to contract prices were in line
with the assumed 9% and 8S annual inflation rates.
2.07     During negotiations,  the  Bank and  the  Borrower  agreed  that  con-
struction supervision would be entrusted to a single specially created unit;
that for procurement purposes the works would be subdivided into several lots;
and that for bid evaluation purposes, bids from public construction companies
would be adjusted to take account of special advantages when compared to bids
from private contractors. A single supervision unit was necessary because the
works were located in two regional subdivisions. The issue of fair evaluation
of offers arose because p-ablic companies in Algeria were not required to pro-
vide performance bonds and were entitled to 15X contractual advance payments,
while private contractors were allowed only lOZ. Under the agreement reached
during negotiations the advantages of public companies had been specified in
contract documents and appropriately quantified in bid evaluation.
2.08     The loan of US$41.5 million was approved by the Board of Executive
Directors on April 21, 1977 and was signed on May 15, 1977.  It was declared
effective on October 5, 1977, after ratification by the Algerian Legislature.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Procurement of Civil Works
3.01     Civil works were procured through international competitive bidding
in compliance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. At appraisal, the en-
gineering design and specifications were well advanced which allowed for an



-4-
early start of  the procurement procedure.   Prequalification of  contractors
started in February, with the intention to call for bids in June 1977. To
take account of complex procurement approval procedures, the entire procure-
ment cycle was expected to take 15 months from prequalification to contract
award, but in fact, it took 33 months because of an unsuccessful first round
of bidding and the subsequent rebidding.
3.02     The DI had  limited experience  in the procurement of large highway
construction works and international procurement procedures, and lengthy con-
sultations and negotiations with the contractor and other Government agencies
contributed to the delay. Moreover, in line with the Government's policy of
self-sufficiency, which called for a significant participation by domc&ic
contractors, the DI divided the Boudouaou-Lakhdaria works into five lots: lot
1, supply of aggregates and bituminous materials estimated at DA 43 millions;
lots 2 and 3. road construction in two sections respectively estimated at DA
172 million and DA 41 million; lot 4, bridges in 12 sublots estimated at DA 25
million; and lot 5, signalization and road safety equipment estimated at DA 15
million. Packaging of the lots was allowed.
3.03     Prequalification was widely advertized in the local press and in 18
international publications.  Applications were received in June 1977 from 15
foreign and 18 Algerian firms, of which 12 foreign and 11 Algerian were pre-
qualified for various lots and combinations of lots but only one foreign com-
pany (an Italian firm) and one domestic public company (SONATRO) could be pre-
qualified for the whole package. Apparently the subdivision of works into se-
veral lots discouraged the interest of large foreign firms and attracted a
number of small and medium national and foreign contractors of marginal capa-
city and experience in highway construction in relation to the project size
and complexity.  The DI was concerned with the inauspicious results of pre-
qualification.   However, after some deliberations bids were invited from the
prequalified firms in January for submission in April L978.
3.04     The  response  to  the  first  round  of  bidding  was  disappointing.
Foreign firms did not participate in the bidding for road and bridge con-
struction. Only the domestic public company - SONATRO - offered an aggregate
bid, and its price exceeded the appraisal base estimate by about 80%.  Two
other public companies bid for bridges and two foreign contractors for signa-
lization, all about 30% above appraisal estimate.   In Augt..    1978, the Gov-
ernment, in agreement with the Bank, declared the bidding unsuccessful.
3.05     The non participation of preselected foreign firms might be explained
by the method of procurement which could have resulted in a situation where
several contractors would be working independently in a restricted area, crea-
ting mutual problems in organization and conduct of works.  There appears to
have been also a lack of information about the legal, fiscal and administra-
tive framework in which the foreign contractors would operate in Algeria.
3.06     Contract conditions for the second round of bidding were changed by
grouping the works into two lots: lot 1, road construction and lot 2, bridge
construction.   The second round was called without prequalification of con-
tractors, and was adequately advertized in September 1978 including an an-
nouncement in "Development Forum".  The Bank agreed to the open bidding in or-
der to gain time after the loss of about 18 months on the unsuccessful first



-5-
round. Nine bids were received in January 1979, all bidders offering for both
lots. SONATRO, the domestic public contractor again participated in the bid-
ding, offering lower prices than in April 1978, but was the sixth lowest bid-
der.
3.07     Bid evaluation and contract negotiations were lengthy, mainly because
of postqualification which required clarification from the successive bidders
considered for contract award in respect of their resources, experience, com-
mitments and construction plans. The four lowest bids were submitted to close
scrutiny. The lowest bidder was disqualified on the grounds of insufficient
experience in large road works and inadequate financial resources, the second
lowest bidder was disqualified because he had experience only in building con-
struction and usually sul ontracted civil works, the third lowest bidder was a
large and experienced contractor, while the fourth had good experience only in
bridge construction. Finally, the contract was negotiated with the third bid-
der, a Spanish firm, for DA 379,685,357 and a three years completion time.
The contract amount exceeded the appraisal estimate adjusted to January 1979
prices by 8Z. The Bank concurred with the Borrower's bid evaluation and the
proposed award. The contractor was notified of the contract award on December
5, 1979.
3.08     The lengthy procurement procedure contributed to an increase in the
project cost through price adjustments and extra price escalation. However,
it provided DI with experience in international procurement of large highway
contracts which significantly improved the implementation of subsequent high-
way projects.  In addition, by introducing foreign contractors, the country's
highway construction capacity increased and prices stabilized due to improved
competition.
Construction of the Project Road
3.09     The construction works comprised about 3.5 million cubic meters of
earthworks, 600,000 square meters of pavement and 7,000 square meters of deck
surface in 14 bridges. By mid-1980, the contractor mobilized on the site ade-
quate resources for satisfactory progress of work comprising about 500 men,
later reaching 950, and an equipment fleet of about 300 items. The start was
rather slow, with only 5Z of the contract carried out in 1980, but afterwards
the rate of progress picked up. By December 1983 over 90Z of works were com-
pleted, including extra works which added 24.2S to the initial contract
amount.   The project was  relatively complex requiring  road widening  under
heavy traffic conditions, bypasses of two towns, and numerous drainage and
bridge structures.  Extra works were required because of local realignments,
earthslides and the change of pavement from surface treatment to premix. Be-
cause of the delay in starting construction, this change was well justified,
but it resulted in 102 extra cost and a 6 month contract extension. A further
7 months extension, to January 1984, was granted because of the 1982183 shor-
tage of bitumen and cement, materials supplied by Government agencies, and a
fi&Lal extension to July 1984 for raising 600 m section of road in Beni Amrane
area because of a proposed dam project and other additional works. The quali-
ty of construction work was good.



-6-
Supervision of Works
3.10     The supervision of works was carried out by a specially created MPW
supervisory unit under an experienced Algerian engineer supported by the expa-
striate consultant INGEROUTE and by the LNTPB which carried out soil investi-
gations and testing of materials and works. The Algerian staff mobilized in
January 1980.  The project served as a training center for MPW's engineers.
The field engineers and technicians were rotated in order to provide training
to more staff.
3.11     INGEROUTE was selected as the supervision consultant because the firm
carried out the feasibility studies and detailed engineering of this road and
assisted in the evaluation of bids. The consultants' contract was awarded in
May 1980; the delay was caused by the reorganization of the consultant. Al-
though the appraisal estimate of consulting services was only 48 man-months,
the contract was made, with the Bank's concurrence, for 124 man-months because
MPW was short of the experienced staff necessary for supervising such a large
and complex project.  The consultant's contract, initially for 3 years, was
subsequently extended to cover the whole construction time.  The consultant
provided satisfactory service; the cooperation between MPW staff, consultant
and LNTPB was good.  Progress reporting by supervisory unit had been satis-
factory and timely.  The unit produced a handbook on proper supervision of
construction and contract management, which is being widely distributed in all
departments of MPW.
Deviation of Traffic
3.12     The widening of the road section located in the narrow gorges of Beni
Amrane required extensive rock excavations which could only be undertaken
after total deviation of traffic. The road was closed from March to November
1981.  The through traffic on this section reached about 8,000 vpd by 1981,
while the local traffic from Beni Amrane to Lakhdaria was about 500 vpd. Se-
veral alternative deviations were considered. The selected deviation for the
through traffic was situated to the East of the project road, joining RN12 3nd
RN5 by 38.8 km of regional road CW18 and 13.5 km of RN25, while the deviation
for the local traffis was on the West side of Beni Amrane, following regional
road CW26 and RN29 and totallad about 50 km. The deviation roads required im-
provement comprising pavement and drainage repairs, strengthening and bitumen
surface treatment, estimated at DA 15.1 million. The work was financed fully
by MPW and was carried out by the regional MPW divisions of Tizi Ouzou and
Bouira in advance of the road closing. The benefits of improvement extended
Weyond the period of deviation, accruing to the population served by these
roads.
Techrical Assistance and Training
3.13     The project included consulting services for: (i) the supervision of
construction of the Boudouaou-Lakhdaria road; (ii) on-the-job training of road
maintenance personnel in three or four maintenance centers; and (iii) imple-
mentation of recommendations of general studies on road maintenance organi-
zation and road planning.  The consulting services for supervision of works
were considerably increased (para. 3.11), while other services were modified
and slightlv reduced.



-7-
3.14     The assistance to on-the-job training was changed, with the Bank's
concurrence, to training in a new permaneat training center of MPW in Bethioua
near Arzew. MPW considered that training courses would be more effective than
the dispersed on-the-job action.  Training of equipaent operators was reco-
gnized as the most urgent need of the linistry.  In December 1979, the MPW
entered into a contract with the consulting firm CIFAT (Belgium) to train 114
equipment operators over a period of 10 months and to identify amongst them 12
trainees for Further training as instructors.  This objective was not fully
achieved. Only 76 operators were trained and 10 trainees were selected to be-
come instructors. The program encountered difficulties due to poor selection
of trainees, poor availability of training equipment which caused trainees to
spend more time in the classroom than in equipment operation and deficient fa-
cilities at the practice area situated several kilometers from the training
center.   Certificate holders were  inducted into regional equipment sections
and public construction enterprises, and are providing satisfactory service.
The consultants prepared adequate didactic material which was used for sub-
sequent training programs.
3.15     The consulting services for implementation of recommendations of va-
rious studies were replaced, with the Bank's concurrence, by services required
for feasibility studies and detailed engineering of about 250 km of roads se-
lected for pavement strengthening under the Third Highway Project. This task
was carried out satisfactorily in 1980 by the consultant BCEOM (France). The
change was justified by an urgent need for timely preparation of the proposed
new highway project, while implementation of the preinvestment and maintenance
studies carried out under the First Highway Project was a long term action,
which extends beyond the project period (para. 1.02).
3.16     The project included 150 man-months of fellowships for highway en-
gineers of MPWC and of national construction companies.  This program was also
modified in agreement with the Bank. The change was made to provide for the
more urgent need of the Ministry in road maintenance and equipment opera-
tions. Training courses were organized by the French institution FORMEQUIP, a
branch of the National School of Public Works in Vaulx en Velin. The agreed
program included two groups of 20 maintenance engineers from regional divi-
sions of MPW for two weeks, and two groups of 15 managers of regional equip-
ment sections for four weeks.  The courses were successfully carried out in
mid-1979.   Other  engineers  were  trained  on  the  Boudouaou-Lakhdaria  con-
struction site.
Implementation Schedule
3.17     The actual and expected project implementation schedule is shown in
Table 1. The main component of the project, road construction, was completed
7 1/2 years after the start of procurement compared to an appraisal estimate
of 4 1/2 years. Half of the 66% time overrun is attributable to the lengthy
procurement procedure (33 months instead of 15) and half to the extension of
construction time (55 months instead of 36).  Training and technical assis-
tance were completed on time.



Complisnce with Covenants
3.18     The Government complied with the Loan Agreement covenants in respect
of procurement of construction works and consulting services, supervision of
works, cooperation with the Bank, and training and improvemnt of road main-
tenance. Tha project cost overrun was covered by the government. Right-of-
way for road construction was acquired in a timely fashion. Control of ve-
hicle dimensions and weights was carried out routinely; there was no evidence
of violation of regulations.
IV. PROJECT COST AND DISBURSEMENTS
Proiect Cost
4.01     The comparison between the actual costs and appraisal estimates  is
shown in Table 2, and details of the road construction and supervision costs
are in Table 3. The road construction contract's initial amount of DA 379.7
million exceeded the appraisal estimate by 28S. However, the appraisal esti-
mate was based on December 1976 prices, while the contractor's bid was based
on prices as of December 1978.  The two-year price escalation accounted for
about a 201 increase, while the remaining 8S represented the excess of bid
rates over appraisal estimates.
4.02     Towards the end of 1983 the contract was about 902 completed, with
full completion targeted for July 1984. The cost figures shown in Table 2 are
therefore the latest estimates and not the final figures.  The total con-
struction cost, including taxes, is expected to be DA 638.8 million comprising
DA 379.7 million of the initial contract amount, DA 92.1 million for addi-
tional works and increase of measured quantities, DA 48 million allowance for
adjustment of bid rates to the date of contract award and DA 119 million for
price  escalation  during  construction.   A  further sum  of  DA  53,5 million
allowed to the contractor as reimbursement of custom duties, fees and royal-
ties is disregarded in the summary of construction costs. The contractor was
authorized to repatriate 56.521 of the contract cost excluding taxes, which
were estimated at 14Z of the total cost.
4.03     Extra works accounted for a 24Z increase of the initial contract
amount expressed in DA while price adjustments added 44% to that amount. The
price adjustment percentage is consistent with the 8% and 91 annual price es-
calation assumed at appraisal.
4.04     The total cost of supervision of works was about DA 28.5 million or
4.51 of construction cost, which is in line with the norm for works of similar
type and size.  The participation of foreign consultants in supervision was
increased substantially in relation to the appraisal estimate because of the
shortage of qualified local staff. The consultants contract allowed for repa-
triation of 61.541 of the amount paid excluding taxes, which were estimated at
181 of payments.



-9-
4.05     The total overrun of the project cost, Including consulting services,
was 44S in terms of US dollars and 64  in terms of Algerian dinars.  The
:oreign exchange cost exceeded appraisal estimates by 72S. The Bank financed
28.6S of the total cost against an appraisal estimate of 41X. The Government
covered all cost overruns.
_Disbursements
4.06     Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates because of the delay
in procurement of works, but picked up when construction work reached a normal
pace.  Annual disbursements were close to appraisal estimates in the later
years. The comparison between appraisal estimate and actual disbursements is
shown below:
FY       Appraisal Estimate      Actual        Actual as % of
(in US$ million)                    Appraisal Estimate

1979            15.0                 -                  -
1980            31.0                 .07                2
1981            41.5               13.1                32
1982            41.5               26.5                64
1983            41.5               41.5               100
The initial Closing Date was extended by one year to December 31, 1982.  The
loan was fully disbursed as of June 29, 1983 for commitments made before the
Closing Date. The Loan funds were exhausted about one year before completion
of road construction works. The Bank did not consider necessary reducing dis-
bursement percentage pursuant to Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement because the
borrower had no difficulty in providing foreign exchange component of payments
after the Closing Date, and the Bank continued supervision of the project com-
pletion in conjunction with supervision of the follow-up Third and Fourth
Highway Projects.
4.07     The loan funds were re-allocated to conform with the actual disburs-
ement under the various categories.

V. INSTITUTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01     The Second Highway Project coincided with a turning point in the ins-
titutional development of MPW, and provided timely assistance in strengthening
of the highway organization. During project implementation, and in particular
as a result of reconunendations of the First Highway Project (Loan 912-AL), the
Ministry of Public Works and Construction (MPWC) entered into a reorganization
process which included the separation at regional level of all activities re-
lated to housing and urbanization from activities related to highways, and the
reform of the maintenance organization (MPWC became MPW). This resulted in an
improved management of road maintenance and construction, which was further
strengthened under the Third Highway Project (Loan 1683-AL).  The reform of
the maintenance organization continued and was directed lately towards main-
tenance by contract. Furthermore, during the project life major increases in
budget allocations for maintenance and rehabilitation were achieved, and trai-
ning of maintenance staff was started through project financed courses abroad
for engineers and technical assistance for training of equipment operators in
the new training center at Bethioua.
5.02     Through the project MPW acquired substantial experience in the use of
the national road construction industry under its supervision.  By resorting
to international competitive bidding for major construction contracts, while
allowing local firms to participate in the bidding, MPW stabilized highly vol-
atile construction prices. This also helped assure a proper split in the road
construction market under which complex projects are executed by expatriate
construction firms, while national construction companies build up expertise
in less complex projects. Through this process, MPW also gained experience in
the administration and supervision of large road construction contracts.
5.03     The maic project implementation problem encountered by MPW was in
procurement of civil works. This problem was successfully solved when the
road contract was awarded to a large and capable contractor. Some adjustments
were made in the technical assistance component which was not clearly defined
at appraisal, but which was satisfactorily completed.  Procurement followed
the Bank's guidelines, and Government adherence to these regulations assisted
the successful implementation of the project. The procurement issue, however,
demonstrates clearly the need to make the loan for the project as late in the
project cycle as possible in order to apprehend accurately construction costs.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01     The Second Highway Project was reevaluated taking into account the
estimated final cost of constructing the Boudouaou-Lakhdaria road, reestimated
maintenance costs, actual and projected traffic flows, and updated estimates
of vehicle operating costs and time savings. Costs and benefits were calcu-
lated net of tax at 1982 price levels. Estimated construction and maintenance
expenditures were adjusted to 1982 levels assuming an 8.5Z p.a. rate of in-
flation which is representative of the rates of foreign and local inflation
during the project implementation period.



- 11 -
6.02     Construction costs included the cost of supervision, the LNTPB, MPW
site staff, and an assumed DA 15 million for the acquisition of right of way.
The cost of improving detour roads (about DA 15 million) was not included be-
cause most of the benefits accrued to local traffic following the completion
of construction. Construction costs totaled DA 682 million, or DA 592 million
net of tax at 1982 prices. Maintenance costs were updated from appraisal es-
timates, assuming that the premix wearing course would be overlaid in 1991 and
2001.
6.03     Traffic grew from 10,454 vpd in 1976 to 16,200 vpd in 1982 on the
Boudouaou - RN12 road section, and from 4,400-4,920 vpd in 1976 to an esti-
mated 7,000 vpd in 1982 on the RN12 - Lakhdaria section (Table 4). 1982 traf-
fic was about 30% below appraisal estimates, but the new road was not com-
pleted until 1983-84; the new road is expected to generate about 15 addi-
tional traffic (appraisal assumption). Normal traffic is expected to grow 7f
p.a. to 1995 and 52 p.a. thereafter, based on observed traffic trends and ex-
pected economic development.
6.04     Vehicle operating costs (VOC's) were based on 1982 estimates by con-
sultants SAETI (Algeria), which were adopted by a consortium of consultants
for studies financed by the Bank of an Algerian Expressway System. VOC's on a
level tangent paved road were estimated to be 57-1342 higher in 1982 than the
1977 appraisal estimate (Table 5).  The 1982 estimates were then adjusted to
take into account the estimated surface condition, grade, curvature and traf-
fic congestion in the "with" and "without" cases. VOC's on the old road were
estimated to range from 30% higher in 1984 to 60% higher in 2000 than on the
new road, due primarily to the effect of traffic congestion. This is general-
ly consistent with the appraisal estimate.  The existing road was closed to
traffic for eight months during 1982, and the additional VOC's associated with
the deviation were included in the reevaluation. Value of passenger time sa-
vings was also based on SAETI's 1982 estimates, using a value of DA 8.48/hour-
/passenger car and DA 111.06/hour/bus. The value of time savings for trucks
is included in their VOCs.
6.05     The  economic  return  from  construction  of  the  Boudouaou-Lakhdaria
road, which accounts for 99X of project costs, was reestimated to be 21Z, or
19% without time savings, based on the above streams of costs and benefits
(Table 6).  This is very close to the appraisal estimate of 20Z and 18  res-
pectively.  A somewhat lower level of traffic was offset by a somewhat higher
real level of vehicle operating costs. The project is therefore considered to
remain economically justified.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01     The Bank contributed to the development of the highway subsector in
three ways: (i) reducing the cost of major civil works through use of ICB
(3.01-3.08); (ii) continuing a dialogue on organizational reforms leading to
positive changes which are still under implementation (para. 1.02); and (iii)
training of MPW staff and preparing urgent pavement strengthening works
(paras.  3.13-3.16).   To strengthen cooperation with MPW and  preserve  good



- 12 -
relations, the Bank agreed to the proposed "slice and package" bidding, al-
though works of this type are usually put to tender in one lot. The procure-
ment process convinced DI that subdivision of complex works is not appro-
priate.  The second round of bidding on a modified basis was successful and
led to one contract for the whole work.  The Bank cooperated closely with DI
throughout the procurement process.   Construction works were visited by the
Bank staff at least three times each year, and all proposed change orders were
reviewed and discussed before their finalization. The cooperation between the
Bank and the Borrower throughout project implementation was very good.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     In spite of a time and cost overrun, the project fully achieved its
physical objectives.   It provided MPW with experience in the international
procurement and supervision of major civil works.   Employment of a foreign
contractor improved Algeria's construction capability, and stabilized prices
through wider competition in a sector where public enterprises had been predo-
minant.  The participation of a foreign contractor left domestic enterprises
free to deal with the large volume of less complex highway works. A Third and
Fourth Highway Projects were prepared and implemented, and a Fifth Highway
Project is under preparation. All these projects will benefit from the basic
principles of procurement and contract administration which were developed un-
der the Second Highway Project.
8.02     The lengthy procurement process was the principal cause of the cost
overrun.  Ilowever, the financial loss was adequately compensated by the ex-
perience gained in international procurement and by strengthening of con-
struction capacity. The project remains economically justified.
8.03     MPW staff was trained under the project, and studies carried out for
urgent pavement strengthening works.   The project provided a vehicle for a
continuing dialogue on organizational matters, leading to reforms which are
being implemented.
8.04     The principal lessons learned through implementation of this project
are:
(i) complex works constricted on a reduced area should not be sliced into
small lots (paras. 3.02-3.09);
(ii) lowering the costs by stage construction of road pavement is usually
uneconomic (paras. 2.04 and 3.09);
(iii) management of traffic during road construction should be planned and
prepared before starting the works (para. 3.12); and
(iv) timing of a project appraisal should concord with an advanced stage
of design and procurement of works to apprehend accurately construc-
tion costs (paras. 3.08 and 5.03).
