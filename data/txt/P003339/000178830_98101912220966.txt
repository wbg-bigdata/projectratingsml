BURMA
APPRAISAL OF A TIIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The proposed project, together with a first Inland Waterways
project, will be the Bank Group's first lending operation in Burma since
1961. Together, these projects are designed to provide essential transport
infrastructure rehabilitation which will assist the future development of the
Burmese economy.
ii.       The transport system of the country is dominated by inland water
transport and the railways, both serving the key economic centers of Burma
but traversing different terrain in doing so. These two major systems, of
which inland water transport is the larger, complement each other rather
than compete for traffic. The road system, while important in some areas,
is of much less national significance and would require a substantial invest-
ment in both infrastructure and vehicles to attain a major role as a long-haul
mode.
iii.      In all three modes, as well as in the small air transport industry,
state-owned organizations are dominant although, in inland water and road
transport, private operators carry a substantial volume of the traffic,
particularly on short-haul activities.
iv.       The Burma Railways Corporation (BRC), a state-owned corporation,
operates a 1,949 route-mile meter gauge system. There are ten branch lines
connected to the main trunk route between the port of Rangoon, and Mandalay
in the north. The railway traverses important agricultural regions and
reaches most of the mineral and forestry areas. It also provides passenger
transport facilities between principal towns and suburban services for Rangoon
and Mandalay.
v.        Largely due to lack of sufficient foreign exchange to purchase
essential spares over the past ten years, locomotives and rolling stock as
well as track have suffered through inadequate maintenance, resulting in poor
availability of transport and a sub-standard level of operating performance.
vi.       The BRC, while technically an autonomous entity, is controlled by
the Government through a Central Transport and Communications Corporation
(CTCC), of which the Chairman is the Minister of Transport and Communications.
For all practical purposes, the BRC functions as a department of the
Government, the managing director of the BRC being responsible for day-to-day
operations.
vii.      The Investment Plan of the BRC, part of the national Four Year Plan,
1971/72 - 1974/75, involves a total expenditure of K 318 million (US$66
million equivalent). The proposed project covers the last two years of the
Plan and includes provision for technical studies. It is estimated to cost
K 213 million (US$44.2 million equivalent), including a foreign exchange



- ii -
element of US$30.5 million. Provision is made for the acquisition of 30
diesel locomotives, to be financed by a French supplier's credit of US$12.5
million equivalent. The proposed IDA Credit of US$16.7 million would finance
procurement of workshop equipment, 110 freight cars, 61 passenger cars and
the foreign exchange cost of rehabilitating locomotives, rolling stock and
track. The procurement of specific goods financed by the Credit will be
through international competitive bidding except certain components and
spare parts for replacement on locomotives, rail cars and rolling stock
already in service - estimated to cost about US$3.1 million.
viii.     The financial results from operations in recent years have been
satisfactory, although they have to some extent been distorted through
deferment of essential replacements and maintenance. While the BRC has not
been a net contributor to Government revenues, its cash generation has
been sufficient to meet almost all its expenditure on capital account.
About 66% of the total cost of the proposed project will be financed by
the French credit and the proposed IDA Credit; the latter will be re-lent
to the BRC. Both these credits will be repaid from the BRC's revenues so
that, together with a contribution to project costs from the BRC of about
19% of the total, the BRC will be responsible for 85% of the total project
costs, leaving the Government to provide the balance.
ix.       The conditions negotiated include an earnings covenant designed
to ensure the BRC's continued financial viability, an undertaking from the
Government that there will be no amplification of the Investment Plan and
other undertakings for technical studies designed to achieve improvements in
the BRC's operating efficiency.
x.        The emphasis of the project is on the acquisition of diesel
locomotives and new rolling stock, on rehabilitation of out-of-service
equipment, and the provision of adequate workshop facilities and improved
operatiorlal efficiency which it is expected to be achieved with some technical
assistance.  Ta1ken as a whole, the project yields an economic return of
i 16%.
The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
o  IsS16,.7 aiillioa: to the Govrernment of the Union of Burma.



BURMA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Union of Burma and the Burma Railways
Corporation (BRC) have asked the Association for a Credit of US$16.7 mil-
lion equivalent to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of the last two
years of the BRC's Investment Plan for 1971/72 - 1Q74/75 (the Plan), which, in
turn, is part of the first Four Year Economic Development Plan of Burma,
1971/72 - 1974/75. BRC's investments during these two years are estimated
at K 212.7 million (US$44.2 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange
component of US$30.5 million equivalent. The project is designed chiefly to
rehabilitate and acquire diesel locomotives, rolling stock and track, and
to create adequate facilities for repairing and maintaining rolling stock
to enable the BRC to cope with the forecast traffic on completion of the
Plan. The proposed Credit of US$16.7 million would be made to the Union of
Burma to be utilized by the BRC, which is a Government enterprise. The
Credit would finance specific imported goods and would include about US$3.1
million for non-competitive procurement of essential spare parts; a small
amount of foreign currency requirements for items already committed would be
covered from the Government's own foreign exchange resources.
1.02      This would be the third Bank Group project in Burma in the railway
sector and, together with the proposed Credit to the Inland Water Transport
Corporation (IWTC), the fourth and fifth in the transport sector. The Bank
Group has helped finance only the transport sector so far. A loan for the
Port of Rangoon in 1956 (Loan 140-BA, US$14.0 million) helped finance the
reconstruction of cargo berths and storage facilities and the purchase of
cargo-handling and floating equipment for harbor operations. Two loans
(Loan 139-BA, US$5.3 million equivalent, in 1956, and Loan 274-BA, US$14
million equivalent, in 1961) helped finance postwar reconstruction and
dieselization of the railways. All three projects were satisfactorily
completed. The Bank Group resumed activity in Burma in 1971 and an economic
mission visited the country in the spring of 1972. The proposed project
for the BRC and a proposed project for the IWTC will reintroduce Bank Group
lending in Burma. Other Bank Group assistance to the Burmese transport
sector is expected in the form of a UNDP-financed study of the Port of
Rangoon, for which the Bank will act as the executing agency. The study will
assess the dredging requirements in the Port and its access channel. Terms
of reference for this study are being prepared.
1.03      This report was prepared on the basis of information supplied by the
Government of the Union of Burma and the BRC and on the findings of a January/
February 1973 appraisal mission composed of Messrs. Y. Abe (economist),
0. Murthy (engineer) and J. Spencer (financial analyst).



-2-
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Burma's economic growth has been very slow, the average annual
increase in gross national product (GNP) having been about 3.6% in the
past five years. The economy depends primarily on the agricultural and
forestry sectors, and per capita GNP in 1972 is estimated at US$70 equiv-
alent. The country has a low level of internal and external savings, which
is reflected in the low level of investment. There has been inadequate
maintenance and poor utilization of the available productive capacity. The
transport sector has been no exception to this pattern.   In the last several
years, there has been a growing awareness at responsible Government levels
of the need to improve the situation. Specifically, this is reflected in
the adoption of the current Economic Development Plan (1971/72-1974/75) and
the readiness to seek Bank Group assistance after an interval of ten years.
B. Transport Sector
2.02      Burma's geography (see Map) is such that over the centuries
economic activities developed along the banks of the River Irrawaddy, its
tributary the Chindwin and the myriads of river-arms of the Irrawaddy Delta.
Thus, historically, inland water transport has been the most important
element of the transport sector. Railway construction, commencing late in
the nineteenth century, resulted in the creation of a second major transport
system linkiag the key centers of Rangoon and Mandalay, with branch lines
extending north to Myitkyina, eastward into the Shan hills and westward to
important towns on the Irrawaddy. However, the railway traverses different
terrain from the inland water system and hence is more complementary to
inland water transport than competitive with it. Later, roads were developed
whlch were, to some extent, competitive with both railway and inland water
transport routes but the development of the road system or the road transport
industry has not been emphasized with the exception of certain short and
meditwi-haul services. The transport system is essentially concerned with
moving the agricultural products of the Delta and Central Burma to such
major population and export centers as Rangoon and Bassein as well as to
the less fertile regions of Upper Burma. Forest products, minerals and oil
move southward from Central and Upper Burma to the Rangoon area for processing,
redistribution or export.
2.03      The transport sector has been suffering from a lack of capacity,
due mainly to inadequate repair facilities, lack of spare parts and materials
and insufficient procurement of replacements. This has resulted in a low
level of efficiency in the various transport entities.
2.04      No detailed traffic data for the country in terms of traffic
flows, passenger-miles and ton-miles are available. According to the



- 3 -
Ministry of Planning and Finance (NDPF), the total volume of freight
transport grew an average of 4% per annum between 1961/62 and 1971/72,
reaching about 44 million tons in the latter year (Table 1). The composi-
tion of demand has remained stable over the past five years: agriculture,
including livestock, forestry and fisheries, accounts for about 70% of the
total, and mining and industry, 30%. In 1970/71, the MOPF estimated that about
62% of total freight traffic was short-haul, carried mainly by small inland
craft, 22% was medium-haul, and 16% long-haul. About 34% of total long-haul
freight is carried by railway, 30% by inland water transport, 18% by road
transport, and 13% by coastal shipping (see Table 2 for details). 1/ While
these figures cannot be regarded as strictly accurate, they provide a reason-
able basis on which to assess the role of each mode for the future. The
railway transportation system is described in the next chapter; the characteris-
tics of other modes in Annex 1; traffic growth of the major state-controlled
transport agencies is shown in Table 3.
2.05      Road Transport services are provided by the state-controlled Road
Transport Corporation (RTC) created in 1963 and by private operators who
collectively carry about 80% of road freight traffic, mainly short and
medium-haul. The RTC is having difficulty in maintaining its capacity due to
lack of spare parts, and privately-owned vehicles are over-aged. The total
number of vehicles, including cars and motor-cycles, was about 54,000 in
1971/72. The road network covers about 16,000 miles of which 42% is paved,
but the roads are narrow and badly aligned.
2.06      The inland water transport services are provided by the IWTC and
by a large number of private operators. The passenger and cargo services of
the IWTC operate over 6,100 service miles 2/ of the major navigable rivers
and carry mostly long-haul traffic. Private operators concentrate mostly on
slow-moving short-haul traffic in small craft but carry a large proportion
of total freight and passenger traffic.
2.07      The Burma Ports Corporation (BPC) operates the deep-water interna-
tional port at Rangoon and administers eight minor seaports along the
coastline. Although no capacity problems at the Port of Rangoon are fore-
seen in the near future, the unstable and shallow access channels have
been of some concern to the Government, and the possibility of dredging
an access channel is being considered. The UNDP has been asked to finance a
feasibility study with the Bank as executing agency.
2.08      The Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation (BFSC) operates eight ocean-
going vessels with 59,000 dwt and six coastal vessels with 8,500 dwt. In
addition, there are 180 privately operated coastal craft with 12,000 dwt.
1/   Short-haul is defined by the Government as distances up to 25 miles,
medium from 25 to 75 miles, and long over 75 miles.
2/   Total of routes and services.  Unduplicated route-mileage unknown.



-4-
2.09      Burma has one international airport in Rangoon and 42 domestic
airports, of which 34 are operated permanently. Navigational aids are of
poor range and quality; maintenance and repair facilities are old. The Burma
Airways Corporation (BAC) provides domestic and some international flights;
Burma is also served by other international airlines. Most traffic is
handled at the Rangoon International Airport. Air freight traffic is minor.
C. Transport Investment and Policy
2.10      Public sector investment in transportation, including road construc-
tion, has been decreasing since 1966/67, and its share of such investments
decreased from 20% in 1966/67 to 10% in 1970/71. Table 4 summarizes capital
expenditures in the transport sector 1966/67 - 1970/71. The three major
modes - inland water, rail and road - received about 90% of total transport
investment.  The level of investment has not been sufficient to maintain
capacity.
2.11      Since independence and particularly since the advent of the
present Revolutionary Government in 1962, Government policy has been to
progressively nationalize the transport sector, with the stated objective of
ultimately placing all forms of mechanized transport in the public sector.
Railway (BRC), air (BAC) and ocean-going transport (BFSC) are entirely
nationalized; private sector activity is allowed in trucking, inland water
transport and coastal shipping. The Government makes freight allocations
among various transport modes, prohibits the replacement of equipment by
private operators and limits the availability of spare parts. The allocation
of government-controlled freight traffic (e.g. rice, oil, coal, cement,
fertLlizer) is made through the Central Movement Coordination Committee (CMCC)
by exhausting the available public sector capacity and satisfying remaining
demand through private operators who also are free to carry decontrolled
commodities. Spare parts for private operators are made available through
the Ministry of Trade (MOT) but allocations have been insufficient to provide
for proper mcintenance of private sector vehicles and craft which are generally
quite old and in poor condition. However, the role of the private sector
will remain importrat In the foreseable future, as the public sector at
present is short of capacity and the private sector moves substantial shares
of; transport detmani. iTt is estimated by the Ministry of Transport and
Cot.iunicatioas (MOTC) that the private sector now accounts for about 50%
of inland water transport 1/ and about 8Q% of trucking in terms of tons.
2.12      The transport sector, excluding highway planning and construction,
is under the authority of the MOTC; highway planning and construction come
under the Ministry of Construction. The MOTC is responsible for enforcing
Government policies regarding transportation by (a) approving the budgets of
the transport agencies in consultation with the MOPF; (b) appointing officers
of the transport agencies; (c) setting tariff and tariff policy; and (d)
enforcing regulations for the operation of the sector. Annex 2 describes the
functions of agencies related to the transport sector.
1/   This excludes short-haul freight traffic.



-5 -
2.13      In the transport sector as a whole, investment priorities cannot
currently be analyzed on a rational basis. This is largely due to inadequate
information on traffic flows, operational statistics and costs and, to some
extent, the lack of expertise in collecting and analyzing information concern-
ing future transport demands. As initial steps which should eventually
help Burmese transport policy makers to make sound decisions on investment
priorities in the future, the BRC will undertake studies of the optimum timing
for phasing out steam locomotives and of the necessity of track doubling
with the help of technical assistance provided under the proposed Credit.
The BRC will also be required to improve preparation of operational and
management statistics and appoint a working group to recommend operational
improvements. Similarly, the proposed Credit for the IWTC makes provision for
assistance in improving accounting, costing and management information.
III. BURMA RAILWAYS CORPORATION
A. Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      The railway was started as a state enterprise in 1877.  It was
under private management from 1896 through 1929, when it reverted to state
management and has so remained until now. Under an Act of 1951, a body
corporate known as the Union of Burma Railway Board was established and
the Government administered the railway through the Board until March 1972.
On March 16, 1972, following a Promulgation of the Revolutionary Council
of the Union of Burma, a Central Transport and Communication Corporation
(CTCC) was formed with the Burma Railways Corporation (old Union of Burma
Railway Board) as the executing agency in charge of the railway.
3.02      In the new organization, the powers exercised by the former
Railway Board passed to the CTCC. The Managing Director of the BRC is the
chief executive, performing the same functions as the former Chairman of
the Railway Board in the day-to-day running of the organization. On
matters of policy he receives direction from the Central Committee of the
CTCC, of which the Minister of Transport and Communications is the Chairman,
and the Deputy Minister is Vice Chairman. The Managing Director of the BRC
is a member of this Committee. Although the BRC is an autonomous body, the
Government has effective control in the overall management (exercised through
the Central Committee of the CTCC on which the various Ministries are represented).
In practice, the Railway organization functions as a department of the
Government under the control of the Deputy Minister for Transport and
Communications. Internally, the Railway is organized 1/ on a departmental
system with the Managing Director in overall charge, assisted by a General
Manager under whom function seven departmental chiefs at headquarters. The
Railway system is divided into Districts managed by officers of each of
1/   See Organization chart, Annex 3.



- 6 -
the major departments, namely, Traffic, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical
Engineering.
3.03      The number of employees on the payroll of the BRC was 22,400 as of
September 30, 1972. The traffic units (ton-miles + passenger-miles) per
employee in 1971-72 was low - about 90,000 compared with 165,000 units in
Malaysia (1971) and 192,000 in Thailand (1971). The remuneration of officers
and staff of the BRC is similar to that in corresponding posts of other
Government civil services. Adjustments are not permitted except with the
approval of the Government. The quality of top management is satisfactory.
The younger officers appear to be keen and competent and staff discipline is
good.
3.04      In order that management may make effective use of operational
statistics for better day-to-day control, the BRC have, during negotiations,
confirmed that steps will be taken to improve the collection and compilation
of statistics so that they are produced promptly. This will require stricter
control over the reporting and evaluating system. It will be done in con-
junction with an assessment of accounting machine requirements which the BRC
will undertake (see para 5.03).
B. Railway Property
Annex 4 describes in detail the physical assets of the BRC.
Track and Structures
3.05      The BRC operates a system of 1,949 route miles of which 225 are
double tracked. The track on the trunk route, Rangoon to Mandalay, and
part of the more important branch lines, in all 817.25 miles, is laid with
75 lb/yd rails and the balance with 60/50 lb/yd rails. Sleepers are of wood
and ballast of broken stone. The track receives systematic maintenance by
manual labor to adequate standards. Bridges and other structures are
generally well maintained. The length of welded track is low (59 miles);
the BRC hopes to increase this mileage gradually. On some sections rails are
more than 50 years old, and on others there is heavy wear and corrugation
on the rail head; the proposed project makes provision for essential renewals.
3.06      The signalling system which varies with the density of traffic,
is well maintained and is adequate for the speeds obtaining. The BRC has
limited the speed of through trains at 37 mainline stations to 25 mi/hr
while passing over facing points, because of the worn out components of the
interlocking equipment and because of the need for electrical detection in the
isolation of the through line. Operations would be considerably improved
if these speed restrictions were removed. The BRC has confirmed during negotia-
tions that it will take steps to permit through-train running speeds at these
stations to be at the same level as applicable at other stations between
Rangoon and Mandalay from a date not later than December 1975.

Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.07      Table 5 shows the details and age of the motive power fleet and
rolling stock on the books of the BRC as of September 30, 1972. It consisted
of 274 steam, and 129 diesel locomotives, 23 diesel rail car sets (mostly
with two powered cars and one trailer), 2,162 bogie freight cars, 6,920
four-wheeler freight cars and 1,206 bogie coaching vehicles.
3.08      Of the 274 steam locomotives, 151 are in poor condition; 34 main-
line diesel locomotives and 4 diesel shunters are out of service; 13 rail
car sets out of the 23 available sets lack spare parts and are not in use;
268 coaches are under or are awaiting repair, with 106 of them needing heavy
repairs. About 2,000 freight cars (nearly 18%) have been stabled awaiting
rehabilitation. The main reason for the poor condition of the motive power
and rolling stock is the lack of components, spare parts, and raw material
which have to be imported. It is also partly due to inadequate repair
facilities in the workshops and maintenance sheds. The Investment Plan aims
at overcoming these deficiencies.
3.09      The BRC has placed an order for 30 diesel locomotives (Alsthom-France),
all of which are expected to be delivered by June 1974. This order was
placed before the current project was fully identified. The procurement,
notwithstanding the proposed rehabilitation of 38 unserviceable diesels
already on hand, was considered by the BRC to be justifiable on the basis of
its inability to maintain existing services and the need for tractive power
for proposed additional services. This justification, however, was based on
the present low levels of locomotive utilization achieved and consequently
made no allowance for the withdrawal from service of steam locomotives.
Moreover, the plans for additional services were not supported by adequate
evidence of traffic requirement. The revised Investment Plan recognizes
the scope for increased availability and utilization of diesel locomotives
through equipment and workshop rehabilitation and improved operational
standards and makes provision for the staged withdrawal of steam locomotives
as proposed in para 4.05. On this basis, the purchase of 30 new diesels
and the rehabilitation of 38 oers is fully justified.
Work Shops and Maintenance Sheds
3.10      The main workshop facilities of the BRC for the overhaul of loco-
motives are concentrated close to the two important centers of railway activity
- Rangoon and Mandalay. The shop at Insein, a suburb of Rangoon, caters to
the heavy repairs of steam locomotives. In addition, it handles, in the
absence of separate facilities, diesel locomotive chassis repairs. The
diesel engines are repaired on a makeshift basis in the maintenace shed at
Rangoon. The new workshop at Ywataung (Mandalay area) will, on completion,
take over all work of repairs and overhaul of diesel locomotives. The
Myintnge workshop (Mandalay area), now being expanded caters to the heavy
and periodical overhaul of freight and passenger cars. It also manufactures
a limited number of passenger and freight cars using imported underframes.
The present overhaul and maintenance facilities for locomotives and rolling
stock are inadequate, but on completion of the construction and expansion of



- 8 -
shops for which the procurement of equipment is to be financed by the proposed
Credit, sufficient capacity would become available.
3.11      Some of the equipment in the workshops and depots is old and
inadequate to ensure proper overhaul of stock; replacements and some
additions are needed for which provision is made in the proposed project.
There will be need in the future for well planned and equipped modern mainten-
ance sheds to cater to the growing diesel locomotive fleet. The project
provides for specialist services to assess requirements (para 4.05).
Marshalling Yards
3.12      The main marshalling yards are at Mahlwagon (near Rangoon) and
at Mandalay. These and the intermediate and terminal yards are adequate
for the level of traffic expected for some years. When the 2,000 freight
cars awaiting repair and stabled in the yards are cleared away, mobility
in the yards will improve.
C. Traffic and Operations
(i) Freight Traffic
3.13      The BRC's freight traffic statistics for 1961/62 and from 1965/66
through 1971/72 are shown in Table 6. From 1961/62 through 1965/66 freight
traffic grew 3.8% per annum in tonnage and 4.9% per annum in ton-miles.
Since then freight traffic has tended to decline and in 1971/72 was 2.9
million tons and 484 million ton-miles as compared with 3.4 million tons
and 552 million ton-miles in 1965/66. This decline was attributable to a
shortage of locomotive power and rolling stock. The average freight transport
distance increased from 155 miles in 1961/62 to 165 miles in 1971/72 due
mainly to an increase in the average haul for rice transportation. The
Rangoon-Mandalay section, linking the two major economic centers of the
ounmtry, has the greatest freight traffic density. Freight net ton-miles
per route-mile were 248,181 in 1971/72 as compared to 286,683 in 1965/66.
.3.14     The composition of freight traffic (shown below for 1971/72) has
been quite constant over the decade; major commodities stem from the
agriculture and forestry sectors, reflecting the basic economic structure.
In 1971/72, these commodities constituted 68% of the BRC's revenue freight
ton-miles, excluding military movements:

Others                              333      13.4     97.0    22.0
Total                  2,495    100.0    440.5   100.0
3.15      Table 7 shows the BRC's freight traffic forecasts from 1972/73
through 1976/77, which take account of expected increases in the production
and distribution of cement and fertilizer envisaged during the First Four Year
Economic Plan and increases in railway capacity arising from the BRC's In-
vestment Plan. The traffic growth rate is expected to be about 5% in terms
of ton-miles in the initial years, due mainly to the existing backlog of
railway freight demand, declining to about 3% later. On average, the total
freight traffic, in tonnage, is expected to increase 4.6% per annum from
1971/72 through 1976/77 and to reach 3.5 million tons and 606 million ton-
miles. Although the agricultural and forestry commodities will continue to
be of prime importance, the proportion of such commodities to total traffic
will decline in the future as other commodities such as cement and fertilizer
become more important. These forecasts were made by the mission in
consultation with the BRC and the MOPF and are realistic.
Passenger Traffic
3.16      Table 8 shows the BRC's passenger traffic statistics from 1961/62 to
1971/72.  During the period 1961/62 to 1966/67, passenger traffic increased
on average by 6.6% per annum in terms of passengers, and by 10.8% in passenger-
miles; it increased particularly in the period 1964/65 - 1966/67, reflecting
the introduction of additional night trains and suburban local trains in
1964/65 and increased passenger movements to the countryside during the
1965/66 and 1966/67 severe urban rice shortages. Traffic started declining
in 1967/68 and the subsequent deterioration of rail services, stemming
from the shortage of locomotives and passenger coaches, resulted in a 10%
overall decline by 1970/71 to 53.6 million passengers and 1.5 billion
passenger-miles. The average distance travelled per passenger was 30 miles
in 1970/71 - 51 miles for long-distance and 5 miles for suburban passengers.
3.17      The Railway is a major carrier of long-distance passengers and
since the BRC has insufficient capacity in locomotives and coaches, many of the
passenger trains are overcrowded. In 1971/72 the BRC allocated three newly-
arrived diesel locomotives and added some 30 passenger coaches to passenger
services and long-distance passengers increased by 40% in passengers and
11% in passenger-miles, as compared to the 1970/71 level.



- 10 -
3.18      The BRC's suburban services play a significant role in handling
commuter traffic in and around the Rangoon area. Due to the low availability
of diesel car units, suburban traffic has been decreasing from its peak level
in 1966/67 of 31 million passengers and 158 million passenger-miles to
26 million passengers and 128 million passenger-miles in 1971/72. Although
the Rangoon area is also served by 11 bus routes for commuters, they also have
insufficient capacity.
3.19      Passenger traffic forecasts are given in Table 8.  They take
account of increases in locomotives, diesel rail cars and coach availability.
Long-distance traffic is expected to increase on average at about 1% per
annum for both the number of passengers and passenger-miles and reach 28
million passengers and about 1.6 billion passenger-miles in 1976/77.  Subur-
ban traffic is expected to increase on average at about 7% per annum, reaching
37 million passengers and 182 million-passenger miles.  This would be higher
than its peak in 1966/67.  Considering tne population increase in the Rangoon
area and recent service reductions, the estimated traffic g-oth is reasonable.
Operations
3.20      Table 9 gives a summary of operating statistics from 1966/67 to
1971/72.  A significant feature of operatioas on the BRC is the predominance
of passenger services. During 1971/72, train-miles of passenger and passe.nger
proportion of mixed servi_es, accounted for 66% of total train-miles or
revenue-earning traffic. The other feature of note is the steady increase
in the proportion of traffic hauled by diesel locomotives. In termbss of
train-miles, the proportion increased from 51% in 1967 to 58% in 1972. In
teri.s of net ton-miles, diesel traction accotmted for 64% of total net ton-
m5-iS.- int 1972.  Thi  third and most importtant feature is the growing deterio-
,ation in the availability of both motive Power and rolling stock.  In 1971/72
`-he arvailal-a.ity of ma.n line steam locomotives was 67%, o  main line diesels
i2O/ of passenger coaches 74.5%, and of freight cars 69%.  The generally
fVJ repted norms of availability of diesel locomotives is about 85%, of coaches
9-i.,.    a-d of freight cars 95%. The poor availability is due to the lack
spares andc Tadequate anc.i-ties described in para 3.08.
.^.1~21   Utilization of the serviceable locomotives and rolling stock has
ee:-r-orated hd.ring the ptst tnTree 'years.  Diesel engine miles per diesel
t.ngi ie-iay available, dropped from 144 miles in 1970 to 115.5 miles in 1972.
Passenger vehicle-miles per vehicle-day available decreased from 129.8 miles
in 9968 to 122.6 miles in 1972. Freight car-miles per freight car-day
available has showqn a marginal improvement (23.06 miles to 23.63) during
the last four years. This, however, is due to the increased diesel traction.,
Net ton-miles per train-mile has dropped from 201 tons in 1970 to 180 tons
in 1972. Notwithstanding the fact that the BRC operates two hill sections
where train loads are severely restricted, the average train load could be
improved significantly. Net ton-miles per year per freight car available
lhas increased over the past four years from 58,400 ton-miles to 66,690
ton-miles, again reflecting t'ne effect of increased diesel traction.
3 .22    Tkhile tlte poor availabilit. of diesel locomotives (62.3%  in 1972)
and the heavy ineidence of engine failures certainly affected operations



adversely, substantial improvements in operation could be achieved through
more intensive use of diesel locomotives in terms of higher utilization and
increased train loads. The current deployment of the larger number of
mixed trains on the main lines (which are essentially passenger services),
and their light loads and pattern of occupancy, deserve study to rationalize
and optimize locomotive and passenger car utilization. The free time
allowed at the goods loading and unloading points (24 hours) should be
drastically reduced to improve wagon mobility. Detention of wagons at
marshalling yards (for which full statistics are lacking) should receive
attention through systematic reporting and control by the management. As
a study of these important aspects of operation could have immediate bene-
ficial effects even under the present difficult operating conditions,
agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations that a working
group consisting of two capable BRC officers (one with operating experience
and the other with experience in locomotive utilization) and an independent
railway expert familiar with BRC operations, will be set up and entrusted
with the proposed study on a full-time basis. It was also agreed with the
Government that the results of the study will be reviewed by the Government
and the Association and the agreed recommendations implemented.
D. Tariffs and Costs
3.23      Rates for freight traffic carried by the BRC fall into fiVe principal
classes which are calculated on a telescopic scale according to distance.
Special rates on a station-to-station basis are applied in certain cases by
mutual agreement between the BRC and the shippers but the BRC, in line with
the general price control system, must have its tariff approved by the
Government. In 1959 the Government decided that tariffs for commodities of
prime necessity, mainly food, should be reduced by 20% to 30%, but there have
been no further moves by the Government to effect reductions in tariffs nor
have there been any general revisions of freight tariffs during the past ten
years.
3.24      With the exception of petroleum products, iron and steel and
other industrial products, all of which are rated at around Pyas 20 per
ton-mile (about USk 4.2 equivalent), most other commodities are carried at
around the overall average of Pyas 12.4 per ton-mile (about USi 2.6
equivalent). These rates are fairly high compared with those of neighboring
countries. Rates for the principal commodities are:
Pyas per ton-mile
Rice                                  12.00
Timber                                 7.07
Sugar Cane                            12.91
Other Agricultural Products           11.86
Petroleum Products                    24.21



- 12 -
3.25      Passenger revenue has remained almost constant during recent years
at about Pyas 5.8 per passenger-mile (approximately USJ 1.2 equivalent).
3.26      The BRC has a costing section consisting of about eight people; they
are presently engaged on a study to identify revenues and costs of operation
on the mainline and on the separate branch lines. While there may be some
elements of cross-subsidization of particular classes of traffic, total costs
are fully recovered and there is no urgent need for an adjustment of tariffs.
E. Financial Management
3.27      Although the BRC is a corporation, for all practical purposes it
operates as a department of the Government. All cash generated is channelled
to the Government through the Union Government Consolidated Fund (UGCF) and
cash requirements for operations and investment programs are made available
through the same Fund. Income tax on the BRC's profits is levied at 99% so
that with the law as it presently stands, it is not possible for the BRC to
have any degree of financial autonomy.
3.28      Accounts of the BRC are prepared on commercial principles and
are satisfactory; there are, however, several shortcomings in accounting
organization and management which are discussed in paras 5.02 and 5.05.
3.29      Budgets are prepared annually for revenue, expenditure and
capital investment. These are submitted to the MOTC and the MOPF and they
are finally approved by the Council of Ministers in September of each year
for the ensuing fiscal year which ends on September 30.
3.30      Accounts to FY71 have been finalized and provisional figures
were presented for FY72. Audit of accounts by the Central Audit and
Inspection Office (Auditor-General's Department) has been completed for
all years to 1971, and in Annex 6 there is shown an English translation of
the auditor's opinion together with a summary in English of reservations
in the long-form Audit Report.
3.31      The mission discussed with the Director of Audit the standards of
auditing and the qualifications of his staff, both of which are acceptable.
The Auditor-General's Department is taking active steps to improve its
organization. The Deputy Director has a first-class professional qualification;
there are at least 40 locally qualified staff and the Auditor-General's
Department conducts its own training and examination programs.
3.32      During negotiations it was agreed that the BRC will send to the
Association copies of its unaudited annual accounts within four months of
the end of each fiscal year, to be followed by audited accounts with
translations in English of the auditor's report not later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year and accompanied by translations of any
exceptions and criticisms referred to in the report.

IV. THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A. The Investment Plan
4.01      A four-year Investment Plan has been prepared by the BRC (Table 10)
covering the period 1971/72-1974/75, coinciding with the national First
Four Year Economic Plan period. The original plan prepared by the BRC
was revised following the mission's discussions with the Government and the
BRC, based on field studies made by the mission of the physical assets, their
condition and utilization, and on forecasts of traffic estimated by the mission.
The main objective of the Plan is to rehabilitate the physical assets of the
BRC which have deteriorated due to lack of imported spare parts and components
and to create adequate facilities for their repair and maintenance. However,
the Plan also includes an investment in new diesel locomotive units, coupled
with a proposed withdrawal of steam engines, and the purchase of certain
additional rolling stock to meet anticipated requirements. Annex 7 describes
in detail the items included in the Plan. As shown in Table 10, the
Plan provides for capital investment of K 318 million 1/ (US$66 million
equivalent), with a foreign exchange component of US$40.38 million equivalent.
4.02      The main items included in the Plan are:  the completion of the
doubling of the main line between Rangoon and Pyinmana, now nearly finished;
equipping of the new workshop at Ywatang and expansion of Myitnge workshop;
improvement in the existing repair facilities in workshops and sheds,
renewals of rails, sleepers and ballast; procurement of 213 freight cars,
135 ordinary passenger cars, 30 diesel locomotives, 4 diesel breakdown
cranes; and the rehabilitation of 38 diesel locomotives, 106 passenger cars
and about 2,000 freight cars now out of service due to lack of imported
spare parts and components.
4.03      Tables 11 and 12 show details of the requirements of passenger
cars and freight cars of the BRC from September 30, 1972, to the end of the
Plan period after allowing for the scrapping of unserviceable cars, rehabi-
litation of serviceable cars, and for improvements expected in the operation.
Out of the total requirements, the proposed Credit covers the procurement of
110 freight cars, 61 passenger cars and the rehabilitation of 38 diesel
locomotives, 106 passenger cars and about 2,000 freight cars. The BRC has
already placed an order for 30 new diesel locomotives under a French
supplier's credit. (See paras 4, 5 and 6 of Annex 7.)
4.04      The doubling from Rangoon to Pyinmana is nearly completed.  The
Government has plans for extending doubling beyond Pyinmana to Mandalay;
earth work on the sub-grade on the first 40 miles and preliminary work on
one major bridge are in execution. As the justification for the extension
of doubling beyond Pyinmana is in serious doubt at this time, the Government's
agreement was obtained, during negotiations, to the effect that the doubling
1/   US$1.00   K Kyats 4.81.



- 14 -
beyond Pyinmana will be suspended until a study by experts 1/ is completed
and reviewed jointly by the Government and the Association and in the light
of the joint review it is agreed that the doubling is justified.
4.05      With the addition of 30 new diesel locomotives and the rehabili-
tation of 38 diesel locomotives, there will be a significant addition to
diesel motive power available, justifying the withdrawal of 106 steam
locomotives as forecast in the schedule in Annex 5. During negotiations,
Government's agreement was obtained that the BRC would scrap or declare as
surplus (not to be utilized in service but "stored in good order") a minimum
number of mainline steam locomotives to accord with the schedule in Annex 5.
It was further agreed that a study by experts 1/ of the retirement of
additional steam locomotives from service would be made and that the
recommendation emerging from the study would be implemented after review
jointly by the Government and the Association. As the requirements of
maintenance facilities for diesel locomotives are expected to grow, the study
would cover the adequacy of facilities for maintenance and overhaul of diesel
locomotives.
4.06      The expansion and improvements in workshop and shed facilities
to be undertaken are necessary in order to ensure satisfactorily the required
standards of improved maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock. The
quality of skills of the workmen manning the workshops is good.
4.07      Tables 11 and 12 show the calculations for the requirements of
passenger and freight cars after allowing for scrapping of unserviceable
stock and improvement in utilization.
B. The Project and the Proposed Credit
4.08      The project consists of the last two years, namely 1973/74
through 1974/75 (and some spillover to 1975/76), of the four-year Plan. The
principal items included are equipment for workshops and sheds; track
renewals; procurement of 30 diesel locomotives, 110 freight cars and 61
passenger cars; and the rehabilitation of rolling stock and diesel locomotives.
As shown in Table 13, the total cost of the project is estimated at US$44.2
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$30.5 million
equivalent. Items to be financed by the proposed Credit are detailed in
Annex 8. A summary of project expenditure is shown below:

4.09      The cost estimates for equipment, components, spares and other
mat-erial are based on prices as known fromn earlier supplies or by enquiries
to possible suppliers with provisiot for price escalation at 5% per annum.
4.10      Cost estimateS far civil works include an allowance of 10% for
physical contingencies. Price conti-ngencies on local costs have been provided
at 2% per annum. There has recently beev a wage increase which has been
covered in the bas-ic costs; subsgtanttial increases in local costs are not
expected. Material and labor costs in Burma have been controlled and have
been comparatively steady. Price contingencies of the foreign exchange
component have been provided at 5% per annum. The BRC will execute the
project and is competent to do so.
C. Procuremnnt and Disbursement
4.11      The procurement of equipment and material will be through
international bidding except far cettain components and spare parts required
for replacements on locomotives, railcars, and rolling stock already in
service - estimated to cost about US$3.1 million. Non-competitive procurement
will be negotiated mainly with original suppliers in consultation with the
Association.  The proposed Credit will be disbursed against the CIF cost
of imported equipment, components, spate parts and material and foreign
exchange cost of the technical assistance; an estimated disbursement schedule
is shown in Annex 9. The new paasenger and freight cars will be manufactured
in Railway workshops on imported underframes with components imported in
knock down condition.  The B:RC have adequate capacity, experience and skills
to undertake the work economically. This will result in substantial savings,
particularly oni freight charges applieable to the import of fully assembled
vehicles.
4.12      Any savings under the Credit will be used to finance additional,
but similar, project items subject to review and agreement with the
Association.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Past Performance
5.01      Revenue and expenditure accounts of the BRC for the six years to
1971/72 are shown in Table 14. Earnings from passenger traffic, after
declining steadily until 1969/70, showed a marked recovery by 1971/72;
freight traffic has declined during the period as a result of the BRC's
inability to maintain locomotives and rolling stock at a satisfactory level
of operating efficiency. Gross receipts from passenger and freight traffic
in 1971/72 were K 6 million less than in 1966/67; other revenue in 1970/71
and 1971/72 was inflated by non-recurring items resulting from the release



- 17 -
of deposits. The average cost of employees has increased at an annual rate
of only 2.7% and during this period there has been no change in the level of
rates and fares. Personnel costs absorb only 32% of total operating costs
which is a very low percentage compared with other railways; in India and
Thailand the corresponding figure is about 50% of total costs. Productivity
of personnel in terms of traffic units per employee (not an infallible
indicator of efficiency) has declined since 1966/67 but there has been some
improvement from the low level of 1969/70.
5.02      Depreciation is calculated at 1/7th of gross receipts; this
amount is put to a Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF) i->m which replacements
of fixed assets are financed. As a consequence the BRC balance sheet does
not show the full cost of fixed assets. Following discussions with BRC
officials it is evident that the BRC would have little difficulty in changing
over to a system of accounting for fixed assets and depreciation on commer-
cial principles. During negotiations it was agreed that commencing with the
preparation of accounts for the year 1973/74, fixed assets will be shown in
the balance sheet at historical cost as adjusted by annual charges for
depreciation based on the normal expected life of the various classes of
assets.
5.03      At present the BRC has a machine accounting installation which is
able to copewith the processing of basic accounting and statistical data.
The machines are outdated and it is therefore necessary that the BRC should
make plans now for its future accounting machine requirements; consideration
should be given to the possible use of a computer already installed at
Rangoon University. The accounting department of the BRC has officials who
are qualified to make a preliminary assessment of the future requirements,
and during negotiations it was confirmed by the BRC that such an assessment
will be prepared and submitted to the Association not later than March 1974.
It was also confirmed that in making the assessment consideration will be
given to machine requirements for processing operational statistics.
5.04      Operating ratios have been maintained at satisfactory levels but
they are to some extent distorted through equipment maintenance not being
carried out at normal levels. Net revenue from operations has been nearly
six times the annual charge for interest on loans.
5.05      The balance sheet of the BRC at September 30, 1972, is shown in
Table 15. Receivables include payments in advance for stores purchases and
advances for port dues and customs duties; outstanding freight accounts
amount to K 37 million, the majority of which are long overdue. Inventories
appear at an excessive figure which includes about K 60 million for obsolete
items or non-existent stores lost during World War II. Fixed assets also
include non-existent assets, largely as a result of war losses, amounting
to about K 144 million, and in showing fixed asset values no distinction is
made between fixed assets in use and uncompleted works in progress. A
deferred asset of K 5.1 million representing an old balance with the Accountant
General's department should be cleared from the BRC's books. Liabilities
under suppliers' credits should be shown separately from current liabilities.



- 18 -
All these points require attention in the interests of good accounting
practice. During negotiations it was agreed that the BRC will write off in
its accounts as soon as possible, but not later than in the accounts for the
year 1973/74, all its inventories and fixed assets which are obsolete or
non-existent and that in subsequent fiscal years inventories and fixed assets
which have become obsolete will also be written off promptly. Also, it was
confirmed that:
(a) the Government will instruct its agencies and corporations
to the effect that all accumulated debts due to the BRC should
be settled by September 1973 and that future accounts should
be cleared within three months of presentation;
(b)  balance sheets of the BRC will disclose the value of uncompleted
works in progress under the heading of Fixed Assets;
(c) a deferred asset of K 5.1 million will be settled or written
off from the books; ad
(d)  liabilities under suppliers' credits and other longterm
liabilities will be shown separately from current liabilities.
5.06      A source and disposition of funds statement for the five years
to 1971/72 is shown in Table 16; it shows that during the period the BRC
generated K 307 million from its own resources.  Debt service and other
requirements absorbed K 84 million, an.d capital expenditure amounted to
K 249 million of which the Government contributed K 187 million, an amount
roughly equivalent to the income tax (levied at 99X of profit) paid by the
BRC.
B, Financi4ng Plan
5.07      During the two years 1973/74 and 1974/75 in which the project will
be executed, funds required by the BRC and the source of such funds will be
as follows:

212.7                44.2  100.0
5.08      The figures in para 5.07 show that the proposed Credit will
contribute 38% of total project costs, 28% being found from a French
supplier's credit, 26% from the Government and 8% from the BRC's own resources.
If the effect of income tax is ignored, the BRC's own contribution would be
19% and the Government's contribution K 31.4 million or 15% of total cost.
Total foreign exchange costs amount to US$30.5 million; the proposed Credit
will contribute US$16.7 million (55%), the French supplier's credit US$12.5
million (41%), and a small balance to be found from Burma's own resources
relates to items already-committed.
5.09      In calculating debt service payments shown in the financing plan,
it has been assumed that the proposed Credit would be relent to the BRC and
repaid to the Government over 20 years including a 4-year grace period with
interest at 6% p.a. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the re-
lending terms which include a proviso that repayment of the Credit by the BRC
in advance of the respective due dates is permissible only to the extent
that the BRC's internal cash generation in any year shall exceed an amount equal
to 1.5 times the aggregate amount of the BRC's debt service requirements for
that year.
5.10      The contract for the supply of locomotives from France was signed
in August 1972. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that the



- 20 -
supplier's credit has been negotiated and is effective. A copy of the
agreement has been received by the Association.
5.11      The project has been defined as consisting of part of the BRC's
Investment Plan for the four years 1971/72 - 1974/75, as detailed in
Table 10. The financing plan is satisfactory, but since the BRC is dependent
on the Government for the allocation of funds for capital expenditure, it
has been agreed during negotiations that the Government will make available
all funds required to complete the project and to enable the BRC to operate
efficiently and to implement essential investment programs. It has also been
agreed that the BRC will carry out its Investment Plan and shall not, except
as the Government and the Association shall otherwise agree, amplify that
Plan by additional investment. Further, it has been agreed that other capital
expenditures made before September 30,1975, and not included in the Plan
will be restricted to an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of
US$1.0 million.
C. Financial Forecasts
5.12      Forecast revenue and expenditure accounts for 1972/73 - 1976/77
are shown in Table 17. Earnings from passenger and freight traffic have been
derived from the forecasts shown in Tables 7 and 8 which show an average
annual growth of 4.5% and 1.3% for freight and passengers respectively. No
provision has been made for any increase in rates and fares. The forecasts
for 1972/73 take account of an exceptional increase in pay for lower paid
workers, and for future years an increase of about 2% in average wage costs
has been assumed. Forecasts presented by the BRC assume an increase in the
labor force from 23,600 in 1971/72 to 30,000 in 1975/76. Part of this
increase is required to staff new workshops but the remainder which is said
to be required to fill existing vacancies should be carefully monitored
to preserve the BRC's financial viability (see paras 5.14 and 5.15).
5.13      Operating ratio rises from 78.5 in 1971/72 to 92.7 in 1975/76 partly
as a result of heavy maintenance costs through overtaking deferred repairs
which will be made possible through procurement of parts included in the
proposed Credit. In 1977 repair costs should return to a normal level. Another
reason for the poorer results from operations is the increase in personnel;
staff costs in 1976/77 are estimated at K 62.0 million compared with K 42.7
million in 1971/72, whereas gross receipts are expected to increase by only
K 15 million in the same period.
5.14      The increase in cost of personnel clearly will have an effect on
the cash situation of the BRC which is also affected by a fairly heavy burden
of payments due under suppliers' credits. A source and applicaton of funds
statement for 1972/73 - 1976/77 is shown in Table 18, from which it will



- 21 -
be seen that debt service 1/ payments in 1975 and 1976 are expected to be
covered only 1.2 times by the BRC's own cash generation. Included in
supplierst credits is one from France covering the cost of 30 locomotives to
be delivered in 1973 and 1974; repayment is to be over a period of 10 years
from delivery with interest at 7.67%. In order to ensure the BRC's financial
viability it was agreed during negotiations that commencing with 1973/74
the BRC will take such measures as are required to achieve an operating ratio
not higher than 87, and from 1976/77 not higher than 85. Achievement of
the proposed operating ratios will mean that the BRC should be able to
generate sufficient cash to meet all debt service and the cost of normal
replacements of capital equipment. It will also have the effect of controlling
increases in the number of personnel employed and at the same time avoiding
the need for increases in rates and fares. Annex 11 illustrates that the
proposed operating ratios would not be unduly difficult for the BRC to
achieve.
5.15      It was also agreed that the BRC will incur additional debt only If
debt service payments, including that on the re-lending of the proposed IDA
Credit and on any new loans or credits obtained or made available to the
BRC, are covered 1.5 times by the BRC's cash generation fromn its operations.
5.16      Pensions and terminal gratuities are charged in the accounts when
paid to the recipients instead of being funded on an accrual basis. During
negotiations the Association was informed that the Government intends to
Introduce in 1974 a national pension scheme covering all government employees,
which should enable the BRC to avoid the undesirable effects of an unfunded
scheme.
5.17      Forecast balance sheets of the BRC for years 1973 to 1977 are shown
in Table 19. The ratio of debt to equity is quite low but the much more
important aspect of ability to service debt has been dealt with at para 5.15.
Return on net fixed assets, after excluding works in progress and assets
which should be written off, has been calculated at 5.2% in 1973/74, reducing
to 2.1% in 1975/76, and then recovering to 3.2% in 1976/77.
VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Economic Role oL the BRC
6.01      The railway and the Inland water transport services, both serving
the key economic centers of Burma but traversing different terrain in doing
so, form the backbone of the transport system of the country, particularly
for long-haul freight and general passenger transport. They complement each
other rather than compete for traffic. Road transport concentrates on
short- and medium-haul freight and passenger movements and plays a lesser
11   Unless otherwise stated, debt service includes payments tnder suppliers'
credits.



- 22 -
role. It is likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future since
very substantial investments would be required to place the road system in
a competitive position. The investment envisaged in the transport sector
during the First Four Year Plan period and the typical freight rates for
various modes are shown in Tables 20 and 21.
6.02      Presently, neither major transport system is able to fulfill its
proper role or to carry the traffic offered because of the deterioration
of its facilities. The proposed project for the BRC and a similar one for
the IWTC, are designed to remedy the situation without changing the respective
roles of the systems.
B. Economic Analysis
6.03      The project, the last two years of the BRC's four-year Plan, has
four important components:
(a)  procurement and rehabilitation of diesel locomotives
(41% of the project);
(b)  procurement and rehabilitation of rolling stock (19% of the
project);
(c)  expansion and rehabilitation of workshops and sheds including
procurement of their equipment and materials (11% of the
project); and
(d)  other investments, which include bridge, rail, sleeper
and ballast renewals and minor civil and engineering work,
the completion of carry-over construction work, including
doubling the track to Pyinmana, and some minor items (29%
of the project).
These investments will enable the Railway to recover and augment its lost
capacity, improve its efficiency and reduce operating costs. As such, it
will result in substantial benefits to the country. If the project is not
carried out, operational standards would deteriorate. Maintenance and
operating costs would continue to rise as old and ill-maintained equipment
remains in service. Furthermore, since the growing backlog of traffic would
become intolerable, the BRC would have to resort to the uneconomic measure of
purchasing new equipment as an alternative to repairing out-of-service stock
with a useful remaining life span.
6.04      Thus, the economic benefits are calculated as differences in
costs between:
(a) costs without the proposed project - estimated increase
in maintenance and operating costs at the present level of
efficiency plus some investments required to cater for
expected increased traffic in the future; and



- 23 -
(b) estimated maintenance and operating costs with the
Proposed project.
All these costs are based on information supplied by the BRC, and they are
reasonahie.  The procurement and rehabilitation of diesel locomotives would
replace existing steam locomotives and this will generate substantial
economic benefits in the form of cost savings.  This is due mainly to lower
maintenance cost of diesels as compared to that of steam locomotives. Since
these benefits would constitute about 80% of the total benefits, the BRC's
appropriate action to retire a considerable number of steam locomotives wIll
be necessarv.  This Is discussed in detail in para 4.05.  Rehabilitation of
freight wagons and coaches would generate benefits in the form of maintenance
cost savings and of deferment of some rolling stock procurement. Rehabilita-
tion and expansion of workshops and sheds are mninly to cater for proper
maintenance work of diesel locomotives.  This will in turn imn rove avallabilitv
of diesel locomotives.
6.05      An assessment of the project as a whole shows that the total
economic benefits would yield an economic return of about 16% with the
first-year benefit ratio of 11%, which are satisfactory.  D etailed economic
return calculations dc shown in Annex 10.  Since benefits attributable to
any of the princ4-,- .:omponents would not fully materialize unless other
items of wor .  also carried out, the economic return has not been
calcul-c'- se ort-ely for each component of the project.  Not includedl in
these quan- . .iable benefits are savings in freight and passenger time,
savings caused by reducing inventories, and the increased reliability andl
quality of service.
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
items:
(a)  studies by experts covering improvements in the BRC's operations
(para 3.22), the need for doubling of track beyond Pyinmana
(para 4.04), and withdrawal of steam locomotives and further
dieselization (para 4.05);
(b)  terTs on which the Government will re-lend to the BRC the
proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit (para 5.09);
(c) implementation of the Investment Plan and limitation on
additional investment (para 5.11); and
(d) earning and debt service covenants (paras 5.14 and 5.15).
7.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of US$16.7 million to the Government of the Union of Burma.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Government Agencies Concerned with Transportation
I.   Ministries
1.        The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is responsible
for railway, port, civil aviation and inland water transport infrastructure
works. It sets basic transport policies and controls transport operations
for all modes including dockyards by (a) approving draft budgets of transport
agencies, (b) appointing officers of transport agencies, (c) setting tariff
policy and (d) enforcing regulations for the operation of the sector. It
carries out its activities through four Departments - Civil Aviation, Road
Transport Administration, Marine Administration, and Waterways - and exerts
control over the Burma Airways Corporation (BAC), the Road Transport
Corporation (RTC), the Burma Railways Corporation (BRC), the Inland Water
Transport Corporation (IWTC), the Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation (EFSC),
the Burma Ports Corporation (BPC), the Burma Dockyard Corporation (BDC) and
the Transport Agencies Corporation (TAC), through the coordinating Central
Corporation of Transport and Communications (CTCC).
2.        The Ministry of Construction (MOC) is responsible for the planning,
construction and maintenance of highways. It controls the Construction
Corporation which is in charge of construction and maintenance of highways.

BURMA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Description of Railway Property
Track and Structures
1.        The Burma Railways Corporation operates a system of 1,949 route
miles. The gauge is one meter. The most important sectior is from Rangoon
to Mandalav (385.5 miles) (see Map). The sections Rangoon to Pyinmana
(225 miles) and Mandalay to Myohaung (2.75 miles) are of double track. A
plan to complete the double track between Pyinmana and Myohaung (157.75
miles) is under consideration. Earth work on about 40 miles of this portion
and preliminary work on one major bridge is under execution.
2.        The metropolis of Rangoon is served by a double line circular
suburban railway system (28-1/2 miles) making use partly of the main lines
from Rangoon to Mandalay and Rangoon to Prome with a connecting link.
3.       iThe track on the main line, Rangoon to Mandalay, and part of
Lmportant branch lines (total 817.25 miles) is laid with 75 lb/yard rails
and the balance is laid with 60 or 50 lb/yard rails. The sleepers are
mostly of hard wood and partly of creosoted soft wood in sidings and unim-
portant branch lines. Bearing plates are not used. The sleeper density is
2,430/2,176 per mile on the main line and 2,220 per mile on other lines.
Ballast is of broken stone, 6 cu ft per foot run on the main line against the
specified theoretical quantity of 8.2 cu ft per foot run. Ballast on some
stretches of the section Pegu to Pyinmana is markedly deficient and the BRC
is considering measures to make good the deficiency. The ruling gradient
on the main line is 1 in 200 and varies between 1 in 200 and 1 in 300 on
the plains. The ruling gradient on the two hill sections, Mandalay - Lashio
and Tazi - Shwenyaung, is 1 in 25 with switch backs.  The maximum curvature
on the main line and on plain sections is 6 degrees and 17 degrees on the
hill sections. Tne permissible axle load, except for a few unimportant
branch lines, is 12 tons. The maximum permissible speed is 40 miles/hr on
the main line and 25 to 30 miles/hr on the branch lines. 59 miles of track
are welded in panels of 117 ft or 234 ft.  The -RC hopes to increase the
mileage of welded track gradually.  Svstematic maintenance of track is by
manual labor. Except for the sections where rail renewals are now proposed,
the standards are good.
4.        Bridges, which account for 1.35% of the line on the Mandalay-Rangoon
route and about 1.11% on the system taken as a whole, are generally well
maintained by departmental staff. The condition of other structures is
satisfactory.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Signalling and Telecommunications
5.        The signalling system at the 290 stations of the BRC varies depend-
ing on the density of traffic. On the mainline, Mandalay-Rangoon, 38 sta-
tions are provided with color light signals, route relay interlocking, with
points operated by electric motors. 36 stations have multiple aspect upper
quadrant semaphore signalling (of which 34 stations are operated with double
wire system).  Nine on the section are key interlocked with semaphore signalling.
The balance of 207 stations are mainly signalled with semaphore signals and
are mostly non-interlocked or key interlocked. The signalling and interlock-
ing system is maintained satisfactorily and is adequate for the density of
traffic and speeds obtaining.
6.        Communications between adjacent stations is by means of Morse
instrument connected by land lines. For each group of 4 or 5 stations, a
50-watt transceiver radio set serves as a means of communication amongst
themselves as also with the important stations. The main stations are con-
nected with each other through 200-watt radio transceivers.
7.        The train despatch and control is through high voltage DC pulsin-.
selective calling of stations. There are 8 control networks of which 4 are
located at Rangoon.
8.        The Block working of trains on double line sections is through
"Lock and Block"' instruments and frequency modulated carrier coded type of
Block instruments. On single lines, tablet-type token instruments are used.
Workshops and Maintenance Depots
9.        The BRC has main workshops at:
Insein    -  for repairs to stean locomotives and to the chassis
of diesel locomotives;
Rangoon   -  a diesel shed used as a repair shop for engines
and electrics of diesel locomotives;
Ywataung  -  a new diesel shop still to be fully equipped; and
Myitnge   -  coaching and freight car repair shop, with an
extension (still to be fully equipped) for aug-
menting the overhaul and indigenous manufacture
of passenger cars and freight cars.
Insein Shop
10.       The Insein workshop which overhauls steam locomotives is organized
on the belt system and is adequately equipped for repairs of steam locomotives.
The overhauling of the chassis of diesel locomotives is also carried out
here, pending transfer of all work on the diesel locomotives to the new shop



ANNEX 4
Page 3
under construction at Ywataung (near Mandalay). A foundry and smithshop
form part of the repair workshop. The workshop has a capacity for 60 unit
repairs of overhaul and 24 unit repairs of intermediate overhaul.
Rangoon Shop
11.       The diesel repair shop at Rangoon is a makeshift arrangement for
the overhaul of the engine part of diesel locomotives. This shop was origin-
ally built as a running shed for the few diesel locomotives procured by the BRC
in the initial stages of dieselization. The capacity of the shop now is
13 units per year of complete overhaul of engines and 42 units of intermediate
overhaul. The repairs to chassis and wheels are being done at Insein. Due
to limited capacity and also due to lack of spare parts, the Dercentage of
locomotives out of commission and overdue overhaul is abnormally high. 38
diesel locomotives are out of commission in a total fleet of 129 locomotives.
Ywataung Shop
12.       The Ywataung diesel shop, which is still to be fully equipped, is
undertaking partial work and when fully equipped will carnr out complete
overhaul of 60 diesel units and intermediate overhaul of 120 units a year.
The existing Mandalay diesel running shed is presently handling intermediate
overhauls of 8 units a year.
Myitn4e Shop
13.       The passenger and freight car repair shop at Myitnge (near M-andalay)
is a large workshop equipped for overhauling annually 2,522 units (four-
wheelers) of freight cars and 825 units (bogies) of passenger cars. It also
has annual capacity for the manufacture of 40 passenger cars (bogies) on
imported underframes and 120 (four-wheelers) or 60 bogie freight cars on
imported underframes. Due to lack of components and raw materials, the
repair of approximately 106 passenger cars and 2,000 freight cars (in terms
of four-wheelers) is in arrears, rendering them out of commission.
14.       The BRC is expanding Myitnge workshop by creating facilities in a
newly-built shed for the manufacture of 70 bogie passenger cars and 180 four-
wheeler or 90 bogie freight cars for normal replacements and marginal
additions. If need arises, the production of the workshops could be
increased to 110 bogie passenger cars and 280 four-wheeler or 140 bogie wagons
per annum by increasing the staff adequately. The expansion has not been
completed and some of the equipment (for instance, over-head crane) is yet
to be ordered. The new sheds will probably not be functioning fully for
another 18 months or so.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
15.       The details of the fleet of locomotives and rolling stock of the BRC,
with their ages, are given in Table 5. In brief, the holdings as of Septem-
ber 30, 1972, were:

/1   Includes inspection cars, dining cars, other coaching vehicles.
16.       In addition, the BRC has placed an order for 30 diesel locomotives, 16
of 950 HP and 14 of 1,600 HP (Alsthom-France), which are expected to be re-
ceived between October 1973 and June 1974.
17.       Out of the total of 274 steam locomotives, 151 are in poor condi-
tion; 38 mainline diesel locomotives (including 4 diesel sh4aters), out of
a total of 129 diesel locomotives, are out of commission due to lack of spare
parts and components. The BRC has acquired 23 sets of railcar u-nits (21 sets
of 3 coach units with 2 powered and 1 trailer and 2 sets of 2 powered) and 2
trailer cars between 1957 and 1962, for use on the Rangoon suburban section.
Only 10 sets are now in use. The BRC has floated a worl.d tender for the
supply of engines and components for recommissioning the disabled units to
be financed from the Government's own resources.
18.       A total of 268 coaches, out of a total of 1,206 (22.2%), are under
repair or awaiting repair. Out of those awaiting repair, 106 coaches need
hea'y repairs and components. Due to the scarcity of parts and components
these coaches have been laid aside resulting in the acute shortage of coaching
stock.
19.       The freight car holding of the BRC is 11,244 1/ in terms of four-
wheelers (2 axles) of which 1,624 are over 41 years old. About 2,000 wagons
1/   Includes 2,000 freight cars (four-wheelers) nominally ii service but
not in effective use pending repairs on receipt of imported components.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
are out of commission mainly due to lack of spare parts and components and
partly due to damages sustained in accidents. The BRC has plans for rehab-
ilitating them during a period of 2 years after receipt of components and
material.
Mlarshalling Yards
20.       The main goods marshalling yard is at Mahlwagon (near Rangoon),
handling about 750 freight cars a dav; the yard at Mandalay and the other
intermediate and terminal yards are adequte for the level of traffic expected
for some years to come. The freight cars awaiting repairs and stabled in
these vards, when cleared away, will release some of the yard lines and
improve thi mobility in the yards.

BURMA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Investment Plan - 1971/72 through 1974/75 - Main Items
1.   Construction of Double Line (7.2% of total expenditure)
By 1970, the BRC had restored the double track as it existed before
the Second World War between Rangoon and Kyungon (175.5 miles) but which
had been dismantled during the war. Since then the BRC has undertaken the
doubling beyond Kyungon as part of an over-all scheme of extending the
doubling right up to Mandalay. So far, further doubling has been completed
between Kyungon and Pyinmana and earthwork on about 40 miles beyond Pyinmana
and work on one major bridge are now proceeding. Pending a techno-economic
study by experts 1/ of the proposed doubling beyond Pyinmana, for assessing
the appropriate timing and possible alternative solutions, further work has
been suspended by the BRC. The Investment Plan provides for the expenditure
on doubling up to Pyinmana only. 2/
2.   Construction and Expansion of Workshops (12.5% of total expenditure)
Mi)       Construction of New Shop at Ywataung.  In order to provide adequate
overhaul and repair facilities to the growing fleet of diesel locomotives,
and for the manufacture of spare parts for rolling stock, the BRC is currently
constructing a workshop at Ywataung (near Mandalay). When completed, the
workshop will be able to overhaul and repair 60 diesel locomotives per year
which should meet the needs of the BRC for a number of years to come.
Although the civil works of the workshops are nearing completion, the work-
shops are yet to be equipped with the necessary machinery. On completion
of the workshop, the makeshift diesel locomotive repair work now being done
at Insein workshop (a steam loco repair shop) and at the Rangoon loco diesel
shed will be transferred to the Ywataung workshop. The Plan provides for the
setting up of this new and essential workshop. -
(ii)      Expansion of Workshop at Myitnge.  The workshop at Myitnge which
undertakes the overhaul, repairs and maintenance of passenger cars and
freight cars, as well as the construction of a limited number of passenger
1/   To be financed by the proposed IDA Credit.
2/   The traffic on the section Pyinmana-Mandalay at present is only 10 to
12 trains in each direction. Prospects of traffic reaching levels
beyond the capacity of single line are doubtful in the foreseeable
future.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
cars and freight cars on imported underframes, is to be expanded by the
construction of a new shed (3 bays, each 44 ft wide and 770 ft long). The
civil works have been nearly completed. The present annual capacity for
overhaul and maintenance in this workshop is limited to 825 units of four-
wheelers (413 bogies) of passenger cars and 2,522 units of four-wheeler
freight cars. This capacity is inadequate and maintenance has fallen into
arrears. The annual repair capacity required is for 3,000 units of freight
cars and 1,000 units (500 bogies) of passenger cars. By reorganizing the
repair and manufacturing activity in the expanded shops, there would be
adequate capacity for annual repairs of freight cars and annual replacement
and repairs of passenger cars. The cost of repairs and manufacture in
Myitnge workshop is reasonable and economical. Full capacity of the
expansion is expected to be achieved in 1974/75.
3.   Bridge, Rail, Sleeper and Ballast Renewals and Other Minor Works
(19.3% of total expenditure)
This item of the Plan covers the cost of bridge repairs and rehab-
ilitation, rail, ballast and sleeper spot renewals (annual), minor civil
works such as extension to sidings and yard lines, minor improvements to
signalling arrangements, improvement to civil engineering workshops and
purchase of a track aligning machine, construction plant and equipment such
as compressors, welding sets, motor trollies, etc. It also provides for
continuous renewal of 126 miles of 60 lb per yard rails with 75 lb per yard
rail over a period of three years; 223 miles of the 60 lb rails are 56 years
old, and were badly maintained during the Second World War. They have holes
drilled through the foot and are spiked to the sleepers to prevent creep,
which was an unsafe measure resorted to during the war. About 103 miles of
the rails to be replaced are badly worn and some are corrugated on the head.
4.   Procurement of Freight Cars (4.1% of total expenditure)
A total of 1,471 freight cars (in four-wheeler units) are over
40 years old. The BRC will retire about 1,320 cars by 1974/75. About 2,000
(four-wheeler) serviceable freight cars now out of service awaiting spare
parts and components are due to be rehabilitated. By effecting an improve-
ment in the percentage of cars under or awaiting repair, from the present
31% to 5%, the traffic expected by 1974/75 could be catered for through
the acquisition of 294 freight cars (in four-wheeler units) or 147 bogie
cars made up of 73 bogie high-sided open cars, 50 timber cars and 24 bogie
tank cars. Of these, the Plan provides for the manufacture by the BRC of 18
high-sided cars and 19 tank cars during 1971/72 and 1972/73. The balance
of 55 open bogie high-sided freight cars, 50 bogie timber cars, and 5 bogie
tank cars will be procured through part assembly and manufacture by the BRC
in the Railway workshop in 1973/74 and 1974/75. The Plan also includes the
procurement of 13 bogie brake vans during 1971/72 and 1972/73.
5.   Procurement of Passenger Cars (7.7% of total expenditure)
The Plan provides for the procurement through manufacture on imported
underframes, of 135 ordinary class passenger cars in the Railway workshop. Of



ANNEX 7
Page 3
these, 34 cars were placed on line in 1971/72. A further 40 cars are programmed
for construction on reclaimed underframes during 1972/73. The balance of 61
cars will be constructed with imported underframes and components. These
cars, together with the 106 cars now not in service but which will be rehab-
ilitated, will cater not only to the modest increase in passenger traffic
expected by 1974/75, but will essentially reduce, to some extent, the excess-
ive overcrowding now prevailing on the Burma railways. An increased utiliza-
tion from the present 123 miles to 130 miles per vehicle-day and improved
availability from 74% to 88% is expected to be achieved by 1974/75. On the
basis of available seat-miles (after allowing for improvements in utilization
of passenger cars), it is reckoned that occupancy ratio could be reduced,
although inadequately, from the present 105% to 90%.
6.   Procurement of Diesel Locomotives (32.5% of total expenditure)
Twenty-three diesel locomotives have been delivered and the BRC
has placed an order for a further supply of 16 Nos. 950-hp and 14 Nos. 1,600-hp
diesel locomotives by Alsthom of France. The delivery is expected to commence
in October 1973 and to be completed by June 1974. With the rehabilitation
of 38 existing diesel locomotives, the number of locomotives in service will
be substantial and should result in a big step towards complete dieselization
of traction through the retirement of a significant number (see Annex 5) of
steam locomotives. Early completion of dieselization calls for a study by
experts 1/ of the extent and further phasing of withdrawals of steam
locomotives from service.
7.   Procurement of Diesel Breakdown Cranes (1.9% of total expenditure)
In order to restore traffic as quickly as possible after an
accident, efficient breakdown cranes are necessary. To replace old (2 beyond
repair and 2 built in 1929) and inefficient steam cranes of 30 and 35 ton
capacity, the Plan provides for the purchase of 4 diesel breakdown cranes
of 45-ton capacity.
8.   Improvement in Repair Facilities in Shops and Depots (Sheds) (1.1% of
total expenditure)
Some of the equipment in the existing workshops is old and inade-
quate to ensure proper overhaul of rolling stock. The BRC proposes to replace
a minimum number of machines and procure additional machine tools to improve
the quantity and quality of work in these workshops. The repair sheds and
depots for locomotive, passenger and freight cars also need equipment like
compressors, pneumatic tools, oxy-acetelene cutters, and a few machine tools
to improve the quality and out-turn of maintenance work.
1/   To be financed by the proposed IDA Credit.



ANNEX 7

9.   Rehabilitation of Rolling Stock (5.0% of total expenditure)
Lack of spare parts, components and imported material due to paucity
of foreign exchange and, to some extent, inadequate repair facilities have
resulted in a large percentage of rolling stock (freight and passenger cars)
being immobilized. The Plan provides for the rehabilitation of 106 passenger
cars and 2,001 freight cars and also for improvement in the standards of
repairs and maintenance by overtaking the backlog of replacements for defect-
ive components.
13.  Rehabilitation of Diesel Locomotives and Rail Cars (5.0% of total
expenditure)
Due to lack of spare parts, components and imported material, the
maintenance of locomotives has suffered over a number of years. The percent-
age of locomotives out of service, under repair or awaiting repairs is
abnormally high. The low number of miles achieved between engine failures
(about 30,000 miles) reflects the poor state of maintenance mainly due to
lack of adequate spare parts. The Plan provides for the procurement of
spare parts and components required for the rehabilitation of 38 diesel
locomotives now out of service and for eliminating the backlog of parts
replacement work to be undertaken.

BURMA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Economic Return Calculation
A.   Cost Enumeration
Cost of the Project
1.        Table 1 of this Annex shows the annual cost of the project in
local currency and foreign exchange for the major items. Local costs do
not include custom duties, ranging from 10% to 20% of import prices, as
they are considered transfer payments. Thus, local costs consist of those
associated with labor and local procurement of spares and materials.
Operating Costs With the Project
2.        Table 2 of this Annex shows maintenance and operating costs of
motive power, e.g., steam, and existing, rehabilitated and new diesel
locomotives. It is assumed that a total of 106 steam locomotives will be
retired from service during the period 1973/74 - 1976/77 as 30 new and 38
rehabilitated diesel locomotives will be put in service. By 1981/82, the
share of steam locomotive costs for maintenance and operation out of the
total motive power costs will be about 48% as against 74% in 1971/72. The
maintenance and operating cost of steam locomotives would be lowered to
about K 18 million in 1976/77 and would increase by about 4% per annum to
about K 22 million in 1981/82; maintenance costs of existing diesel locomo-
tives are assumed to increase on average by about 4%, reaching about K 15
million in 1981/82; maintenance costs of new and rehabilitated diesel loco-
motives are assumed to increase at ratios lower than those of existing diesel
locomotives. Table 2 also shows maintenance costs of wagons and passenger
coaches. The rate of increase in these costs is assumed to be 2% per annum,
taking into account (a) acquisition of new rolling stock (110 wagons and
61 passenger coaches); (b) rehabilitation of rolling stock (2,001 wagons
and 106 passenger coaches); and (c) rehabilitation of maintenance equipment.
Foreign exchange costs are for imported materials, and local costs are for
labor and materials to be procured domestically.
Costs Without the Project
3.        In the "without the project" case, the situation is assumed to
be as follows: (i) the BRC would be able to carry the present level of traffic
with the presently available locomotives and rolling stock but at increasing
costs of maintenance; (ii) the BRC's operational efficiency would be the same
as at present; (iii) the BRC would have to import some wagons and coaches to
cater for additional traffic. Table 3 to this Annex shows the costs of
maintenance and operating costs of existing steam locomotives and diesels.



AM'EX 10
Page 2
Steam locomotive costs would rise due to an increase in maintenance costs in
the first five years of 7% per annum and the second five years of 10% per
annum and in operating costs of 2% per annum; the costs of existing diesels
would rise bv 4%7 per annum for the first five years and by 5% per annum for
the second five years. The table also shows maintenance costs of wagons and
passenger coaches and the required investment in the procurement of rolling
stock in order to accommodate additional traffic. The maintenance cost would
increase by 7% per annum for the first five years and 10% for later years;
investment costs are calculated on the basis of the present level of effi-
ciency and expected additional traffic.
B.   Benefits Analysis
4.        Benefits in the form of cost savings as shown below mainly result
from the replacement of over-aged steam locomotives by 30 new and 38 rehabi-
litated diesel locomotives:

1975/76         7.38      9.34      12.04    11.17      19.42    20.41
1976/77         16.89    10.96       8.21     7.09      25.10    18.05
1977/78        20.91    11.29        8.81     7.15      29.72    18.44
1978/79        21.73    11.54        6.60     4.54      28.33    16.08
1979/80        22.51    11.84        6.78     5.26      29.29    17.00
1980/81         23.74    11.25       7.46     4.82      31.20    16.07
1981/82        24.93    12.72        5.33     1.96      30.26    14.68
-           24.93    12.72        5.33     1.96      30.26    14.68
1992/93        24.93    12.72        5.33     1.96      30.26    14.68
After completion of the project, the importance of benefits related to the
introduction of 68 diesel locomotives would increase (by 76% in 1978/79
and 82% in 1981/82). During the initial three years, the influence of the
procurement of rolling stock on savings is quite large, but it would become
smaller in later years. Savings in foreign exchange show a similar trend.
The benefits described above do not include those associated with investment
in track, ballast, bridges, etc. Those would certainly generate considerable
benefits in the form of avoiding accidents and speed restrictions. To that
extent, the benefits are understated.

C.   Economic Return Calculation
5.        Based on an economic life of the project of 20 years, including
the execution period and the benefits and project costs shmn below, the
project would yield an estimated economic return of 15.5%; the first year
benefit return would be about 11%.  These returns are satisfactory.
Project Cost          Benefits           Net Benefits
Total     F.E.      Total      F.E.      Total      F.E.

1974/75         63.90    45.27      19.91    13.84   - 43.99   -31.43
1975/76          1.88      1.13     19.42    20.41       17.54    19.28
1976/77                             25.10    18.05       25.10    18.05
1977/78                             29.72    18.44       29.72    18.44
1978/79                              28.33    16.08      28.33    16.08
1979/80                             29.29    17.00       29.29    17.00
1980/81                             31.20    16.07       31.20    16.07
1981/82                             30.26    14.68       30.26    14.68
-                                30.26    14.68       30.26    14.68
1992/93                              30.26    14.68      30.26    14.68
The estimated economic return would vary, depending upon alternative assump-
tions for major variables in the analysis. Assuming that the economic cost
increases by 10% (taking into account the possible over-value of Kyats
currency in terms of dollars), the economic return would be similar to the
estimated one because the major economic benefits are in the form of for-
eign exchange; if the benefits are 10% less than estimated, the economic
return would be about 13.5%. However, if the traffic volumes materialize
faster than estimated (from 1981/82, traffic levels are assumed to remain
constant), the economic return would be substantially higher than the 15.5%
shown above.

The above statement is intended to indicate the potential savings in staff
costs. While it may not be possible to achieve all the above potential
savings in staff costs, any other costs reductions or tariff increases
which might be required would be quite small.

strength is 25,000.
