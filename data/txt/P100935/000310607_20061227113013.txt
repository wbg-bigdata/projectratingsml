                             A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryand Sector Issues

1. Avian inJuenza: Outbreaks o fhighlypathogenic avianinfluenza (HPAI)causedbythe H5N1
    subtype o f influenza "A" were first recognized in Hong Kong in 1997. Since late 2003, this
    subtype has been spreading at an alarming rate, from East Asia to Central Asia, and now to
    the Middle East, Europe, Afnca, and South Asia. In addition to its impact on animal health,
    with millions o f domestic poultry having died or been destroyed worldwide, H5N1 has been
    causing severe human disease. Of the known 258 humans with confirmed HPAI as o f
    November 2006, most (154) have died. The rapidly expanding area inwhich HPAI has been
    discovered and the escalating number o f human infections have raised concerns worldwide
    over the possible evolution o f the next influenza pandemic and its disastrous consequences.'

2. Afghanistan 's risk status: As a result o f a quarter-century o f devastating civil stnfe andhalf a
    decade o f senous drought, Afghanistan has some o f the poorest social, economic and health
    indicators in the world with high susceptibility to communicable diseases. Inadequate
    facilities and capacities to detect, control, contain and mitigate an outbreak o f commucable
    disease have made this country highly vulnerable. 26 confirmed cases o f H5N1 virus in
    sampled chicken in 4 provinces have been reported since testing started inMarch 2006. The
    virus - which was first diagnosed in the province o f Nangahar - appeared to be spreading
    fast, with infection occumng in five new provinces in close succession (Kabul, Laghman,
    Logar, Parwan and Kapisa). However, since bird migration stopped inMay, there have been
    no further outbreaks o f AHID in Afghmstan. Bird migration will normally restart by
    October andpreparedness will beparticularly important dunngthe following six months.

3. National Preparedness Plan. In March 2006, an inter-sectoral Task Force prepares a
    National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan
     (ANIPPRP) formally endorsed by the Government o f Afghanistan (GOA).' After prepanng
    the plan, the Government requested the World Bank assistance to finance the Plan. The
    ANIPPRP provides a strong basis on w h c h to detect and combat possible outbreaks, and
     outlines the institutional mechmsms for doing so. The plan i s candid about what capacity
     and resource constraints exist. The ANIPPRP was later supplemented with an Operational
     Plan, which formed the basis for the World Bank appraisal.


' Avian  influenza (also called avian flu or bud flu) refers to a group of differentinfluenzaviruses that primarily
affect birds.An influenzapandemchappens when a new subtype emergesthat has notpreviously cuculatedm
humans.IfH5N1adapts mto a straln that is contagious amonghumans, it will no longer be a budvms but a human
influenzavirus.
* A National Avian Influenza Comrmttee (NAIC) was established as soon as the Mimster MA1 confirmed the
existence HPAI (H5N1). Membership of NAIC mcludes MAI, Mimstry of Public Health (MOPH), Mitllstry o f
Commerce (MOC), Ministry of Finance (MOF, and the Mimstry of Envuonmental Protection (MEP),
representativesof concerneddonors and implementingorgarmations suchas FAO, USAID, USDA, EU, ADB, WB,
WHO and UNICEF



                                                             3

4. Recent actions taken: Under the Plan the Mimstry o f Agnculture and h g a t i o n (MAI)
   adopted a policy o f slaughtenng birds in the vicinity o f all proven outbreaks o f H5N1 and
   payment o f compensation to farmers concerned. This policy was initiated under the FA0
   supported Avian Influenza Response Project ( A m ) and, as a result o f the 26 diagnosed
   cases, about thirty thousand birds were slaughtered. Since then, eight regional emergency
   centers have been established for handlingavian influenza (AI) (Kabul, Nangahar, Kandahar,
   Herat, Bamayan, Balkh Kunduz and Ghazni). Intensive training has been provided to
   provincial vetennary directors and training courses on AI awareness have been organized for
   285 vetennanans. h t i a l supplies o f equipment, protective clothing and flu detector antigen
   have been distributed and a surveillance program has been initiated based on 2 percent
   monthly samplingo fpoultry flocks in each regonal center.

5. Status ofthe Animal HeaZth Services: The Department o f Vetennary Services (DVS) i s a part
   o f MA1 and is headed by the Director o f Vetennary Services/Chief Vetennary Officer
   (CVO). The MA1vetennary service i s poorly equipped and has no budget for addressing
   regulatory and public-good functions related to animal health, including trans-boundary
   disease control, zoonotic disease control, disease surveillance, food safety, and quality
   control o f vaccines and medicines. Transport and telecommunications are weak and there i s
   no organized disease-information system. There are insufficient graduate vetennanans for
   providing an effective presence inall provinces o f the country; salanes for MA1vetennanans
   are extremely low and sometimes delayed.

6. Status ofthe Public HeaZthcare Services: Until the end o f 2003, the performance o f the
   public health system was poor. Since the beginning o f 2004, there appears to have been a
   large increase in service delivery, about 90 percent o f it provided by NGOs. A rudimentary
   disease surveillance systembased on a Health Management Information System (HMIS) and
   reports from vertical programs such as tuberculosis and vaccine-preventable childhood
   diseases exists in Afghanistan. However, the quality and completeness are vanable and
   utilizing this system for avian and pandemic influenza surveillance would be unreliable, due
   to weak data accuracy. The best functioning disease surveillance system in Afghanistan i s
   the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)/poliomyelitis system.         It is supported by WHO in
   collaboration with the MOPH. This system has an extensive grass-roots infrastructure
   throughout Afghanistan, has timely reporting, i s coupled with specimen collection and rapid
   shipment, and has a ngorous response component. Rapid response teams that conduct case or
   outbreak investigations are present in each province.        As needed, these teams can be
   supplemented by national level personnel.      Some training o f personnel on these teams
   regarding avian influenza (including specimen collection) has been conducted, but their
   ability and capacity to adequately respond i s largely untested and they have limited
   equipment and transport.

7 Diagnostic Capacity - Animal Health: Diagnostic capacity for animal health i s very limited
   but several efforts are under way with funding and technical assistance from European
   Commission (EC), UnitedStates Department o f Agnculture (USDA), and Japan International
   Cooperation Agency (JICA). FA0 initiated a trans-boundary disease-surveillance program in
   Afghanistan, which i s part o f broader regional efforts in Central and South Asia. The
   program established an enzym-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) test laboratory At the
   same time, the third US naval medical research unit (NAMRU-3) has provided the MA1



                                                4

   laboratory in Kabul with real-time reverse transcnptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-
  PCR) equipment to screen samples for Avian Influenza. The FA0 laboratory provides the
   necessary HPAI diagnostic services through the following diagnostic tests: (i)   RRT-PCR for
   identification o f H5, (ii)ELISA for antibodies against type A, (iii)HI3for detection o f
   antibodies against H 7 andH9, and (iv) AGID4test for antibodies against H 7 andH9.

8. Dzagnostic Capacity - Human Health: Laboratory diagnostic capacity for human health in
   Afghmstan i s very limited. Under the BPHS, no lab services are offered at health posts or
   BHCs. CHCs and distnct hospitals offer basic hematology, unnalysis, and biochemical
   assays. They are able to perform gram stains for bactenology and acid fast smears for
   tuberculosis. However, more advanced health care facilities are unable to perform
   microbiologic cultures, and instead rely on gram stains and smears. As a result, most
   infectious diseases diagnoses are based on clinical impression, although serologic diagnosis
   through blood collection is performed for some diseases. For influenza, FA0 has established
   diagnostic capacity in the vetennary diagnostic laboratory o f the Ministry o f Agnculture.
   Arrangements are inplace for this facility to test human specimens when necessary There
   are also arrangements to refer specimens to the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office
   (EMRO) o f WHO and the collaborating laboratory o f the U.S. Naval Medical Research Urut
   (NAMRU)No. 3 in Cairo. NAMRU-3 is inthe process o f developing virology capacity in
   the Central Laboratory o f the Ministry of Public Health, including influenza facility
   renovation, RT-PCR diagnostics and virus isolation.

2. Rationale for IDA involvement

9  Bank involvement i s justified by the global public good aspect o f the HPAI, one of many
   emerging and re-emerging transboundary zoonoses. A human flu pandemic could cause
   significant increases in poverty in developing countnes. To be effective, the response
   requires coordination across countnes and agencies at the international and regional levels
   and close intra-ministry coordination in each participating county. Inmost instances it also
   requires substantial financial resources. The Bank i s well placed to work inthis environment,
   in partnership with international technical agencies, other multilateral agencies and donor
   countnes.

10.The Bank has endorsed the FAO/OIE Global Strategy to minimize the global threat and nsk
   o f HPAI in domestic poultry and humans through progressive control and eradication o f
   HPAI, particularly that caused by H5N1 virus from terrestnal domestic poultry Furthermore
   the Bank, in collaboration with the EU, WHO, FAO, OIE and bilateral donors, has
   established a multi-donor trust fund for Avian and Human Influenza (AHITF) that pnmarily
   supports country level activities in conjunction with a smaller and complementary role at the
   regional and global levels. National level activities for progressive control and eradication o f
   the HPAI are a fundamental buildingblock to global eradication. The Bank has been working
   with national governments, FAO, OIE, WHO, EU, other partners and bi-and multilateral
   agencies inthe preparationo fNational AI Preparedness Plan and strategies.

11.The HPAI control and eradication programs are complex and require a multi-disciplinary
   approach to integrate technical, social, economic, political and regulatory issues. The Bank i s
   well placed to draw on its vast expenence throughout the world in multi disciplinary
   approaches to tackle similar emergency preparedness, nsk-mitigation and other projects and
   programs requinng multi-disciplinary approaches. In addition, the Bank has comparative
    advantage in having swift access to its own financial resources to support emergency
   preparedness and response projects. The Bank is an active member o f the NAIS and has
   demonstrated its capability to bnngtogether relevant and important national and international
   institutions in support o f a national preparedness plan. The Bank, recognizing the importance
    o f the poultry sector, has included a component for semi-intensive poultry production in the
   recently approved Horticulture and Livestock Project (P098256, HLP).


                                    B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. ProjectDevelopmentObjective

12. The overall objective o f the Project i s to mimmize the threat posed by HPAI to humans in
    Afghanistan by controlling such infections among birds, especially domestic poultry, and
   prepanng for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an
    influenza epidemic and related emergencies. Though the objective is specific to HPAI, the
    interventions are expected to contribute to the control o f other zoonotic diseases and other
   types o f infectious diseases, interms o fbuildingoverall response capacity

13. This objective will be achieved through three types of interventions: (i)prevention; (ii)
    preparedness and planning; and (iii)  response and containment. Ifthese types o f interventions
    achieve their goals, the proposed project will reduce the burden o f disease in animal and the
    consequent economic losses. It will also lower the nsk o f human infection and the loss o f
    productivity attributable to human infections in Afghanistan. Finally, it would limit the nsk
    of HPAI inother countnes.

14. At the end o f the project it i s expected that (i)
                                                      the capacity o f the agencies involved in AI
    containment, control andmitigationwill have significantly improved, (ii) threat to human
                                                                               the
    health in the high nsks provinces o f Afghanistan will have been substantially reduced, and

2. FinancialInstrument

15 The project will be implemented over three years for a total cost o f US$ 13 million. IDA will
    finance US$8 million and the Avian and HumanInfluenza Trust Fund (AHITF) will finance
    US$5.0 million.

16. The IDA Grant is proposed under the Global Program for Avian Influenza and Human
    Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI, approved by the Board on January 12, 2006).
    Under the GPAI framework, all new IDA financing preparedwill follow APL procedures for




                                                  6

    follow-on operations.' GPAI operations are also processed as emergency and recovery
    operations (ERLs) under OPBP 8.50.

17 AHITF cofinancing i s expected to be made available within six months from effectiveness of
    the proposed IDA Grantunder the same applicable Bankpolicies, practices, andstandards.6

3. Project Components

18. The project will finance activities under four components: (i)                Ammal Health, (ii)      Human
    Health, (iii)    Communications and Public Awareness, and (iv) Institutional Coordination and
    Project Management.

Animal Health KJS$6.2 million)

19 Under the responsibility o f the Animal and Plant Health Department of the Ministry of
    Agnculture and Imgation, this component will support a national program to develop and
    implement HPAIprevention, containment, control, and eradication activities inthe livestock
    sector o f Afghanistan creating an effective system for improved bird health surveillance,
    diagnostic analysis and disease control inaccordance with FAO/OIE standards.

HumanHealth (US$ 3.4 Million)

20. Under the direction o f the Ministryo f Public Health (MOPH), this component will support a
    national program o f activities to prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate the impact of human
    illness caused by avian or pandemic influenza. Component activities will involve emergency
    and long-term developments to address pnonty gaps in disease surveillance, control and
    treatment. It would also contribute to MOPH's ongoing program for re-establishing public
    health capacity that was destroyed dunngdecades o f conflict.

Communication And Public Awareness WS$1.4 million)

2 1 Under the coordination o f the commumcations specialist based at the AI Secretanat, and with
     the advise and technical assistance o f the Communications Task-Team (including donors,
     and NGOs), the communications component will finance baseline research, design, test and
     implementation of a comprehensive and integrated communications strategy, to: (i)elevate
    public awareness and promote behavior-change among at-nsk and vulnerable populations, to
     control the spread of the virus; (ii)provide visibility to the multisectoral response, and
     generate a sense o f transparency and trust; (iii)maintain high-level political engagement
     dunng the different pandemic phases; and (iv) build upon the available communications
     infrastructure o f vanous ministnes and stakeholders, to foster an "enabling environment,"


5The GPAI's is available to countries demonstrating that they have (i)national strategic plan; (ii)
                                                                       a                         nahonal

                   an
civil society; and (iv) a clearly defined momtoring and evaluation system. The preparationteam considers that these
criteria have been satisfied.
 Inpartnership with the EU, WHO, FAO, OIE and bilateral donors the World Bank has established a multi-donor
Trust Fund for Avian and Human Influenza (AHITF) that prmrily supports country level activities in conjunction
with a smaller and complementary role at the regional and global levels.

    operating expenditures for coordinatinglmanaging project implementation.

Physical and Pnce Contingencies (uS$655,000)


                                      C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

23. InMarch 2006 as soon as the Ministry o f Agnculture and Imgation confirmed the existence
    o f H P A I in the country, an inter-sectoral task force was established to prepare a National
    Avian Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (NAIPPRP). The task force
    included representatives form Ministry o f Agnculture and Imgation (MAI), Ministry o f
    Public Health (MOPH), Ministry o f Commerce (MOC), Ministry o f Finance (MOF), and
    National Agency for Environmental Protection (NEPA), representatives o f concerned donors
    and implementing organizations such as FAO, USAID, USDA, EU, ADB, WB, WHO and
    UNICEF The preparedness plan has now been finalized and it provides the basis for the
    proposed project.

2. InstitutionalArrangements

24. Institutional arrangements are already in place and organized at central and field levels.
    They are consistent with GPAIstandards inother countnes.

Central Level

25 The main coordination entity for AI policies, strategy and action plans is the National AI
    Committee (NAIC) established in March 2006 under an inter-ministenal Cabinet level
    National Emergency Response Committee (NERC). While the purpose o f the NERC is to
    address country-wide coordination for any emergency, the N A I C focuses specifically on AI
    control and mitigation in the event o f a major outbreak. Headed by the Minster of
    Agnculture, the N A I C includes MOPH, Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD),
    Intenor (MOI), andMOC, as well as NEPA.




                                                   8

26. The NAIC is advised by a Techmcal Committee chaired by the Director o f Vetennary
   Services o f MA1 w h c h provides overall t e c h c a l knowledge and shares data and
    information on AI. The Technical Committee is composed by representative o f the t e c h c a l
   departmento f the interested government agencies. WHO, UNICEF,FAO, US Department of
   Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (HHSKDC),
    several non-govekental organizations, World Bank, European Commission, DFID and
   USAID are also participating members.

27 By the same token a Financial Committee chaired by the Deputy Minister ofFinance advises
   NAIC on financial and budget issues related to AI activities, including annual budget
    allocations, coordinates and alignment o f donor resources, and cash flow projections.

Field Level

28. Provincial AI Committees (PAICs) chaired by the Provincial Governor, coordinate and
    manage AI activities in the respective provinces. Members o f the PAIC include provincial
   representatives o f MA1 (Vetennary Services Division), Department o f Public Health,
   Municipality, the Police Department, the border police (where relevant), MRRD and NEPA.
    The technical members o f the PAIC will ensure that implementation o f the vanous
    components o f the project are in accordance with the stipulated standards, norms, rules and
    regulations - not only technical but also social and cultural. The implementation at field
    level will be the responsibility o f the provincial and distnct level public health staff and
    vetennary staff with assistance from the staff o f WHO, FAO, UNICEF, other multi- or bi-
    lateral support agencies, Vetennary Field Units (VFU), Afghan Vetennary Association
    (AVA) andlocalNGOs.

3. ImplementationArrangements

29 Overall and ultimate responsibility for project execution, successful implementation,
    accountability and outcomes will be with a newly established National Influenza Secretanat
    (NAIS), hosted inthe General Department for Policy and Planning ofthe MA1and integrated
    with an ImplementationSupport Team (ET) financed by the project and composed o f locally
    and internationally recruited specialists.

30. The IST will include an overall Project Coordinator, an Animal Health Coordinator, a
    Human Health Coordinator, a Communications Coordinator, a Monitonng and Evaluation
    specialist, a GIS specialist, two Financial Management Specialists, two Procurement
    Specialists, and one Safeguard specialist. Most o f the IST will be physically located in the
    General Department for Policy and Planning (GDPP) of the MAI, while the Human Health
    Coordinator, Procurement Specialist, and Financial Management Specialist under the Human
    Health component will be based in the Directorate o f Afghan Public Health Institute (APHI)
    o f the MOPH. Inaddition, the NAIS will include limited supported staff.

31. The Project Coordinator will be nationally recruited and will report to the NAIS through the

32. Activities under the Animal Health Component will be organized and supervised by an
    Animal Health Coordinator, who for technical fhctions            o f the project will work in
    collaboration with the Director o f the Animal and Plant Health Department, MAI. Under the
    responsibility o f the Animal Health Coordinator, the implementation o f the component will
    be contracted to an implementing partner, which is expected to be FA0             -  subject to
    agreement on the technical and financial terms and conditions, and acceptance of the Bank
    standardclauses on fraud, corruption and external audit, Draft TORs for the Animal Health
    Coordinator have been completed. Draft TORs for the hinngo f FA0 at an estimated cost of
    $560,000 have been agreed at appraisal for the first year.

33. Activities under the Human Health Component will be organized and supervised by the
    Human Health Coordinator, who for technical functions o f the project will work in
    collaboration with the relevant components o f the MOPH. The activities under the
    component will be outsourced to implementing partners, expected to be WHO and UNICEF,
    subject to agreement on the t e c h c a l and financial terms and conditions, and acceptance o f
    the Bank standard clauses on fraud, corruption and external audit. Draft TORs for the hiring
    o f WHO at an estimated cost o f $260,000 and UNICEF at $310,300 have been agreed at
    appraisal.

34. Activities under the Commumcations and Public Awareness Component will be coordinated
    and supervised by a Communications Coordinator, supported by the Communications Task-
    Team, and a short-term international consultant. Communication activities will implemented
    mostly through a vanety o f partners and stakeholders, including the agncultural extension
    and health education teams o f the MA1and MOPH, the communications infrastructure of the
   National Solidanty Program and Ministry o f Education, NGOs working with media and
    community-radio, as well as UNICEF, if agreement on the technical and financial terms and
    conditions i s reached, and subject to acceptance o f the Bank standard clauses on fraud,
    corruption and external audit. TORs for the hinng o f technical assistance and the
    implementation o f activities under the component at an estimated cost o f $350,000 have been
    agreed at appraisal.

4. FinancialManagement,DisbursementandAudit Arrangements

35 Financial Management o f the Project will be coordinated by two Financial Managers of the
    IST, one for the MA1and one for the MOHP. A PFM performance rating system has been
    recently developed for Afghanistah by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
    (PEFA) multi-agency partnership program, which includes the World Bank, IMF, EC, and
    other agencies. Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM performance indicators portray a
    public sector where financial resources are, by and large, being used for their intended
    purposes as authonzed by a budget that i s processed with transparency and has contributed to
   ,aggregate fiscal discipline.

36. The facilities o f the agents contracted under the Public Administration Capacity Building
    project (PACBP) will venfy the operation and help to strengthenthe fiduciary measures put
    in place for ensunng transparency and accountability o f funds provided by the Bank and
    other donors. Two advisers-Financial           Management and Audit-are       contracted under
    PACBP to work with line ministnes to carry out these core functions.             The Financial

   Management Agent (FMA) i s responsible for helpingthe MOF maintain the accounts for all
   public expenditures, including IDA-financed projects and for building capacity withn the
    government offices for these functions. Quarterly Financial Momtonng Reports will be
   prepared by MA1and MOPH accounting units. Consolidatedproject reports will be prepared,
   reviewed, and approved by the MOF, supported by the FMA.

37. A Designated Account (DA), with an initial deposit o f US$500,000, will be opened at D a
    AfghanistanBank (DAB, Central Bank) in the name o f the project on terms and conditions
    satisfactory to IDA. The DA will be maintained by the MOF Withdrawal applications for
    replenishment will be submitted monthly Financial management arrangements for the
    project are detailed inAppendix 7

FundFlows

38. Fund management for the Project will follow existing procedures for IDA financed
    operations. As with all public expenditure, all payments under the project will be routed
    through MOF. The FM Agent will assist the MOF in executing and recording project
    payments. Inkeepingwith current practices for other projects inAfghanistan, the DA will be
    operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in the Treasury Department o f MOF.
    Requests for payments from DA fimds will be made to the SDU by the relevant
    implementing entities. In addition to payments from DA funds, the implementing entities
    can also request the SDU to make direct'payments to consultants or consulting firms, and
    special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit. Such requests will follow
    World Bank procedures.      All withdrawal applications to IDA, including replemshment,
    reimbursement,and direct payment applications, will beprepared andsubmittedbyMOF

Accounting and Reporting

39 The FM Manual developed and approved for the Horticulture and Livestock Project
    (P098256, HLP implemented by the MAI) will be applicable for this project at the MA1
    level. The Financial Management Manual outlines guidelines for project activities, and
    establishes a project financial management system in accordance with standard Afghan
    government policies and procedures. This includes use o f the Chart of Accounts developed
    by the FMA to record project expenditure. Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in
    MOF, through the SDU and supported by the FMA. Consolidated Project Financial
    Statements will be preparedfor all sources and uses o fproject expenditures.

DisbursementMethod

40. Disbursements from the IDA grant will be made in accordance with the Bank's
    Disbursement Guidelines for Projects (May 2006) and Disbursement Handbook for World
    Bank Clients. The client may request reimbursement,.direct payment, and payments under
    Special Commitments including full documentation (submission o f records) or against
    statements o fexpenditures, as appropnate.

Retroactive Financing

41. Provision has been made to reimburse GOA for payments it makes for project expenditures,
    upto US$ 1,000,000 between 15 June 2006 and signingo fthe grant.

Audit ofProiect Funds

42. The Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, is responsible for auditing the accounts
    o f all IDA-financed projects. Annual audited project financial statements will be submitted
    within six months o fthe close o f GOA's fiscal year.

5. ProcurementArrangements:

43. Procurement for the Project will be c m e d out by two procurement specialists. One
    procurement specialist will operate inthe MAI, and will be incharge o f procurement related
    to the Atllmal Health, Communications,          and Management components. A second
   procurement specialist will operate in the MOPH and procure goods and services under the
    HumanHealthcomponent.

44. Procurement will be in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under
    IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (dated May 2004); "Guidelines: Selection and Employment
    of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (dated May 2004); and the provisions stipulated
    in the Development Grant Agreement. The Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments, Requests
    for   Proposals,  and Forms o f Consultant         Contract will be used.      In case    o f
    conflict/contradiction between the Bank's procurement procedures and any national rules and
    regulations, the Bank's procurement procedures will take precedence. The summary o f the
    procurement capacity assessment of the implementing agencies and precise arrangements are
    presented inAppendix 6.

6. MonitoringandEvaluationof Outcomes/Results

45 The M&E activities will be coordinated by an M&E specialist who will ensure data
    collection, and timely reporting and dissemination o f information. Details of a proposed
    M&E are presented in`Appendix 9, which incorporates good practices form other GPAI
    project and lessons learned form the FAO-implemented AIRP inAfghanistan.

ImplementationinHigh-nskAreas

46. The extent to which the project will be able to assist farmers throughout the country depends
    on the secunty situation. Secunty remains problematic in several provinces because o f the
    limited extent o f government authonty Aid agencies can face threats from cnme, inter-
    warlord nvalnes, and opponents to the government. The secunty situation in the country is
    at its worst since the fall o f the Taliban regime, and it i s not clear how it will evolve in the
    next coming years. k s k is particularly hgh in the South. Preliminary operations o f the
    project have therefore been designedto avoid areas ofpersistent nsk.

47 No controversial aspects are foreseen.

8. Grant conditionsand covenants

48. No withdrawal will be made for payments under the Project unless: (i)a Financial
Management Manual satisfactory to the Association has been prepared and adopted for the
Project; (ii)a financial management officer for the Project has been appointed withn MAI; (5)
the Implementation Support Team has been constituted and staffed with an adequate number o f
key professionals, and (iv) the Operations Manualhas been adopted.

49 No withdrawal against the Compensation Facility will be made until a Compensation
Procedures Manual and an Environmental Management Plan satisfactory to the Bank have been
adopted by the government

50. Before effectiveness, the Minister o f Justice should prepare and submit to the Bank a legal
opinion stating that the Financing Agreement has been executed and ratified in accordance with
the laws o f Afghanistan. In addition, the cofinancing agreement between IDA (as administrator
for the Avian and Human Influenza Trust Fund) and the government o f Afghanistan should have
been executed and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness or to the nght o f the government
o f Afghanistan to make withdrawals under it will have been fulfilled.


                                     D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicand FinancialAnalyses

5 1 In terms o f savings or prevention o f losses from further outbreaks o f HPAIthe returns to the
    proposed investment are substantial. Using conservative assumptions, the total investment o f
    US$12.7 million, could prevent an estimated cumulative loss o f about US$200 million over
    the next 10 years. Infinancial terms an average o f about US$18 million per annum o f losses
    preventedmay be significant in itself but these losses would affect the poorest and the most
    vulnerable households inAfghanistan.

52. The economic analysis uses the standardcost-benefit analysis method to estimate the avoided
    losses in with-project situation. Without project and AI outbreak would have a significant
    negative impact on the poultry sector and humans, using the impact parameters from WHO
    and FAO/OIE (See Appendix 5 for more details). The with-project scenano assumes that the
    negative impact o f the disease would be minimized over the course o f the project, leading to


                                                  15

   reduced costs to the stakeholders and the economy as a whole. The benefits in terms of
   humanhealth and the poultry sector are significant and robust, suggesting the financial and
    economic viability o f the project. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project benefits are
   robust and do not change even with significant changes in the assumptions and parameters
    (Appendix 5). Nevertheless, the assigned probabilities, as cntical parameters for estimating
    costs and benefits with and without project scenanos are estrmates and not statistically
    denved. Any interpretation o f the economic analyses should therefore be correspondingly
    cautious.

53. Some notable and highly relevant direct and indirect costs related to a possible AI outbreak
   have been disregarded in the analysis, in view o f the uncertainties in extent o f correlation,
    lack o f appropnate data and information. Following field visits to a number o f affected and
   highlyvulnerable provinces, the preparationmission found that manytraders and the nascent
   poultry farms have incurred significant costs and many have beenindebted as a result of the
    minor outbreak early in2006.

54. Alternative sources o f income are limited and in Afghanistan any loss o f income from the
   poultry sector will have significant food insecunty repercussions. Poultry is also one of the
   most significant sources o f income for the landless. Therefore, the project's aim to help
    control and contain the spread o f AI will benefit pnmarily the relatively poorer members o f
   the society

2. Technical

55 The proposed Project involves a large set o f technical issues involving capacity o f vetennary
    services, laboratory facilities, bio-secunty measures, epidemiological .expertise, and
    emergency response to avian influenza outbreaks and a possible pandemic. These technical
    issues are elaborated inAppendix 2 (Detailed Project Descnption).

3. Fiduciary

56. The decision to align with the government's systems and procedures for implementing all
    components will contribute to enhancing institutional capacity While the overall fiduciary
    nsk associated with the Project is rated as "High h s k " for financial management and
    procurement, the proposed nsk mitigation action plans are deemed to be adequate (see Annex
    6 and 7 for details). Efforts will be made for capacity building in project coordination that
    includes procurement and financial management.

4. Social

57 Although poultry i s not a major commercial or economic activity, in Afghanistan, backyard
    chickens are an important livelihood, income and food secunty issue for the rural poor and
    especially for female-headed households. Nearly 98 percent o f the poultry sector i s owned
    and managed by women as one of the very few economic activities accessible to women.
    Therefore, interventions in the poultry sector will disproportionately benefit the most
    vulnerable section o f the society and positively contribute to addressing the gender bias in
    society, representinga significant positive social impact.

5. Environmental

58. The Project is assesszd as Category B for environmental impact. Project activities are
    expected to generate no or limited adverse environmental effects, since most activities are
    designed to support preventive measures. The Project will, generally, have positive
    environmental and social impacts as investments in facilities, equipment, laboratones, and
    training will improve the effectiveness and safety o f existing avian influenza handling and
    testing procedures. This would be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental
    safeguards through protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal o f ammals dung
    AI outbreaks and decontamination o f production facilities, and laboratones. However,
    adverse environmental health impacts, mainly unintentional from the spread o f HPAI, could
    occur when an emergency operation involves containment o f outbreaks through quarantine,
    isolation and culling actions and when relevant mitigation measures are not inplace. Most of
    the key potential impacts will be avoided or minimized by routinely integrating

Introduction

The project will support the national program for HPAIprevention, containment, control,
and eradication activities in the livestock and public health sectors. These activities
reflect an assessment o f the particular nsks, conditions, constraints, needs and
possibilities in the country, including a rapid assessment o f the public health and
vetennary services and poultry production systems, and reviews by donor agencies and
institutions involved with AI.

A.1. StrengtheningHPAI Controland OutbreakContainmentCapacity

Project support for HPAI outbreak containment actions reflects the provisions in the
NAIPPRPand associated implementation guidelines andmanuals. Project financing will
be provided for activities relatedto the implementation o f the NAIPPRP which specifies
the responsibilities and functions o f the National and Provincial Committees on AI
Control, the line ministnes involved, and implementing partners. It also defines the
responsibilities o f the zone offices and the teams that will be formed and trained now
and activated in any location where an outbreak is suspected andor confirmed. For
animal health, this will pnmarily involve the Vetennary Services Department (VSD) o f
MAI.

Targeting Virus Eradication at the Source. The overnding objective for vetennary
services i s to detect and contain any outbreak o f AI and to eradicate the disease at the
source of infection. Several activities are directly linked with this objective and
accordingly, the sub-component will provide support for: (i) detection o f virus
                                                                  early
among the poultry population; (ii) response in order to suppress viral activities in
                                     early
the identified outbreaks by means o f culling o f infected and at-nsk poultry (stamping
out) through emergency response teams, (iii)       compensating farmers and commercial
poultry producers (at rates prescribed by the National Avian Influenza Secretanat -
NAIS), (iv) disposingo f carcasses and potentially infective matenals ina bio-secure and
environmentally acceptable manner, (v) enhancing bio-secunty at poultry farms and
associated premises through bio-containment and bio-exclusion; (vi) controlling the
movement o f birds and products that may be infected, including controls at the interface
of infectednon-infected areas and border controls, and (vii) providing nng vaccination
for all poultry within restncted and control areas after completing culling operations.

Project financing will provide for the technical and logistical means to Emergency
Response Teams (ERTs) to contain a HPAI outbreak through location quarantining and
culling o f affected animals in infected and dangerous contact places. Culling and carcass
disposal will be done under the supervision o f zonal vetennanans or contracted pnvate

 vetennanans, who will be assisted by properly trained, equipped and protected staff
 (governmenthetennary field units - VFU staff and laborers) hued for*thispurpose by
 VSD o f the zone. Equipment and matenals will be provided for efficient and humane
 animal destruction as well as for the safe disposal o f carcasses. Carcass disposal will be
 case-specific, depending on local circumstances, but inall cases inan authonzed andbio-
 environmentally safe manner. Manuals will be developed in local languages and culling
 teams will receive proper training in human safety measures, humane killing and
 environmentally safe disposalldestruction o f biological and solid waste matenals.
 Protective clothing and other gear will be procured and kept in ready supply at zonal
 offices, to be issued incase o f an outbreak to all staff and workers involved incontainmg
 it. Detailedrecords will bemaintained o f all w a l s culled, so as to prowde the basis for
 subsequent compensation to their owners.

 For backyard poultry operations, the culling will be done in the presence and under the
 "social supervision" of a small local committee that includes two trusted members o f the
 village community (of which preferable one will be a woman) as well as the local
 vetennanan.      Community representatives may be the Mullah, members o f the
 Community Development Council (CDC), a representative o f the Women Poultry Group,
 or other locally recognized and trusted community members. This committee will venfy
 the number o f birds culled and their owners, so as to ensure a correct count and f i l l
 transparency for subsequent compensation payments. The commission members will
 sign and the poultry owners will countersignthe list o f birds culled.

 At (semi-)commercial poultry farms, the culling will be carned out in.the presence o f the
 owner or manager or o f a person designated by himher and under the supervision o f the
 zonal vetennanan and one official o f the local administration. All three will sign the list
 o fbirds culled.

 Along with the project activities the staff members o f the ERTs will undertake filed
 simulation exercises in order to test the correct implementation o f the established
 procedures.

 Vaccination: Poultry vaccination on a large scale as a preventivemeasure i s not foreseen
 at the present time. Lessons learned from the epizootic occurred in March-April 2006
 showed -that the disease, if present, i s likely to move slowly within the poultry
 population. This might be mainly due to the low population density o f poultry and to the
 fact that 98% of the poultry population i s in the rural sector (with an estimated average
 size of 6 animals/family), meaning that there are no big aggregation o f birds per
 epidemiological unit that can sustain the survival o f the virus. In addition the vetennary
,system (government and pnvate) i s not presently equipped to implement large-scale
 poultry vaccination campaigns7, the secunty situation in many parts o f the country not
 conducive to large-scale vaccination campaigns. Vaccination can however take place on
 a regular basis for the semi-commercial layer farms and pullet-reanng farms, which
 provide birds to the rural sector, as well as the birds supplied via Rural Poultry
 Development ProjectsPrograms. Provisions have been made in the budget to do so. In

 'The annual import of Newcastle disease vaccine is reported to be 2 milliondoses.

,the face o f an outbreak and inorder to prevent hrther spread o f disease, the project will
  undertake nng vaccinations, after culling, if required. Each zone will receive adequate
  stock o fvaccines to carry out nngvaccinations.

  Whenever vaccination is going to be implemented a vaccination monitonng scheme has
  to be developed in order to momtor: (i)  efficacy o f vaccine; and (ii) incursion o f
                                                                        detect
 virus in vaccinated flocks. The latter is usually achieved by leaving some unvaccinated
  birds invaccinated flocks. Evenif such method is culturally unacceptable inthe Afghan
  rural setting this might be applied in the commercial and semi-commercial sector. The
  project will support active and passive sero-surveillance programs in vaccinated birds,
  distributed through the FA0 implemented Rural Poultry Development project
  (GCP/AFG/030/USA), in order to assess the level o f protection after vaccination and to
  monitor vaccinated birds for possible infection with HPAI. These activities will i.a. be
  carned out with the assistance o f female (para)vetennanans/CBAHWs and poultry
  trainers.

  After the initial emergency phase, dunng which poultry farmers are to be financially
  compensated for culled birds, a restocking scheme with vaccinated birds, based on the
  Afghan Rural Poultry Development Model, could be established as a mechanism within
  the compensation facility

  Activities in support of sub-component A.l (cost Table 1in project files):

        A.1.a. In order to face avian influenza emergency situations, the Project will
        support eight regonal ERTs. Each Team will be composed o f four vetennanans,
        who will be equipped with all necessary matenal to carry out field investigation and
        culling operations. The provisional list o f minimum required equipment i s as
        follows: rapid tests, personal protection equipment sets (PPEs), disinfectants,
        sprayers, motonzed mist blowers, autopsy kits, culling bags, C02cylinders, GPS,
        cell phones,   maps, laboratory equipment for samples collection, storage
        (refngerators and freezers) and sample transportation (liquid nitrogen tanks and
        cool boxes).

        A.1.b. Training for the ERTs. Teams will be provided with technical operation
        manuals on samples collection, storage and transportation, outbreaks investigation,
        methods for culling and disposal o f carcasses.

      the vaccine and to establish a monitonng program in commercial vaccinated flocks
      inorder to be able to detect earlyincursions ofthe virus.

      A.1.f. The project will procure a number o f station wagons, pick ups, motor
      bicycles and truck in order to carry out timely and effectively above mentioned
      activities inthe country

A.2 -Human       Safety Assurance. The project will support the provision o f traimng to
people likely to be in direct contact with birds that may carry AI. Ths includes
vetennary and extension field staff involved inidentification o f the disease, farm workers
involved in culling and waste disposal, and laboratory workers involved invirus isolation
and diagnosis.      Resources will be allocated for extensive field training* in order to
enhance the level o f awareness. Equipment (bio-safety hoods and appropnate personal
protective gear and clothing) will also be provided and inaddition, all vetennary staff and
workers involved in emergency response teams and laboratory staff involved in HPAI
diagnostic activities will be vaccinated against seasonal humaninfluenza.

Activities in supportof sub-component A.2:

        A.2.a. Extensive training activities will be camed out by ERTs for field
        vetennanans, field staff and farm workers on recoption o f avian influenza and
        procedures o f self-protection in case o f handling suspected birds. Training will
        include the procedures o f activation o f the ERTs. Each ERT will carry out three
        training sessions per year inorder to cover the relevant satellite provinces.

        A.2.b. Provision of PPEs for the ERTs, trainees, and State Vetennary Department
        (SVD) staff. The Project will procure 10,000 (ten thousand) units composed of
        coveralls, boots, cover heads, masks and gloves.

A.3. StrengtheningHPAI clinicalandlaboratorydiagnosis andsurveillancefor
rapidandeffectiveoutbreakdetectionandcontainmentcapacity

Strengthening Disease Surveillance Capacity. Project financing will provide for
supporting MA1 vetennary services and VFUs nationwide through specific operating
procedures for all staff inthe detection and reporting o f clinical HPAI disease. This will
be based on the guidelines as developed by FAO/OIE and will include building capacity
of public and pnvate vetennary services, throughprovision o f training programs inactive
and passive epidemiological surveillance and disease reporting, in order to combat major
trans-boundary animal diseases including AI. This sub-component will expand the
activities already initiated and build on the expenences and lessons learnt fiom the FA0
implementedAN?, which is providing a bndging project between the AI surveillance
component o f the FA0 Regional Trans-boundary Animal Diseases project and the AHIP

project. The surveillance program i s implemented at the moment in (formerly) infected
and neighbonng distncts and at live bird markets in established nsk areas. The
preliminary results o f the program are presently under evaluation but it can be anticipated
that the results so far obtained didnot evidence the presence o f HPAIinthe study areas.

The program was structured infour main sub-components: (i)      rural areas; (ii)
                                                                                commercial
and semi-commercial sector; (iii)wetlands; and (iv) live birds markets. The same
approach could also be used inthe present project extending the activities throughout the
country Project financing will be provided for regular epidemiologcal studies and active
and passive surveillance programs in commercial and smallholder poultry. This will
support the process o f improving disease control measures, and will allow for
adjustments and refinements as new information becomes available. This activity will
also support Afghanistan's participation in the regional HPAI network and will enable
disease information shanng. Studies to support the surveillance component will be
implemented by the project and include, i.a., poultry density mapping exercises to
support nsk assessments and establishment o f sample sizes for epidemiological surveys.
Following these studies, VFUs will be contracted to carry out surveillance work e.g. (bi-
)weekly random sampling at live-bird markets, commercial and semi-commercial sectors
intheir service areas. Government and pnvate service providers will be remunerated for
both passive and active surveillance activities. It is foreseen that surveillance in rural
poultry will be carned out by female (para)vetennanans/CBAHWs.

UDdatina Essential Information on Migratory Birds. The Government intends to assess
flight and resting patterns o f migratory birds, especially waterfowl.      To this end the
project management will liaise with the National Environmental Program for Afghanistan
(NEPA) to determine migratory bird species in the country In this context, project
financing will provide for: (i)supporting activities by an ornithologist to classify
migratory bird species; (ii) active surveillance program invillages around 15 identified
                                 an
wetlandsg in order to carry out nsk assessments at locations where migratory fowl may
come into contact with domestic poultry and humans; and (iii)      surveillance activities in
wild birdsthrough observation o f the clinical status and collection o f samples from target
species adopting methodologies that will not affect protection o f wildlife and
safeguarding biodiversity. Active reporting will be stimulated via the FA0 installed
CODAN radio network, which i s to date operating in 32 provinces o f Afghanistan. The
remaining two provinces, not yet covered by the system, will receive a CODAN radio
shortly

Strengthening Diagnostic Capacity. Project support through this sub-component will
be targeted pnmarily at strengthening the capacity o f the Central Vetennary Laboratory
and public and pnvate field staff, in detection, reporting, sample collection and
submission, and follow-up of reported AI cases.          This will involve initial training
followed by active surveillance activities. Essential equipment for the central laboratory
and rapid tests for regional laboratones, as well as consumables and reagents, will be
financed. Staff training and technical assistance will be provided to establish rapid
institutional capacity for serological tests and screening surveys, and for virology tests to

  Serological surveys carried out inDec 2005 -Jan 2006.

confirm the existence o f the disease. Twinning arrangements with appropnate institutions
and laboratones will be explored to facilitate sustained capacity strengthemng over the
mediumandlonger term.

Activitiesin supportof sub-component A.3:

       A.3.a. Training and review the regulatory and legslation framework and
                                                              2

       development of guidelines for compensation scheme.

       A.3.b. Improvement o f information system is an essential component o f the
       surveillance system, which will be enhanced through the procurement o f different
       items aimed at improving the capacity o f the State Vetennary Department to
       rationalize information collected through surveillance system. Training will also
       be provided on the implementation o f an ad-hoc information system.

       A.3.c. In order to strengthen disease surveillance capacity, training and
       preparation o f guidelines and manuals will be provided for investigating diseases
       inthe sub-component identified (rural, commercial and semi-commercial sectors,
       livebirdsmarkets and wetlands).

       A.3.d. Remunerationfor the vetennmans involved ininvestigatingincommercial
       and semi-commercial sectors, live birds markets and wetlands. Investigations in
       commercial sector and live birds markets are to be carned out on a regular basis
       while investigations on wetlands are to be carned out mainly dunng migrating
        seasons o fwild birds.

        A.3.e. Field vetennanans involved in surveillance activities in wetlands will
        undertake a training course on sample collection and recognition o f wild birds
        species, which are relevant to AI epidemiology

        A.3.f. Field vetennanans involved in activities in wild life will need to be
        equipped with sample collection matenal and additional devices to capture wild
        birds.

        A.3.g. The Central Vetennary Diagnostic Laboratory in Kabul will be provided
        with laboratory equipment, reagents and consumables in support of surveillance
        activities. Laboratory staff involved in diagnosis will undertake refreshing
        training courses on laboratory techniques.

A. 4. Improvingthe capacityof poultry stakeholdersto adopt appropriatemeasures
to counter HPAIpresenceinAfghanistan

Community-BasedAnimal Disease Surveillance and Early Warning. Early warning
o f suspected outbreaks o f avian influenza i s essential in curtailing spread o f the disease
and minimizing economic loss. Since the rural backyard poultry sector constitutes 98
percent o f the national flock, rural poultry raisers are the focal point to address when
early warning and disease reporting issues are concerned.


                                             31

However, early warning systems at village level will only be effective if measures taken
follow established guidelines and procedures, and farmers are well and timely
compensated for loss o f healthy chickens through culling. Activities as expenenced in
Afghanistan, e.g. culling in distncts without confirmed cases o f avian influenza, are not
conducive to disease reporting, and may senously hamper containment and control of
HPAIinAfghanistaninthe near future.

The rural poultry industry i s a female core and since most rural women in Afghanistan
are illiterate and often out o f contact with modern communication methods such as radio
or television, the method o f choice to address these women i s through personalcontact by
female poultry trainers or CBAHWs.

To establish early warning systems at the community level to support a robust emergency
reporting and feedback system for notifiable animal diseases, the project will finance
training courses in, and implementation o f participatory disease survey techniques for
female animal health workers and women poultry trainers. Training courses will further
include handling o f infected animals, reporting procedures and immediate local response
measures. To this purpose the project will provide training courses to FAO's Women
Poultry Trainers and to female BWV, who will act as trainer o f trainers. NGOs will be
sub-contracted to implement program activities at village level through training o f
women poultry raisers. Poultry farmers will receive hands-on training in detection o f
clinical signs. Group leaders will be focal points for reporting suspected cases in those
villages where women poultry groups exist. Group leaders will be reimbursed for cost"
incurred for reporting (telephone, travel, small service fee, etc.).     Funding will be
provided for essential bio-secunty equipment such as sprayers andprotective equipment.

Improving Bio-Security in Poultry Production. Bio-secunty is the cheapest, most
effective means o f disease control available. N o disease prevention program will work
without it. Bio-secunty i s a concept for prevention o f disease entry/escape that must be
practiced by all farmers, cooperatives, abattoirs etc. Lack o f bio-secunty measures
increases the nsk o f introducing disease or infection into the production unit, market, or
any commercial operation. Farm management practices and marketing systems influence
the probability o fpoultry beingchallenged (andbecoming infected) with HPAI.

Smallholder households keep approximately 98 percent o f the total poultry population in
Afghanistan. Typically, smallholder households own around 6 chickens per household
and sell a bird occasionally to meet cash or domestic needs. Rural poverty i s
unfortunately expected to perpetuate high-nsk behavior through slaughtenng and/or
selling o f infectedchickens.

The main goal o f the bio-secunty sub-component is to develop clear guidelines and to
train both commercial and backyard poultry owners in clinical signs o f senous poultry
diseases, to ask them to notify competent authonties o f occurrences o f sick and/or dead
birds, and to give them information on practicing bio-secunty measures to keep their


loOn average US$5.0 per report.


                                              32

birds safe and healthy This will be achieved through carehl assessment and planningo f
the required measures and their applicability in the Afghan context. All commercial
poultry farms should develop and implement a formal bio-secunty plan as appropnate to
the type of farm. The bio-secunty planshould be documented with clear specifications o f
those responsible for its maintenance.

Bio-secunty practices do not have to be cumbersome or expensive. However, the
effectiveness of the measures depends on compliance by farmers and farm workers, who
must have a basic understanding of the purpose o f the measures. Breaches o f bio-secunty
can occur no matter how stnngently the measures are implemented. Therefore, this sub-
component will assess the capacity and willingness o f people to cany out bio-secunty
measures. Willingness depends on the perception o f the nsks from HPAI, the extent to
which the government i s able to enforce wntten regulations, the importance o f poultryto
the livelihood, the cost o f the recommended bio-secunty measures compared to profit
from the poultry enterpnse, and the availability o f cash to make an investment in bio-
secunty measures, when weighted against the many other demands on income.

Improving bio-secunty in poultry production i s an important element in any strategy to
safeguard against the damaging impact o f HPAI. The project will support participatory
socio-economic needs and impact assessments o f bio-secunty measures in the poultry
sector, encompassing all stakeholders. Links should be established with the HLP project
for baseline data on bio-secunty Support will also be provided for an overall assessment
o f the poultry industry, including birds markets, and o f the opportunities for improving
bio-secunty measures to prevent spreading o f virus from infected premises and thereby
reducing the nsk o f further infection. The assessments will result in tailor-made
recommendations to enhance bio-secunty at poultry farms and associated premises,
through bio-containment and bio-exclusion and by the provision of safe carcass disposal
facilities. Appropnate technical training matenal adapted to vanous existing categones o f
poultry stakeholders will be developed. Particular emphasis will be given to the
promotion o f the Afghan Rural Poultry Development model as viable approach for bio-
secunty measures. Project management will liaise with the HLP to provide poultry
reanng training courses to HPAIaffected farmers.

Activities in support of sub-component A.4:

         A.4.a. Surveillance in rural areas will be carned out by trained women. This
         activity will have two main components: (i)regular surveillance in nsky areas

A.7. Waste Managementand Sanitation

This sub-component will include the preparation o f a national plan, standard guidelines
and an operational manual for HPAI-related waste management, as well as equipment
and supplies to support healthy and environmentally fhendly disposal o f culled animals,
laboratory waste disposal and decontamination. Detailed TORS for an international
consultant to prepare guidelines and operational manuals have been prepared and are
available inthe draft Project Operational Manual.


B. HUMANHEALTHCOMPONENT

B.l. EnhancingPublicHealthProgramPlanningandCoordination

Supportfor an avian influenzacoordinatorwithin the Ministryof PublicHealth. At
present, there is no individual inMOPH responsible for coordinating activities related to
AI and human health. It is important that a senior officer be appointed since the required
elements o f human avian influenza surveillance, response, and case management,
including those activities that are part o f this proposal, fall within different parts o f the
MOPH. The proposed activities must .occur in a precise time frame and sequence (e.g.
guidelines must be developed before training can be initiated).             A Public Health
Coordinator will be appointed to the project coordinating unit, to be responsible for
implementingthis component. The PH Coordinator will also serve as the MOPH liaison
to the National Avian Influenza Secretanat (NAIS), and will coordinate the NGOs,
international organizations, and technical consultants who will be executing a number o f
theproject tasks through contractual arrangements with the MOPH.

Development of command and control structures within the Ministry of Public
Health,and review of institutionalinfrastructure. The current ability o fthe MOPH to
manage complex emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, i s limited and fragmented.
There is no management structure for handling a complex problem like avian influenza.
An outbreak of AI will require a system for integrating surveillance information,
communications, deployng response teams, pharmaceuticals management, specimen and
test result tracking. It will also need to liaise with provincial and local health authonties
and other parts o f govemment. Project funding will assess the institutional arrangements
within the MOPH for command and control, and develop a unified structure, including


                                               34

staffing and equipment, to support the formation o f a command and control w t . Project
hnding will also provide for the appointment o f a director and operating costs for the
command andcontrol unit.

Developmentof protocolsand guidelinesfor disease surveillance,response, and case
management. The MOPH has developed limited guidelines for disease surveillance,
including dissemination o f a case definition. Guidelines andprotocols are available from
many international orgamzations (WHO, CDC, the European CDC, other countnes that
have expenenced human illness from avian influenza). However, these guidelines will
need to be adapted to the situation inAfghanistan. Given the multiplicity o f organizations
that are providing health care in the country, uniform standards for disease surveillance,
reporting, investigation, and case management, are cntically needed. Training activities
cannot commence untilsuch matenals are inplace. Project financing will provide for the
technical assistance needed to: (i)rapidly develop, produce, and disseminate such
protocols and guidelines; and (ii)    carry out penodic reviews o f existing protocols and
guidelines and necessary modifications as the human dimensions o f avian influenza
evolve.

Training workshops and activities. A comprehensive training program is needed to
assure uniform implementation o f protocols and guidelines for surveillance, response,
and case management of persons with avian influenza. The project will support a train-
the-trainer approach. Workshops will be conducted for up to three trainers from each of
the provinces on disease surveillance, training o f response teams, and case management.
The project will also support subsequent provincial and local training activities to be
conducted by the trainers.      The project will also provide resources for training o f
personnel at the national and regional referral hospitals being established as part of the
project. The project will provide resources for penodic refresher courses, especially as
the national situation, and the state of knowledge of avian influenza, evolves.       Such
penodic retraining will assure that the health care system is well-prepared to handle
humandiseaserelated to avian influenza.

Conduct of tabletop and field simulations. Once protocols and guidelines are inplace,
it is important to conduct exercises to assurethat policy-makers and healthcare managers
understand how to respond to avian influenza and can identify and correct any gaps or
deficiencies in the system.       The project will support technical assistance for the
development o f two tabletop exercises and four field exercises, and will support the
actual conduct o f the exercises.

B.2. Strengtheningthe NationalPublicHealth SurveillanceSystem

Develop institutional capacity for avian influenza surveillance including data
collection, analysis, and dissemination in the MOPH. The project will support the
development o f a unit within the Ministry o f Public Health to coordinate surveillance
activities related to avian influenza and other pnonty diseases. At present, surveillance
activities within the MOPHare fragmented, and there i s no single unit with responsibility
for its collection, analysis, and dissemination. For avian and pandemic influenza, this i s a



                                              35

cntical deficiency It is likewise a problem for other pnonty conditions and diseases.#
The project will support the institutionalization o f a network for the avian influenza
component through the Disease Early Warning System (DEWS) currently under
development, including collection o f data on viral pneumonia and influenza-like illness
(ILI), from the local to the provincial to the national level. As regional facilities are
being developed as case referral centers (see below), the project will support sentinel site
ILI monitonng in these same locations.        The project will also support six additional
geographically representative sentinel sites for ILImonitonng. Each o f the eight sentinel
sites will be gven a lump sum payment o f $12,000 annually to cover equipment,
recording, reporting, specimen collection and shipment costs, and an information
coordinator at each surveillance site. Under this component, the project will support
equipment (computers,       communications equipment, training) and transportation,
information dissemination through monthly bulletins, a surveillance unit director and data
manager, and information collection personnel at each surveillance site. Because other
donor resources are available to support the surveillance unit director and data manager
for the first two years of the project, project funds are allocated for them dunng the third
year o f the project only.

Support to rapid response teams. Each province in Afghanistan has rapid response
teams (also known as emergency response teams) that have been developed to conduct
investigations and institute control measures in emergency or outbreak situations, or
when unusual illness i s recognized. Each o f these teams i s multi-person. There are also
national level teams which provide back-up support to the provincial teams.             The
technical skill o f these response teams is inconsistent, as is their training. These teams
will need to respond if suspected or confirmed cases o f avian influenza are recognized.
They will need to conduct field investigations, complete report forms and file outbreak
investigation reports, initiate control measures, and collect appropnate specimens for
diagnostic purposes. The project will offer support to these teams, including training,
communications, transportation, personal protective equipment, and incentives. For the
purposes o f cost estimation, it was assumed that the surveillance infrastructure would
identify 50 potential cases or clusters requinng investigation per year, and that backup
support will be required from national level teams ten times per year. Support is also
provided for WHO to,provide technical support to the investigations being conducted by
the rapid response teams. Because funds from other sources are available to support
investigations dunng the first year o f the project, project funds are provided only for the
second and third year.



Equip major medical referral centers. The project supports the development o f a
definitive diagnostic capacity using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for
avian influenza in the Ministry o f Public Health Central Laboratory         This capacity is
beingdeveloped by other donors, and is therefore not covered under the project proposal.
For case management purposes, four regional medical centers have been identified as
referral facilities for suspected and confirmed avian influenza (see below). Two
additional referral centers are being refurbished and operated by other sources. These
facilities have weak laboratory diagnostic capacity Although the project cannot support



                                             36

development o f RT-PCR in each o f these sites, it is appropnate for case-management
purposes (e.g. to aid decision making on initiation of anti-viral therapy, health care
worker prophylaxis, use o f isolation) to have access to rapid diagnostic luts to identifythe
presence o f influenza virus (luts identify influenza A & B only). These pre-packaged kits
are feasible for resource-limited laboratones. Because two o f the four designated referral
centers are inKabul, it is not necessary to provide kits to these hospitals, since specimens
can be rapidly transferred to the Central Laboratory for definitive RT-PCR diagnosis.
Kits, along with the training to use them, will be provided to the remaimng two facilities
and the two facilities being established through other donors, outside of Kabul.
Sufficient capacity to perform 100 rapid tests per year will be provided to each o f these
four referral sites.


B.3. Strengtheningthe HealthCare SystemResponseCapacity

Designation of regional health care facilities and upgrading of these facilities to
serve as referral institutions for persons with suspected or confirmed avian
influenza. Although it is not possible to predict where human cases might appear in
Afghanistan, dung the pre-pandemic phases there will need to be specialized referral
facilities to isolate and care for persons with suspected or confirmed disease. Dunngthe
pandemic phase, when there are likely to be large numbers o f illindividuals, the health
care system will have difficulty canng for all .severely illpatients. However, there will
still be a role for these isolation facilities. At present, Afghan health facilities are ill-
prepared to care for such patients, lacking the physical infrastructure, equipment (e.g.
oxygen generators, suction devices), and supplies for such isolation wards. The project
will support facility renovations to hospitals designated by the national government to
serve as referral facilities on a regional basis. This includes two hospitals inKabul (the
infectious disease hospital and the Indira Ghandi pediatnc hospital) and two in other
locations in the country yet to be designated.     Two additional sites are being developed
by other donor sources. The project will also support transportation costs to transfer
patients from penpheral locations to these referral facilities. Because most health care
services in Afghanistan are organized by the MOPH but managed through a consortium
o f NGOs, the project will support a contract with an NGO to renovate and operate the
wards designated for care o f persons with suspected or confirmed avian influenza
(isolation wards) in the four designated regional referral facilities. It i s expected that
these wards will be used to care for patients with other pnonty communicable diseases
(especially those where isolation may be necessary) when they are not being used for
patients with avian influenza.

Personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers who will be canng for
persons with suspected or confirmed avian influenza should utilize protective equipment
to reduce their nsk o f exposure and infection. Standards for PPE have been established
by WHO. They include masks (N95 or above), gowns, gloves, boots, and for care o f
severely illpatients (e.g. in isolation facilities) goggles.   Since these patients may be
hospitalized in virtually any health care facility, or be seen in comprehensive or basic
health care centers, some amount o f PPE should be available in these settings.            A



                                               37

standardized set o f PPE, if purchased in bulk, should cost about $15 U.S. per unit. The
project will obtain 200 sets o f PPE per referral hospital, 100 sets per regional and
provincial hospital, and 25 sets per distnct hospital.        A backup stdckpile o f PPE
maintained by the MOPH will also be developed. The project will also budget for a 25
percent replacement rate per year. The project will also fund shipping and distribution
costs.

Antiviral medications.      As currently circulating avian influenza (H5N1) viruses are
uniformly resistant to M 2 inhibitors (amantadine and nmantidine), the only currently
feasible antiviral option i s the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (for both prophylaxis
and treatment). The other neuraminidase inhibitor (zanamivir) is currently not widely
available.     The project will support prophylactic use o f oseltamivir in limited
circumstances as follows: (a) prophylaxis o f workers engaged in culling activities (b)
prophylaxis o f health care workers canng for patients with confirmed avian influenza (c)
dunng the pre-pandemic phase, household and other close contacts o f patients with
confirmed avian influenza. The project will also support use o f oseltamivir for treatment.
However, to be effective, the drug must be administered within48 hours o f illness onset.
Given the challenging geography o f Afghanistan, this means that the drug must be
distributed and warehoused throughout the country, particularly in the facilities
designated as referral centers.      The project will support 200 treatment courses o f
oseltamivir in each o f the four regional referral centers, 100 treatment courses in each
province, with a 50 percent annual replacement estimate. A backup stockpile o f 1000
treatment courses with annual replemshment will be maintained by the MOPH. A
proportion (75%) o f the medication will be obtained inthe adult tablet formulation while
the remaining 25% will be in the pediatnc formulation. The ration is reversed for the
pediatnc hospital inKabul. Ifadditional medicationi s needed, it can be accessedthrough
the stockpile o f WHO, or through emergency purchases o f medication. The dose and
duration o f prophylaxis is one tablet per day for 10 days.      The WHO recommended
treatment course i s one tablet twice daily for five days. The estimated cost o f oseltamivir
i s $2/tablet and $4/dose for the pediatnc formulation, although costs may be less from
other WHO-certified suppliers. The project will also support shipping and distribution
costs.

Seasonal influenza vaccine for health care workers and poultry culling workers.
Persons at high nsk o f exposure to avian influenza virus should be vaccinated against
regular (or seasonal) influenza. This will reduce the opportunity for simultaneous co-
infection with humanand avian viruses, a circumstance which can promote re-assortment
and enhance person-to-person transmissibility        Since influenza viruses naturally dnft
from year-to-year, this vaccine must be given annually InAfghanistan, individuals who
should receive this vaccine are poultry culling workers, health care workers with a high
'likelihood o f canng for patients with avian influenza, and persons working in laboratones
where viable avian influenza virus may be present. The estimated cost of each vaccine
dose i s $10.00.     The project will cover costs for procurement, distribution, and
administration.

Developmentof case managementstrategies duringthe pandemicphase. Ithas been
estimated that with no interventions, at the peak o f an influenza pandemic 30-40 percent
o f the population o f a community may be illat the same time, with 10 percent o f these
individuals (3-4 percent o f the population) severely ill.Few communities inAfghmstan
have the infrastmcture to support such a large number o f illpersons at one time. There
are strategies that can reduce the amount o f overall illness, but even in the best of
circumstances, in a full-blown pandemic large numbers o f individuals will seek and
require care. It i s therefore important to plan for these needs and develop options to
handle these illnesses. InAfghmstan, given the geographic isolation o f many areas, it is
possible not all communities will be impactedby the pandemic. Furthermore, because o f
its geographic, it i s likely that all would not be affected at the same time. Planrung
efforts should take these factors into consideration. Given the low level o f surge capacity
o f the Afghan health care system, a case management approach which takes full
advantage o f the community health worker system and emphasizes home management,
should be emphasized. The project will support the development o frecommendations for
health care management dunngthe pandemic phase.

Surge capacity in the health care system during a pandemic. Afghmstan has one o f
the lowest health care worker per capita ratios inthe world. Exacerbating this problem i s
that these workers are not evenly distributed throughout the country, being
disproportionately urban. Dunnga pandemic, health care workers will also be ill,leaving
some communities without health care services. Therefore it i s important to develop
strategies to deal with possible shortages o f health care workers dunng the pandemic
phase, and to develop strategies to reinforce the health care workforce.        Among the
possible strategies to be employed are shifting health care workers from less affected to
more affected communities, developing and credentialing a volunteer workforce, and
bnnging health care workers no longer actively engaged in health care back onto
temporary service (e.g. a reserve force). The project will support the development and
implementation o f recommendations for health care worker surge capacity dunng the
pandemic phase.

Social distancing measures.         In the pre-pandemic and pandemic phases, social
distancing measures can play an important role in limiting the spread of disease and
reducing overall morbidity and mortality. Community isolation and quarantine, closure
o f common gathenng places (e.g. schools, sports venues, and religious institutions),
business closures or worker furloughs, and travel advisones/alerts or restnctions, are
among the more common social distancing measures. Social distancing plans need to be
developed before they are actually needed. Because implementation and enforcement o f
many o f these measures fall outside the responsibility o f the MOPH, it will be necessary
to draw a number o f other stakeholders into the discussion and plandevelopment. These
stakeholders include, but are not limited to, local community leaders, religious leaders,
Ministnes of Education, Sports, Transportation, Secunty, and Defense, and the business
community The project will support the development o f a social distancing plan. Once
this plan is developed, consideration should be given to devoting one o f the tabletop or
field exercises to implementationo f social distancing measures.

C. COMMUNICATIONAND PUBLIC AWARENESS

The AHIP fdly recognizes the importance o f a communications component inits quest to
control and contain AI and reduce its nsks both to humans and animals. This component
will inparticular address the following activities: a) elevate public awareness, control the
spread in the poultry sector, and prevent the spread o f infection among humans; b) give
visibility to the multisectoral response; c) secure hgh-level political support; d) promote
a pro-active commuruty-dnven response; e) install a feedback and reporting mechanism,
to foster two-way information flows.

UNICEF has had significant expenence incommunication and has recently designed and
implemented AI-related communication strategies in a number o f countnes in Asia and
elsewhere. The AI Secretanat incollaboration with other technical agencies (FAO, WHO
and NGOs) will seek the assistance o f UNICEF to prepare a communication strategy and
plano f action for AHIP Subject to agreement o f the AI Secretanat and NAIS, UNICEF
will also be responsible for implementing the strategy. If agreed with the National AI
Secretanat UNICEF will implement all or parts o f the communications component under
a contract with the former. The communications strategy and plan o f action, which will
be prepared by UNICEF will include the following activities if deemed appropnate at the
time o fimplementation.

C.l. ExtensiveCommunication

Training component to pnontv stakeholders: The National AI Secretanat will sub-
contract and manage the design, production and delivery o f face-to-face training to a
competent agency (an option could be UNICEF) to reduce the nsk o f infection in
animals, and prevent the spread o f the disease. Contents for these interventions will
adhere to FAO's guidelines on AI communications, and FAO-WHO-UNICEF's "pnonty
behaviors to control AI.". Support will be provided to finance the development o f
appropnate communication training matenal and training to homogenous groups o f
pnonty audience. Pnonty audiences groups are:
        Agncultural extension and public health staff,

    0   Religious leaders
    0   Provincial Councils
    0   Community development councils
        Teachers/NGOs

Training to media managers: The National AI Secretanat will sub-contract and manage a
program for the delivery of an information workshop on the AI epidemic. This will
include the creation and maintenance o f a cleannghouse o f information and
documentation on AI matenals, accessible to media reporters, for a professional and up-
to-date reporting o f the epidemic.

Community-based mobilization and media suuport: The Communications Unit o f the
National Solidanty Program (NSP) will enter into partnership with the National AI



                                             40

 Secretanat to reach the Commuruty Development Councils and rural populations across
 the country through its established communications infrastructure. The partnershp with
 NSP will also include assistance in the creation o f a feedback mechmsm, to bnng
 information from the grass-roots level, to the APSecretanat and other stakeholders. Ths
 mechanism can be built on NSP's existing community reporting system.

 Support to face-to-face education and the development o f audiovisual matenals, for hgh-
 nsk and vulnerable rural population. T h s matenal will focus on five core messages:
 prevention and control o f AI; protection o f rural livelihoods; disclosure o f compensation
 mechanisms; rapid-reporting; andthe mobilization o f group resources.

 The Component will finance the production costs o f five radio core messages. The spots
 will beproducedinlocal languages.

 The Component will cover the production costs o f a weekly radio program, to highlight
 the activities undertaken, and investments made by pnonty mimstnes, to prevent and
 control AI.

 A request to the NSP will be made to contribute in-kindto the AI project inthe delivery
 o f "community-based dialogues," the five radio core messages, and the weekly
 presentation o f AI government activities. Similarly, the NSP will negotiate with
 subcontracted networks: RTA, Inter-News and Equal Access, for the dissemination of the
 radio messages inan intensiveradio campaign.

 Radio senals for sustainable awareness: The Afghan Education PrograrrBBC, will be
 subcontracted to produce a package o f edutainment senals, covenng all audiences in the
 rural population, across the country

 The senals will focus on the AI prevention and control messages inthe first three months
 o f the project, while maintaining a presence o f the educational contents across the rest o f
 the first year. The package will include research, message design, production in two
 languages, broadcasting, as well as monitonng and evaluation o f the effects, in four
 established radio dramas, namely. Health life, People talk, Senes for Afghan children,
 and Village voice

 Advocacy to secure high-levelpolitical suuuort: The Component will organize a senes o f
 presentations to the NAIS members, the parliament and other decision-makers, about
 possible epidemic scenarios; financial and social costs; and the activities o f the national
 response program. Identification and training o f spokespersons will be provided, as well
'as a consistent plan to inform the media on a regular basis. Lastly an operational budget
 for communications, assigned to the National AI Secretanat, will be earmarked for
 emergingcommunication needs inthe first year o fthe project. A budget to maintain basic
 communications operations dunng years 2 and 3 will be available, with the assumption
 that other national government programs will assist and finance operations, in case of
 need. The main activities include:
      a) Meetings and presentations to decision-makers



                                              41

    b) Selectionandtraining o f spokespersons
    c) Press conferences and roundtables
    d) Communications budget for emerging needs

C.2. IntensiveCommunication

Gender sensitive communicators inthe mobile response units: Under this Sub-component
the Project will subcontract the professional training o f women, to act as Communication
Officers in the mobile units responding to the outbreaks. They will receive specialized
training in the preventive health aspects o f AI, preparedness plans, socio-psychological
and community-based mobilization. These Communications Officers will be equipped
with educational matenals and resources to face the immediate needs o f impacted
populations, and will be hiredfor the duration o f the project (3 years).

The mobile teams will receive intensive training with regard to the AI (both from the
animal and human health perspectives), issues o f control, safeguards, containment and its
dangers. The main task o f these teams are to raise awareness with regard to the AI and
persuade women within the households to allow necessary culling and what precautions
to take ifcertain symptoms are observed.

D. INSTITUTIONAL COORDINATIONAND PROJECTMANAGEMENT

Financing for this Component will cover overall institutional coordination and project
management. It will cover (i)    NAIS expenses for its operations and to strengthen the
National Policy and regulatory environment and (ii)the cost o f the Implementation
Support Team operations to implement the proposed Project, including financial
management, procvrement, monitonng and evaluation.

D.l. Strengtheningthe NationalPolicyand RegulatoryEnvironment. Although there
are regulations and guidelines in place, compliance and enforcement are not actively
practiced. Present lack o f cooperation and exchange o f information between ministnes i s
also not conducive to an effective response to the containment, control and eradication o f
HPAIinAfghanistan.

The project will support therefore activities for improving the policy, legal and regulatory
framework relating to AI. This will extend to ensunng inter-ministenal coordination and
cooperation and the national capability to implementthe recommendeddisease detection,
control, prevention, containment and eradication measures ina uniform and effective way
and in accordance with OIE standards and guidelines. The Component includes support
for a detailed review of current policies and the existinglegal and regulatory environment
and for drafting, as may be warranted, o f legal amendments, regulations, and
implementation guidelines and manuals. Further the project will fund related policy
studies and dissemination workshops especially those focusing on trans-boundary animal
diseases.

National Action Plan. The Director DVS has few qualified and trained staff to delegate
responsibility for implementation o f an action plan. Following the first outbreak o f HPAI,


                                             42

   a National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan
   (ANIPPRP) was developed in close collaboration with the MOPH, NEPA, FAO,
   USDNAPHISNSandWHO. This forms thebasis o fthe Project.


,  As part o fthe NAIPPRP, a good and comprehensive draft actionplan" hasbeenprepared
   for the vetennary sub-sector. The Plan includes precise details (standard operating plans)
   for: (i) detection o f suspected cases of HPAI in domestic poultry, and (ii)rapid
             rapid
   eradication o f HPAI by stamping out. It further spells out the responsibilities o f the
   response plan task force, and regional and local .task forces, and the cntical need for
   operational team training.        It also specifies a communication plan. The project will
   provide support to further refimng the NAIPPRP and to develop the necessary detailed
   implementation guidelines and manuals outlining the steps to be taken at all levels for all
   relevant agencies and services. Specialists will be contracted to assist in this work in
   close collaboration with the national HPAI working group and the agencies involved
   (MAI, FA0 and subcontracted NGOs, notably AVA) inHPAI prevention and control of
   animal health.

   Development of a HPAI Contingency Plan. Initial response efforts by the MAIto the
   diagnosis o f avian influenzawere delayed for three weeks because o f

            lack o fpersonal protective equipment PPE),
            lack o f equipment and supplies to conduct culling, disposal and decontamination
            o f premisesknownto holdinfectedpoultry,
       0    lack o f training for personnel to conduct surveillance, euthanasia, and disposal of
            culled birds,
       0    inadequate transportation and communication to support deployedteams, and
       0    lack o f immediate financial support from GOA and donor community to support
            teams deployed to provinces.

   The Contingency Plan to be developed under the Project will include guidelines for the
  rapid mobilization o f physical and human resources to respond quickly to an outbreak.
   This will require close cooperation between the relevant ministnes and the immediate
   availability o f contingency funds. Project support will provide for developing a
   contingency plan with detailed procedures for supporting early reaction capabilities o f all
  parties concerned in case o f a H P A I outbreak. Useful information can be found in a
   number o f FAO/OIE documents12 and in the Australian Vetennary Emergency Plan
   documents.l3

Inparticularproject actions will focus on: (i) training staff and testing plans, developing
capabilities at the national, provincial and distnct vetennary centers, field level and
laboratory services; (ii)
                        developing mechanisms for ensunng close collaboration between
government and pnvate sector services and farming cornmumties in the emergency
response; (iii)developing the capacity to mobilize resources to counter the disease or any
other m m a l health emergency in the most efficient way (including equipment,
vaccination, personnel and finances); and (iv) establishing legal and administrative
structures to deal with an emergency. The project will support contingency allowances
for appropnate humanresources as required.

Regulation o f the Poultry Sector. The project will support the assessment of present
policies regulating the Afghan poultry sector. When warranted appropnate policies and
regulations to strengthen the poultry sector would be drafted.

D.2. ProjectCoordination

Financing for this sub-component will cover overall project management, including
technical coordination, financial management, procurement, monitonng and evaluation
and ad hoc consultancies. Institutional capacity will be strengthened for coordinating and
managing the project, at central and provincial levels (national and zonal coordination
units). Inaddition to full time employment o f personnel at central and provincial levels,
project actions will promote linkages with existing coordination structures. Linkages will
be specifically made with Bank-financed operations in the agnculture/livestock/health
sectors to make synergies with project management, coordination, procurement and
monitonng and evaluation.

I.Background

The AI outbreaks were first identified in six South-East Asian countnes inclose succession.
The HPAIhas since spread to more than 35 countnes, which has infected 194 people out o f
which 109 cases have been fatal (as o f 12 April 2006). Inaddition it has caused the death o f
200 million birds (as of February 2006) since the outbreak. The spread o f AI in quick
succession has raised significant concern over the potential emergence o f a pandemic with
devastating consequences for humanhealth and livelihoods.

A study by the European Commission indicates that the global losses from the HPAI
outbreak since late 2003 may run into billions o f U S dollars. Direct economic costs are the
costs associated with the loss o f poultry population, poultry products, control, mitigation and
treatment o f patients as well as the loss o f life. Indirect costs are the effects on higher
alternative substitute food products, the loss o f capital employed in the poultry sector, from
the fam-gate to the fork, and so forth.

In Afghanistan, nearly 98 percent of the poultry sector is owned and managed by poor
households under free-range, scavenging with insignificant or no purchased feeding provided
and very small numbers kept around the house. The poultry is not only a good source of
nutntion for poor households but also a significant source o f income as well as a store of
value, hence, an important factor in household food secunty Lack o f sufficient alternative
sources of income and nutntion would augment the direct costs AI to households and
increase household vulnerability to food insecurity The resilience o f the poultry sector in
other countnes following the HPAI outbreaks have been noted, however, this may prove
rather difficult inAfghanistan for lack o f investible fund at the household levels, inparticular
the resource-poor rural households.

11. Methodologyand Assumptions

The economic analysis for this project uses the standard with andwithout-project cost-benefit
analysis using accepted scenanos and standards. The without-project scenano assumes that
nothing will be done and the toll on poultry and humans will be unhindered. The WHO
estimated parameters in conjunctions with local data are used to estimate the impact o f an
unhindered AI outbreak. The with-project scenano estimates the costs with the proposed
project, investment costs and the losses to humans and poultry, as the mission i s under no
illusion to assume that the proposed interventions will be 100 percent effective, given the
animal and human health conditions and institutional capacities in the country Finally, the
net benefit i s denvedby usingdifference between the total costs o fwith and without project.

Cntical assumptions for estimating costs and benefits are based on likely guesses on
probabilities o f events that are not estimated using scientific methods, simply because



                                              48

statistics on the AI or similar diseases do not exist. Therefore, caution is necessary when
interpretingthe resulting project IRR andNPV.

Population: The last census was conducted in 1979 and no accurate census has since been
conducted. Therefore,         population estimates by vmous national and international
organizations vary greatly and range between 22 and 26 million. However, the Central
Statistics Office (CSO) in2003 undertook a review and made some estimates for settled and
nomad population. The CSO hasjust published population estimates for 2006 at 23.6 million
with settled population estimated at 22.1 million and the nomads (Kuchi) population
estimated at 1.5 million. The current population estimates are based on the 2003 estimates
and review, which may have some credibility issues but is still the best estimate available.
Population growth is estimated at 1.9 percent per year. Since the last official census in 1979,
population has almost doubled (the fertility rate at 6.8 percent i s one o f the highest in the
world). Urban population is currently estimated at just over 21 percent o f the total, with
urbanization nsing at an alarming rate.

Without-Project Scenario. Assumes that the HPAI will spread unhindered affecting both
humans and the poultry sector. Using the WHO estimated parameters in case o f unhindered
AI outbreak, the direct and indirect costs for both, households and the society, are estimated.
The assumptions are:

    a. in the event o f an outbreak 30 percent o f the poultry sector will be affected, and'any
        affected birdwill be destroyed (either culled or die o f the disease);
    b. the probability o f an outbreak is estimated at 0.1 with a 5 percent growth rate per
        annum;
    c. 30 percent o f unprotected human population (all population in the case of
        Afghanistan) are likely to be affected (WHO);
    d. 10percent o fthe affectedpopulation will require hospitalization (WHO);
    e.  1.5 percent o f the cases will be fatal (WHO);
    f. Local pnces (with appropnate adjustments) are used in calculating the appropnate
        unit costs;
    g. The unit cost estimates and the vanous assumptions are presented inTables 1and 2.

With-Project Scenario. Assumes that the proposed project actions will have a gradual but
notable effect on the containment, protection and treatment o f a likely AI outbreak. The
following main assumptions are made:

    a. Probability o f success inthe prevention o f an AI outbreak inpoultry is conservatively
        assumed at 20 percent reaching 50 percent inthe fourth year o f the project;
    b. Probability o f success in rotecting humans is assume at 10 percent gradually
        reaching40 percent inthe 7tRproject year;
    c. Probability o f success in containment o f AI and treatment o f infected humans i s
        assumed at 20 percent reaching 40 percent inthe 4thproject year, both assumptions, c
        and d are highly conservative in view o f the dilapidated and low capacity o f the
        publichealth sector inAfghanistan;
    d. It is further assumed that the government expenditure in economic terms to continue
        the project containment and control plansbeyond the life o fthe project will amount to
        about US$2.1 million over the penod o f analysis.

Some notable and highlyrelevant direct and indirect costs related to the AI outbreak have not
been included in the analysis, in view o f the uncertainties in extent o f correlation, lack o f
appropnate data and information. Many traders and the nascent poultry farms have incurred
significant costs and many have beenheavily indebted. Inaddition, many traders and poultry
farmers are awaiting news and instructions from relevant authonties, when to begin their
activities and inwhat form. This situation i s further detenorating their financial situation.

The Results

Table 2 provides the results o f the project economic analysis using a number of
conservative assumptions and parameters. The basic assumptions are relatively more
conservative even,when compared with the assumptions made for similar projects in
other countnes in the region and elsewhere. Despite such conservative assumptions, the
project economic analysis results inanNPV ofUS$21million and an IRR o f 37 percent,
whlch are highly significant and suggests that the proposed project is economically and
financially viable.

SensitivityAnalysis

Table 3 provides a summary o f sensitivity analysis based on a number of assumptions as
presented in the table below. Despite significant changes in the rates o f project success,
probability o f AI outbreaks and the associated costs both to humans and animals, the
project IRR and NPV i s still highly significant. Therefore, the project is robust and the
results do not change even if the assumptions change significantly. Changing the
parameters in the human health impact o f the project significantly changes the IRR and
NPV

DistributionalAnalysis

Poultry i s one o f the most important sources o f food and income as well as a reliable
store o f value and a cushion for consumption smoothing in lean seasons. The poultry
sector i s predominantly a backyard and household activity with 98 percent o f the poultry
owned by households under very small scale management (about 4 birdshousehold on
average) with very little or no purchased inputs. The householdpoultry i s entirely owned
and managed by women. Usually the income from poultry finds its way directly to the
purse rather than the wallet, with notable impact on the intra-household consumption
behavior and welfare. Any support to the household poultry sector positively contributes
to correcting the gender bias inAfghanistan.

Almost all of the rural poor raise some poultry in their backyard, which contributes to
their diet and is animportant source of income. Alternative sources o f income are, by and
large, limited and any loss o f income from the poultry sector will have significant food
insecunty repercussions. Poultry i s also one o f the most significant sources o f income for

'
  the landless and women-headed households in rural areas. On the other hand, the
  project's aim to control and contain the spread o f AI, will have disproportionately
  benefitedthe relatively poorer membersof the society

                APPENDIX 6-ProcurementArrangements


CountryContext

The Bank has gained substantial expenence and understanding o f the procurement
environment in Afghanistan through its involvement in the intenm procurement
arrangements put in place through EPAP as well as with the institutions with current
responsibility for those and the subsequent arrangements, namely ARDS. As part o f the
broader review o f Afghanistan's Public Finance Management (PFM) system, the Bank
camed out an assessment o f the procurement environment in the country based on the
baseline and performance indicators developed by a group o f institutions led by the
World Bank and OECDDAC.

The first key issue identified through the procurement assessment was the need for
ownership and a champion in the Government for reform, deepening o f capacity,
ensmng integnty in the operation o f procurement systems, and promoting sound
procurement among ministnes.

A new Procurement Law has been adopted in November 2005 which radically
transforms the legal and regulatory framework. While it provides a very modern legal
system for procurement, it may be difficult to implement in the current context. The
Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) has now been established under the M O F to ensure
implementation through the creation of secondary legislation, standard bidding
documents, provision o f advice and creation o f the necessary information systems for
advertising and data collection. It further relies on the development o f an independent
complaints review mecharusm to ensure enforcement. These institutional arrangements
are yet to be inplace.

Inthe absence of adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some
intenmarrangementshave beenput inplace to improve the procurementmanagement o f
the country    A central procurement facilitation service has been established under
A R D S which i s supervised by the Ministry o f Economy The Bank and the Government
has agreed on a program for country wide procurement reform and capacity building,
leading to the transition from centralized to decentralized procurement services. The
Bank funded Public Administration Capacity Building project (PACBP) i s the pnmary
instrument for implementingthe program to strengthen capacity o f the line ministnes to
manage public procurement in an effective, transparent and accountable manner.
However, the implementation o f the procurement capacity building strategy has not
made any significant progress yet due to lack o f coordination and delays in decision
making within the Government.       The envisaged radical changes to the procurement
management environment expected from the new Law also require the urgent
implementation o f a comprehensive human resources and capacity development
program. The implementation of the procurement reform component o f the PACBP
should be considered with due pnonty to ensure that fiduciary standards are further
enhanced and that capacity i s developed inthe Government to maintain these standards.

 A. General

 Procurement for the Avian and Human Influenza Project would be camed out in
 accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and
 IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
 Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y 2004, and the provisions stipulated
 in the Legal Agreement. The vanous items under different expenditure categones are
 described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different
 procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification,
 estimated costs, pnor review requirements, and time fi-me are agreed between the
 Recipient and the Bank inthe Procurement Plan. The Pr~curementPlanwill be updated
 at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
 improvements ininstitutional capacity.

 Procurement of Works: Works procured under this project would include: facility
 renovations each contract estimated to cost around US$ 30,000 intwo hospitals inKabul
 and two provincial hospitals to establish isolation wards, rehabilitation o f office space
 for command and control unit, excavation o f pits for manual bunal o f carcasses from
 slaughtered birds.Provincial Health Departments will be responsible for canyng out t h s
 component. Works contracts will be awardedcamed out as required in accordance with
 paragraph 3.5 - 3.8 o f Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Provincial Health Departments
 with the assistance of consultants (UN agencies) will implement the works contracts.
 The procurement will be camed out using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents
 (SBD) for all ICB andNational SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for all NCB.
 Threshold for NCB works will be USD 500,000 per contract and for shopping will be
 50,000 per contract.

 Procurementof Goods:Goods procuredunder this project would include (i)
 Procurement o f emergency requirements ofPPEs, vaccines, diagnostic kits andmedical
 supplies(ii)  Poultry Vaccines for emergency vaccination (iii) Vehicles (iv) motor cycles
 (v) bicycles (vi) Equipment and supplies for Emergency Response Teams (six packages)
 for Animal Health (vii) office equipment and fbrniture (viii) Office Equipment,
 Furnitureand other Equipments'(Five lots) (ix) Procurement o fequipment for sample
 collection, storage and special equipment to capture birds (intwo packages) (x)
 Communication Equipmentfor CCU and Surveillance Unit (inthree packages)
 The procurement will be done usingthe Bank's SBD for all ICB andNational SBD
 agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for all NCB. Procurement o f the above
 equipment, drugs and consumables will be carned out following ICB, NCB, Shopping
,andDirect Contractingprocedures as per the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Most o f
 the UNAgencies based inAfghanistan are already involved incarryng out preliminary
 activities to control avian influenza. These organizations have extensive expenence in
 handling similar work worldwide.

 The government agencies lack capacity to procure the urgentlyneeded goods to cater to
 a rapidoutbreak o fAI. Therefore, it i s proposedto contract WHO and UNICEF for the
 procuremento f first year requirementso f drugs, vaccines, specialized test equipments


                                     55

. andsupplies and other specialized matenal inaccordance withparagraph3.9 o fBank's
  Procurement Guidelines. Threshold for N C B goods will be USD 200,000 per contact
  and for shoppingwill be US$lOO,OOO per contract. However, package# 2 under goods
  will beprocured following shoppingprocedures as theywill beneeded inan emergency
  situation and ICB will not be an appropnate procurement procedure for the above
  package, therefore, on exceptionalbasis we have agreed to follow shopping procedure
  for package# 2 inthe procurement plan.

  Selection of Consultants: There will be several major consultancy contracts under the
  project, including:
  (a) For Human Health: (i)Developing guidelines, procunng antiviral, conducting
  simulation exercises and pandemic planning (ii)Strengthening of Health Care System
  Capacity-National andthree RegionalReferral Centers;
  (b) For h m a l Health: (i)Preparation o f manuals, guidelines, training, and Epid.
  Survey; and

  (c) Communication Component: Training, Production o f AI educational matenals Radio
  Broadcasts to raise awareness.

  Some o f these assignments for project year one will be contracted to appropnate UN
  agencies following Single Source Selection Procedure. There will also be several

January 2006 and it was found that the existing Ministry staff does not have adequate
expenence for handlingBank financed projects.

To mitigate this nsk, the mimstry will be strengthened by a competent procurement
specialist to carry out procurement action under the project and train the ministry
procurement staff.

The procurement specialist will be responsible for managing procurement for: (i)      the
animal health component based on technical specifications provided by the Department
o f Vetennary Services; and (ii)the communications component, based on t e c h c a l
specifications provided by the relevant MA1departments. The procurement specialist, if

Ministry o f Public Health. The Bank made an assessment o f the capacity o f the
procurement staff o f MOPHto implement part of the procurement actions for the project
in April 2006 and it was revealed that the existing personnel does not have adequate
expenence for managing Bank financed projects. To mitigate the nsk, the following
arrangement will be adopted for the Project:

a) a competent procurement specialist will be hired under Grant and Contract
Management Unit (GCMU) o f MOPH to procure small value o f goods, works and
consultancy contracts;

b) procurement o f highvalue and complex contracts for the first year o f the project will
be carned out through UN agencies which will be contracted as consultants under the
project.

Because o f the overall responsibility o f MA1 for implementing the Project, all
procurement for the public health component will be carned out incollaborationwith the
IST based in MAI. To ensure compliance with the World Bank policy and procedure,
procurement documentation for complex and large value o f goods, works and
consultancy contracts will be carned out with consultation o f the ARDS.

            APPENDIX 7-FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements


CountryIssues

The Bank has gained substantial expenence and understanding o f the financial management
environment inAfghmstan through the large number o f projects under implementation over the
past four years. The Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP) i s the pnmary
instrument to continue and enhance the fiduciary measures put inplace dunng the past years to
help ensure transparency and accountability for the funding provided by the Bank and other
donors.
A PFM performance rating system using 28 high-level indicators that was developed by the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnershp program was
applied in Afghanistan in June 2005       PEFA   IS  compnsed o f the World Bank, IMF, EC, and
several other agencies.      The system is structured around six core dimensions o f PFM
performance: i)budget credibility, ii)comprehensiveness and transparency, iii)policy-based
budgeting, iv) predictability and control in budget execution, v) accounting, recording, and
reporting, and vi) external scrutiny and audit.           Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM
performance indicators generally portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and
large, being used for their intendedpurposes. Thshas been accomplished with very high levels
o f support from international firms; this assistance will continue to be needed over the medium
term ifthese ratings are to be maintained. There i s also muchroom for improvement.

Inspite of undeniable gains made inreconstruction since the end o f 2001, the challenges facing
Afghanistan remain immense; not least because o f the tenuous secunty situation in the region
and continued prevalence o f a large illegal and illicit economy The policy framework
benchmarks have not yet been fully costed so vanous pnonties are funded through the annual
budgeting process. The nsing costs o f the secunty sector constitute the major constraint on
attainment o f fiscal sustainability With regardto executive oversight, the national assembly will
play an increasingly active role. All in all, the new national strategy has created high
expectations o f the executive which could prove to be quite difficult to meet.

The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions, remains extremely
weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff in the civil service and the absence o f
qualified counterparts in the government after 30 years or war and conflicts is a binding
constraint. Delays in reforming the pay structure and grading o f civil servants have severely
crippled the public administration of the country Domestic revenues lag behindexpendituresby
a factor o f ten to one. Large-scale corruption could emerge to undermine the government's
efforts to enhance aid flows through national accounts. Capacities to track expenditures and
monitor expenditure outcomes have improved, but they need rapid and substantial strengthening
ifprogress toward the attainment ofnational development targets is to bemonitored. Currently,
75 percent o f external revenues bypass government appropnation systems.

The World Bank is financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the Ministry o fFinance,
an Audit Advisor to assist the Control and Audit Office, and a Procurement Advisor to assist in
Procurement-related activities. Also an Internal Audit h c t i o n i s being developed within the
Ministry o f Finance with World Bank financing. USAID and earlier the Indian Aid Assistance
Program are also financing a team o f consultants and advisors to assist the D a AfghanistanBank
in local as well as foreign currency operations. The activities carned out under the existing
Public Administration projects have helped the Government to ensure that appropnate fiduciary
standards are maintained for public expenditures, including those supported by the Bank and the
donor community.

Progress has been slower than expected in shiftingfrom operations support provided by the three
Advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the civil servants. Given that, it i s
expected that the Advisors will continue to be required for the medium term. Challenges still
remain in attaining the agreed upon fiduciary standards and also to further enhance them. And to
make matters more complex, the regulatory environment in Afghanistan has advanced
significantly in the past three years. Unfortunately, even mastery o f basic skills in the early
environment does not fully qualify the civil servants to work effectively in the new emerging
environment.

Strengths andWeaknesses

Strengths

The Government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in place to
ensure appropnate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented. The Government support for
PACBP i s strength in itself to enhance financial management in Treasury operations, public
procurement, internal audit inthe public sector, and external audit by the Auditor General. This
will be the second IDA-funded grant for MAI, so the Ministry has expenence infollowing Bank
procedures.    Under the Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) MA1 has established an
Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) to oversee all aspects o f the project. The
IMST is part o f the General Department for Policy and Planning (GDPP) and includes a Lead
Facilitating Partner (LFP) involving technical and administrative specialists to train and
strengthen MA1 personnel in project implementation.             This team includes a financial
management specialist who will be responsible for developing sound financial management
procedures and training Afghan personnel responsible for financial management. In the same
way, this facility will be available to support the HAICP

Weaknesses and Action Plan

The main weakness in this project, as in many others in Afghanistan, is the ability to attract
suitably qualified and expenenced counterpart staff especially for Financial Management. The
additional staff to be fundedby the project, together with intensive training programs included in
this project, is expected to strengthen the fiduciary arrangements.

ImplementingEntity

The National Emergency Response Committee through the AI National Committee (NAIC) will
serve as the oversight body. The NAIC, through the Finance Committee (FCAI) will convene at
least every four months to review progress with implementation and review and approve work
plans and budget. The Minister MAI, as Chairman o fNAIC, will have overall responsibility for
project implementation. The relevant technical departments o f MA1 and MOPH will be
responsible for implementing the &mal        Health and HumanHealth components respectively.
Their activities will be managed by a Project Coordinator who will report to the Mimster of
Agnculture.

In order to ensure comprehensive management o f NAIC finances, a Financial Management
Officer (FMO) i s being hired in MAI to perform key project functions and to help develop
capabilities of the MAIFinance and Administration Department (FAD). T h s responsibility will
also include training staff at the national and provincial levels. The FMO will work closely with
the financial management personnel responsible for financial management o f the Project and
HLP in IMST This staffing is considered adequate for the project since the bulk o f the project
work i s expected to be contracted out to other UNAgencies like WHO, UNICEF and FA0 who
will have their own FMarrangements.

The FMO is expected to seek guidance and technical assistance from the Financial Management
Specialist o f the LFP o f HLP. The Financial Specialist IMST and his Afghan colleagues will
liaise with the Financial Management Officer (FMO) when prepanng M-16 forms (payment
orders). The Head o f the accounting department for Grant and Contracting Management Unit
(GCMU) in MOPH will take responsibility for the financial management activities o f the
component to be implemented by MOPH. This department is adequately staffed with FM
personnel who are efficiently managing all external grants includingIDA Health Sector Project.
The present capacity i s adequate to absorb FMwork related to AIC project.

Budgeting

The budgets for respective components would be prepared in the responsible line ministry, i.e.
MA1 and MOPH and included in the development budget for the line ministry These will
however, be consolidated for the project at the AI Secretanat.

Because limited capacity exists within MA1 to manage the external budget, the FMO with
support fi-om the Specialist under HLP will strengthen the financial management capacity of
MAI. The FMO will be responsible for ensunngthat projects expenditures expended ina fiscal
year are captured in the Governmental Development budget o f that fiscal year. The MA1must
get an approval from the presidential office and the parliament to be attached to B27 and PCS
forms at the time o f requesting yearly allotments for contracts under development project to
avoid delays when payments are processed.         Similarly G C M U will be responsible for this
function inMOPH.




                                               69

FundsFlow

The standard mechanism o f flow o f funds inAfghanistanwill be followed inthis project. Project
funds will be deposited inthe Designated Account (DA) to be opened and maintained at the D a
Afghanistan Bank (DaB).       The DA, in keeping with current practices for other projects in
Afghanistan, will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in the Treasury
Department o f MoF Requests for payments out o f the DA will be made to the SDU by the
implementing entity when needed.

Inaddition to payments out ofDA funds, the implementing entities could also request the SDU
to make direct payments from the Grant Account and Trust FundAccount to consultants, firms,
and contractors and special commitments for goods contracts covered by letters o f credit. These
payments will follow the World Bank procedures. All project payments are expected to bemade
to either international firms or local firms that have bank accounts in DaB, a local commercial
bank, or an overseas bank. All payments will be made either through bank transfers into the
account o f such firms or by check. All expenditures for each component will be paid centrally
from MA1and MOPH respectively in accordance with the approval mechanisms documented in
the FMManual.

Retroactive Financing
Retroactive financing o f up to US$l,OOO,OOO   IS envisaged for government financed expenditures
related to start-up activities between 15th June 2006 and when the grant i s signed. The
retroactive finance can be claimed only after the grant becomes effective and all disbursement
conditions have beenmet.

Accounting

The SDU will maintain a proper accounting system o f all expenditures incurred along with all
the supporting documents to enable IDA to venfy these expenditures. The Financial
Management Officer and the government counterparts in MA1 and FM Staff o f GCMU in
MOPH will: i)supervise preparation of supporting documents for expenditures, ii)prepare
payment orders (Form M16), iii)obtain approval for M-16s by the Minister or Deputy Minister
dependingon the payment amount, and iv) submit them to the Treasury DepartmentinMoF for
venfication and payment. Whilst onginal copies o f required supporting documents are attached
to the Form M16, the project i s requiredto make and keep photocopies of these documents for



                                            71

their record purposes. The FMAdvisor inthe MoF/SDU will use the government's computenzed
accounting system, AFMIS for reporting, generation o f relevant financial statements, and
exercising controls.

Currently, all records o f payments by MA1 are filed manually However, the Financial
Management manualto be prepared for the project will establish a simple tracking and reporting
system in the General Department for Policy and Planning o f MAL The FMO and the
government counterpart will train existing MA1 staff to record project expenditures in
spreadsheets for maintenance o f accurate and timely financial data. The FM manual, to be
reviewed and approved by the Bank will include roles and responsibilities o f all FM staff,
documentation and approval procedures for finds transfers in each o f the subprograms, project
reporting requirements, and quality assurance measures to help ensure that adequate internal
controls and procedures are inplace and are being followed.

The FM Manual will also establish project financial management in accordance with standard
Afghan government policies andprocedures, including use o fthe government Chart o fAccounts
to record project expenditures. The use o f these procedures will enable adequate recording and
reporting o f project expenditures. Overall project accounts will be maintained centrally in SDU,
which will be ultimately responsible for recording o f all expenditures and receipts in the
Government's accounting system. Reconciliation o f project expenditure records with M o F
records will be carned out by the General Department for Policy and Planning together with the
Financial Management Officer and assigned FM staff in GCMU for MA1 and MOPH
respectively. Consolidated project accounts will be maintained centrally in MoF through the
SDU in the Treasury Consolidated project financial statements will be prepared for all sources
and uses of project finds.

DisbursementArrangements

Table 1 shows the allocation o f IDA proceeds and Table 2 the expected co-financing. A single
category for "goods, works, consultancy services, training, audit and operating costs" i s defined
in the financing agreement to facilitate preparation o f withdrawal applications and record-
keeping. Because there are specific disbursement conditions attached to the Compensation
Facility, there i s a separate disbursement category for this component. Project funds will be
disbursedover 36 months. The closing date o f the project will be March 31, 2010 with a final
disbursement deadline four months after the closing date.

Dunng this additional 4-month grace penod, project-related expenditures incurred pnor to the
closing date are eligible for disbursement. Disbursements procedures set out in the Bank's
DisbursementGuidelines (May 2006) and "Disbursement Handbook for World Bank Clients              "
(May 2006) are applicable to this project.

                 APPENDIX 8 -Environment and Social Safeguards Framework


                      Environmental assessment: Environmental Category B

1. Environmental Aspects. The Project is assessedas a Category B Project. Activities under the
proposed Project are expected to generate no or limited adverse environmental effects, since
most activities o f the Project are considered to support preventive measures. The Project will,
generally, have positive environmental and social impacts as the project's investments in
facilities, equipment, laboratones, and training will improve the effectiveness and safety o f
existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures. This would be reinforced by the
mainstreamingo f environmental safeguards into the protocols andprocedures for the culling and
disposal o f animals dunng AI outbreaks, decontamination o f production facilities, and
laboratones. However, adverse environmental health impacts, mainly unintentional from the
spread o f HPAI, could occur when an emergency operation involves containment o f HPAI
outbreaks through quarantine, isolation and stamping out actions and when relevant mitigation
measures are not in place. Most o f the key potential impacts could be avoided or minimized by
integrating environmental and public health safety aspects in the preparatioddesign and
implementation o fthe project activities.

2. Worker Safety       The suggested investments in health facilities, equipment, clothes, staff
training and management o f the waste will improve the safety and effectiveness o f Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) handling and testing procedures. The PIM to be prepared
pnor to the disbursement should include these provisions.

The project will help the Government of the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan in developing
strategies to manage future outbreaks o f infectious and zoonotic diseases that may emerge and
re-emerge. The Environmental and Social Safeguards will be benefited from this iri two major
ways: (i)  Environmental safeguards will be mainstreamed into protocols and procedures for the
inspection and disposal o f animals dunng an outbreak in due consideration o f OLE standards,
and (ii)Policies on compensation for poultry owners affected by future outbreaks will be
developed.

Social Issues

There are no Social Safeguards tnggered by the project, which will have significant positive
social impact by protection o f human lives through HPAI early warning,          prevention and
containment, improved poultry farming practices, increased public awareness o f HPAI and
improved hygiene and food preparation practices and waste management. Development o f
compensation policies to affected poultry owners will contribute to mitigate the effects of losses
suffered from HPAIpandemic.

There will be no Land Acquisition (voluntary or involuntary) under the project, and carcasses o f
culled birds will only be deposited on public land. For backyard poultry operations, the local

committee witnessingthe culling and the local vetennanan sign a document stating the carcass
deposit area for is public property and free o f encroachers/informal settlements. Incase o f semi-
commercial poultry farms, the zonal vetennanan and an official from the local administration
will sign a document stating that the carcass deposit area is public land and free of
encroachers/infonnal settlements.

InAfghanistan, almost all poultry (98 percent) is raised infamily backyards rather than inlarge
commercial poultry farms. There are an estimated 250 small artisan incubators and only one
commercial hatchery that operate parttime". According to the NRVA, an average o f 86 percent
of rural households have poultry - at a rate o f 4 ammals per household (2003)16, w h c h is a
reduction o f almost 2/3 compared to the situation in 1995 (before the drought), where the
average number o f birds per household were 11.6. In all but two provinces, more than 75
percent o f rural households own poultry - the exceptions being Badghis (25 percent) and
Jawzjan (57 percent). Through the RAMP project, poultry production has been promoted in 25
distncts o f Ghazni, Kunduz, Nangarhar andParwanprovinces.

The pnmary poultry production system i s the traditional backyard system where small numbers
o f domestic fowl are raised for home consumption with small, mostly seasonal surpluses being
soId in village markets. Women and children are the main tenders o f ammals in the rural
households, and unlike the larger livestock, poultry is normally considered the property of
women, who would normally control any income generated from the sale o f poultry and eggs.
Hence, village-based scavenger and semi-scavenger systems are owned and operated by women,
whereas semi-commercial poultry producers are exclusively men and are based in urban and
semi-urban areas.l7 With the preponderance o f village-based scavenger system, women and
children are thus highnsk groups inrespect o f H P A I and women andpoor households ingeneral
will in particular suffer economically from the HPAI, since poultry is one of the very few
income sources for women, and an important source o f supplementary foodincome particular in
poor households.

While women are the main poultry owners, cultural restnctions on their mobility and social
interaction prevents them for being engaged inthe marketing o f poultry and eggs, which is thus
an entirely male domain. Live farm chickens and eggs either being sold at farm gate to collectors
or sold on the local markets directly to local consumers or to collectors. Young boys may retail
eggs produced by the family in rural penodic markets and pen-urban markets. The
collectors/middlemen will sometimes buy the chickens and eggs from the rural women through
barter, payng for the poultry and eggs in commercial goods particularly aimed at female
customers. Collectors transport the live chickens to urban centers for sale by retailers in the
urban live poultry markets, where different species of poultry (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese,
guinea fowl) are kept in cages, which are not cleaned or disinfected regularly Evenvisibly sick
birds are attempted sold off before dyng, and in case o f culled birds, they are normally not

cages ingeneral merchandise shops with foodstuff.

People usually prefer buyng a live bird and kill it themselves at home as it i s considered
healthier than buyng a slaughtered bird, since the meat i s fresh and frozen chicken can spoil
before reaching the retailer due to the many interruptions inthe cold storage chain." Chicken i s
a very popular food in Afghanistan, often served to guests and invanably at special occasions
such weddings, engagements, funerals and religious festivals like Eid. While both poultry and
eggs normally are fully cooked when consumed, food handling practices in general are far from
safe. Eggs are usually consumed inthe momng, but boiled eggs are also sold as a snack in the
bazaar and at bus stations. Like in case o f chickens, there i s a strong preference for Afghan
produced brown eggs ("national eggs") which consumers consider healthier than white eggs
("machine eggs", imported from Pakistan or Iran), since they have a larger yolk. Brown eggs
sells for twice the pnce o f whte eggs, but cover only around 10percent o f the market (ibid).

Special measures are required (a) to reach the pnmarily female poultry producers and assisting
children with sufficient information, training and mobilization to prevent the spread o f Avian
diseases. (b) to change household level behavior inpoultry raising, improved hygiene and food
preparation practices and waste management food through awareness raising and community
mobilization campaigns; (c) likewise, the identification o f the disease and the culling o f birds
have to involve significant community mobilization and awareness raising in view o f the
preponderance o f small domestic poultry units where cultural restnctions on the mobility and
social interaction o f women poultry owners render outreach activities, identification and culling
o f sick birds difficult and necessitates recruitment o f female field staff.

3   The following are the potential adverse effects for each o fthe GPAIactivities:

Animal Health Component:
      a)       Improving HPAI Prevention and Control Planning.               There are no foreseen
               potential adverse effects but emphasis is put on country preparedness. Country's
               Emergency Contingency Plan to include all institutional, financial and human
               resources and arrangements to deal with adverse environmental impacts from
               prevention and control activities.

      b)       Strengthening o f vetennary services. Training o f vetennary workers to include
               procedures for safe handling o f AI matenals and refurbishing o f reference and
               health clinics, include key environmental issues related to zoonotic disease
               containment and waste management practices.

               birds, bird products or waste (eggs, manure and feathers) and equipment (for
               example inopen containers) may pose environmental andpublic healthnsks.

      d)       Safe disposal o f carcasses. A practical and samtary system for disposing of dead
               birdswill help prevent the spread o fdisease andprotect air andwater quality

Human Health Component: Refurbishing o f reference diagnostic laboratones (if any),
refurbishing o f referral hospitals and health clinics and training o f staff to include key
environmental issues related to zoonotic disease prevention and special waste management
(laboratones, clinics and hospitals).

Public Awareness and Coordination Support Component: No environmental issues, but an
important component for design and delivery o f communications tools for good hygiene, safe
culling and disposal o f animal carcasses and animal waste management.

Implementation Support and Critical Imports (ifapplicable): No environmental issues.

The pnmary potential key nsks can be grouped into two categones:

  a)    Inadvertent human exposure and spread o f the virus due to: improper culling and
        disposal of dead birds (wild birds, sick and dead birds from backyard and commercial
        poultnes); lack of, or improper personal protection equipment (PPE); improper disposal
        of farm waste (Le. bedding, manure, washngs, etc. dunng andor after an outbreak); lab
        and hospital/medical, and

  b)    Inadvertent release o f chemicals inthe environment from unsatisfactory decontamination
        procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, andtransport vehicles, etc.).

An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for carcass, excreta and waste (eggs, manure and
feathers) disposal facilities is attached (Attachment 1to this appendix). However, it i s important
to note that the EMP will be further revised and updated with the evolving situation and
conditions inthe country with regardto AI. The necessary adjustments inthe scope of the EMP
will be specified dunngthe initial phases o fthe project implementation. While the EMPis being
finalized, the project will follow the initial EMP andthe operating procedures to manage and
monitor potential negative impacts o f the disposal o f carcasses, excreta, litter, contaminated
soils, disposal equipmentinaccordance with the advice o f a technical specialist to the Project
Management Team. These Provisions will be included inthe Project Implementation Manual
(PIM) to be readypnor to disbursement, and updated as necessary to reflect any changes or
additions to procedures recommended inthe EMP

To prevent further spreadingo f H5N1,surveillance indomestic poultry as well as inwild birds
should be strengthened inthe country as it i s along migrating birdroutes. Resources shouldbe
focused on the reduction o f close contacts betweenhumans, domestic poultry and wildlife
through better management practices and improved biosecuntypractices inpoultry production
enterpnses, especially those that are small and 'open-air'- where domestic poultry and waterfowl
are allowed to mingle with wild birds.



                                                81

Officials would also need to monitor 'wet' and wildlife markets, where wild and domesticated
species are kept inclose proximity, which are at nsk o f exposure to a wide range o fpathogens.
Limitingcontact with wild birds shouldtherefore bepart o f any avian influenza control strategy
To protect domestic poultry, vaccination should be considered as a tool for the prevention and
control o fHPAIinat nsk situations.,The control o f avian influenza infection inwild bird
populations at this stage, i s not feasible - from a logistical, environmental andbiodiversity point
o f view hdiscnminate culling o f wild migratory birdpopulations would be ineffective in
preventing further spread o f avian influenza and their huntingwould likely cause dispersion o f
the birds.

The investments in laboratory facilities, equipment and staff training will improve effectiveness
and safety o f avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international standards
established by OIE. If there are existing guidelines from other projects, for the handling of
medical waste generated in health care facilities, such guidelines will be adapted. The Project
will also support updating o f these guidelines, training o f healthcare workers to manage medical
wastes according to these guidelines and, ifnecessary, the purchase o f equipment for the proper
handling and disposal o f medical waste in participating facilities. These provisions will be
included inthe PIM.

The Project will assist the government in developing a strategy for managing future emerging
and re-emerging zoonotic and infectious disease outbreaks. Such a strategy would improve
environmental and social safeguards inthree areas: (i)       mainstreaming environmental safeguards
into protocols and procedures for the stamping out and disposal o f animals dunng an outbreak,
in particular by adopting OIE standards; (ii)improving understanding of the relevant
practitioners o f waste management systems in health facilities; and (iii)     developing policies on
compensation for poultry farmers affected by future outbreaks.

As an emergency operation under OP/OD 8.50, the safeguard documents are not requiredto be
preparedand disclosed pnor to appraisal. However, it is expected that the EMP for the carcass
disposal facilities will need to beprepared and disclosed pnor to the appraisal.

Strategic Communication. The Project is designed to promote awareness, consensus building,
support buy-inon mitigation measures by the Afghan public and stakeholders on the Avian and
Human Influenza Control and Preparedness Emergency Project in the country. This strategy is
predicated on the fact that pandemic will be slowed down by everyday behavior change, which
is in turn determined by information and beliefs, and also by sheer plain habit. One o f the
lessons learned elsewhere around the world from the AIDS epidemic i s that public information
alone does not necessarily generate action. People's response i s contingent on social networks,
social beliefs and how they affect behavior as well as resource availability in their community
Government's role i s to provide enabling policies for restoration o f public health infrastructure
and preparedness at individual, community and national levels, developing training courses in
communication methodology and techniques for apcultural extension and vetennary staff,
health workers, NSP social organizers/facilitators information and National Onentation staff at
national, local government levels as well as community based groups, such as, CDCs, CBOs, the
traditional shuras and etc.

The Project is designed to safeguard human health, in particular for extension staff, animal
health workers, poultry producers and their families, by improving public awareness and
information. Support will be provided for information and communication activities to increase
the attention and commitment of government, pnvate sector, and civil society organizations, and
to raise awareness, knowledge and understandingamong the general population about the nsk
and potential impact o f the pandemic. It will also involve conducting a rapid social and hygiene
assessment to investigate household and individual health-related behaviors within `their
complex, rational matnx of personal, organizational, and social realities. The assessment will
explore opinions, attitudes, behavior, and motivations o f affected communities, leading to
understanding o f health, livelihood and other social development issues relevant indesigning an
effective communication strategy

In Afghanistan, raising chicken is one o f the means o f income generating activities and
livelihood strategy, and many o f poor farmers and peasants live in close proximity with their
flocks and depend on poultry production for their survival, often in remote areas. Unlike in
some other countnes, where poultry production i s largely concentrated in huge enterpnses, the



                                              83

scattered and small holdings in Afghanistan pose enormous problems for controlling any
outbreak.

The fact that the virus o f Avian Influenza does not recognize national boundanes, Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) strategy should address the migratory nature o f wild birds
carryng the virus across the borders.

The new environmental law is givingNEPA the mandate o f ensunngthe Environmental
Management inthe country ingeneral andparticularly among other issues o f the transboundary
environmental issues and making regulations with regardto EIA o fprojects. Inthis case NEPA
and its partner UNEP could beplayng a vital role inmaking sure that relevant major
environmental concerned are adhered to and capacity i s developed inthe relevant implementing
agencies to comply with the stipulated laws as far as possible given the conditions inthe
country

A. Introduction

The project will include two major categones o f interventions: (i) emergency or short-term
interventions geared to control and prevent the spread and outbreak o f Avian Influence threat
to general public in a bio-secure and environmentally fhendly manner; and (ii)   interventions
for the longer-term that aim to improve existing national capacity, systems, procedures and
public awarenessto prevent, respond effectively and rapidly to any potential AI threat, and to
control the situation in the event o f an AI outbreak.       In the initial stage of project
implementation, the focus will be on emergency interventions. Therefore, the Monitonng and
Evaluation Framework and Strategy should be capable to provide necessary information to
policy makers, and related stakeholders, including government agencies on project inputs,
outputs, outcomes and implementation performance in relation to both these two phases o f
interventions. Lessons learned during the emetgency phase will also be a learning exercise
for the government to refine and fine tune medium term interventions thgt will continue
beyond the emergency phase.

B. M&EApproach

The AHIP places significant emphasis on M&E and sees it as a vehicle for ensunngthat the
envisaged activities fully reflect the changing environment. The monitonng and evaluation
(M&E) system is intended to provide information to the relevant stakeholders on project
implementation performance, process, outputs, and outcomes.

There are a number o f cntical aspects that need to be monitored in order to achieve the
objectives o f this operation.  In view of the high nsks posed by the AI threat and the
emergency nature o f the project as well as lack o f pnor expenence with similar projects in
the country, the M&E system will be dynamic and reflect the changing environment and             '

conditions. The iterative and dynamic M&E approach would ensure that the changing
environment and lessons learned from implementing the project will be reflected in the
ensuing project activities. Such an arrangement will and can help emergency response team
and task forces as well as implementing agencies and partners to introduce early corrective
measures, which would lead the project to achieve its stipulated objectives in a dynamic
fashion. A dynamic and continuous monitonng and evaluation system will be established to
ensure that the project implementation fully reflects the changing environment and i s
sufficiently flexible to alter the direction and implementation modality o f the project.
Lessons learned from this project will not only feed into the design and implementation
strategies of the subsequent phases o f the project but will also contribute to improving the
design and implementation o f other similar projects inthe country

B.1Organization for M&E

The ultimate responsibility for national level M&E will rest with the National AI Secretanat
(NAIS). A Project Coordinator will be appointed for implementing the Project and this
person will work in team with the public health and animal health coordinators for technical
implementation and in liaison with the Director General o f the General Department for



                                            90

Policy and Planning (GDPP) MA1for administrative matters and monitonng and evaluation.
An Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) has been established for
coordinating the Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) and a lead Facilitating Partner
(LFP) has been appointed to provide technical assistance specialists to work with Afghan
coordinators in IMST        The IMST i s headed by a Project Manager who - working in
collaboration with the Project Director is responsible for project implementation. Appendix
10provides all details o f the institutional arrangements proposed for the project.

The IMST includes a monitonng and evaluation specialist to help develop the operations of
the Monitonng and Evaluation Department within GDPP A full time senior officer will be
designated as M&E specialist for THE PROJECT, working as part o f the M&E team in
GDPP and in liaison with NAIS. Inaddition, the two implementing ministnes will designate
staff at their eight zone offices to keep track of project implementation progress, inputs and
outputs and to provide detailed and frequent reporting to the centre. The frequency o f
reviews and progress monitonng for the NAIS, TCAI and FCAI will be determined dunng
the project implementation depending on the levels o f nsk and emergency

Terms o f References for key Project staff, including the M&E specialist, highlighting the
scope and institutional arrangements o f the M&E system for the proposed project will be
developed as part o f the Project Operational Manual. Inview o f the emergency nature o f the
project and the consequent need to achieve efficiency and transparency in project
procurements and financial management, the M&E specialist will play an overlapping role in
monitonng some aspects of procurement and financial management o f the project as well.
The M&E specialist will work together with staff responsible for overall financial
management, establishing and enforcing transparent systems and procedures to register and
monitor the disbursement o f financial compensation to the affected poultry farmers.        In
addition, he/she will also work inclose collaboration with the relevant staff for monitonng o f
the timely implementation of the procurementplan and external and ex-post procurement and
financial management audits of the project. Some o f the most important inputs and outputs
of the project components are presented inAppendix 1. These matnces should be considered
dynamic, which will be revised from time to bme based on the expenence and lessons
learned dunng the project implementation.           In addition, the M&E specialist will be
responsible for organizing, contracting and implementing specific analytical work, research
and field studies requiredto assess the project's outcomes and impact inline with the Results
Framework (Appendix 1).         The main aspects o f the proposed M&E are outlined in the
following sections.

B.2Physical geographic monitonng

The Project M&E specialist will maintain a GIS baseddata base o f the provinces and specific
geographic locations where the AI virus has been detected and preventive and control
measures have been carned out. Necessary technical assistancewill be obtained from a local
IT company to develop the GIS system. The M&E Specialist will produce maps showing
geographical locations where H5A1 virus have been detected, culling and animal vaccination
activities have been carried out with other information and statistics such as the number o f
poultry killed and vaccinated and number of persons treated with preventive vaccines. The
M&E Specialist will: (i)through its zonal representatives, establish proper communication
channels for provincial and central level departments o f the two ministnes; and (ii)  help to
designand improve the data collection and registration formats used by the MOPH and MAI.




                                               91

He/she will also ensure that accurate data and information are collected by animal health and,
human health workers and transmit the information timely from the field to the provincial
offices and provincial offices to the Secretanat.

B.3Implementation Monitonng and Learning

The success o f the intended AI control program and the achievement o f the intended project
objectives depend in part on the speed and ability with which all the stakeholders can
respond to demands o f a changing situation and conditions. Success also depends on the
diligence with which planned control and prevention measures are implemented with
satisfactory adherence to the sanitary, environmental and safety requirements o f the program
as elaborated in Appendix 8 and partly in Appendix 2-1..          It is essential to monitor the
implementation o f the program not only focusing on the quantitatwe inputs and outputs but
also covenng the qualitative aspects o f the implementation program. For example, if the
quality o f protective clothing used by the animal heath workers i s not satisfactory or
necessary safeguard procedures are not adopted in culling and disposing culled poultry, not
only the intended benefits o f the program may not be fully achieved but further risk may also
be generated. Safety standards and appropnate procedures specific to salient implementation
aspects o f the project will be prepared and translated into local languages for implementation
in the form of an operation manual. Careful monitonng of the adherence to prescribed
procedures, standards and safeguards will therefore be a key part o f the monitonng and
learning o f the project. The monitonng o f project inputs and outputs, both inquantitative and
qualitative dimensions, will be useful for all project stakeholders, including the emergency
response team, to rectify the shortcomings on regular basis. Core aspects o f inputs and
output monitonngwith respect to the project components are illustrated inAppendix I.

B.4Outcome and Impact MonitonnP and Evaluation

The outcome and impact monitonng will be guided by the Results Framework, presented in
Appendix I.The framework shows the major outcome indicators as well as the potential use
o f the outcome indicators during project implementation. The framework also shows the
arrangements for results monitonng for each outcome indicator expressed in terms o f
baseline status, cumulative target values, frequency o f reporting, means o f venfication and
responsibility for M&E.

C. Implementation'CompletionEvaluation

At the end ofthe project, a comprehensive evaluation o fthe project outputs, outcomes and
impacts will be carned out by the AI Secretanat. The evaluation will specifically assess
whether the target set inAnnex Ihadbeen achieved at the end of the project.

IDA will producean Implementation Completion Report, which will focus on evaluating
whether the project objectives and targets for key performance indicators have been met.

A. Introduction
The institutional arrangement for the Project are based on the responsibilities and capacities
of existing departments and organizations, using operational guidelines and technical
capacity specific to the Project. Awareness o f avian influenza (AI) and its control and
containment are a preoccupation at the highest government level.

Early in 2006 the government established a National Emergency Response Committee
(NERC) at Vice President-level to address major national emergencies. However, because of
the senousness of a potential threat from avian influenza it also created a specific National
Avian Influenza Committee (NAIC) responsible for tackling prevention and control of this
disease. The NAIC i s supported by two specialized committees (Box 1).

Box 1.Various Actors inthe AI Control,Afghanistan

National Emergency Response Committee (NERC): Headed by the Vice President. This is an inter-
mnisterial level body that coordinates national level activities, policies and strateges on all national
emergencies. The c o m t t e e has recently begun discussing issues relating to the AI outbreak in the
country All policy and strategy issues, inparticular those that concern more than one rmnistry, can be
addressed in the emergency response c o m t t e e . Since the AI concerns a number o f mnistfles, this
c o m t t e e will be particularly useful in pursuing specific AI-related policies and strateges and
ensunng that all concerned rmnistries adhere to the recommendations o f the c o m t t e e . The
c o m t t e e meets twice per month, which can increase in case o f emergencies.
National A I Committee (NAIC): This body has recently been established, just before the outbreak of
AI in Afghanistan      111March 2006. It is headed by the Mimster o f MAI. The members o f the
c o m t t e e include: Ministryo f Public Health (MOPH), Ministry o f Finance (MoF), Ministry o f Rural
Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA),
Ministry o f Commerce, Ministry o f Interior and the Mimstry o f Foreign Affairs. This is the main
coordination unit for national level AIpolicies, plans o f action and activities. The NAIC reports to the
National Emergency Response C o m t t e e and is advised by two Techmcal C o m t t e e s .
Technical Committeefor A I (TCAI): The T C A I i s chaired by the General Director o f the Animal and
Plant Health, MAI and includes: Infection Department MOPH, NEPA, Kabul Municipality, FAO,
WHO, UNICEF, U N M , UNDP, Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, USAID and
DFID. The TCAI has provided guidelines, technical knowledge, data and information to the public
and the relevant field workers. The TCAI provides technical advice on all aspects o f AI control and
containment to the Provincial C o m t t e e on AI (PCAI).
Financial Committee for A I (FCAI): The FCAI i s chaired by the Deputy Mimster o f Finance and
includes a representative from the T C A I and bilateral and multilateral donors present 111the country
This c o m t t e e coordinates sources of financing and disbursements inrelation to AI activities.
Provincial A I Committee (PAIC): The PAIC is chalred by the Governor o f the respective province
and includes the following agencies at the provincial level: the Department o f Agriculture - in
particular the Vetennary Services Division, Department o f Public Health, Municipality, The Police
Department, The border police (if a bordering province), NEPA, MRRD, FAO, WHO, UNICEF and
relevant NGOs. Not all provinces have formed a provincial c o m t t e e , while efforts are underway to
establish PAICs in all provinces.

B.ProjectImplementationArrangements

Overall and ultimate responsibility for project execution, successful implementation,
accountability and outcomes will be with under a newly established Secretanat (NAIS)
hosted in the General Department for Policy and Planning (GDDP) o f the Ministry o f
Agnculture and Irngation. The NAIS i s supported by a hired Implementation Support Team
(IST) financed by the project and composed o f recruited specialists for the duration o f the
project. The positions under the IST are currently being advertised.

The IST will include an overall Project Coordinator, an Animal Health Coordinator, a
Human Health Coordinator, a Communications Coordinator, a Monitonng and Evaluation
specialist, a GIS specialist, two Financial Management Specialists, two Procurement
Specialists and a Safeguard specialist. Most o f the IST will be physically located in the
General Department for Policy and Planning (GDPP) o f the MAI, while the Human Health
Coordinator, Procurement Specialist, and Financial Management Specialist under the Human
Health component will be based in the Directorate o f Afghan Public Health Institute (APHI)
o f the MOPH.

The Project Coordinator will be nationally recruited and will report to the NAIS through the
Director General o f Livestock Services. The coordinators for each component will report to
the NAIS through the Project Coordinator.

Activities under the Animal Health Component will be organized and supervised by a
Animal Health Coordinator, nationally recruited, who for technical functions o f the project
will work in collaboration with the Director o f the Vetennary Department, MAI. Under the
responsibility o f the Animal Health Coordinator, the implementation o f the component will
be contracted to an implementing partner, which i s expected to be FA0 - subject to
agreement on the technical and financial terms and conditions. Draft TORS for the Animal
Health Coordinator have been completed.

Activities under the Human Health Component will be organized and supervised by the
Human Health Coordinator, nationally recruited, who for technical functions o f the project
will work in collaboration with the Director o f the Afghan Public Health Institute, MOPH.
The activities under the component will be outsourced to implementingpartners, expected to
be WHO and UNICEF, within framework agreements already existing with the Ministry

Activities under the Communications Component will be coordinated and supervised by a
Communications Coordinator, nationally recruited, supported by a short-term international
consultant. The implementation arrangements for the communication activities will be
subcontracted to a vanety o f partners and stakeholders, including UNICEF, the agncultural
extension and health education teams o f the MA1 and MOPH, the communications
infrastructure o f the NSP and Ministry o f Education, as well as NGOs working with media
and community-radio, subject to agreement on the technical and financial terms and
conditions.

The IST will also be responsible for Monitonng and Evaluation, Financial Management and
Procurement for the project, includingreporting.

' At the field level, the Provincial AI Committees (PAICs) will coordinate and manage AI
  activities in the respective provinces. The technical members o f the PAIC will ensure that
  implementation o f the various components o f the project are in accordance with the
  stipulated standards, regulations and social and cultural norms. The Ministers MA1and the
  MOPH will jointly ensure that Provincial AI Committees are formed and counterparts from
  each o f the two ministnes are assigned to the NAIS.

  The project will finance the employment o f Zonal coordination units (ZCUs) compnsing of
  an animal health specialist, a communication and M&E specialist and a database
  management specialist. Coordination, management, monitonng, data collection and
  tabulation, managing the flow o f information between provinces, distncts and the centre will
  be the responsibility o f the ZCUs. The ZCUs will also be responsible for monitonng AI
  related activities in their area and ensunng that agreed contracts, rules and regulations are
  fulfilled. It i s proposedthat initially the project will establish ZCUs infour regions where the
  AI outbreak nsk is high.The AHC inconsultation with DVS will determine the pnonaes for
  establishing the ZCUs in the regions. It i s necessary to appoint a qualified and expenenced
  contact person in every province, selected from the provincial staff o f the Department o f
  Animal Health, to ensure that general surveillance and awareness-raising for AI is camed out
  and specified measures are taken in case o f an outbreak. Table 1 below presents the
  definition o f regions as has been adopted by FA0 for animal healthplanning since the 1990s.
