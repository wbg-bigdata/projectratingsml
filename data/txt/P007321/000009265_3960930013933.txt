HAITI
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Credit and Proiect Summary
Borrower:         Government of Haiti (GOH)
BX  uti. A.oj-: Ministry of Economy and Finance/Economic and Social Fund (ESF)
Benefi¢iaries:    Target groups in rural and urban poverty areas to be reached
through NGOs, cooperatives and community associations.
SDRs 7.9 sillion (US$11.3 million equivalent).
Terms:             Standard, with 40 years maturity
Onlending Tern a   The GOH would pass on the funds to the ESF as a grant.  The
ESF would finance sub-projects through NGOs, cooperatives and
grass roots organizations on a grant basis.
Proiect Objectives
and Descrivtion:  The objectives of the project would be to:  (i) establish an
effective mechanism, the Econosic and Social Fund (ESF), as
a means of responding flexibly and efficiently to the basic
needs of the poor through NGOs, cooperatives, comunity
associations and other grass roots organizations; (ii) assist
the GOH to improve health, nutrition and education services
and  provide   physical   infrastructure,   and   employment
opportunities to the poor; (iii) provide an effective channel
for critically required donor financing and coordinate
domestic efforts that are currently fragmented; and, (iv)
strengthen the capacity of comunity groups, cooperatives and
other grass roots organizations in preparing and implementing
projects.
The proposed operation would consist of a project component
and an institutional development component.   The project
component (US$10 million, IDA contribution) would address the
needs of the poor in health and nutrition, education and
physical infrastructure.   Financing would be provided for
(i) health and nutrition projects primarily for children,
pregnant and lactating mothers, rehabilitation and construction
of  primary  health  care  facilities,  essential  drugs,
immunization, construction of small water supply systems,
small-scale sewerage systems and latrines (US$6.4 million);
(ii) rehabilitation and construction of pre-school centers and
primary schools, provision of school furniture and pedagogic
material, literacy and vocational training programs (US$2.5
million); and (iii) rural market and social service access



(ii)
roads and related drainage works (US$1.0 aillion); and advisory
services to participating organizations (US$.1 million).
The institutional development component (US$1.3 million) would
finance administrative and technical assistance to the ESP,
including salaries for selected ESP staff, equipment (vehicles
and computers), consultant services and operating costs.
Benefitst         Benefits would bet   (i) poverty alleviation through the
provision of services and facilities in health, nutrition and
education to the urban and rural poor with emphasis on women
and children; (ii) improvement in the physical infrastructure
closely tied to the needs of rural comunities; (iii)
employment creation; (iv) strengthening the capabilities of NGOs
and grass roots organizations in prepraring and implementing
projects; and (v) providing an effective mechanism to
complement governeent efforts in delivering development
assistance directly to the rural and urban poor.
Risks:            Possible risks include: (i) political uncertainty, which could
have a negative impact on the ESF credibility, its
directorship, on the confidence of NGOs and grass roots
organizations and their willingness to be associated and work
with the Government; (ii) the untested capacity of the ESF to
maintain a good and a capable working team, maintain
transparency regarding its finances, and withstand pressures
to finance projects for political purposes. Carefully selected
and technically competent staff, a well defined manual on
operating procedures and project eligibility criteria, a good
information system, well established accounting procedures,
close supervision and quarterly reports with a mid-term review
of operations will help to minimize the above risks. Agreements
were reached during negotiations that the operating policies
and procedures of the ESF, and the Director would not be
changed without IDA's consent.

HAITI
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. XACROECONOIIIC SETTING
1.1   Haiti's economic deterioration since the curtailment of foreign assistance
in 1987 has generated and accelerated a macroeconomic crisis. Real GDP declined
by 1.5% in FY 1988 and 0.5% during FY 1989 (ending September 30). Inflation,
which had been eliminated in FY 1987, reemerged in FY 1988, increased to 15% in
FY 1989, and is projected to accelerate unless the public sector can
significantly reduce its use of Central Bank financing.  A parallel market,
which began to operate in the early 19809 with a premium ranging between 5% in
periods of fiscal and political stability, reached 40% in late 1989, largely as
a result of excessive public sector credit and attempts by the Government to
control the foreign exchange market. During the first half of 1990 the premium
has stabilized to around 50%.
1.2   The export assembly sector, which had been the most dynamic sector in the
economy since the 1970s, has been severely affected with an estimated loss of
10,000 to 12,000 jobs in the last two years. Coffee rust, hurricane damage and
the recent collapse of the International Coffee Agreement have devastated coffee
exports, which were expected to be only US$26 million in FY 1989 or less than
half their value in FY 1986.
1.3   The loss of foreign assistance and the decline of exports are also
partially responsible for a significant deterioration in the balance of payments
and foreign exchange situation. Balance of payments surpluses of around US$30
million in FYs 1986 and 1987 hiave since deteriorated from a US$17 million
surplus in FY 1988, to a US$12 million deficit in FY 1989. As a result, liquid
foreign exchange holdings fell in mid-1989 to US$8 million, representing the
equivalent of just over one week of imports. Arrears on foreign debt increased
from US$12 million at the end of FY 1987 to US$28 million in June 1989.
1.4   The Government, which took office in September 1988, initially attempted
to deal wisely with the mounting inflationary and foreign exchange pressures by
adopting a balanced budget for FY 1989. However, a loss of expenditure control,
poor revenue performance, and weak management of the public enterprises, have
produced mounting deficits and a growing need for Central Bank financing.
Public sector net use of Central Bank financing amounted to 2.4% of GDP for the
FY ending 1989.   This contrasts with the more restrained use of domestic
financing in FYs 1987 and 1988, equivalent to 0.8 and 1.1 percent of GDP,
respectively.
1.5   In response to the deteriorating situation, a 15-month Stand-by of SDR 21
million was agreed between the Government and the IMF in September 1989. The
stabilization program provided for a reduction of domestic financing of the
public sector deficit from an estimated 2.4% of GDP in FY 1989 to 0.6% in FY
1990. As part of th3 program, in early September 1989 the Government adopted
decrees/regulations broadening the coverage of the value added tax, increasing
customs valuations by 30% to reflect the exchange rate in the parallel market,



-2-
and raising the price of flour by 10%.  The program committed the government to
raise electric rates by 8%.  The Government also agreed to limit spending by
salary freezes and improved control of public enterprises.
1.6   The economy remains depressed, unemployment has risen to around 40%, and
inflation has moderated to an annual rate of 20%.   Except for residential
construction, private investment remains depressed, and the assembly sector is
stagnant. Although the Government was able to keep expenditures down, on the
revenue side, it was however, unable to meet the agreed targets of the
stabilization program.  The IMF stand-by program is currently in abeyance.
2. THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND
Institutional Structure and Staffing
2.1   A Presidential Decree establishing the Economic and Social Fund was
published  in the Moniteur of June  3,  1990  (see Annex  1).   An  "Arrete
Presidentielle" appointed the Director General of the ESF on July 10, published
in the Moniteur of July 12, 1990.   The ESF is designed to operate as an
autonomous unit under the auspices of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. It
has full juridical status, as well as administrative, technical and financial
autonomy. It is exempted from the standard civil service regulations, including
salary levels, to enable it to pay sufficiently high salaries to draw qualified
and experienced local staff, Haitians living abroad, and foreign consultants as
needed.  No specific termination date has been set.  However, at the end of
three years of operation, an evaluation will be carried out to determine its
future.
2.2   The ESF is governed by a Board composed of nine members, including the ESF
Director as the Executive Secretary. Of the nine members, three are from the
public sector and six from the private sector representing NGOs and grass roots
organizations.   The Board would define and oversee the policies of the ESF,
approve the operating manual, review and approve the annual budget and the
action plan.  A draft operating manual and draft project evaluation criteria
have been prepared under the PPF. Lessons o- experience from the ESP projects
in Bolivia have been taken into account in e igning the proposed operation.
2.3   The ESF is headed by a Director Ger.  ,l who would be assisted by an
executive committee including four departn    directors (administration and
finance, promotion, evaluation, and monitor  I and follow-up).   The Director
General and the department heads would form  .ae executive committee and would
meet at least once a week to approve projects. Technical experts would be hired
as needed on a part-time basis to review pro acts and make recommendations to
the executive committee.
2.4   The Decree defines the broad objective.s and structure of the ESF and
leaves wide discretion and operational flexibility to the Director regarding
day-to-day operations, personnel administration, project selection and approval.
The ESF Director would also be responsible for securing financing from bilateral
and multilateral sources.   The current Director General and four key higher



-3-
level staff have been chosen in close cor.sultation with IDA and other donors.
Consultants have also been hired to assist ESF to establish the unit price
mechanism to be used for direct contracting and to set up an accounting system.
The total number of ESF staff at full implementation is estimated at 27
including 17 professionals.
Functions and Approach
2.5   The principal functions of the ESF would be the following:  (i) promotion
of projects; (ii) distribution of program resources; (iii) evaluation and
approval of projects; (iv) entering into contracts with executing agencies; (v)
disbursing funds and tracking their execution; (vi) establishing information
systems to monitor project flows and collect information on impact indicators;
(vii) administering the receipt and disbursement of funds; (viii) internal
monitoring and evaluation; and, (ix) fundraising.
2.6   Line ministries have neither the budgetary nor the implementing capacity
or mechanisms in place to respond quickly and efficiently to the needs of the
poor, especially in the rural areas. This situation has been aggravated with
the suspension of foreign aid since the 1987 aborted elections. The Government
is endorsing this alternative channel to complement its social investment
strategy in a rational and decentralized manner. The ESF would receive support
from the line ministries and closely coordinate its work at the local community
level so as to complement rather than duplicate -their efforts (See para. 10.9).
The ESF would strengthen the ongoing process of active involvement of community
groups in responding to their own needs.  Special attention would be paid to
targeting activities that are complementary and mutually reinforcing.
2.7   The ESF would have a comparative advantage in financing small, short-
term,technically simple projects that can be implemented at the community level.
ESF benefits are more likely to reach the intended beneficiaries by working with
a vast majority of private institutions that are in direct contact with the
communities.
3.   SOCIAL SECTORS
Social Indicators
3.1   Haiti's 6.2 million inhabitants occupy 28,000 km (over 200 inhabitants per
km).  With a per capita GNP of only US$360, Haiti is the poorest country in
Latin America and the Caribbean. Nearly 70% of the urban population and 80% of
the rural population are below the poverty line. Three-fourths of all Haitians
live in rural areas.  Declining rural incomes have led to substantial rural-
urban and international migration. The population is growing at 1.6% per annum,
net of an emigration rate of 0.5%, while the urban population is expanding by
4%. The infant mortality rate of 119 per 1,000 is close to the average of Sub-
Saharan Africa; maternal mortality rates approach 367 per 100,000; and child
mortality 22 per 1,000, while life expectancy is estimated to be 54. Nearly 65%
of the adult population does not know how to read or write. Only some 20% of
the population has access to potable water.



-4-
Health and Nutrtition
3.2   The health status of the Haitians, as indicated above, is at the bottom
of the scale in Latin America and the Caribbean.   The causes are multiple
varying from lack of access to basic health facilities, inadequate food intake,
and inadequate environmental sanitation including lack of safe water.
3.3   Health.      Diseases often associated with underdevelopment,  such an
diarrhea,   tetanus,   measles,   malaria,   intestinal   parasites,   typhoid,
poliomyelitis, and TB, account for the highest portion of the mortality and
morbidity rates mentioned earlier.   Diarrhea alone accounts for 75% of the
registered deaths during the first year of life, for 50% of deaths in the 1-4
age group, and for 20% of the total number of deaths registered in the country
during the early 1980s. Infectious and parasitic diseases are major causes of
morbidity and mortality among adults and children. The incidence of malaria is
increasing due to weakened vector control and the dismantling of the National
Endemic Disease Service, an agency that ran into serious funding problems after
the 1987 cut of external assistance.  AIDS has reached epidemic proportions.
As of February 28, 1990, Haiti had reported 2,331 AIDS cases.  Most of these
diseases could be prevented or treated early at relatively low cost through
adequate oral rehydration, immunization and health education programs.
3.4   Nutrition.  Malnutrition is strongly associated with illness in Haiti and
is a major factor in the high child mortality rate. In a 1987 survey, 27% of
the children were severely or moderately malnourished, and only one-quarter of
children under five years of age were in the normal range of weight. The causes
of malnutrition are multiple and include inability of many families to acquire
required food, and inadequate environmental sanitation, including lack of safe
water.
3.5   The target population of those considered at risk for malnutrition include
867,000 children under five years old, 300,000 pregnant women and 139,000
lactating mothers. Malnutrition rates vary only slightly by geographical region.
on the whole, urban areas tend to have less malnutrition than rural areas, but
studies done on marginal urban neighborhoods show pockets of poverty with worse
malnutrition levels than those in rural areas.
3.6   As pointed out in a USAID study on nutrition programs in Haiti:  "Haiti
is one of the most experimented countries in tie world with respect to
nutritional programs".   Nonetheless, malnutrition indicators continue at an
alarmingly high level. The cause of this is twofold: first, stagnant household
incomes have restrained poor peoples' ability to buy or produce their way out
of malnutrition; and second, the institutional context for delivering
nutritional services, including direct food aid, is characterized by a
dispersion of efforts, weak administrative capacity, lack of accountability and
sustainability.
3.7   Five types of nutrition interventions are offered by the public and
private organizations operating in Haiti:   (i) Direct Food Aid:   channelled
mainly through school feeding programs with little targeting and limited
monitoring for individual programs. Seventy-five percent of public schools and



-5-
35% of private schools are covered. However, coverage is restricted since only
about 60% of school aged children are enrolled;  (ii)         Nutrition Programs
Within Health Services:   The current strategy  is to  in.tegrate nutrition
activities into the health delivery system. These programs typically include
food supplements, nutritional surveillance and nutritional education;   (iii)
Nutrition Programs Within Child Care Services: A small number of activities are
carried out  through  child care  centers.    These projects  perform growth
monitoring and nutritional rehabilitation for the malnourished; (iv) Vertical
Vitamin Supplement Programs: The Ministry of Health and selected NGOs provide
targeted vitamin supplements, particularly Vitamin A, to mothers and children
through existing health and community education programs; and (v) Programs to
Increase  Household  Food  Production:    These  programs  combine  nutritional
education with a food production component.
3.8   Key institutions working in nutrition programs include the World Food
Program, USAID Food Aid Affiliates (Catholic Relief Service, CARE and ADRA),
Foster Parents Plan, Centers for Health and Development (CDS), and the Ministry
of Health. The scale and scope of programs carried out by these institutions
is detailed in Annex 5.
3.9   Due to concerns about the complexity of administration, su3tainability and
accountability of nutrition programs especially food programs, ESF would
primarily channel efforts into facilitating distribution and logistical support
to programs mentioned in para 3.7 above.  For example, in coordination with
agencies that administer food aid programs, ESF would finance projects providing
logistical support for day care centers, targeting malnourished children,
pregnant and lactating mothers. ESF would selectively finance the purchase of
food in cases where shortages arise and the current food distribution system
cannot provide support. The largest impact on nutrition of the ESF may not occur
in nutrition projects themselves, but in complementary areas of activities, such
as potable water and sanitation services.   A study of a sample of projects
supported by Catholic Relief Services shows that project intervention with the
greatest impact on nutritional status are water and sanitation, and not health
services or food aid.
3.10    Water Supply and Sanitation.  Potable water supply has top priority,
especially for rural communities. Water supply and sanitation service levels
in Haiti are the lowest in the Western Hemisphere with only 20% of the
population having access to safe water.   Sanitation conditions in Haiti are
highly deficient, sewerage systems are nonexistent. Lack of access to potable
water is further aggravated by the country-wide depletion of forests, leading
to reduced rainfall.    Incidence of water-related diseases  is common and
particularly affects infants and children.  The lack of proper latrinization
contributes substantially to water pollution by human excreta and related
diseases. The TPTC (Ministry of Public Works) is responsible for overall sector
management.   It supervises the two agencies responsible for operating and
maintaining the water supply facilities in the country---the Centrale Autonome
Metropolitain d'Eau Potable (CAMEP) which supplies water to the Port-au-Prince
metropolitan area and Service National d'Eau Potable (SNEP) which is responsible
for providing water supply services to the rest of the country. A water and
sanitation entity for secondary cities and rural areas called Postes
Communautaires d'Hygiene et d'Eau Potable (POCHEP) has become quite active in



-6-
recent years.   In addition, NGOs have become increasingly involved in the
financing of small rural water supply systems.   The POCHEP and NGO financed
systems are in most cases turned over to SNEP for operation and maintenance upon
completion.    Improved sector coordination  is evident  in the inter-agency
standardization of the pumps used in providing rural water supply, thereby
greatly facilitating pump maintenance and the availability of spare parts.
3.11    The main sector objectives are to improve operation and maintenance of
the  existing  water  supply  systems  and  expand  coverage.    Institutional
constraints relating to the operational weaknesses and poor financial condition
of CAMEP and SNEP have led to greater NGO involvement in the sector.
3.12    The Health Care System.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for
all government policies and public activities in health. The MOH is one of the
largest ministries, representing 11% of the fiscal budget in 1987. The Ministry
oversees the following autonomous entities:   the University Hospital;  the
Haitian Agency for the Creation of Commune Pharmacies--an externally financed
pharmaceutical procurement and distribution agency which is being restructured
in the aftermath of the suspension of foreign aid; and POCHEP--responsible for
the  development  of  rural  water  supply  systems.    Underlying  financial,
organizational, and managerial weaknesses have undermined the Ministry's
capacity to implement the health policy defined in the GOH Nouvelle Orientation
de Sante (1982).
3.13     Operations are divided into four geographic regions.  Regional offices
are charged with administering and supervising the execution of health
interventions by the public sector.  The regional office acts as the liaison
between the district level and the center, orchestrating district planning and
budgeting.   The district is the most decentralized level of administration.
There are 15 districts in Haiti, comprised of 20 sub-districts and 136 communal
sections. Health districts are staffed by an administrative unit which oversees
the functioning of hospitals, health centers and dispensaries.
3.14    The major shortcomings that limit the effectiveness and efficiency of
service delivery at the district level include: (i) an inefficient allocation
of financial resources; the district level has no control over the amount of
resources made available to it by the central level, and much of its operating
budget goes to pay additional salaries or is absorbed by listrict hospitals;
(ii) an imbalance in the distribution of human resources; under the present
institutional structure, the district level has little control over staffing
decisions, and wide disparities exist in staffing patterns throughout the
country; (iii) inadequate logistics and planning; because of the limited
operating budget at the local level, insufficient attention has been given to
support services such as building maintenance, drug distribution, and purchase
of materials and equipment;  (iv) limited management information;  a general
reluctance of health institutions to submit reports stems from the fact that
feedback from the central level is very seldom received;  and (v) lack of
supervision; despite the existence of norms, the supervision carried out in the
field is very limited.
3.15    Other providers of health services include NGOs, which run 50% of the
health facilities in Haiti. NGOs have operated mostly autonomously, which has



-7-
led to a lack of integration of NGO programs into the planning and information
systems of the health sector.   In 1982, the Association of Private Health
Organizations (AOPS) was established as an umbrella organization to coordinate
NGO activities in the health sector and integrate them with the public sector
activities.   AOPS main objective is to provide primary health care  (PHC)
services--in particular vaccination, growth monitoring, education, and family
planning (FP)--to mothers and children.  AOPS's initial goal of covering one
million people by 1988 has not been attained. Coverage was estimated at 300,000
at the end of 1988. The creation of AOPS has not increased the integration of
activities between the private and public sectors.
3.16    Health  Financing.   In light of Haiti's overall poverty,  aggregate
expenditures for population, health and nutrition services are substantial.
Funding of health expenditures reached 5% of GNP in 1987, and per capita
spending increased (in current US$) from US$14.4 to US$23.2 in the 1981-87
period. The budget of the MOH has increased over the past few years reaching
US$29 million or 16% of total government expenditures in 1987 from levels
fluctuating in the 11-16% range over the past few years. Following large salary
increases in 1982 and 1987, and continuous hiring of personnel (over 40%
increase in 10 years), personnel related expenses reached 87.5% of the
Ministry's budget in 1988. Charges to patients are defined at the central level
for all categories of institutions.   Bilateral and multilateral assistance
(excluding water sanitation projects) represented an average disbursement of
about US$12-13 million a year over the past five years.   However, political
circumstances have resulted in the withdrawal of a significant portion of
external support. Most significant, the large USAID program (about US$5 million
per year) has been curtailed and is now being channelled entirely through the
private sector.
3.17    There  are  three  principal  sources  of  financing  sector  services.
Households use a portion of their income to pay for such services directly to
providers.    This  includes  all  direct  payments  made  to  physicians  and
institutions for medical care and drugs, as well as payments for traditional
medicine (healers, midwives). This component is the largest source of funding,
representing 41% of national expenditures for population, health, and nutrition
activities. The second source, or about 23% of total expenditure is the portion
of government revenues used to finance health services. The third source, about
36% of total funding is externally provided funds, both public and private,
which are used to pay for the current operating expenditures of many private
clinics and hospitals, particularly in rural areas, and for nearly all public
investment.
3.18    The main donor agencies in the sector are as follows:   USAID is
financing child survival and family planning programs with Haitian NGOs, and
contributes over US$5 million a year; the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, similarly channel
their aid to NGOs and focu3 on integrated development projects. UNICEF and PAHO
have collaborated with the MOH in the implementation of priority PHC coverage
of children under five. The United Nations Fund will be allocating a total of
US$2.3 million in the next four years for maternal health and family planning
interventions. The Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) is currently financing
pre-feasibility studies in the areas of nutrition, upgrading of tertiary care



-8-
facilities and implementation of integrated referral systems. The first IDA
financed Health Project aims at assisting the Government in rationalizing the
allocation of resources for primary health care and implementing in the Western
health region a Basic Health Services Delivery Model based on the Government's
stated primary health care policy.
3.19    Obiectives and Aywroach of the ESF in the Health\Nutrition Sector.  The
objectives of the ESF in the health\nutrition sectors would be to: (i) help the
Government target scarce existing resources more effectively to reach the most
;ulnerable among the poor to improve their health and nutrition status; (ii)
help decentralize and improve health, nutrition, and basic sanitation services,
in particular in rural areas; and (iii) over the long run, strengthen the
capacity of community groups and municipalities to plan and implement health
projects and programs.
3.20    The proposed project would finance small-scale community-based projects
that target those segments of the population that are disadvantaged
economically, socially, and by their geographic access to services, and whose
health\nutrition needs are the greatest. The following illustrative indicators
of extreme poverty would be used: (i) infant mortality rates; (ii) malnutrition
rates among children 0 to 5 years old; (iii) availability of potable water and
latrines; (iv) percentage of school children attending school; and (v) existing
health infrastructure available to community.
3.21    Categories  of  Health  and  Nutrition   Sub-Proiects.           Eligible
health/nutrition sub-projects would be defined in accordance with the following
considerations: (i) consistency with the Government's priority programs in the
sector; (ii) capacity to reach the poorest segments of the population, and to
effectively improve their health/nutrition status; and (iii) benefits to women
and children. The following broad categories of projects would be considered:
(i) primary health care infrastructure; (ii) primary health care supplies and
drugs; (iii) immunization; (iv) epidemic control; (v) information and education;
(vi) training; (vii) day care\preschool nutrition programs; (viii)nutrition
programs   in health posts having the capacity to administer food programs,
vitamin A and iron supplements;and (ix) water supply and basic sanitation.
3.22    Detailed descriptions of sub-projects and specific criteria for project
eligibility are given in Annexes 3, 4 and 5.
Education
3.23    Education in Haiti suffers from low primary school enrollment and poor
quality. The enrollment ratio in grades one to six is only 50%, despite steady
increases over the last two decades. The private sector has absorbed the bulk
of the rising demand for education, with its contribution to primary education
having increased from 40% in 1973 to 72% toiay. Quality is low, especially in
the private rural schools. About 80% of teachers have less than seven years of
basic education. IDA's sixth Education Project under preparation would help the
Government to formulate policies including private sector eligibility criteria,
curricula, selection of textbooks, strengthen the planning and accounting system
of the Ministry of Education and improve access and quality of basic education
through teacher training.



-9-
3.24    Public expenditures in education have grown in 1987 from about 1.5% of
GNP to over 2.5%. The increased expenditures went mostly to upgrade teachers'
salaries to the average level of the public sector. The ratio of salaries to
operating expenses, amounting to 90% in 1986, increased to 93% in 1989. The
salary increase was not coupled with upgraded training, supervision and access
to didactic material and as a result did not yield an improvement in the quality
or accessibility of public schools, but exacerbated the salary problem among
private school teachers.
3.25    Organization and Institutions.  Although the Ministry of Education has
the responaibility to formulate and implement education policy, it has failed
to commit the necessary resources to meet the growing demand for education.
Unlike  most  developing  countries,  the  public  sector  plays  a minor  and
diminishing role in education in Haiti.   The private sector that plays the
dominant role is not homogeneous.  Private schools are operated by profit and
non-profit institutions, religious and lay organizations, with quality varying
widely.
3.26    Church based schools, that represent the great majority of private
schools, were the first to engage in an organizational process that has allowed
for greater formal and informal control over the schools.  The Federation of
Protestant Schools (FEPH) and the Association of Catholic Schools (CEEC) took
a further step in September 1988 when they joined efforts to create a secular
institution, the Fondation Haitienne de l'Enseignement Prive (FONHEP), to
promote the interests of primary education. Non-denominational schools are more
heterogeneous, a factor that has hampered current organizational efforts.
Attempts are being made by the Association des Ecoles Privees de Port-au-Prince
(ADEPP) to organize these schools.
3.27    Organization of the private sector has started recently in primary
education, with a view to improve quality and efficiency, especially for the
schools serving disadvantaged,  primarily rural areas.   It aims to improve
coordination among private schools, and also with the Government and with
external  donors.    The  "Projet  Bilateral  d'Education"--PROBED  (Bilateral
Education Project) funded by USAID, has financed and supported the FONHEP and
has been an important vehicle in this process.  It has built up on existing
institutions,  church based and lay schools.   However, organization of the
private sector is still fragile and incomplete for primary education and
nonexistent at other levels of the education sector.
3.28    The Education System:  Primary Education.  In 1982, the Government of
Haiti formulated an educational reform program as part of its New Orientation
Policy Statement. The program included: (i) a redefinition of the school cycle
to comprise two cycles of primary education (years 1-4 and 5-7) followed by
three years of basic secondary education; (ii) achievement of functional
literacy by the end of the first primary cycle; (iii) introduction of new
curricula; (iv) adoption of Creole as the language of instruction in the primary
cycles; (v) improvement of school supervision and inspection.
3.29    The reform program although well received, was too centralized and
overly ambitious, given the sector's financial and administrative capacity and



-10-
the conflicts involved, particularly in the use of Creole.  The results were
disappointing:   by 1989, only one-third of all primary school students were
enrolled in schools covered by the reform.
3.30     The Government which came to power in February 1986 modified some
elements of the reform. Both Creole and French may now be used in the primary
schools, and primary education was reduced from a total of 7 to 6 years. Also,
the Government increased teachers' salaries by 70%, bringing them in line with
the rest of the civil service. The wage hike was intended to attract and keep
qualified teachers and to promote the enactment of the reform.
3.31    The wage increase, however, had two adverse consequences.  First, it
left no budgetary allocation for an increase in non-salary current expenditures,
including maintenance costs, and second, it widened wage differentials with the
private sector (US$50\month private vs. US$175 public). The Government tried
to alleviate the pressure on the private sector by providing wage supplements
and subsidies to poor private schools with financing from the IDA-financed
Fourth Education Project, allocated through FONHEP, CEEC and FEPH. Expenditures
for supplies, repairs and maintenance were further reduced, thus further
aggravating the inefficiency in primary education.
3.32    Pre-primarv Education.  Less than 5% of children under six have access
to pre-school centers which generally accept children between the ages of 5 and
6. Some 10,000 children attend 200 public centers and 40,000 other attend 800
identified private centers. Most programs include a nutrition program, which
is particularly important for children under 6 (the population with the greatest
likelihood of developing handicaps related to malnutrition).
3.33    Programs for pre-primary education have developed with the support of
foreign assistance, including the Community Integrated Nutrition and Education
Centers Program (CINEC) supported by USAID-CARE. The Ministry of Education has
selected this program as the nationwide model for the sector.   UNICEF is
supporting a community-based program, where 63% of the recurrent costs are
covered by the community, thus ensuring continuation after the life of the
project.  A new project sponsored by UNICEF is defining a national policy in
coordination with the Ministry of Education, aimed at increasing pre-school
enrollment by 50,000 through informal programs.
3.34     Secondary Education.   This sector essentially depends on private
schools, which comprise 84% of all schools.  Most schools are located in the
capital and are beyond most Haitians' ability to pay.
3.35     Vocational and Technical Training.  This sector is poorly developed and
in need of relevant programs directed at specific skill creation and employment
opportunities.    The education reform program  stressed the  importance  of
developing vocational and technical training, but no significant action has been
initiated. A Directorate (Institut National de Formation Professionnelle-INFP)
in the Ministry of Education is in charge of technical education, directly and
through other departments in other ministries. INFP has developed programs for
on-the-job training, for training in the informal sector and for the starting
of new businesses.   Private sector institutions are heterogeneous and have
developed without coordination among church-sponsored centers, industry-



-3-
level staff have been chosen in close cor.sultation with IDA and other donors.
Consultants have also been hired to assist ESF to establish the unit price
mechanism to be used for direct contracting and to set up an accounting system.
The total number of ESF staff at full implementation is estimated at 27
including 17 professionals.
Functions and Approach
2.5   The principal functions of the ESP would be the following:  (i) promotion
of projects; (ii) distribution of program resources; (iii) evaluation and
approval of projects; (iv) entering into contracts with executing agencies; (v)
disbursing funds and tracking their execution; (vi) establishing information
systems to monitor project flows and collect information on impact indicators;
(vii) administering the receipt and disbursement of funds; (viii) internal
monitoring and evaluation; and, (ix) fundraising.
2.6   Line ministries have neither the budgetary nor the implementing capacity
or mechanisms in place to respond quickly and efficiently to the needs of the
poor, especially in the rural areas. This situation has been aggravated with
the suspension of foreign aid since the 1987 aborted elections. The Government
is endorsing this alternative channel to complement its social investment
strategy in a rational and decentralized manner. The ESF would receive support
from the line ministries and closely coordinate its work at the local community
level so as to comy..ement rather than duplicate their efforts (See para. 10.9).
The ESP would strengthen the ongoing process of active involvement of community
groups in responding to their own needs. Special attention would be paid to
targeting activities that are complementary and mutually reinforcing.
2.7   The ESF would have a comparative advantage in financing small, short-
term,technically simple projects that can be implemented at the community level.
ESF benefits are more likely to reach the intended beneficiaries by working with
a vast majority of private institutions that are in direct contact with the
communities.
3.   SOCIAL SECTORS
Social Indicators
3.1   Haiti's 6.2 million inhabitants occupy 28,000 km (over 200 inhabitants per
km).  With a per capita GNP of only US$360, Haiti is the poorest country in
Latin America and the Caribbean. Nearly 70% of the urban population and 80% of
the rural population are below the poverty line. Three-fourths of all Haitians
live in rural areas.  Declining rural incomes have led to substantial rural-
urban and international migration. The population is growing at 1.6% per annum,
net of an emigration rate of 0.5%, while the urban population is expanding by
4%. The infant mortality rate of 119 per 1,000 is close to the average of Sub-
Saharan Africa; maternal mortality rates approach 367 per 100,000; and child
mortality 22 per 1,000, while life expectancy is estimated to be 54. Nearly 65%
of the adult population does not know how to read or write. Only some 20% of
the population has access to potable water.



-4-
Health and Nutrition
3.2   The health status of the Haitians, as indicated above, is at the bottom
of the scale in Latin America and the Caribbean.   The causes are multiple
varying from lack of access to basic health facilities, inadequate food intake,
and inadequate environmental sanitation including lack of safe water.
3.3   Health.      Diseases often associated with underdevelopment,  such as
diarrhea,   tetanus,   measles,   malaria,   intestinal   parasites,   typhoid,
poliomyelitis, and TB, account for the highest portion of the mortality and
morbidity rates mentioned earlier.   Diarrhea alone accounts for 75% of the
registered deaths during the first year of life, for 50% of deaths in the 1-4
age group, and for 20% of the total number of deaths registered in the country
during the early 1980s. Infectious and parasitic diseases are major causes of
morbidity and mortality among adults and children. The incidence of malaria is
increasing due to weakened vector control and the dismantling of the National
Endemic Disease Service, an agency that ran into serious funding problems after
the 1987 cut of external assistance.  AIDS has reached epidemic proportions.
As of February 28, 1990, Haiti had reported 2,331 AIDS cases. Most of these
diseases could be prevented or treated early at relatively low cost through
adequate oral rehydration, immunization and health education programs.
3.4   Nutrition.  Malnutrition is strongly associated with illness in Haiti and
is a major factor in the high child mortality rate. In a 1987 survey, 27% of
the children were severely or moderately malnourished, and only one-quarter of
children under five years of age were in the normal range of weight. The causes
of malnutrition are multiple and include inability of many families to acquire
required food, and inadequate environmental sanitation, including lack of safe
water.
3.5   The target population of those considered at risk for malnutrition include
867,000 children under five years old, 300,000 pregnant women and 139,000
lactating mothers. Malnutrition rates vary only slightly by geographical region.
On the whole, urban areas tend to have less malnutrition than rural areas, but
studies done on marginal urban neighborhoods show pockets of poverty with worse
malnutrition levels than those in rural areas.
3.6   As pointed out in a USAID study on nutrition programs in Haiti:  "Haiti
is one of the most experimented countries in the world with respect to
nutritional programs".   Nonetheless, malnutrition indicatcrs continue at an
alarmingly high level. The cause of this is twofold: first, stagnant household
incomes have restrained poor peoples' ability to buy or produce their way out
of malnutrition; and second, the institutional context for delivering
nutritional services, including direct food aid, is characterized by a
dispersion of efforts, weak administrative capacity, lack of accountability and
sustainability.
3.7   Five types of nutrition interventions are offered by the public and
private organizations operating in Haiti:   (i) Direct Food Aid:  channelled
mainly through school feeding programs with little targeting and limited
monitoring for individual programs. seventy-five percent of public schools and



-5-
35% of private schools are covered. However, coverage is restricted since only
about 60% of school aged children are enrolled;  (ii)         Nutrition Programs
Within Health Services:    The current  Btrategy  is to  integrate nutrition
activities into the health delivery system. These programs typically include
food supplements, nutritional surveillance and nutritional education;   (iii)
Nutrition Programs Within Child Care Services: A small number of activities are
carried out  through  child care centers.    These  projects  perform  growth
monitoring and nutritional rehabilitation for the malnourished; (iv) Vertical
Vitamin Supplement Programs: The Ministry of Health and selected NGOs provide
targeted vitamin supplements, particularly Vitamin A, to mothers and children
through existing health and community education programs; and (v) Programs to
Increase  Household  Food  Production:    These  programs  combine  nutritional
education with a food production component.
3.8   Key institutions working in nutrition programs include the World Food
Program, USAID Food Aid Affiliates (Catholic Relief Service, CARE and ADRA),
Foster Parents Plan, Centers for Health and Development (CDS), and the Ministry
of Health. The scale and scope of programs carried out by these institutions
is detailed in Annex 5.
3.9   Due to concerns about the complexity of administration, sustainability and
accountability of nutrition programs especially food programs, ESF would
primarily channel efforts into facilitating distribution and logistical support
to programs mentioned in para 3.7 above.  For example, in coordination with
agencies that administer food aid programs, ESF would finance projects providing
logistical support for day care centers, targeting malnourished children,
pregnant and lactating mothers. ESF would selectively finance the purchase of
food in cases where shortages arise and the current food distribution system
cannot provide support. The largest impact on nutrition of the ESF may not occur
in nutrition projects themselves, but in complementary areas of activities, such
as potable water and sanitation services.   A study of a sample of projects
supported by Catholic Relief Services shows that project intervention with the
greatest impact on nutritional status are water and sanitation, and not health
services or food aid.
3.10    Water SuDDly and Sanitation.  Potable water supply has top priority,
especially for rural communities. Water supply and sanitation service levels
in Haiti are the lowest in the Western Hemisphere with only 20% of the
population having access to safe water.   Sanitation conditions in Haiti are
highly deficient, sewerage systems are nonexistent. Lack of access to potable
water is further aggravated by the country-wide depletion of forests, leading
to reduced rainfall.    Incidence of water-related diseases  is common and
particularly affects infants and children.  The lack of proper latrinization
contributes substantially to water pollution by human excreta and related
diseases. The TPTC (Ministry of Public Works) is responsible for overall sector
management.   It supervises the two agencies responsible for operating and
maintaining the water supply facilities in the country---the Centrale Autonome
Metropolitain d'Eau Potable (CAMEP) which supplies water to the Port-au-Prince
metropolitan area and Service National d'Eau Potable (SNEP) which is responsible
for providing water supply services to the rest of the country. A water and
sanitation entity for secondary cities and rural areas called Postes
Communautaires d'Hygiene et d'Eau Potable (POCHEP) has become quite active in



-6-
recent years.   In addition, NGOs have become increasingly involved in the
financing of small rural water supply systems.  The POCHEP and NGO financed
systems are in most cases turned over to SNEP for operation and maintenance upon
completion.    Improved sector coordination  is evident  in the inter-agency
standardization of the pumps used in providing rural water supply, thereby
greatly facilitating pump maintenance and the availability of spare parts.
3.11    The main sector objectives are to improve operation and maintenance of
the  existing  water  supply  eystems  and  expand  coverage.    Institutional
constraints relating to the operational weaknesses and poor financial condition
of CAMEP and SNEP have led to greater NGO involvement in the sector.
3.12    The Health Care System. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for
all government policies and public activities in health. The MOH is one of the
largest ministries, representing 11% of the fiscal budget in 1987. The Ministry
oversees the following autonomous entities:   the University Hospital; the
Haitian Agency for the Creation of Commune Pharmacies--an externally financed
pharmaceutical procurement and distribution agency which is being restructured
in the aftermath of the suspension of foreign aid; and POCHEP--responsible for
the  development  of  rural  water  supply  systems.    Underlying  financial,
organizational, and managerial weaknesses have undermined the Ministry's
capacity to implement the health policy defined in the GOH Nouvelle Orientation
de Sante (1982).
3.13     operations are divided into four geographic regions.  Regional offices
are charged with administering and supervising the execution of health
interventions by the public sector.  the regional office acts as the liaison
between the district level and the center, orchestrating district planning and
budgeting.   The district is the most decentralized level of administration.
There are 15 districts in Haiti, comprised of 20 sub-districts and 136 communal
sections. Health districts are staffed by an administrative unit which oversees
the functioning of hospitals, health centers and dispensaries.
3.14    The major shortcomings that limit the effectiveness and efficiency of
service delivery at the district level include: (i) an inefficient allocation
of financial resources; the district level has no control over the amount of
resources made available to it by the central level, and much of its operating
budget goes to pay additional salaries or is absorbed by listrict hospitals;
(ii) an imbalance in the distribution of human resources; under the present
institutional structure, the district level has little control over staffing
decisions, and wide disparities exist in staffing patterns throughout the
country; (iii) inadequate logistics and planning; because of the limited
operating budget at the local level, insufficient attention has been given to
support services such as building maintenance, drug distribution, and purchase
of materials and equipment;  (iv) limited management information; a general
reluctance of health institutions to submit reports stems from the fact that
feedback from the central level is very seldom received; and (v) lack of
supervision; despite the existence of norms, the supervision carried out in the
field is very limited.
3.15    Other providers of health services include NGOs, which run 50% of the
health facilities in Haiti.  NGOs have operated mostly autonomously, which has



-7-
led to a lack of integration of NGO programs into the planning and information
systems of the health sector.   In 1982, the Association of Private Health
Organizations (AOPS) was established as an umbrella organization to coordinate
NGO activities in the health sector and integrate them with the public sector
activities.   AOPS main objective is to provide primary health care  (PHC)
services--in particular vaccination, growth monitoring, education, and family
planning (FP)--to mothers and children.  AOPS's initial goal of covering one
million people by 1988 has not been attained. Coverage was estimated at 300,000
at the end of 1988. The creation of AOPS has not increased the integration of
activities between the private and public sectors.
3.16    Health Financing.   In light of Haiti's overall poverty,  aggregate
expenditures for population, health and nutrition services are substantial.
Funding of health expenditures reached 5% of GNP in 1987, and per capita
spending increased (in current US$) from US$14.4 to US$23.2 in the 1981-87
period. The budget of the MOH has increased over the past few years reaching
US$29 million or 16% of total government expenditures in 1987 from levels
fluctuating in the 11-16% range over the past few years. Following large salary
increases in 1982 and 1987, and continuous hiring of personnel (over 40%
increase in 10 years), personnel related expenses reached 87.5% of the
Ministry's budget in 1988. Charges to patients are defined at the central level
for all categories of institutions.   Bilateral and multilateral assistance
(excluding water sanitation projects) represented an average disbursement of
about US$12-13 million a year over the past five years.   However, political
circumstances have resulted in the withdrawal of a significant portion of
external support. Most significant, the large USAID program (about US$5 million
per year) has been curtailed and is now being channelled entirely through the
private sector.
3.17    There  are  three  principal  sources  of  financing  sector  services.
Households use a portion of their income to pay for such services directly to
providers.    This  includes  all  direct  payments  made  to  physicians  and
institutions for medical care and drugs, as well as payments for traditional
medicine (healers, midwives). This component is the largest source of funding,
representing 41% of national expenditures for population, health, and nutrition
activities. The second source, or about 23% of total expenditure is the portion
of government revenues used to finance health services. The third source, about
36% of total funding is externally provided funds, both public and private,
which are used to pay for the current operating expenditures of many private
clinics and hospitals, particularly in rural areas, and for nearly all public
investment.
3.18    The main donor agencies in the sector are as follows:   USAID is
financing child survival and family planning programs with Haitian NGOs, and
contributes over US$5 million a year; the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, similarly channel
their aid to NGOs and focus on integrated development projects. UNICEF and PAHO
have collaborated with the MOH in the implementation of priority PHC coverage
of children under five. The United Nations Fund will be allocating a total of
US$2.3 million in the next four years for maternal health and family planning
interventions. The Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) is currently financing
pre-feasibility studies in the areas of nutrition, upgrading of tertiary care



-8-
facilities and implementation of integrated referral systems. The first IDA
financed Health Project aims at assisting the Government in rationalizing the
allocation of resources for primary health care and implementing in the Western
health region a Basic Health Services Delivery Model based on the Government's
stated primary health care policy.
3.19    Obiectives and Approach of the ESF in the Health\Nutrition Sector.  The
objectives of the ESF in the health\nutrition sectors would be to: (i) help the
Government target scarce existing resources more effectively to reach the most
vulnerable among the poor to improve their health and nutrition status; (ii)
help decentralize and improve health, nutrition, and basic sanitation services,
in particular in rural areas; and (iii) over the long run, strengthen the
capacity of community groups and municipalities to plan and implement health
projects and programs.
3.20    The proposed project would finance small-scale community-based projects
that target those segments of the population that are disadvantaged
economically, socially, and by their geographic access to services, and whose
health\nutrition needs are the greatest. The following illustrative indicators
of extreme poverty would be used: (i) infant mortality rates; (ii) malnutrition
rates among children 0 to 5 years old; (iii) availability of potable water and
latrines; (iv) percentage of school children attending school; and (v) existing
health infrastructure available to community.
3.21    Catecories  of  Health  and  Nutritxon  Sub-Proiects.            Eligible
health/nutrition sub-projects would be defined in accordance with the following
considerations: (i) consistency with the Government's priority programs in the
sector; (ii) capacity to reach the poorest segments of the population, and to
effectively improve their health/nutrition status; and (iii) benefits to women
and children. The following broad categories of projects would be considered:
(i) primary health care infrastructure; (ii) primary health care supplies and
drugs; (iii) immunization; (iv) epidemic control; (v) information and education;
(vi) training; (vii) day care\preschool nutrition programs; (viii)nutrition
programs   in health posts having the capacity to administer food programs,
vitamin A and iron supplements;and (ix) water supply and basic sanitation.
3.22    Detailed descriptions of sub-projects and specific criteria for project
eligibility are given in Annexes 3, 4 and 5.
Education
3.23    Education in Haiti suffers from low primary school enrollment and poor
quality. The enrollment ratio in grades one to six is only 50%, despite steady
increases over the last two decades. The private sector has absorbed the bulk
of the rising demand for education, with its contribution to primary education
having increased from 40% in 1973 to 72% today. Quality is low, especially in
the private rural schools. About 80% of teachers have less than seven years of
basic education. IDA's sixth Education Project under preparation would help the
Government to formulate policies including private sector eligibility criteria,
curricula, selection of textbooks, strengthen the planning and accounting system
of the Ministry of Education and improve access and quality of basic education
through teacher training.



-9-
3.24    Public expenditures in education have grown in 1987 from about 1.5% of
GNP to over 2.5%. The increased expenditures went mostly to upgrade teachers'
salaries to the average level of the public sector. The ratio of salaries to
operating expenses, amounting to 90% in 1986, increased to 93% in 1989. The
salary increase was not coupled with upgraded training, supervision and access
to didactic material and as a result did not yield an improvement in the quality
or accessibility of public schools, but exacerbated the salary problem among
private school teachers.
3.25    Organization and Institutions.  Although the Ministry of Education has
the responsibility to formulate and implement education policy, it has failed
to commit the necessary resources to meet the growing demand for education.
Unlike most developing countries, the public sector plays a minor and
diminishing role in education in Haiti.   The private sector that plays the
dominant role is not homogeneous. Private schools are operated by profit and
non-profit institutions, religious and lay organizations, with quality varying
widely.
3.26    Church based schools, that represent the great majority of private
schools, were the first to engage in an organizational process that has allowed
for greater formal and informal control over the schools.  The Federation of
Protestant Schools (FEPH) and the Association of Catholic Schools (CEEC) took
a further step in September 1988 when they joined efforts to create a secular
institution, the Fondation Haitienne de l'Enseignement Prive (FONHEP), to
promote the interests of primary education. Non-denominational schools are more
heterogeneous, a factor that has hampered current organizational efforts.
Attempts are being made by the Association des Ecoles Privees de Port-au-Prince
(ADEPP) to organize these schools.
3.27    Organization of the private sector has started recently in primary
education, with a view to improve quality and efficiency, especially for the
schools serving disadvantaged, primarily rural  a1reas.   It aims to improve
coordination among private schools, and also with the Government and with
external  donors.    The  "Projet  Bilateral  d'Education"--PROBED  (Bilateral
Education Project) funded by USAID, has financed and supported the FONHEP and
has been an important vehicle in thi. process.  It has built up on existing
institutions,  church based and lay schools.   However,  organization of the
private sector is still fragile and Lncomplete for primary education and
nonexistent at other levels of the educatior sector.
3.28    The Education System:  Primary Educatiou .  In 1982, the Government of
Haiti formulated an educational reform progLam as patt of its New Orientation
Policy Statement.  The program included:  (i) a _eaefinition of the school cycle
to comprise two cycles of primary education -saars 1-4 arnd 5- ') followed by
three years of basic secondary education;  (ii) a,.hieven,ent of  functional
literacy by the end of the first primary cy^le; (iii) introduction of new
curricula; (iv) adoption of Creole as the lar.gtdge of instruction in the primary
cycles; (v) improvement of school supervision and inspection.
3.29    The reform program although well received, was too cent-alized and
overly ambitious, given the sector's financial and administrative capacity and



-10-
the conflicts involved, particularly in the use of Creole.  The results were
disappointing: by 1989, only one-third of all primary school students were
enrolled in schools covered by the reform.
3.30     The Government which came to power in February 1986 modified some
elements of the reform. Both Creole and French may now be used in the primary
schools, and primary education was reduced from a total of 7 to 6 years. Also,
the Government increased teachers' salaries by 70%, bringing them in line with
the rest of the civil service. The wage hike was intended to attract and keep
qualified teachers and to promote the enactment of the reform.
3.31    The wage increase, however, had two adverse consequences.  First, it
left no budgetary allocation for an increase in non-salary current expenditures,
including maintenance costs, and second, it widened wage differentials with the
private sector (US$50\month private vs. US$175 public). The Government tried
to alleviate the pressure on the private sector by providing wage supplements
and subsidies to poor private schools with financing from the IDA-financed
Fourth Education Project, allocated through FONHEP, CEEC and FEPH. Expenditures
for supplies, repairs and maintenance were further reduced, thus further
aggravating the inefficiency in primary education.
3.32    Pre-primary Education.  Less than 5% of children under six have access
to pre-school centers which generally accept children between the ages of 5 and
6. Some 10,000 children attend 200 public centers and 40,000 other attend 800
identified private centers. Most programs include a nutrition program, which
is particularly important for children under 6 (the population with the greatest
likelihood of developing handicaps related to malnutrition).
3.33    Programs for pre-primary education have developed with the support of
foreign assistance, including the Community Integrated Nutrition and Education
Centers Program (CINEC) supported by USAID-CARE. The Ministry of Education has
selected this program as the nationwide model for the sector.   UNICEF is
supporting a community-based program, where 63% of the recurrent costs are
covered by the community, thus ensuring continuation after the life of the
project. A new project sponsored by UNICEF is defining a national policy in
coordination with the Ministry of Education, aimed at increasing pre-school
enrollment by 50,000 through informal programs.
3.34     Secondary Education.   This sector essentially depends on private
schools, which comprise 84% of all schools.  Most schools are located in the
capital and are beyond most Haitians' ability to pay.
3.35     Vocational and Technical Training. This sector is poorly developed and
in need of relevant programs directed at specific skill creation and employment
opportunities.    The education  reform program  stressed the  importance  of
developing vocational and technical training, but no significant action has been
initiated. A Directorate (Institut National de Formation Professionnell -INFP)
in the Ministry of Education is in charge of technical education, directly and
through other departments in other ministries. INFP has developed programs for
on-the-job training, for training in the informal sector and for the starting
of new businesses.   Private sector institutions are heterogeneous and have
developed without coordination among church-sponsored centers, industry-



-11-
sponsored training programs and other profit institutions. The private sector
represents about 80% of the 500 technical training institutions.
3.36    Informal Education.  Informal education programs have concentrated on
two main areas:  literacy and community development.   Literacy programs for
adults include national campaigns as well as smaller programs directly linked
to pro4ects with other specific objectives. However, recent experiences with
national campaigns by the Catholic Church-sponsored "Mission Alpha" and the
public  program  of  the  Office  National  d'Alphabetisation  et  d'Action
Communautaire (ONAAC) have not been encouraging. They had to be terminated, due
mainly to the lack of funding and the absence of post-literacy programs for the
participants.
3.37    Community Develooment. NGOs conduct integrated projects with education/
skill training being only a component of larger projects with principal
activities in agriculture, infrastructure or health. A preliminary survey of
126 NGOs conducted by USAID in 1986 indicates that 56 institutions were involved
in informal education, 51 in adult literacy, 35 in skill development, and 39 in
agricultural training. Some successful projects include those supported by the
Catholic Relief Center and the Programme Interimaire d'Urgence supported by the
EEC. These programs are managed by local organizations, and include informal
training, i.e., management training as a component to productive projects.
3.38    Obiectives and Approach of the 3SF in the Education Sector. The general
objective of the proposed operation in the education sector will be to support
physical infrastructure as well as informal education programs in pre-primary
education, adult literacy and vocational training aimed at the rural poor. It
would: (i) help the Government to target resources to improve the quality of
existing education services for the urban and rural poor; and (iiD strengthen
the capacity of NGOs and community groups to design, implement, and manage
education projects in accordance with national priorities. Beneficiaries would
be children and adults, the latter being primarily women in rural areas.
Priority would be given to projects in underserviced poor communities, demand-
led by direct beneficiaries.
3.39     Projects will give special attention to the needs of women (pre-school
centers, vocational centers to meet the needs of working women, literacy and
post-literacy programs for mothers, and women starting their own businesses).
Broad categories of projects would include: rehabilitation and or construction
of primary schools, school furniture, pedagogic material, pre-school centers
(rehabilitation, equipment, training), vocational education (pedagogic material,
tools, training of trainers), literacy programs (furniture, books, training of
trainers), non-formal education (literacy adult programs and post-literacy
vocational programs) (See Annex 6). Sub-projects will have to be sustainable
at the termination of the ESF support.    Institutions involved in project
implementation will have to prove their capacity to pay permanent staff to
support a project, as salaries of permanent staff will not be eligible for
financing under the proposed operation.  Cost efficiency of programs will be
assessed on the basis of cost/per beneficiary and efficiency indicators such as
enrollment ratios, attendance recording, repetition and dropout rates, test
results and diplomas.



-12-
Economic Infrastructure
3.40    Rural Roads.  Only 600 kms are paved of Haiti's 3,500 kms of motorable
roads,  and the rest are gravel and dirt roads.   Roads have deteriorated
considerably in the last two years due to financial constraints emanating from
the decline in exterr%l assistance and poor domestic resource mobilization.
Government emphasis at the present in the transport sector is on maintenance and
rehabilitation of existing roads and on improvement of the road network in the
municipalities and secondary cities. It is estimated that more than 1,900 kms
of roads lack maintenance. Improvement along these lines should enable the
transport sector to play its supportive role of facilitating the flow of
agricultural and industrial goods to markets and of supporting economic exchange
between various regions.  The Government's main sectoral objectives include:
(i) the improvement and rehabilitation of roads, bridges, and ports; (ii)
strengthening of the planning, operation, and maintenance of transport
facilities; and, (iii) continued development of the sector institutions through
training and technical  assistance.   The Ministry of Transport  (TPTC)  is
increasing the involvement of the private sector in carrying out sectoral
investments. The proposed operation would focus on rehabilitation and
construction of rural roads and related drainage works, that give access to
markets, schools, and health care facilities.   Cost per sub-project in this
sector would not exceed USS150,000 equivalent.
4. PROFILE OF SUBPROJECTS - THE PILOT PHASE
4.2   Following the IDA preparation mission in April 1990, a number of NGOs,
gtass  roots  organizations  and  others-approximately  40  institutions-have
submntted 182 project proposals to be considered for financing under the
prcv.osed operation. The total cost is estimated at US$15.9 million, of which
US$ 4.8 million financing has been requested or 93% of total project cost. Of
the total number of projects 35% are in the health and nutrition sectors, 26%
in ec.'nomic infrastructure primarily rural roads, 19% in education and 20% in
produc;ive activities.  Of the total financing requested 37% is in the economic
infr-t-ucture sector, 36% in education (construction and or rehabilitation of
schools, day care centers and school equipment), 29% in health and nutrition
(construction and rehabilitation of health centers, day care nutrition programs,
dispensaries, latrines, water supply systems, immunization and community
training in basic hygiene) and 8% in productive activities (agricultural
projects including silos, reforestation etc.)
4.2   IDA will  finance only projects  in health,  nutrition,  education and
physical infrastructure primarily rural roads. Other donors would in addition
cover rural productive activities including reforestation.   The majority of
projects submitted (116 projects or 64% of total) are under US$50,000, 31% are
between US$50,000 to US$250,000 and 5% exceed US$250,000. Approximately 75% of
the projects in the health and nutrition sector, and 50% of the projects in
economic infrastructure are under US$50,000. Average project size for the sample
excluding projects above US$250,000 is US$46,000. Of the total number of
projects 148 or 81% representing 60% of the financing requested are to meet the
needs of rural communities. Cost per beneficiai  varies from US$2.50 for an



-13-
immunization project to US$80.00 for installation of water supply systems. Sub-
projects have been selected from this sample to be financed under the pilot
project included in the PPF. Approximately 7 sub-projects have been appraised
and were reviewed by IDA during negotiations. Although a number of the project
proposals are simply requests with very little information available, at least
30% are well prepared and would require very little additional information -
before they can be processed for approval. A preliminary review of the project
profile indicate that the institutional framework is strong in the health, and
education sectors and weak in road construction/rehabilitation.
5. THE ROLE OF NGOs IN HAITI
5.1   NGOs have been active in Haiti since the 1950s.  Indigenous and expatriate
NGOs, together, are currently estimated to number between 800 and 1500. In 1987
US assistance reached approximately 400 of these organizations and 45% of the
assistance was channeled through them.   Because of the general weakness of
public service institutions, which has worsened substantially during the last
four years, the NGO sector in Haiti has increasingly taken over the delivery of
some essential services to the urban and rural population.   About 175 NGOs are
registered with the Government, and of those about half are foreign and 75% rely
on foreign assistance. It was estimated in May 1988 that as of 1981 over 300
NGOs have invested approximately US$65 million in Haiti. Nineteen of the more
important NGOs invested US$23 million in 1983-84. The 71 NGOs surveyed in 1985
were estimated to have invested US$100 million between 1981-85 of which 60% was
allocated to health and education. Funding is provided by various bilaterals
including USA, Germany,  Canada,  Holland and France.   USAID has played a
particularly important role in strengthening a number of local NGOs as well as
stimulating the creation of a number of new organizations. A list of the most
important NGOS is attached in Annex 10.
5.2   Although a large number of NGOs are found in the Port-au-Prince area, many
NGO's especially the larger ones have branches in all regions of the country.
Annex 10, Table 1 indicates regional and sectoral distribution of the NGO
population in Haiti.   NGOs are particularly active in health and education,
however, NGO activities also include community development, productive
activities, rehabilitation of small irrigation works, rural roads, agricultural
and livestock development, fisheries, and reforestation.
5.3   It  is  clear  that  NGOs  have  become  important  partners  in Haiti's
development process. NGOs have made contributions either in cash or in-kind to
the Haitian development process that is additional to the resources that would
otherwise be available. Development objectives, through NGOs, are said to be
achieved within short periods of time and benefits are more likely to reach the
intended beneficiaries. Beneficiary participation in the development process
seems to be strongly encouraged under the NGO approach to development. They are
widely spread to reach regions and beneficiaries that the Government would not
normally reach.   NGOs usually promote projects that require small capital
investment, use local human and natural resources and technologies which are
appropriate and accessible. However, there are also some drawbacks. Not all
NGOs have purely developmental objectives; political and religious objectives



-14-
dom nate some of them. Administrative costs also tend to be high in some NGOU.
Most NGOs do not have the capacity to implement or supervise large and complex
projects. Some NGO activities, especially in the case of foreign-based NGOs,
are not adequately institutionalized, and once they move out there is no
institutional  or  technical  capacity  left  behind.    However,  using  NGOs
selectively and strengthening them at this particular time in Haiti is crucial
in assisting the government to carry out development activities.
5.4   It is expected that the provisions in the new Decree governing the
operations of NGOs and a newly elected Government credibly responsive to
development concerns, would increase collaboration between the Government and
the NGO community.   The ESF would establish a close coordination of sector
activities implemented by NGOs with the respective line ministries. It would
also make an effort to involve as many local NGOs as possible to ensure that
adequate institutional and technical capacity remains in the country. However,
in this case, the ESF would need to allow for technical assistance since a
number of the indigenous NGOs are weaker than the non-indigenous ones. Most of
the non-indigenous NGOs however, have significant numbers of Haitian staff, who
remain in the country and often in the development field.  Basic eligibility
criteria for NGOs and other grass roots organizations would include: (i) legal
existence as non-profit development organizations; (ii) demonstration of
institutional capacity including knowledgeable professionals to assure competent
implementation/supervision of project; (iv) at least two years experience in the
sector; and (v) accounting mechanism in place.
6. TARGETING OF BENEFICIARIES
6.1   In reviewing existing data sources,  it is clear that poverty is so
widespread in Haiti that a sophisticated and costly mechanism to identify the
poor is not justified.   Existing information (including indicators such as
access to potable water, health facilities and schools, infant mortality rates,
nutrition intake etc.) is sufficient to provide a general geographic framework
on a departmental level for rural areas and on a neighborhood level for urban
areas.  Community level data however, do not exist, so the poverty level of
beneficiary communities would be best confirmed during the evaluation of the
individual project.  A targeting study would also be carried out to further
refine the targeting mechanism of the ESF operations (see Annex 11).
6.2   The ESF will target its resources on financing sub-projects which benefit
the poorest segments of the population through the provision of services in
health, nutrition, education and basic economic infrastructure. Employment
opportunities would also be created in the implementation of micro-projects in
the above sectors.
6.3    To ensure that poor communities benefit from infrastructure and social
services, the ESF will develop a geographical programming of resources.
Existing data sources are sufficient to provide general geographical programming
priorities. For instance, a 1986-87 study of food availability confirmed the
general observation that the Northern Department of Haiti harbors the most
critical poverty areas.  Only 35% of households surveyed had access to food



-15-
greater than 75% of the recommended daily amount, compared with slightly over
half of households in the other regions of the country.
6.4   The greatest risk of leakage of project benefits will undoubtedly be in
the less poor neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince and other urban centers. A 1988
survey of poor areas of major urban centers has collected indicators on income,
employment, housing conditions, and availability of social services.   This
survey will help guide the targeting of ESF projects in urban areas. Overall,
the highly centralized nature of past investments in the Port-au-Prince
metropolitan area has left most outlying areas, particularly rural areas,
unserved.  To help redress this imbalance, a target ceiling between 20%-30%
would be placed on projects in urban areas. The ESF will strive for around 70%
of the financing to go to projects in rural areas, reflecting the demographic
distribution of the country.
6.5   Geographical programming priorities will also be developed for each type
of sub-project based on existing information of sector-specific indicators.
For instance, priority will be placed on nutrition projects in those zones with
extreme malnutrition indicators. For primary education projects, priority will
be placed on projects in rural areas which on average have deficits in coverage
three times greater than in urban areas. The ESF would submit an action plan
to IDA every six months showing a reasonable geographical and sectoral balance.
7. WOMEN'S CONSIDERATIONS
7.1   The targeting of ESF's benefits reflects the integral role of women in
poverty  alleviation  efforts  in  Haiti.    As  productive  agents,  women's
participation in income generating activities represents a crucial part of the
survival strategy of poor households.  Over the last forty years, women have
increasingly shifted away from traditional agriculture and into commercial
activities, either in the selling of agricultural products or in trading of
urban goods and services.   To raise the productivity of these activities,
Haitian women will need expanded access to basic education and training, credit
and improved infrastructure such as markets and roads.  The ESF will extend
these benefits to low-income women through the financing of well-targeted
projects of these types.
7.2   Apart from their increasingly important role in the economic well-being
of poor families, women have traditionally played the central role in the
development of Haiti's human resource base.  ESF's investments in health and
nutrition would seek to address the precarious health condition of Haitian women
and children, and reduce maternal and infant mortality. The health status of
women will also be improved through the provision of safe drinking water and
sanitation facilities.
7.3   In order to assure the broadest possible access by women to the potential
benefits of the ESF, the Promotion Department will specifically target women's
organizations. A number of these organizations have been identified, including
the Center for Promotion of Women Workers which administers health and nutrition
programs for working women.

8. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
8.1   Current concern with environmental problems in Haiti is focused on the
alarming rate of deforestation and soil erosion.   The pressure to increase
production of food crops has resulted in the expansion of the cultivated area
into marginal areas including steep hills, the removal of trees and shrubs and
the shortening of fallow periods.   However, by far the greatest pressure on
Haiti's dwindling natural resources comes from the cutting of trees and shrubs
for firewood and charcoal. Although Haiti has an impressive number of laws and
regulations to protect natural resources, the legislative and enforcement
process does not function well due to financial and institutional constraints.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MANRDR)
has the principal responsibility for protecting natural resources, but national
conservation policy rests with the Institut de Sauvegarde de Patrimoine
Nationale (ISPAN), an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Education.
8.2   With the objective of de..ning a coherent intervention and investment
strategy in the area of natural resource management, the IDA through its
Technical Assistance Credit (Credit 1786-HA) financed a major study that was
recently completed.   Based on the collective experience of an IDA supported
Pilot Forestry Project (Credit 1257-HA), implemented between 1982-89 through the
MANRDR, the recommended approaches of the above environmental study, the USAID
experience supporting agroforestry through NGOs, and the LAC Regional Forestry
Strategy, a proposed Forestry and Environmental Protection Project (FY91) has
been defined to assist the Government to slow down the pace of degradation of
Haiti's natural resources and to put in place institutional and policy
mechanisms aiming at:  (i) protecting the remaining forests; (ii) increasing
wood production through the management of state forest lands and through the
promotion of agroforestry by farmers; and, (iii) reducing the pressure on
vegetation for charcoal production through conservation and partial substitution
of wood-fuels with mineral-fuels for use by urban households.
8.3   Subproject proposals would include environmental impact assessment in
relevant areas.  Health posts and health centers would be designed to ensure
that they do not contaminate the environment.   They would be equipped with
septic tanks or improved latrines.   Similarly,  a plan for improvement of
sanitation of schools would be required, including latrines.
9. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT
9.1   IDA country strategy for Haiti aims to:   (i) alleviate poverty by
providing assistance via selected investments in critical social services, such
as health, nutrition and education directed towards the low income population,
emphasizing project management and institutional development; (ii) provide
limited support for the productive sectors to arrest the decline in the
productive base; and (iii) finance projects designed to prevent a further
deterioration of the physical facilities and the environment. Haiti's social
sector investment program has been adversely affected by the unfavorable overall
political developments and the economic uncertainty, and further exacerbated by



-17-
the suspension of aid by key donors.  The Government, forced by the loss of
foreign assistance, has cut expenditures for physical and social infrastructure
to the bone. The budgets of the line ministries are currently covering only
salaries, and there is very little left for other operating expenditures and \or
investment. In addition, centralization of decision making has always prevented
the ministries from responding flexibly and quickly to the needs of the poor at
the rural community level. IDA's involvement is particularly critical at this
juncture to arrest the spreading of poverty and the deterioration of physical
facilities, while at the same time providing employment to the rural and urban
poor.   The quick infusion of resources through grass roots organizations,
cooperatives and NGOs, would address directly and quickly the needs of the poor.
The proposed operation by financing social infrastructure and social services
would support complementary activities that are mutually reinforcing.
Microprojects in the health/nutrition, education, and infrastructure sectors
would complement on-going operations in those sectors (Credits 2085-HA and 1592-
HA). In addition, the proposed operation would address Government priorities
in the PSIP, including projects with high content of social services, minimizing
counterpart funding, and fostering a reasonable sectoral and geographical
balance.
9.2   If the newly elected Government shows a readiness to embark upon an
adjustment effort and reinitiate an IMF program, IDA's strategy would be
expanded to emphasize broader assistance to the productive sectors improving
revenue mobilization and expenditure programming, and rationalizing public
sector employment and enterprises.
10. THE PROJECT
Proiect Obiectives
10.1   The objectives of the proposed project would be to:  (i) establish an
effective mechanism, the Economic and Social Fund (ESF), as a means of
responding directly, efficiently and in a decentralized manner to the basic
needs of the poor through NGOs, cooperatives, community groups and other grass
roots organizations; (ii) assist the GOH to improve health, nutrition and
education services and provide physical infrastructure, and employment
opportunities to the poor; (iii) provide an effective channel for critically
required donor financing and coordinate scattered domestic efforts; and, (iv)
strengthen the capacity of community groups, cooperatives, NGOs and other grass
roots organizations in preparing and implementing projects.
Proiect Description
10.2   The proposed operation would  include a project  component  (US$21.2
million) and an institutional development component (US$2.4 million). The IDA
credit for the project component (US $10 million) would finance the following:
(i) health projects, including construction and rehabilitation of health
posts/centers with emphasis on primary health care facilities in rural areas,
provision of equipment and essential drugs, epidemic control, immunization, day
care and nutrition programs for pre-school children,  pregnant and lactating



-18-
women, construction of small water supply systems, small sewerage systems and
latrines (US$6.4 million);   (ii) education projects including primary school
construction and rehabilitation, primary school equipment, textbooks, literacy
adult training targeting women involved in businesses (US$2.5 million); and
(iii) rural roads giving access of poor communities to markets, schools and
health centers (US$1 million). Advisory services would also be provided to weak
grass roots organizations in the poorest communities that lack the institutional
capacity to carry out projects (US$.l million). Detailed project costs are given
in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of Annex 9.
10.3   Institutional Strenathenine of the ESF  (US$2.4 million).   The IDA
component (US$1.3 million) would finance salaries of selected fixed term ESF
staff and consultant services, their travel expenses, office equipment and
supplies,vehicles and microcomputers.   Technical assistance would also be
provided to the ESF for:  (i) the establishment of a price data base on unit
costs for construction materials and labor as a basis for procurement under
direct contracting; (ii) the design and implementation of a management
information  system,  including  monitoring/evaluation  systems;   (iii)  the
completion of an operating manual including project evaluation criteria; (iv)
the refinement of poverty targeting mechanisms; (v) the design of an impact
study;and (vi) the establishment of an accounting system. A Project Preparation
Facility (P621-HA) was approved on May 24, 1990, to assist the Government to set
up the ESF and begin operation through a pilot project component. The ESF
Director with a four member team are in place and have initiated work for the
preparation of the project.
Proiect Cost and Financing
10.4   Total project cost is estimated at US$23.6 million equivalent, excluding
taxes and duties.  IDA would finance US$11.3 million equivalent, and the IDB
US$10.4 million equivalent.   Counterpart contributions will be generated by
beneficiary communities in the form of labor or materials and funding at US$1.9
million equivalent or 8% of total project costs.  Foreign costs would represent
about 17% of the total.   Since all specific subprojects  are yet to be
identified, no contingencies have been calculated. Any increase in the expected
average sub-project cost would be reflected as a reduction in the number of
subprojects.   The estimated sectoral distribution in the project cost table
reflects need as demonstrated by the 182 proposals received thus far from
requesting agencies, as well as institutional capacity in the various sectors
to implement sound projects. Average project costs are estimated at US$45,000
equivalent in health and education. Rehabilitation of rural roads is estimated
at around US$10,000/km and new construction could vary from US$20,000/km to
US$40,000/km depending on the technique used. Maximum sub-project size would not
exceed US$250,000 equivalent.

Cofinancinq Arrangements
10.5   As indicated in the project financing plan  (Table 2), the proposed
project is being cofinanced by the IDB on a parallel basis. With regard to the
institutional development component IDA would finance 100% of the institutional
support expenditures for the first year, while IDB would finance salaries of all
professional staff starting the second year through completion.   IDA would
finance all other institutional support expenditures through completion
amounting to less than 20% of total.   IDB has participated in all project
preparation activities and in credit negotiations.   However, because of the
nature of the project and the cofinancing arrangements, there would be no need
for any cross effectiveness provisions in our respective agreements, even though
the usual cross default provisions relating to project implementation would be
necessary.
10.6   Cofinancing  has  also  been  pledged  from  additional  bilateral  and
multilateral sources,  but not yet confirmed:   US$500,000  (United States),
US$400,000  (France),  US$750,000  (Canada), US$1-US$2 million  (EEC),   US$.6



-20-
million (UNDP). Germany and CARICOM have indicated willingness to participate,
although no specific amounts have been indicated yet. The ESF would expand the
program along the lines stipulated in the Operations Manual to accommodate
additional financing in support of its activities.
10.7   The Director General of the ESF would review further the status of the
proposed cofinancing with the local representative of the aid agencies of the
countries that have expressed interest. Concurrently, IDA would also follow-up
the matter with the respective countries to help facilitate the provision of the
indicated cofinancing resources.
Institutional Arrangements
10.8   ESF would have the overall responsibility for the project.  The Borrower
would pass on the proceeds of the credit to the ESF on a grant basis under a
Subsidiary Agreement satisfactory to IDA, and to be signed by the Borrower and
ESF. The signing of the agreement would be a condition of effectiveness. The
ESF would pass on funds on a grant basis for projects in health/nutrition,
education and infrastructure. ESF would evaluate, approve and monitor projects
(see paras. 2.5 - 2.7 and Annexes 3-7).    ESF's operating manual, including
project evaluation criteria, the operational and the organizational structure
satisfactory to IDA in form and substance, would be approved by IDA as a
condition of effectiveness.    A draft operating manual  including project
evaluation criteria were reviewed by IDA during negotiations.
10.9   Coordination  with  Line  Ministries.  The  ESF  would  coordinate  its
operations with sectoral ministries at two different levels to ensure that the
ESF projects fit within the overall sectoral objectives, that ESF -funded
projects complement other government activities, and that there is no
duplication. At the central ministerial level, project eligibility and
evaluation criteria have been reviewed by the respective ministries to ensure
compliance with overall ministerial objectives. The Unit of Coordinating
Regional Activities at the Ministry of Public Works, the Unit of Coordinating
the Priority Programs in the Ministry of Health and the Department of Planning
at the Ministries of Education and Agriculture are the main contact points for
the ESF. Once the criteria have been agreed upon with the line ministries, the
decision to accept or reject projects would be left with the ESF. In this
connection the ministries would make the plans, standards, regulations relating
to the different types of projects, available to the ESF. In addition, the ESF
would coordinate with the respective ministries at the local level, through the
involvement of local ministerial staff to assist as needed in the
implementation/supervision of projects. For example, community groups and or
NGOs wishing to rehabilitate health centers or institute a vaccination campaign
would review the plans with the district medical doctor and the district
engineer to ensure that the proposed microproject conforms with the national
health  plan  and  with  the  engineering  norms.    Supervision  of  project
implementation would also be requested by ESF from the line ministries, when
appropriate (see para 10.12).



-21-
Implementation Arrangements
10.10   Standard Execution Contracts.  Since the ESF will not execute projects,
contracts will be made between ESF and the agencies soliciting projects and in
some cases, a third party contractor.   For all infrastructure projects, a
private third party construction contractor would be required for execution.
For projects involving social services, it is expected that soliciting agencies
would execute directly, except in the case of construction components of these
projects.   The pilot phase will be used to test the effectiveness of these
contracts. During negotiations IDA reviewed and commented on model contracts
between ESF and soliciting agencies, and between ESF and third-party
construction contractors.
10.11   The standard contracts will stipulate activities and physical works,
prices, execution periods, and administrative responsibilities. Contracts for
civil works carried out through private contractors will include a 15% profit
margin including incremental overhead costs associated with the implementation
of the project.
10.12   Supervision Contracts.  To assure quality control in the implementation
of projects, a supervision contract would be made for most projects with an
independent party or agency.  This contract would be limited to no more than
five percent of total project costs to cover travel expenses and an honorarium
paid to the supervisor.   Such a contract  is deemed necessary since the
geographically dispersed nature of projects will not allow for complete
technical supervision of works by ESF staff. A supervision contract will be
required for all projects which involve physical construction. In addition, ESF
will explore the possibility of contracting the Pan-American Health Organization
to supervise the quality of services delivered in health projects.   In some
cases, government agencies such as the Ministry of Education , the Ministry of
Health and the Ministry of Public Works may be contracted to supervise projects
carried out by NiGOs and community organizations.   In addition to assuring
quality control, this independent supervision mechanism will provide critical
technical assistance during project implementation, beyond the assistance which
ESF staff can offer. During negotiations IDA reviewed and commented on a model
contract for supervision.
10.13   ESF Sub-Proiect Disbursements.   The ESF'a disbursement procedures on
sub-projects will seek to establish a mechanism for controlling quality of
execution which does not delay disbursements nor result in extremely high
administrative costs for the ESF. In order to retain a satisfactory degree of
control over execution, disbursements will be made in tranches against work
completed. An initial advance of twenty percent will be issued to facilitate
project start-up. Subsequent disbursements will be made on average on a monthly
basis, the amount to be determined by site visits of ESF staff. During these
visits, ESF will verify all expenditures against receipts. Authorization for
disbursements must be signed by the responsible ESF staff and the supervisor in
cases of contracting independent supervision.   To further ensure quality
execution, for physical works projects carried out by third-party contractors,
these contractors will be expected to provide financial guarantees for 20% of
total project amount. Where this is not possible, half of the contractor's fee
will be withheld until two months after project conclusion for inspection of



-22-
works. The first 30 sub-projects independent of size and all sub-projects above
US$100,000 including contracts would be subject to prior review by IDA.
Proiect Sustainability, Recurrent Costs and Maintenance
10.14   The approach to cost recovery and maintenance would depend on the type
of sub-project.   Soliciting agencies  in all cases would be requested to
incorporate in the specific project proposals mechanisms to be used for cost
recovery, operation and maintenance.  The ESF would evaluate, before project
approval, the institutional capacity of the soliciting agency and feasibility
of proposed mechanism to ensure proper operating and maintenance.
10.15   In the case of water supply and sanitation projects communities, through
local committees would institute mechanisms to recover sufficient funds through
modest user fees and contribution in kind to cover costs of operation and
maintenance.   Moreover, ESF-funded sub-projects would also include technical
assistance/education in the use and maintenance of facilities. Initial stock
of tools and parts would be financed by the ESF. Maintenance efforts would also
be coordinated with SNEP (see para 3.10). In the case of health infrastructure,
the ESF would seek assurances from requesting agencies and/or the Ministry of
Health when appropriate to finance recurrent costs (salaries, drugs).   With
regard to health services, modest user fees for curative services would partially
finance revolving stocks of drugs and materials.   In the case of nutrition
programs, user fees are not appropriate, but the ESF would evaluate the
respective institution to assure continuation of services after the project
financing ends,  if applicable.   With regard to school infrastructure, the
capacity of the soliciting agency would be evaluated to ensure that it can
mobilize future maintenance; salaries of teachers would be assured for all new
construction. With regard to road construction, the ESF would require formal
approval from regional/central road agencies, to include newly constructed roads
in their maintenance/repair and planning, when applicable.
Performance Indicators
10.16   ESF's performance will be monitored through the management information
system. This system will allow for supervision of ESF operations relating to:
(i) financing; (ii) project flows; (iii) direct impact, and (iv) efficiency of
operations.   A joint mid-term review will be carried ou'. by no later than
December 31, 1992 and the necessary actions would be taken as needed.   With
regard to financing, performance indicators will include both the financial
status of the ESF as well as cost profiles of the sub-projects financed,
including total commitment amount and disbursements, number of sub-projects
matched with source of funds, etc.   With regard to project flows, the ESF
information system will provide up-to-date information on its project cycle,
including distribution of sub-projects by type and region, dates of sub-project
flows through various stages, number and amount of projects in each stage, amount
and dates of disbursements against works, etc. The performance indicators used
to measure impact on a continual basis will allow for a snapshot at any time of
the scale and way in which ESF is reaching its target beneficiaries including
number of physical units executed (kilometers of road repaired, classrooms built,
inoculations given, etc.), number and location of beneficiaries reached and
number of man-months of employment created. Efficiency of operations will be



-23-
measured at two levels.  First, the administrative efficiency of the ESF to
appraise and finance sub-projects will be measured through various indicators
including administrative costs as a percentage of sub-project financing, average
number of project evaluated/week, number of projects/supervisor, etc, and delays
in sub-project execution. And second, through measures of the efficiency with
which the sub-projects themselves are delivering their intended results including
cost per physical unit delivered (infrastructure or services) and cost per
beneficiary per project type.   An evaluation report on the implementation
experience would be prepared by the end of the three year period. An effort would
be made to collect baseline data through the MIS system on project impact (see
Annex 12). Soliciting agencies would be asked to provide to the extent possible
indicators at the community level which can be used subsequently in the impact
study. The targeting study would also provide additional baseline data (see
Annex 11).
Procurement
10.17   Contracts for works of above US$2.5 million which would require ICB under
the Bank procurement guidelines are not envisaged. Local competitive bidding,
satisfactory to IDA, would apply for civil works contracts between US$50,000 to
US$2.5 million. A very large proportion of procurement for works such as self-
help social assistance projects would be small in terms of contract sum (below
Us$50,000), and spread across various parts of the country in rural community
centers averaging less than 1000 inhabitants.   A schedule of standard rates
covering unit prices for domestic materials and labor are being developed by ESF
(these standard prices are arrived at, with assistance by a consultant costing
expert by using as inputs market prices for purchasable materials and trends in
wage rates and productivity factors observed in the type of sub-projects).These
unit prices would be reviewed from time to time and would be adjusted
accordingly. For civil works contracts below US$50,000, the sponsoring agency
would engage in direct contracting by nominating the contractor. The contractor
would have to agree to accept the ESF rates. ESF would not approve the contract
awarded by a sponsoring agency, if the amount of such contracts, when added to
all prior non-competitive contracts financed by ESF during the same calendar year
and awarded directly or indirectly to the same contractor, would exceed the
equivalent of US$200,000.   The aggregate limit under the direct contracting
method would not exceed US$6.3 million equivalent. To the extent possible,
equipment, textbooks, furniture and medical supplies to be purchased under
subprojects would be combined for the purpose of procurement in packages of
US$100,000 or more and contracts for their purchase would be awarded on the basis
of ICB.  Goods estimated to cost US$100,000 or less but more than US$20,000
equivalent, would be awarded on the basis of LCB procedures satisfactory to IDA.
Goods estimated to cost US$20,000 or less up to an aggregate amount of US$2.3
million equivalent would be procured by the sponsoring agency according to local
shopping procedures with offers from at least 3 eligible suppliers.
10.18   Goods (micro-computers, vehicles) under the institutional development
component which can be combined in packages of US$100,000 or more would be
procured under ICB.  Goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000 would be
procured on the basis of LCB procedures satisfactory to IDA. All ICB and the
first two LCB contracts would be subject to IDA prior review. Consultants
required for the institutional development component would be hired in accordance



-24-
with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.   ESF would carry out a
procurement performance review every 6 months including updating of the unit cost
pricing mechanism. A procurement table is attached as Annex 9, Table 4.
Disbursements
10.19   The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed over a period of four years,
to be completed by June 30,  1995  (closing date).   Sub-project activities
supported by the IDA credit are expected to be completed by December 31, 1994.
The expected disbursement profile is consistent with similar ESF projects in the
region.
10.20   Disbursements  would  be made  against  the  following  categories  of
expenditure: (i) 100% of disbursements by ESF against eligible subprojects; (ii)
100% of the costs for institutional development support (cost of salaries of
selected staff, travel costs, other recurrent costs , consultant services,
microcomputers, vehicles, furniture).
10.21   Documentation of Expenditures.   Withdrawal applications for goods and
services and for civil works contracts with a value of US$50,000 or more will
be supported by full documentation.   Contracts for less than US$50,000, and
disbursements against expenses not undertaken by contract and all disbursements
under subprojects will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs),
for which supporting documents would be maintained by ESF and would be made
available for review by IDA staff.
Accounts, AuditinQ and Re2ortint
10.22   ESF's accounts will be available for inspection by the Association.
Annually audited accounts will be submitted to the Association no later than four
months following the end of ESF's fiscal year. Auditing will be done by an
independent auditing firm acceptable to the Association, and will include
specific arrangements for audit of civil works contracts under direct contracting
and statements of expenditures submitted for disbursements. ESF will send IDA
quarterly progress reports until the project is completed.  The reports will
include inter alia, sources of funds, including cofinancing, and application of
funds. A joint mid-term review of operations would be carried out. Corrective
actions would be taken as needed. A post evaluation review would be carried out
before the end of four years.
11. BENEFITS AND RISKS
11.1   Project benefits would be: (i) poverty alleviation through the provision
of services and facilities in health, nutrition and education to the urban and
rural poor with emphasis on women and children; (ii) improvement in physical
infrastructure closely tied to the needs of small communities; (iii) employment
creation; (iv) strengthening the capabilities of NGOs and grass roots
organizations in preparing and implementing projects; and, (v) providing an
effective mechanism to complement government efforts for delivering development
assistance directly to the rural and rural poor.



-25-
11.2   Possible risks include:  (i) political uncertainty could have a negative
impact on the ESF credibility, its directorship, and on tLe confidence of NGOs
and grass roots organizations and their willingness to be associated and work
with the Government; and (ii) the untested capacity of the ESF to maintain a
good and capable working team, maintain transparency regarding its finances, and
withstand pressures to finance projects for political purposes.   Carefully
selected and technically competent staff, a well defined manual on operating
procedures and project eligibility criteria, well established accounting
procedures, intense and frequent supervision and frequent auditing will help to
minimize the above risks. Agreements were reached with the Government during
negotiations that the operating policies and procedures of the ESF, the Director
and the department directors would not be changed without IDA consent.
12. AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS
12.1   During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that it
would not take any action which would affect materially and adversely the ability
of ESF to perform its obligations, including changes in the Operations Manual
and removal of the ESF Director and the Department Heads without IDA consent.
Agreements were also reached that IDA would retain the right to suspend
disbursements if the disbursements under the IDB Loan are not remitted by
June 30, 1991. Assurances were also obtained that the ESF would: (i) ensure
that all sub-projects would be appraised, implemented and supervised according
to the agreed criteria reflected in the Operations Manual, acceptable to IDA
(paras. 3.19, 3.20, 3.21, 3.38, 3.39); (ii) submit to IDA quarterly progress
reports covering all areas of ESF operations, sources and uses of funds (para
10.22); (iii) appoint independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA to
carry out audits of its accounts including audits of direct contracts and all
disbursements made against SOEs, and furnish such audits to IDA within four
months at the end of the fiscal year (para. 10.21 and 10.22); (iv) submit to
IDA for review all subprojects above US$100,000 and the first 30 projects
independent of size and including a representative sample from all sectors (para
10.13); (v) submit to IDA for review all ICB and the first two LCB contracts for
goods and works (para. 10.17); (vi) submit to IDA for review an action plan
every six months showing a geographical and sectoral balance  acceptable to
IDA(para 6.5); (vii) conduct reviews of procurement performance every six months
including a review of the unit price mechanism (paras. 10.17 and 10.18); (viii)
maintain accounts disagregated by type of sub-project, technical assistance
activity, and by source of financing (para. 10.16); (ix) carry out a mid-term
review and if needed take necessary actions to improve implementation (para.
10.16); (x) carry out a poverty targeting study to be completed by June 30, 1991
with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (para. 10.16) and (xi) prepare a
final report on implementation experience including an assessment to determine
ESF's future (to be completed before December 31, 1994) (para. 10.16); (xii)
would expand ESF activities to accommodate additional cofinancing along the terms
and conditions stipulated in the Operations Manual (para.10.6).



-26-
12.2   The approval of the Operations Manual by IDA and the signing of the
subsidiary agreement between the Government and the ESP for transferring the IDA
credit under conditions satisfactory to IDA, are conditions of effectiveness.
(paras. 10.8).
12.3   Recommendation.   Based upon the above agreements and assurances the
proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of SDRs 7.9
million (US$11.3 million equivalent) to the Government of Haiti.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Proiect Implementation
Sub-Proiect Promotion
1.    Because  of the demand-driven nature of the ESF,  initial demand is
anticipated to be strongest from areas where the organizational capacity to
formulate and present projects is the strongest. In order to assure that ESP
resources reach the poorer and more remote regions of the country, ESF staff
will adapt a promotional strategy to generate demand from these areas.  This
strategy will be reinforced by the provision of technical assistance to the weak
agencies included in the proposed operations.
2.    ESF?s promotion team will visit high priority regions to contact local
NGO's and grassroots organizations to solicit project requests from these areas.
The team will assess the implementation capacity of these agencies and assist
in the identification of community needs and in the translation of these needs
into the project format to be presented to ESF.
3.    Despite this promotional strategy, it is expected that in the short-term
there will be difficulties in reaching the poorest of the poor, particularly in
rural areas. The lack of effective organizations to implement projects in these
areas combined with factors such as remoteness and the high cost per beneficiary
of reaching dispersed populations reduce the possibilities of serving these
communities. However, the poverty targeting and promotional strategies adopted
by the ES? would assure the ES? will succeed in reaching a greater share of the
most critically poor groups in Haiti.
Sub-Proiect Apoiraisal
4.    Evaluation Procedure. ESF's Evaluation Department will be responsible for
reviewing sub-projects to verify institutional capacity, poverty targeting and
technical aspects of the sub-project proposals.   Unit prices for labor and
materials will. be adjusted against the ESF's price data base. The methodology
to be used for each type of sub-project will be elaborated in the Operating
Manual. This review process will be complemented with an obligatory site visit
to confirm the appropriateness of technical design and to assess beneficiary
participation  in project  implementation.   The Director of the Evaluation
Department will present all projects which pass this screening process to the
Project Approval Committee.
5.    Anvraisal Criteria.  The principal elements of the appraisal procedure
would be:
(a)   Project eligibility, to fall within the ESF objective;
(b)   social targeting and beneficiary analysis;



- 41 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 2
(c)   technical requirements;
(d}   project *ustainability - financial and institutional analysis;
(a)   minimum cost parameters, and
(f)   generation of employment.
6.    Appraisal Criteria by Proiect Tyle.  The ESF will finance sub-projects
which satisfy appraisal criteria in the following areas:
(a)   Economic Infrastructure. Following would be some broad criteria for
project selection in infrastructure:
Targeting (location priority, target beneficiary group, income
level, community involvement and counterpart support);
technical requirements (engineerLng standards);
community commitments (maintenance and repair), and
*     cost parameters (cost per/km, costs/beneficiary.
The following types of such-projects would be eligible for financing:
Labor-intensive road construction, maintenance and upgrading of
seasonal roads with a priority on secondary and feeder roads.
(b)   Social Services.  The primary objective of social services projects
is to deliver basic health and education services to poor beneficiaries. Key
selection criteria include the profile of beneficiaries, cost per beneficiary
and, for construction of new facilities, the ability of the implementing agency
to finance operating expenses (see Annexes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, for description of
project eligibility criteria in each sector).

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
The Nature and Scoye of Health/Nutrition Sub-2rojects
Obiectives and Approach of the ESF in the Health Sector
1.    The major objectives of the project in the health sector would be:
(a)   Help the Government target scarce existing resources more effectively
to reach the most vulnerable among the poor to improve their health
and nutrition status;
(b)   help decentralize and improve the health, nutrition,  and basic
sanitation services, in particular in rural areas, and
(c)   over the long run, strengthen the capacity of community groups and
municipalities to plan and implement health projects and programs.
2.    To this aim, the proposed project would finance small-scale community-
based projects that target populations at the periphery - geographic, social
or economic - with the greatest health needs. National programs in Haiti tend,
by and large, to be supply-led and hardware-driven. It can be argued that the
poorest segments of the population have very different needs from those which
would be met by increasing coverage of conventionally structured, centrally
planned health services. The proposed project would concentrate on small-scale
Droiects that are demand-led and software-driven. The project objectives and
scope would take into consideration that health services may not be perceived
as a priority need by the poorest segments unless they see it as part of a
package to improve their overall living standards.
3.    Small-scale community-based projects in Haiti are usually carried out by
NGOs. While the quality and impact of services offered by NGOs in Haiti varies
greatly, the proposed project would focus, as a first step, on successful NGOs.
A key consideration in project implementation is that scaling-up of small
successful projects in the health sector may have a negative effect on
performance.  The proposed ESFPs efforts in the health sector would focus on
small-size projects and provide financing to larger, scaled-up projects only in
cases where the NGO has the institutional capacity to do so and the targeted
population is sensitized and its needs have been correctly assessed.
Cateaories of Health\Nutrition Sub-Proiects
4.    Categories of eligible health sub-projects can be defined in accordance
with the following considerations:



-43 -                               ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 4
(a)   Consistency with the Government's 7 priority programs in the health
sector S
(b)   capacity to reach the poorest segments of the population, and to
effectively improve their health\nutrition status;and
(c)   benefits to women and children.
S.    The following broad categories of projects would be considered:
(a)   Primary Health Care Infrastructure
(i)   Construction, expansion or repair of health centers and health
posts.

General obiectives
1.    The major objectives of the project in the health sector are defined in
Annex 3.
catecories of Protecto
2.    Project categories would include:
(a)   Primary health care infrastructure.
(b)   Primary health care supplies and drugs.
(c)   Immunization.
(d)   Epidemic Control.
(S)   Information, education and communication.
(f)   Training.

Target Beneficiaries
3.    The ESF objective is to target its resources to the poorest segments of
the population. To achieve this objective, it needs to develop a methodology
that works within existing data constraints and that will permit targeting
relatively small geographical areas, while minimizing the costs of targeting.
The criteria to be used by ESF would be based on the most illustrative indicators
of extreme poverty in rural Haiti. The following criteria should be used in the
selection of municipalities and beneficiaries:
(a)   infant mortality and morbidity rates;
(b)   malnutrition rates among children 0 to S years old;
(C)   availability of potable water and latrines;
(d)   percentage of school age children attending school;
(-)   community accessibility (type of road, open all year or part of the
year... ); and

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Nutrition Component of ESF Proaram
1.    As pointed out in a USAID study on nutrition programs in Haiti:  "Haiti
is one of the most experimented countries in the world with respect to
nutritional programs". In addition, the level of food aid received by Haiti is
important, amounting to 715 metric tons in 1986.   Nonetheless, malnutrition
indicators continue at an alarmingly high level. The cause of this is twofold:
first, stagnant household incomes have restrained poor peoples' ability to buy
or produce their way out of malnutrition; and second, the institutional context
for delivering nutritional services, including direct food aid, is characterized
by a dispersion of efforts, weak administrative capacity and a lack of
sustainability.
2.    In terms of general profile of malnutrition in Haiti, the 1978 Nutritional
Assessment in Haiti found that three-quarters of the population under-five years
old suffered from some degree of malnutrition, with 30% of under-fives falling
within a range of moderate to severe malnutrition. Based on these figures and
demographic estimates for 1990, the target population of those considered at risk
for malnutrition include 867,000 children under five years old, 300,000 pregnant
women and 139,000 lactating mothers, out of an estimated 1990 population of 6.3
million. Malnutrition rates vary only slightly by geographical region. On the
whole, urban areas tend to have less malnutrition than rural areas, but studies
done on marginal urban neighborhoods show pockets of poverty with worse
malnutrition levels than those in rural areas.
Types of Nutrition Interventions
3.    Five types of nutrition interventions are offered by the public and private
organizations operating in Haiti:
(a)   Direct Food Aid:  Of the direct food aid donated to Haiti, the bulk
is channelled mainly through school feeding programs with little
targeting and limited monitoring for nutritional impact. Seventy-
five percent of public schools and 35% of private schools are
covered. However, coverage is restricted since only about 60% of
school aged children are enrolled.
(b)   Nutrition Procrame Within Health Services:  The current strategy is
to integrate nutrition activities into the health delivery system,
either through hospital feeding programs, child survival programs
including vaccinations and oral rehydration, or through primary
health services provided through health centers and health posts.
These programs are limited to the existing reach of the health care
system.   These programs typically include food supplements and
nutritional education.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 4
(c)   Nutrition Programs Within Child Care Services:  A small number of
activities are carried out through child care centers.   These
projects perform growth monitoring and nutritional rehabilitation
for the malnourished.
(d)   Vertical Vitamin Suoplement Programs:  The Ministry of Health and
selected NGOs provide targeted vitamin supplements, particularly
Vitamin A, to mothers and children through existing health and
community education programs.
(e)   Programs to Increase Household Food Production:   These programs
combine nutritional education with a food production component. Food
production is centered on urban gardens and introduction of varied
produce on rural holdings.
Assessment of Demand and Institutional CaDacitv
4.    To get an assessment of ongoing activities and future needs in nutrition
key institutions working in nutrition programs and food aid were visited. The
scale of programs carried out by these institutions is detailed below.
5.    World Food Prooram(WFP).  The WFP channels its food aid through food-for-
work programs and donations to the Ministry of Health (MSPP) for hospital feeding
programs and support to MSPP health centers. WFP experience in food aid is
mixed. At present, it is reaching 35,000 women and children through 21 health
posts. However, WFP estimates that only 30%-50% of the available resources are
utilized due to lack of counterpart funds from the MSPP to finance distribution
and logistical support. Almost half of all donations are estimated to be sold
by beneficiaries rather than consumed. In addition, US$1 million in food was
lost during the chaos of the change in government in April 1989, fostered by
opposition from the holders of monopolies on certain food products. In terms
of projects in its pipeline, the WFP is planning for 1991 a school feeding
program in the North and Northwest regions over a four year period to cover
initially 30,000 primary school children, rising to 45,000 by the second year.
The cost of the food component average US$l million annually, WFP is seeking
US$70,000 for the necessary cooking equipment and infrastructure modifications.
6.    USAID Food Aid Affiliates.  USAID food donations are channeled through
three private voluntary organizations: Catholic Relief Services, CARE and ADRA.
These donations reach 700,000 beneficiaries of which 500,000 are primary school
children and 200,000 are participating through maternal and child health
programs. The value of these donations including shipping reaches US$10 million
annually. Approximately US$2 million food was lost last year. Catholic Relief
Services are seeking financing through USAID for a US$365,000 three year project
to provide growth monitoring equipment and nutrition education programs as a
complement to food aid in 25 MSPP health centers to reach 20,000 children under
five years of age.
7.    Foster Parents Plan. Foster Parents Plan receives financing through child
sponsors in the US to finance programs in a variety of locations in Haiti,
though they do little in terms of nutrition. However, in the Jacmel area, they
run a number of nursery schools which include nutritional rehabilitation for the
severely malnourished. Little information was available about this program.

Page 3 of 4
8.    Centers for Health and DeveloDment (CDS).   CDS is most noted for its
development work in the slum area of Cite Soleil within Port-au-Prince, though
have recently extended their activities to Cap-Haitian, Port-Liberte and the
rural area of Ouanaminthe in the northeastern part of the country. Nutritional
programs carried out in Cite Soleil are an important element of the excellent
health program CDS manages. Food supplements are distributed through mothers
participating in the health program and to all children up to three years old.
Vitamin A is provided as well. The most urgent of CDS's funding needs relating
to nutrition is logistical support for the transportation and distribution of
food supplements through its health program in the northeast.   The EEC is
providing the US$3 million in food delivered to Port-au-Prince. CDS would need
financing for transport and storage, estimated around US$100,000.
9.    Ministry of Health.  The MSPP has a long history of nutrition activities,
usually sustained by external financing, much of which has been suspended in
recent years. Most of the MSPP's actions have a programmatic focus, such as the
goal of covering all children with primary health care including growth
monitoring, Vitamin A supplements, oral rehydration therapy and vaccinations.
There is some experience with more focused, project-type interventions in
nutrition. In discussions with Josette Bijou, the project manager of the IDA
financed Haiti Health Project, she noted that in the southern region the MSPP
had worked in the past with groups of women in nutritional education, especially
in the use of local food products. The experience had been positive on a pilot
scale, but as yet had not been extended to a scale sufficient to have a
significant impact. She voiced interest in ESF financing for the possibility
of trying a similar project in the western region.
10.   Assessment of Demand. Based on the organizations visited above, an initial
reading of demand for ESF financing is possible. The proposed programming of
ESF resources estimates US$2.5 million for two years of project commitments in
primary health care and nutrition. Much of this financing will undoubtedly go
into primary health care, because the capacity to spend is much greater since
this also includes infrastructure and the institutional capacity is stronger.
11.   In terms of nutrition-specific projects, the amount of demand in financial
terms depends greatly on which items ESF chooses to finance. In food programs,
the bulk of finance goes to purchase food. The ESF would mainly channel its
efforts into facilitating distribution and logistical support through programs
in primary health care and nutrition. It would finance the purchase of food only
in selected cases where coordinating with ongoing food programs is not possible.
12.   ESF will provide th]j necessary complements to food aid to assure its
effective utilization. Using the CRS case as an example, US$6 per beneficiary
per year is needed to carry out growth monitoring and nutrition education
programs complementary to the food supplements given out. With a total target
population of 867,000 malnourished children, and assuming that ESF could increase
coverage by 20% in its first two years of operation, the demand would total US$1
million. However, this depends on an institutional capacity to implement these
programs which is generally weak. A smaller amount of demand for financing can
be expected from local projects in food production and child care centers.

Comoarative Advantace of the E8F
13.   The effect that ESF will have on the nutritional status of the poorer
populations of Haiti depends very much on the type of mechanism ESF is. NSF ie
clearly not conformed in euch a way am to become an agency to manage a national
food program. Because it is demand-driven, ESF must fit within the existing
institutional contours of the country. While sweeping national efforts cannot
be expected, such efforts in the past have met with failure because of lack of
administrative and management abilities to pull such efforts off.  ESF will
succeed in facilitating a series of local efforts, leveraging impacts with very
little resources.
14.   The larg-et impact on nutrition of the ESF may in fact not occur in
projects themselves, but in complementary areas of activities, such as water and
sanitation. The links between potable water and basic sanitation and deaths from
malnutrition are well known. During the mission, discussions with a researcher
at CRS revealed that according to results of a dtudy to be published in the
coming months, the experience of a sample of CRS project sites in Haiti shows
that the project interventions with the greatest impact on nutritional status
are water and sanitation, and not health services or food aid.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
General Criteria for Sub-projects in the Education Sector
1.    Eligible projects will have to be defined in accordance with the following
considerations:
(a)   Consistency with the government priority program of modernization
of the education system (for primary, vocational and pre-school
education, and literacy);
(b)   coordination of public and private institutions in the implementation
of the modernization program;
(c)   capacity to reach the poorest segments of the population in rural
and suburban areas and to improve their education level, and
(d)   benefits to women.
2.    Broad Categories of Sub-projects
(a)   Primary education. Extension, rehabilitation and repair of schools.
New construction should be exceptional, i.e., when rehabilitation
or extensions  are not  feasible;    basic  sanitation equipment:
latrines, water supply; equipment in school furniture: benches,
tables, blackboards, locked closets, and nutrition equipment;
pedagogic material: books and training.
(b)   Pre-school centers.   Construction/repairs;   equipment, including
nutrition equipment; pedagogic material, and training.
(c)   Vocational education.   Extension,  rehabilitation and repair of
vocational centers led by communities; pedagogic material; tools,
small machinery, and training of trainers for on-the-job programs.
(d)   Literacy programs.  Furniture;  books, and training of trainers.
(e)   Non-formal education.  Training for adults and children outside the
formal education system includes pre-school, literacy and post-
literacy programs and vocational programs.
(f)   Special programs.   Programs for suburban children without family
(enfants des rues); Socio-educative projects (Centres d'Accueil pour
les Jeunes).

Page 2 of 2
3.    Technical Feasibility Criteria
(a)   Civil works and equipment must be subject to norms to be defined in
coordination with the Ministry of Education, FONHEP and the Fifth
Education Project unit.   (Presently,  there are on average 1.5
teachers per group of 35-40 students for each classroom.   Some
schools 'Ecoles Tonnelles" have no formal buildings.); communities
will have to participate (with local material, workforce); priority
will be given to infrastructure with a low maintenance cost that can
be provided by the community.    For construction or important
rehabilitation, community will have to prove ownership of the land;
no civil work will be approved for new institutions without an
existing paid staff.
(b)   Pedagogic material.  Books represent a large part of the cost of
primary education paid by parents. Generally, free distribution is
not efficient. An appropriate form of subsidy has to be adopted in
coordination with Fifth IDA-financed Education Project, the Ministry
of Education and the FONEPH. Pedagogic material has to be adjusted
to practical and not theoretical programs, to the skills and training
of the teachers.
4.    Economic and Financial Sustainability. Sub-projects have to be sustainable
at the termination of the project.   Recurrent costs (permanent salaries...)
cannot be financed by the ESF. Institutions will have a minimal experience of
two years, will prove their capacity to pay a permanent staff and will have to
present a consolidated budget.
3.    Cost-efficiency will be assessed using cost and benefit indicators per
beneficiary (such as enrollment ratios, occupation rate, test results and
diploma).

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
The Role of NGOs in Haiti
1.    The Government published a Decree on December 13, 1982 to regulate and/or
control the operations of NGOs.  Most NGOs opposed the Decree on the grounds
that it strongly limited their freedom of action.   Most of them refused to
register under the terms of the Decree. The main objections to the Decree were:
(i) the Decree established a cumbersome bureaucratic procedure for registering;
and, (ii) it introduced control provisions which would have seriously impaired
NGO ability to operate efficiently.
2.    Over the past two years the Government and NGOs have become conscious of
the following: (i) NGOs have recognized the need for institutionalizing their
existence and their activities, but prefer that the Government do so in a way
that protects and respects the rights of both parties; (ii) because the NGOs now
operate in a vacuum, with a lack of sectoral planning and efficient decision
making there is danger that the operations of various NGOs may not fit into a
desirable overall policy; and, (iii) fear on the part of NGOs that some of their
actions may be defeated by administrative and political decisions without them
having the opportunity to defend themselves.
3.     Against this background, the Government circulated a draft of a new Decree
to replace the 1982 Decree in late 1988. The UNDP commissioned a consultant to
review the new proposal. The consultant recommeded changes to the new proposal,
emphasizing that relations between the Government and NGOs be insitutionalized.
In particular, the following recommendations were made: (i) strengthening the
Unit in the Ministry of Planning that is responsible for coordinating NGO
activties; (ii) a wider consulting body, including NGOs, the Government and
representatives of foreign donors, should be established to discuss NGO
development activities and their relation to Government policies and planning.
In addition, it was pointed out that there was an absence of a truly
representative and credible umbrella institution, and that such a body should
be established to coordinate NGO positions vis-a-vis the Government.   The
Government, without much consideration for the UNDP report, published a new
Decree on October 5, 1989, which further strengthened the Government's control
over NGO activities, particularly in the area of financial restrictions. There
was considerable opposition to this Decree from the NGOs, as well as from the
foreign donors.
4.    Several meeti: s were held subsequently between the Government and the
NGOs, where most recommendations made by the NGOs were taken into account.  The
most important of the changes were: Article 5, making it mandatory for an NGO
to obtain special authorization from the Ministry of Planning before carrying
out projects financed by foreign donors. The article was modified to apply to
projects defined by foreign donors, and not to projects prepared by an NGO. Also
the need for special authorization was replaced by _  -.o-objection letter.
Article 8 requested a guarantee deposit of US$10,000 in a Haitian Bank for NGOs

applying for registration. This was removed.  A new article war  introduced
setting up a National Mixed Consultation Committee composed of nine members (4
representatives form the NGOe, one from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two from
foreign donors) under the chairmanship of the NGO Coordinator in the Ministry
of Planning. The purpose of the Committee is to coordinate NGO programs and
activities with national planning objectives and maintain an open dialogue
between the Government and the NGO community. The new Decree which seems to be
satisfactory both to the NGOs and to the Government is expected to be published
within the next three months.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Poverty TarReting Study
Context of the Study
1.    To orient the ESF in financing projects which reach the poor, a study will
be carried out during the preparation phase of ESF which will define the
demographic and geographic characteristics of populations to be served and design
operational mechanisms for ESF to use the reach the poor.
Description of Study
2.    Since many poverty studies exist, the study will not generate new raw data.
It will, instead, organize existing data and conclusions. The widespread poverty
in Haiti makes more sophisticated and costly targeting mechanisms unnecessary
at the beginning of the fund's operations.
3.    Ideally, ESF should reach the poorest of the poor. In some cases the costs
and logistics of reaching those who live in isolated rural communities, however,
will be prohibitive. Moreover, as a demand-driven institution,, ESF will have
difficulty in reaching poor areas which are not served by an institution capable
of preparing projects.   So while it must be accepted that some of the very
poorest may go unattended, the primary objective of the targeting mechanism
should be to limit leakage of benefits to wealthier areas, and not to assure
complete coverage of the very poorest.
4.    The study would contain the following components:
(a)   Literature Review:   review of poverty literature on Haiti from
national  and  international  sources  (e.g.  USAID  documents,
publications on health-, education-, and development-related
journals).  A computerized search should be conducted through an
organization capable of providing it. Attention should be paid both
to qualitative as well as to quantitative data which may exist on
specific sites.
(b)   Statistical Analysis:  an assessment of statistical sources and the
information they offer on specific geographic areas. For example,
the Institut National de Statisstique et Informatique (Mme. Danilia
Altidore) has conducted surveys on consumption and socioeconomic
indicators.  Westinghouse Co. did a health-related study several
years ago, whose data are also available.   Could the existing
computerized data be analyzed to yield information that would
identify the poorest areas which could then be targeted for poverty
alleviation? What indicators are available? Are data available on
a local level to point out specific communities? Some funds should



- 73 -                               ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3
be budgeted for manipulation of existing data bases to put
information into a form usable by ESF.
(c)   Poverty Profile:  formulation of a poverty profile on the basis of
steps (a) and (b). This could have the form of local maps indicating
areas of greatest need on the basis of quantitative indicators. It
could also be a matrix of areas on which information is known and
the indicators which exist:
Poverty Indicators
Per capita    Unemployment    Infant         School       etc....
income         rates            mortality    enrollment
Province/
Village
It is expected that some data will exist for some areas but not for
others and on some indicators but not others. Also, data may exist
about some small villages but not on larger areas. Furthermore, data
may be old. Despite these problems, the widespread poverty in Haiti
and the large number of studies conducted should allow for a
reasonably accurate if not exhaustive analysis and an initial
targeting of specific areas where ESF should ideally operate.
(d)   Institutional  Analysis:    compile  existing  information  on  NGO
geographical and sectoral activity; compilation of institutions
active in various sectors and geographic areas; to the extent
possible, a preliminary evaluation of their effectiveness.
(e)   Field visits:  the consultant would spend two weeks travelling to
the previously identified poorest areas of Haiti to verify the
validity of quantitative data and to identify institutions working
in these areas. The Directors of Promotion and Appraisal will be
informed of the results and will, in subsequent visits contact these
institutions and offer them assistance for acceptable projects.
Programming targets will be established.
Output
5.    The product of these first five tasks would be a brief report (10 pages
maximum) and a profile of the poor in Haiti which would allow targeting based
on geographical areas, sector, occupation, gender, or other available variables.
The consultant will provide technical assistance to the staff of ESF in
establishing poverty targeting mechanisms. The products should include: (i) list
of target institutions, (ii) a general promotional strategy, and (iii) a
beneficiary profile component within the standard forms to be used in appraising



74 -                             ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 3
a project. Specific attention will be paid to rural areas and to children and
female poverty.
6.    Premaration for a Monitoring System.  A system must be established to
evaluate the performance of ESF in reaching the poor in various sectors and
various subpopulations (e.g., poorest of the poor, poor women, the poorest
provinces, etc.). The consultant will propose an acceptable research design.
Possibly, a quasi-experimental design can be used: After approval of a project
and prior to its implementation, a pre-test survey (on indicators to be
determined) will be given to the project area as well as to a control village.
Following project completion, post-test measures will be taken. Care will be
taken to assess factors threatening the internal validity of the design. The
beneficiary assessment methodology is another important tool for project
evaluation. Some continual monitoring will also be possible on a limited basis
through the management information system of ESF. The products of section will
include: (i) preparation of terms of reference for a series of monitoring studies
necessary to evaluate whether ESF has reached its poverty targeting objectives
and to what effect; and (ii) technical assistance to ESF staff in the development
of a key set of indicators, such as project location, beneficiary classification,
etc., to be incorporated into the ESF information system.
Costs and Time Frame
7.    The study should cost no more than an estimated $46,000.  The amount will
be determined by whether a local or international consultant is contracted. In
addition to salary and travel expenses, $2,000 should be earmarked in the
eventuality that ESF needs to pay for services for some limited data processing.
8.    The study will require approximately four months to complete.  Two weeks
are budgeted for travel within Haiti. The remainder of the time the consultant
should be based in the ESF office to provide the aspects of technical assistance
called for in the description of the study.

Proiect Monitorina and Ex-Post Evaluation
1.        ESF with the help of consultants will design a system for the
monitoring and ex-post evaluation of the program.   The objective will be to
provide ESF with an integrated system of feedback on both the short-run
effectiveness of projects and the program as well as their longer-run impact on
developmantal goals.
2.        The overall system will consist of two components, a short-run project
monitoring system and long-run ex-post evaluation system. The former will be
designed to monitor the efficiency and quality of projects and those in
execution. In the monitoring system, moreover, particular emphasis will be given
to providing ESF with updated information on the operation and maintenance of
projects financed by the program. The ex-post system, on the other hand, will
be designed to evaluate the institutional aspects of project management as well
as the longer run developmental impact of the projects themselves including
efficiency in delivering priority services to the target population.
3.        To achieve the above goal, a sample of project sponsors and executed
projects will be selected.  The sample will reflect the different kinds and
scales of both sponsors and sub-project types.   Selected sponsor agencies,
together with the specific subprojects analyzed, will constitute the basic module
of the ex-post analysis.
4.        When evaluating the selected modules,  the evaluation will take
particular note of the role of i) ESF; ii) the Sponsor; iii) beneficiaries in
each state of the subproject cycle:
*  Identification
*  Development and Design
*  Appraisal and Approval
*  Contracting and Execution
*  Supervision
*  Operation and Maintenance
5.        For each sub-project evaluated, the analysis will review the variables
examined in the ex ante appraisal and will compare them with the results actually
achieved, with particular reference to:
Targeting
* The socio economic characteristics of the beneficiaries
* The priority of the project for the beneficiaries

paid to the system's ability to identify and correct problems, and to identify
and dissemLnate successful arrangements.
8.        In carrying out the evaluation, efforts will be made to ldentify
project impacts, both positive and negative, that were not foreseen or analyzed
