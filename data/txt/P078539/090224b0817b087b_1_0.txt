                         (i) to achieve the global targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate in 100% of the districts; and (ii) for the zones where DOTS has been under implementation for
                         five or more years, the incidence of smear-positive TB starts to decline.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The World Bank has supported India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) since its inception in the mid-1990s.The International Development Association
                         (IDA) has provided financing to the program totaling approximately US$ 312 million (US$142 million 1997-2006 and US$ 170 million 2006-2012). RNTCP has met internationally-
                         adopted targets, exceeding 70% detection of new smear positive tuberculosis (TB) cases (79% in 2011) and successfully treating over 85% of those cases (85.1% in 2011). During
                         the past five years, the program examined more than 36 million persons through sputum-smear microscopy and treated more than 7.5 million TB patients, saving an estimated one
                         million lives. RNTCP has made TB services available to the entire Indian population, delivering diagnostic services through 13,000 quality-assured microscopy centers embedded in

                         response to multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, having established 42 specialized laboratory services and extended treatment to over 12,000 MDR-TB patients. RNTCP works closely
                         with HIV/AIDS services - a majority of TB patients treated under the RNTCP are now screened for HIV. The project closed on September 30, 2012.

                         Despite this success, large challenges remain, as each year in India there are an estimated 2.3 million new cases of TB. The program has developed a National Strategic Plan for
                         2012-17 that includes further expansion of service delivery through the government health system, further scale-up of the response to MDR-TB, improvements in diagnostic services,
                         and better engagement with private sector health providers. The plan includes a significant increase in budget for the program, as well as increased domestic funding.
