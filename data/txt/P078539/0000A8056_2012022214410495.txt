                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         (i) to achieve the global targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate in 100% of the districts; and (ii) for the zones where DOTS has been under implementation for
                         five or more years, the incidence of smear-positive TB starts to decline.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This credit has accounted for a significant proportion of central government funding of India’s tuberculosis (TB) control program during the period 2006-12. During this period, the
                         program has expanded coverage of standardized diagnosis and treatment services (directly-observed treatment - short course, DOTS) to the entire population. For diagnosis, it has
                         established more than 13,000 sputum microscopy centers in the laboratories of primary health facilities across the country, while more than 400,000 DOTS providers manage
                         treatment with “patient-wise? boxes of the full course of medication. The program has ensured uninterrupted drug supply for first-line treatment through centralized procurement and
                         an effective logistics system. The program has meet internationally-adopted targets, exceeding 70% detection of new smear positive TB cases (73.5% to the third quarter of 2011)

                         and successfully treating over 85% of those cases (87.6% to the third quarter of 2011). The program has had considerable success in collaboration with the national HIV/AIDS
                         program. It has expanded diagnosis and treatment of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), establishing four national reference laboratories and 31 accredited state-level laboratories
                         for diagnosis, so far putting on treatment a total of 6,871 MDR-TB patients.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The program has developed a new national strategic plan for the period 2012-17 which is currently being reviewed by government. With ambitious "universal coverage" objectives,
                         the plan includes new and innovative activities relating to scaling-up engagement with the private sector, new diagnostics, and responding to MDR-TB. The project is slated to close
                         on March 31, 2012, but the government has submitted a request for a two-year extension and additional financing of US$ 100 million.
