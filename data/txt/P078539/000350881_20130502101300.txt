1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In 2005, India’s population was an estimated 1.15 billion with gross national income
(GNI) per capita of US$ 730. The economy was growing rapidly at an annual rate of
9.3% while 27.5% of the population was estimated to be living below the national
poverty line. Overall health indicators were improving: for example, the infant mortality
rate fell from 73 to 55 per 1,000 births between 1995 and 2005, while life expectancy
rose from 60 to 63 years during the same period. Public spending on health, however,
remained low at only 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to a figure of
3.9% for private spending on health care (World Bank, 2012; GOI Press Information
Bureau, 2007).

Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly-fatal bacterial disease that spreads through the air and
attacks the lungs but can also infect other parts of the body. Not all infections lead to
active disease, but left untreated, each person with infectious TB will spread the germs to
10-15 people every year. When a person with infectious TB is identified (using a
microscope to look for TB bacilli in a smear of the person's sputum), a full course of
treatment over six to eight months can usually cure the disease. DOTS (directly-observed
treatment, short-course) is the internationally-recognized cost-effective public health
strategy for diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-
TB) can develop when the disease becomes resistant to the standard treatment due to
misuse of anti-TB drugs and/or interrupted or incomplete treatment. HIV infected persons
are at a significantly higher risk of contracting TB infection.

Although TB affects all socio-economic groups in India, the disease is disproportionately
borne by the poorest and marginalized sections of society. It often affects the most
productive age groups, and can pull households deeper into poverty due to the long
course of treatment and cost of drugs, as well as foregone productivity and wages. It was
estimated that in 2005 the direct costs of TB in India were US $300 million annually
while the indirect costs were US $3 billion (GOI MOHFW, 2006).

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that annual TB incidence in India in
2005 was 209 new infections per 100,000 population. This translated to about 2.4 million
new cases each year. Prevalence (new plus existing cases) was estimated at 358 per
100,000 population, or around 4.1 million cases. Mortality due to TB was estimated at 36
per 100,000 population, or about 410,000 deaths annually. (WHO, 2011) WHO estimated
that 5.7% of TB cases had HIV infection, and based on small studies it was speculated
that MDR-TB could be present in up to 3% of new TB cases (i.e. 55,000 cases) (WHO,
2006b).

In order to address a number of weaknesses of the existing national TB program, between
1993 and 1997, the Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) piloted the DOTS
strategy in several states. The strategy involved highly-standardized systems for



                                            1
diagnosis, treatment, supply, administration, and monitoring. Drugs were centrally-
procured and entire courses of treatment were made available in individual “patient-wise?
boxes, administered to patients under direct observation. Dedicated TB program staff
were put in place at the sub-district (i.e. TB Units), district, state, and central levels, and a
network of externally-financed consultants provided technical support (WHO, 2010).
After 1997, RNTCP was scaled-up nationally in phases, notably supported by an
International Development Association (IDA) credit of US$100 million between 1997
and 2006. The IDA credit represented the majority of program financing, while other
international partners also provided significant support (WHO, 2010). Starting in 2000,
international partners contributed to a Joint Monitoring Mission (JMM) every three years,
coordinated by WHO, while annual missions led by the World Bank also included other
partners. As RNTCP continued to expand coverage, its annual budget rose from US$36
million in 2002 to US$57 million in 2006 (WHO, 2006a).

From covering 18 million people in 1998, by March 2006, RNTCP had achieved
nationwide coverage; that is, TB services were made available to the entire population
according to the program’s norms (i.e. one TB Unit per 500,000 population) (GOI
MOHFW, 2007). From around 30,000 patients initiating treatment under the program in
1998, by 2006, 1.4 million received treatment annually from RNTCP. In 2006, case
detection and cure rates were close to the international targets of 70% and 85%
respectively. (Table 1) Since 1997, the program had evaluated more than 24 million
people with suspected TB and treated more than 6 million patients (GOI MOHFW, 2007).
WHO estimated that TB prevalence had declined from 550 per 100,000 population in
1995 to 280 in 2007, while estimated mortality declined from 44 per 100,000 to 29 in the
same period (WHO, 2010), suggesting that the program was having a significant impact
on disease prevalence (by shortening the average duration of infection) and mortality (by
successfully treating a large proportion of cases). RNTCP reported that its services had
saved 1.2 million lives by 2006 (GOI MOHFW, 2007).

TB services, a number of other challenges came to the fore. They were described by a
2006 joint mission involving international partners. The mission report suggested that
rapid expansion of the program had outpaced the health system’s capacity to effectively
supervise and ensure quality, and that systems for procurement, human resource
development and monitoring needed further strengthening. Capacity at the state level
needed to be further developed, particularly in the poorer-performing states. More work
was needed on increasing community awareness of the availability of TB services. The
mission report stated that coordination with the national HIV/AIDS program had started
but required expansion. It acknowledged that effective implementation of RNTCP was
the best strategy for preventing MDR-TB but urged the program to implement a strategy
for diagnosis and management of MDR-TB. It indicated that although there has been
progress, involvement of the private sector in the program was not yet sufficient (WHO,
2006a).

In 2006, the Stop TB Partnership (which includes the World Bank) adopted the Stop TB
Strategy, including the overall objectives of achieving universal access to high-quality
care for all people with TB and protecting vulnerable populations from TB, TB/HIV and
MDR-TB. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halting and beginning to
reverse the incidence of TB by 2015 was adopted. Six areas of focus were emphasized:
(i) expansion and enhancement of high-quality DOTS; (ii) addressing TB/HIV, MDR-TB
and the needs of poor and vulnerable populations; (iii) contribution to health system
strengthening; (iv) engagement with all care providers; (v) empowerment of people with
TB and communities; and (vi) promotion of research (WHO and Stop TB Partnership,
2006).

In 2005-06, development of the second phase of RNTCP (RNTCP II) (which was
indistinguishable from preparation of the second IDA credit) reflected the challenges
facing the program as well as strategies being adopted at the international level.

The Government of India’s (GOI) Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) included continued
commitment to TB control and emphasized integration of RNTCP and other disease-
specific programs into the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) that was launched in
2005 (GOI Planning Commission, 2008). The World Bank’s 2005-08 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) described the planned program’s contributions to the MDGs, and stated
that because infectious diseases are of global concern, with MDR-TB presenting a
particular threat, and that they disproportionately affect the poor, the Bank would
continue to support India’s efforts to control TB and other diseases.

1.2 Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was: (i) to achieve the global
targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate in all districts of the country; and (ii) for
the zones where DOTS has been under implementation for five or more years, the
incidence of smear-positive TB starts to decline.?




                                             3
The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) stated the PDO more broadly, “to support
the Borrower’s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program Phase II (the Program),
aimed at treating and reducing the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) throughout its territory.?
The DCA formulation is consistent with the higher level objectives to which the program
contributes as stated in the PAD: “The proposed operation would help reduce mortality
and morbidity due to TB and interrupt transmission of infection through consolidating
program performance and expanding program coverage.?

The PDO was to be measured by two outcome indicators as well as 22 intermediate
outcome indicators (see the ICR Datasheet) above.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO and/or indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the program were to be people infected with TB in India, as
well as their families and communities. In addition, groups who were singled out for
particular attention were to be: (i) poor, tribal, and other “hard to reach? populations; (ii)
HIV/AIDS patients; (iii) children suffering from TB; (iv) MDR-TB patients; and (v) TB
patients who seek care from the private sector.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project can be considered analogous to a sector-wide approach (SWAp) in that the
IDA financing was contributing to an overall program (i.e. RNTCP II) which domestic
and other external financing also supported. The operation supported two “outputs?
(components) of the RNTCP II program, as follows:

1. RNTCP services consolidated

This component aimed at consolidating and sustaining the quality of the RNTCP services
that had been established across the country over the previous eight years. This included
the following:

   (i)     Improvement in the quality of laboratory services, including establishment of
           intermediate reference laboratories (IRL), introducing a laboratory quality
           assurance (QA) system, and ensuring routine reporting of QA results in order
           to inform measures for improvement.

   (ii)    Improvement in supervision and monitoring, including field monitoring, a
           computerized management information system (MIS), surveys to estimate
           incidence, and staff increases in low-performing areas.




                                              4
   (iii)   Strengthening of information, education and communication (IEC), including
           creating awareness among patients and health care providers of the free-of-
           charge RNTCP services, advocating for commitment to TB control, and
           enhancing provider-patient communication.

   (iv)    Development of institutional capacity, including strengthening the Central TB
           Division (CTD) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW);
           developing managerial capacity at the state and district levels; supporting
           further decentralization of program management and strengthening staff in
           large and poorly-performing states, providing quality training, and supporting
           public and private medical colleges on DOTS training and implementation.

2. RNTCP outreach to target special groups expanded

This component aimed to maximize access to TB services by under-served and other
vulnerable groups. This included the following:

   (i)     Improvement of coverage of poor, tribal and other “hard to reach? groups,
           including implementing activities identified by a social assessment (SA) and
           tribal action plan (TAP), using incentives for health staff in difficult and tribal
           areas, and providing additional financial and managerial support to poor-
           performing areas.

   (ii)    Promotion of the involvement of private health care providers in RNTCP and
           DOTS provision, including continuing with ongoing public-private mix
           (PPM) efforts and drawing from their experience, developing a plan for
           further expansion of PPM, providing additional training, and undertaking
           operational research.

   (iii)   Deepening of HIV/TB coordination, including strengthening of joint planning,
           health communication, training, surveillance and case-finding, as well as
           increasing staffing.

   (iv)    Improvement in the care of pediatric cases, including introducing standardized
           drug regimens, ensuring availability of diagnostic facilities, training, and
           reporting.

   (v)     Development of the program’s response to MDR-TB, including establishing
           laboratory capacity, improving surveillance, establishment of clinical centers,
           and “gradual expansion? of access to drug resistance testing and MDR-TB
           treatment for patients who fail treatment under the RNTCP’s base program.

1.6 Revised Components

Components were not revised.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

In 2009, an amendment to the DCA changed the reimbursement percentage for eligible
expenditures from 80% to 90%, excluded from reimbursement laboratory consumables
and printing (which are procured at decentralized levels), and modified the monetary
thresholds for the use of shopping as a procurement method.

In 2012, the project Closing Date was extended from March 31, 2012 to September 30,
2012 to allow additional time for the preparation and approval of Additional Financing
that had been requested by the Government of India.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The following factors in the preparation process affected the implementation and
outcomes of the project.

Soundness of the background analysis. Project design was informed by the lessons
learned from the first IDA-financed TB program, other Health Nutrition and Population
(HNP) projects, and international best practices. Several lessons learned and gaps were
highlighted and addressed in the design. These included: (i) the need to ensure that core
human resources are available at the state, district and sub-district levels to implement the
program; (ii) the need to decentralize operations and build ownership at the state level;
(iii) the need to assess implementation capacities at the district level prior to the start of
service delivery; (iv) the need to address weak procurement processes to ensure
uninterrupted supply of drugs; (v) the need for strong engagement with the private sector;
and (vi) the need for an effective advocacy and health communication strategy to increase
case detection and demand for services.

Other lessons that informed the design of the project were: advocacy and IEC strategies
implemented by India’s National Leprosy Elimination Program; Malawi’s experience in
improving the performance of program staff at sub-national levels; and China’s
experience in controlling TB through adoption of technical guidelines for DOTS as
recommended by WHO and other international organizations.

Government ownership, commitment, and institutional readiness. IDA had supported
the TB control program in India since 1997 which was and continues to be a priority for
the GOI. Thus, project implementation was grounded in (i) GOI strong commitment and
ownership to the RNTCP, (ii) strong leadership in CTD of MOHFW for managing the
TB program, (iii) an existing TB program with established implementation capacities.

Project design. The design of the project was technically sound, informed by scientific
evidence, and consistent with the internationally accepted approach for TB care. The
overall objectives of the project were highly consistent with the GOI priorities and sector
issues identified. The project was designed to support a single national program also



                                              6
financed by domestic funding and other development partners, with a common technical
strategy, performance indicators, etc. It encompassed a large scope, covered a vast and
diverse geographical area, included multiple sectors (private, public, medical schools,
private drug agencies), and addressed several medical challenges (drug resistance, HIV-
TB co-morbidity, pediatric TB). This was clearly an ambitious undertaking reflecting a
comprehensive approach. In order to extend the reach of TB services, the project design
focused on reaching out to the poor, tribal people and other “hard to reach groups?. This
was complemented with other mechanisms to expand outreach such as: (i) using IEC to
create awareness for TB diagnosis and treatment and generate demand for services; (ii)
strengthening public-private partnership (PPP); and (iii) developing institutional
arrangements to strengthen capacities at the state and district levels for implementation.

While the design was based on global knowledge and best practice, it must be noted that
one overall project objective of reaching 70% coverage and 85% cure in all districts was
ambitious given the wide disparities among the districts and the challenges faced in some
poor and hard-to-reach districts. Also, achieving global targets across all districts in India
is an outcome that would likely materialize beyond the life of the project.

Assessment of risk. In designing the project, the Bank team was aware of the critical
risks to achieving program objectives and accordingly, the project risk was rated as
“Substantial?. The design identified twelve risks, three of which were rated substantial.
   i.   Inability of the program to monitor program achievements in targeted sub-groups.
        Mitigation measures included development of special schemes and monitoring of
        tribal, poor and other vulnerable groups.
  ii. Deficiencies in the procurement system including pharmaceutical quality control.
        Mitigation measures included agreement with the GOI on a comprehensive
        Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP).
 iii. Lack of interest among private and public providers in using DOTS for treatment
        of TB patients. Mitigation measures included the development of a health
        communication strategy and incentive schemes to encourage the adoption of
        DOTS.
One risk that could have been rated higher at appraisal was the weak health systems and
lack of institutional capacities to deal with the rapid expansion of RNTCP II operation.
This risk was rated as moderate and later proved to be a challenge (further described in
Section 2.2).

Quality at Entry. A total budget of US$ 410,000, including US$ 155,000 trust funds was
spent on project preparation. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER), involving several
high-level experts on TB control in India from outside the Bank, was held in March 2005.
The QER raised several issues which were later addressed in the design, notably relating
to institutional capacity, monitoring and evaluation, procurement, and the respective roles
of the public and private sectors. In November 2008, a Quality Assessment of the
Lending Portfolio (QALP) evaluated the overall probability of achieving development
objectives as “Likely,? and concluded that quality of design was “Satisfactory.? The main
strengths in the design that the review identified were: (i) the development objectives
were “highly relevant, appropriate, and well aligned to the country’s social and economic


                                              7
development priorities;? (ii) the design was consistent with the government’s strategy and
the internationally-accepted approach for TB control; (iii) there was careful attention to
coordination with other development partners with harmonization of procedures; (iv)
report-based disbursements were used to fill the program’s funding gaps; (v) monitoring
and evaluation relied on a well-established and functioning national system; and (vi) the
project emphasized reaching the poor, tribal and hard to reach groups. The design
weakness identified by the QALP was that the risk of human resource constraints at the
service provision level should have been explicitly recognized.

The following readiness steps were completed by project approval: (i) development of a
detailed Project Implementation Plan (PIP) by the RNTCP that specified all activities and
budgets for the program; (ii) preparation of a Procurement Manual by the CTD along
with annual plans for the full project period for contracts to be awarded, and procurement
schedules for the first 18 months of project implementation; (iii) a social assessment
study and tribal action plan; and (iv) development of the GAAP by the MOHFW in
consultation with the Bank.

2.2 Implementation

Factors that favorably contributed to the project implementation

Support to ongoing program. Because the project supported an ongoing program,
implementation started immediately after credit effectiveness.

Establishment of institutional arrangements. Several institutional arrangements were
established. These included: (i) decentralization mechanisms and expanding the role of
State TB cells and TB Units; (ii) establishment of five additional units in CTD to manage
supervision, human resource management, advocacy and communication, finance, and
procurement and hiring of contractual staff; (iii) establishing an Empowered Procurement
Wing (EPW) within the MOHFW; (iv) development of an IEC strategy for hard-to-reach
groups; and (v) development of a national PPM framework.

Strong government commitment and leadership. After its rapid expansion between
1997 and 2006, the government was strongly committed to the further development of
RNTCP. There was also strong leadership and management of the program by MOHFW.
The 2008 QALP singled out these factors as strengths of project implementation.

Strong supervisory and M&E system. RNTCP II was supported by a strong reporting
system that has been in place for several years. The program had dedicated supervisory
staff at the TB Unit (TU), state, district and national levels, who implemented regular and
structured field monitoring. This well-established system supported the problem
identification process and technical support to states and expedited the progress toward
achieving the set targets. The 2008 QALP emphasized the positive effect on
implementation of proactive staff in CTD in tracking implementation progress and
supporting states in resolving issues as they arose.




                                            8
Effective partnership arrangements. Several bilateral and multilateral partners
supported the RNTCP II, with each financing different activities in different states and
districts. The GOI was successful in coordinating this support and in establishing one set
of systems and procedures to be used by all. Joint Monitoring Missions were led by
WHO every three years, while annual joint missions were organized by the Bank. These
provided a single forum for technical supervision and support to the program by the Bank
and other partners (for example, the 2009 JMM served as the Mid-Term Review of the
IDA project).

Contracted technical assistance. WHO played an important role in ensuring supervision
and technical assistance at the state and district levels. The role of WHO consultants was
critical in providing technical assistance and supervision needed for project
implementation.

Harmonization with National Rural Health Mission. NRHM (launched in 2005) is a
central government program designed to strengthen basic health care services in rural
areas, including integrating disease-specific programs, such as RNTCP, into sector-wide
systems. Therefore, at the time of project preparation, the project team paid adequate
attention to ensuring the linkages between the NRHM and project design. During the
course of project implementation, the government progressively integrated its financial
management systems with those of the project. However, there was variation in the level
of harmonization with NRHM across states, as some states used flexible NRHM funding
to support TB services, while others did not.

Focus on governance. A Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) of procurement under
health sector projects financed by IDA in India contributed to a 15-month period between
appraisal and Board approval of the TB project (World Bank, 2007). As a result,
procurement arrangements for the project were further strengthened, including out-
sourcing procurement management, and adopting various other accountability measures
in the GAAP. These measures may have contributed to some delays in implementation
later on, but overall, the strengthened procurement, drug quality, and other measures were
implemented and had a positive impact on overall project quality and outcomes. The
2008 QALP found that proactive implementation of the action plan by CTD was one of
the main strengths of project implementation.

Factors that negatively affected project implementation

Human resource constraints. The rapid expansion and scale up of the RNTCP II
presented challenges to the central and state levels to effectively manage the program.
Key impediments included shortages of staff at all levels, delayed hiring for key positions
(such as IEC Officers), insufficient and high turnover among laboratory technicians, and
additional workload and stress on existing human resources due to the introduction of
MDR-TB services.

Difficulties in engaging the private sector. Two-thirds or more of all health care
provision in India is in the private sector and effective engagement between government



                                            9
and private providers is a challenging issue across the sector. During project
implementation, RNTCP successfully engaged with private medical colleges and
developed a variety of PPM schemes to collaborate with other for- and non-profit health
care providers. However, partly due to administrative inefficiencies, such as delayed
payments, the scale of many of the PPM schemes has been limited.

Integration with general health system administration. One rationale for the creation
of a disease-specific program implemented by state-level “TB Societies? was to avoid the
limitations of the overall government health system’s routine administration and
procedures. The TB program represents just 2% of the NRHM budget; as the TB
program’s administration has become progressively integrated into management of the
general health system, some processes have experienced delays, notably relating to
financial disbursements and audits.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The Results Framework included 2 PDO and 22 intermediate outcome
indicators, most of which were technically sound. However, there were a number of
deficiencies worthy of notice: (i) the denominator (incidence) for the PDO indicator
relating to district-level case detection rates has proven to be flawed in that incidence
estimates are based on surveys that are representative of much larger geographic areas
(zones) (see Section 3.2); (ii) out of 22 intermediate outcome indicators, 12 had
“increasing trends? for targets; (iii) out of the 22 intermediate outcome indicators, 8 did
not have a baseline established at project approval, (iv) the use of the international targets
for case detection rate (70%) and cure rate (85%) to measure performance at the district
level may not have been appropriate, as these rates were already high and increasing
them even by a small margin would likely take more time than the life of the project.

The RNTCP II benefited from an existing well-functioning national M&E system which
monitored the overall program regardless of financing source. There was a robust
national recording and reporting system, with a good structure and well-defined
supervision roles and responsibilities at each level.

M&E implementation. The program implemented a structured supervision and reporting
schedule that cascaded down from the central level to the periphery. Bi-annual national
reviews and quarterly state and district reviews were performed using standard indicators,
supervision checklists and reporting formats. Data on service delivery are aggregated at
the district level which is then compiled at the state level using a computer-based system.
The program is currently scaling-up a web-based reporting system which should improve
the notification of TB cases.

M&E utilization. The program has a well-established review mechanism using the data
from the system and the results of the field assessments. Periodic internal and external
reviews take place where CTD conducts one thorough state review annually while each
state performs its own internal reviews in two districts each quarter. The CTD and states
analyze the quarterly reports received from the states and districts and provide feedback



                                             10
to the districts for further analysis and corrective action. In these evaluations, the focus is
on a range of issues including validating program data, sharing implementation
experiences by states and districts, and garnering and encouraging administrative and
political will and support. In 2011, all states were provided feedback on their quarterly
reports while more than 60% of the states provided feedback to their districts for all
quarters (GOI MOHFW, 2012a). The M&E data are compiled into numerous quarterly
reports and one annual report throughout the year that are publicly available on the web
(GOI MOHFW, 2012b). The program also had external reviews by the World Bank team
and WHO-coordinated Joint Monitoring Missions were carried out every three years to
review progress.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance. There was full compliance with the Bank safeguard policies
during project implementation. The project triggered the Bank’s Environmental
Assessment safeguard policy, classified as Category B (due to site-specific and
manageable environmental impacts). The main environmental issue relates to
occupational health and safety and management of infectious medical waste generated
from the activities being undertaken at the clinics. At the beginning of the project, the
CTD developed an Infection Management & Environmental Plan, which included a
strategy for capacity building, waste management and monitoring. The Plan included a
caveat that, final disposal from TB centers would be the responsibility of overall facility
management of the health system institutions where centers are located, and their scope
of influence is therefore limited. The CTD implemented the environment management
plan during project implementation, which included revision of training modules,
ongoing training of health staff, and encouragement of hepatitis B immunization for
health staff, dissemination of guidelines on occupational practices and standard
precautions, and establishment of a reporting system on medical waste. During various
assessments and supervision mission reviews, it was found that in a majority of facilities,
training on the subject had been undertaken satisfactorily, medical waste management
systems were in place, and supplies were adequate. Treatment and disposal of sputum
cups and slides were being done as per the guidelines disseminated by RNTCP. Many of
the facilities have functioning Waste Management Monitoring Committees in place. In
Addition to CTD’s specific environmental guidelines, the program was also covered
under the GOI’s national policy of infection control and waste management which
allowed this component to be managed under a more integrated approach for various
common activities such as training, dissemination of guidelines, budgetary allocations
and monitoring.

The project triggered the Bank’s Indigenous Peoples safeguard policy, Operational
Directive (OD) 4.20, and therefore adopted a Tribal Action Plan, also referred to as the
Tribal Development Pan (TDP) in the PAD. This was informed by a 2005 Social
Assessment that surveyed TB patients and community members among tribal populations,
migrant workers, slum inhabitants, and industrial workers. Based on the Social
Assessment, Component 2 aimed at strengthening program outreach to cover
marginalized and hard to reach groups such as tribal, rural poor and urban slum dweller



                                              11
communities. The measures proposed to address this issue were focused on “increasing
access of “hard to reach populations? to treatment by bridging information, access and
provider gaps; and enabling the disadvantaged groups to overcome socio-economic and
cultural barriers. The TAP was prepared in consultation with tribal groups, women, and
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), compliant with OD 4.20 and the measures to address
social issues were captured in the DCA. Overall, the project design went beyond the
compliance requirements of OD 4.20 to address social inclusion issues.

During implementation, the RNTCP took a number of measures in tribal areas to improve
access to TB services, including doubling the per capita number of TB Units and
microscopy centers, providing travel allowances to patients and attendants, and funding
salary incentives and increased travel allowances for health staff. The program monitored
its performance in tribal and poor areas. In 2011, the program completed a second Social
Assessment, focusing on tribal and urban slum populations which captured achievements,
lessons learned, and the way forward. The TAP was implemented in 85 districts in 19
states, covering 55.4 million people. The SA of 2011 showed that performance of tribal
districts with regard to case detection and treatment success was better compared to the
poor/backward districts although the number of suspects examined per 100,000 was low
in both the tribal and poor/backward districts. Treatment services under RNTCP have
performed well; and data recorded in the SA of 2011 suggest that once a TB patient
enters the program, the chance of her/his completing treatment and getting cured are high.
From a baseline of 79% case detection rate and 86% treatment success rate in 2006, the
averages in 85 predominantly tribal districts in 2011 were 80% and 88% respectively.
Community participation was encouraged through tribal schools and local bodies; Non-
Governmental Organization (NGO) participation was not prominent. Operational
research covered tribal areas and other hard to reach populations. The qualitative study
examined the knowledge and experience of TB patients (both those who received care
from RNTCP and those who did not), as well as other community members. Some
respondents went to government health services because of their low cost and the
availability of drugs, while others preferred private health care providers due to ease of
access and better service. A number of other issues were identified by the SA, including
the often long pathway between start of symptoms and initiation of treatment, and
economic barriers to treatment such as transport cost and lost wages. Overall, the
implementation of TAP was effective and the client continues to expand measures
beyond the project to enhance implementation quality and outreach to the hard to reach
populations.

Financial Management Compliance. Financial management was carried out using the
same systems and procedures developed under the first IDA-financed project. These were
implemented by CTD and state-level TB “societies,? separate from regular government
systems. During project preparation, as part of the broader reforms in the implementation
of centrally funded health projects, the government indicated its intention to consolidate
the state level health "societies" using common financial management systems for all
health programs under the NRHM umbrella. While the Bank supported the overall
reforms, it was recognized that this would entail substantial changes at the state level and
was flagged as a risk in the PAD. Also specified as financial management risks were the



                                            12
challenges of ensuring consistency in the quality of financial management arrangements
across the states and districts, delays in submission of audit reports, and staffing gaps at
the state level. These challenges indeed became evident during implementation. Merging
of RNTCP financial management with that of NRHM was a factor in delayed audit
reports, including in one case at the end of the project implementation period where a
government investigation of alleged corruption under NRHM prevented one state audit
report to be submitted. External audit reports continued to point to weaknesses in
compliance with the internal control framework, especially with respect to the
management of advances, preparation of bank reconciliation statements, uneven quality
of accounting records, etc., which often resulted in qualified audit reports. However, the
impacts of these issues were successfully mitigated through active follow up by CTD and
implementation of remedial action plans. Despite the large scope of the project, the
submission of semi-annual Interim Financial Reports was timely and of acceptable
quality. Overall, the financial management arrangements were satisfactory.

Procurement Compliance. With regard to procurement implementation, MOHFW
established an EPW, although during initial implementation of the project there was a
lack of clarity about the division of responsibility between this new entity and CTD.
Procurement implementation by a contracted agency was planned as an interim measure
while MOHFW capacity was developed. A first agent was not contracted until 2007,
delaying initial procurement. A second agent was contracted in 2010, and procurement
was overall managed satisfactorily although the MOHFW lengthy approval process
added significant time to the process. Technical support on inventory management by
WHO contributed to effective pharmaceutical supply management by the program. The
interim measure of an external procurement agent continued until project closure, while
technical assistance to the EPW by the Bank and the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) has had limited impact. Nevertheless, there was progress in the
development of MOHFW procurement capacity with the establishment of a Central
Procurement Agency, while several state governments put in place health sector
procurement agencies.

During project implementation, problems were found with procurement at the state and
district levels in some states, so that the Bank declared mis-procurement for some
contracts. Some items normally procured at those levels were excluded from IDA
financing. CTD also enhanced procurement training and on-the-job support, and
increased post-procurement audits. These steps were effective in that procurement
problems were not evident subsequently.

During project implementation, the government successfully implemented the GAAP. In
the area of quality assurance, MOHFW adopted mandatory WHO Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMP) certification of bidders, audited the GMP status of winning bidders
before contract award (although this led to delays in the contracting process), ensured
pre-dispatch and post-delivery quality testing of all procured pharmaceuticals, and
sourced first-line TB drugs from manufacturers with WHO prequalified products. The
sustainability of some of these measures after project closure is not known, although the




                                            13
government has stated its intention to strengthen national pharmaceutical quality
assurance systems.

Overall, procurement under the project was successful in terms of final outcomes in that
all planned procurements were completed, quality assurance measures were implemented,
and there were no drug stock-outs throughout project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In 2010-2011, the Bank team supported the development of the RNTCP’s 2012-2017
National Strategic Plan (NSP), which adopted the objective of “Universal access for
quality diagnosis and treatment for all TB patients in the community.? This proposed a
significant increase in program resources to over US$ 1 billion in the five year period,
about a tripling of the program’s budget during the previous five years. The National
Strategic Plan involved further expansion of RNTCP’s diagnosis and treatment services,
scale-up of its response to MDR-TB, piloting of new diagnostic technology, development
of information technology (IT) systems, and improved and scaled-up engagement with
the private sector. India’s recently-adopted government-wide 12th Plan (2012-17)
endorsed the TB program’s objectives along with significant increases in overall
government health spending. The government initially requested the Bank for Additional
Financing to the project in order to support the RNTCP’s new strategy, with particular
focus on innovations and pilots in the areas of public-private engagement, IT systems,
diagnostic systems, and urban TB services. However, given the large planned increase in
domestic funding for the health sector and a focus on fully integrating administrative
procedures under NRHM, the MOHFW decided in September 2012 that Additional
Financing from the Bank for the TB program would not be required at that time.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Rating: High)

Objectives

Relevance to current status of TB epidemic. The objectives of the project remain
highly relevant to the current health priorities of India and its efforts to control the TB
epidemic. Despite the significant progress achieved by the GOI in curtailing the spread of
the disease, India continues to have the largest number of new TB cases annually
worldwide with an estimated 2.2 million new cases occurring each year. Moreover, TB
continues to be the third most common cause of death due to infectious diseases with an
estimated 300,000 Indians dying of TB every year. India’s TB epidemic is exacerbated
by an increasing number of drug-resistant cases. About 1 in 20 cases in India or an
estimated 100,000 annually have drug-resistant TB which requires more aggressive TB
control efforts as well as a significantly higher level of resources (WHO, 2012b).

Alignment with national TB strategy, CAS, and MDGs. The objectives remain well-
aligned with India’s latest TB national strategic plan for 2012-2017. The draft plan states
the program’s vision for a “TB-free India,? and articulates the goal of achieving


                                            14
“Universal Access for quality diagnosis and treatment for all TB patients in the
community.? The plan is a continuation of the previous program, building on its
achievements while addressing the gaps that existed at the end of the project. The project
is similarly highly relevant to GOIs commitment to Goal 6 of the UN MDGs. The
program continues to contribute to the global public good of TB control, including
reducing the risks of expansion across borders of drug-resistant TB. The project is also
consistent with the Bank’s 2009-12 CAS which focuses on increasing the effectiveness of
service delivery in the health sector. Since poor and deprived populations are
disproportionately affected by TB, this project clearly contributes to the Bank’s mission
of reducing poverty.

Design

The design of the project continues to be highly relevant to country conditions.
Component 1 (RNTCP services consolidated) remains relevant in that development of the
capacities of the program, along with its further expansion, is an ongoing agenda. The
2012-17 draft strategic plan includes continued improvements in information systems,
management systems, and human resource development, along with substantial
expansion of decentralized administrative and service delivery capacity. Component 2
(RNTCP outreach to target special groups expanded) similarly remains highly relevant,
as improvement and expansion of TB services to reach poor and tribal groups continues
to be a priority, pediatric TB requires ongoing attention, and drug-resistant TB and
engagement with the private sector are major areas of focus for the program’s 2012-17
draft strategic plan.

Implementation

The implementation strategy remains highly relevant, as it continues after the end of the
project with domestic funding. The implementation strategies and structures are indeed
mainstreamed as an ongoing government program, while the TB program (as was
foreseen by the PAD) is being mainstreamed into the broader government health system.
The implementation strategy for addressing drug-resistant TB (establishment of the
necessary diagnostic and treatment capacity) remains highly relevant. Also, the principles
of engagement with the private sector based on incentives and enabling factors remains
relevant today as it did at project appraisal. These were applied during project
implementation as the public private mix schemes were developed and continue to be
highly relevant as the program aims to increase the scale and effectiveness of its
engagement with private providers.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Rating: Satisfactory)

The formulation of the PDO in the PAD consists of two elements, each of which is
equivalent to a PDO indicator. These PDO elements, bolstered by the various
intermediate outcome indicators, can also be considered to reflect aspects of the “higher
level objectives? stated in the PAD as well as the project objective as stated by the DCA
(see Section 1.2 above).



                                           15
A: Methodology for measuring program performance:

PDO 1: to achieve the global targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate in all
districts of the country. This first part of the PDO provides an indicator of progress on
the broader objective to further expand program coverage to reach vulnerable and other
groups with particular needs. This aspect of the PDO is the focus of Component 2 of the
project (RNTCP outreach to target special groups expanded) for which 13 intermediate
outcome indicators were also specified.

PDO 2: the incidence of smear-positive TB starts to decline in zones where DOTS
has been under implementation for five or more years. This second part of the PDO is
an indicator for broader health outcome objectives relating to reducing incidence,
morbidity and mortality due to TB, as well as development of the overall TB program.
Component 1 (RNTCP services consolidated) focuses on continued development of the
overall TB program in support of these broad objectives, with nine intermediate outcome
indicators specified.

B: Progress towards achievement of the PDO:

Overall, the program shows significant achievements with the majority of its indicator
targets met. One of the two PDO indicators was over-achieved while the other was
substantially achieved. While four intermediate outcome indicators surpassed their targets,
14 were fully achieved and four others showed varying levels of improvement (see Table
2 below).

*This PDO indicator #2 is counted as “substantially achieved? given that 113% of the target was reached
for district treatment success rates and 60% of the target was reached for district case detection rates.
**For both of these indicators (IO #2 and #3) treatment success rate was achieved at 96% for states and
125% for zones. Despite this, these indicators are considered as “partly achieved? because the case
detection rate was achieved at 46% of states and 25% of zones.

PDO 1: Achieve global targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate in all
districts of the country (Rating=Satisfactory)

This PDO was chosen to reflect the priority given to improving TB service coverage (and
program performance) in districts that were under-performing in relation to
internationally-adopted indicators and targets. Detecting at least 70% of estimated smear-
positive new TB cases (i.e. the TB bacilli can be observed in sputum smear through
microscopy), and curing 85% of those cases, were performance indicators linked to MDG

6, adopted by WHO in 1991 and affirmed by the Stop TB Partnership in 2006 (WHO and
Stop TB Partnership, 2006).1

Nationally, the program has met the global targets, exceeding 70% case detection (72%
in 2011, compared to 66% in 2005) and exceeding 85% treatment success rate (88% in
2011, compared to 86% in 2005). Figure 1 shows that the program maintained high levels
of case detection and treatment success rates during the life of the project.

The target for this PDO indicator was set at 450 districts. Starting from a baseline of 111
districts, 222 districts reached both global indicator targets in 2011. Considering the two
global indicators separately, 269 districts reached the case detection target, while 508
districts reached the treatment success target in 2011. There has been substantial
improvement since baseline: the number of districts that reached the case detection target
between 2005 and 2011 increased by 42% (from 189 to 269), while the number of
districts that reached the treatment success rate target increased by 58% (from 322 to
508). The number of districts that reached both targets increased by 100% (from 111 to
222).

The realism of a target of 100% of the districts across India can be questioned given the
wide disparities in socio-economic conditions and health system capacities across the
country. In addition, although the program continues to monitor case detection statistics
at the district level, in 2010, RNTCP suggested to the Bank team that this indicator is
flawed in that the denominator – the estimated total number of smear-positive cases in
each district, or incidence – is based on data that are not representative of the district

 Currently, the internationally-accepted indicator is “treatment success rate,? which refers to patients who
are (i) cured or (ii) completed treatment but did not meet the criteria for either cure or failure. (WHO,
2012b) “Cure rate? is no longer reported by RNTCP or WHO.


                                                     17
level (the data are representative of each of four large “zones? into which the country is
divided for purposes of incidence surveys).2

Like this PDO indicator, several intermediate outcome indicators pertain to improving
geographic coverage of TB services. With a baseline of 8 and a target of 28 (the total
number of states in the country), the number of states that have reached the global smear-
positive case detection and treatment success rate targets was 10 in 2011 (Intermediate
Outcome (IO) 2). Thirteen states exceeded the case detection target, while 27 states
exceeded the treatment success target. An intermediate indicator and target adopted by
the project was to achieve the two targets in four zones.3 With a baseline of zero, both
global targets were achieved in one zone (North) in 2011 (IO 3). While one zone
exceeded the case detection target, all five zones exceeded the treatment success rate
target. Finally, an intermediate outcome target of 100% population coverage (i.e.
availability of RNTCP services according to its norms) was reached as early as 2006 (IO
4).

TB Services for Poor and Tribal Populations
An important part of this aspect of the PDO is to improve TB services for poor and tribal
populations. The program targeted 145 poor and 85 tribal districts. These districts were
provided with special incentives in the form of additional financial and managerial
support and implemented special activities to improve detection and treatment success
rates. An intermediate outcome indicator referred to the global targets for case detection
and treatment success rates in these districts (IO 9). In tribal districts between 2006 and
2011, the average case detection rate increased from 79% to 80% while the average
treatment success rate increased from 86% to 88%. With these figures, the program met
its targets in tribal districts. In districts designated as poor, between 2006 and 2011, the
average case detection rate increased from 55% to 67% and the average treatment success
rate increased from 85% to 89%. Thus, the program substantially increased its detection
rate and exceeded its target treatment success rate in poor districts.

Development of TB/HIV Services
Increasing HIV/TB coordination has been a very positive contribution by the project
given the importance and risk of co-infection. Several intermediate outcome indicators
are relevant. From 11,331 in 2005, the annual number of people referred for TB testing
from voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services in 2011 was 435,880 (with a
cumulative total of almost 1.8 million during the course of the project) (IO 13). The
annual number of HIV/AIDS patients referred from VCT services and diagnosed with TB
increased significantly from a baseline of 3,034 patients in 2005 to 37,865 in 2011 (with
a cumulative total of 189,982 during the course of the project) (IO 14). Similarly, this
coordination increased the annual number of HIV-TB patients placed on DOTS, going
from 2,047 patients in 2005 to 34,355 in 2011 (cumulative total of 161,288). The

  It should also be noted that WHO and the Stop TB Partnership no longer emphasize the case detection
rate partly due to uncertainties about estimated TB incidence. (WHO and Stop TB Partnership, 2011)
3
  Although incidence surveys are representative of four zones, the program has added a fifth zone (North
East) for reporting purposes.

program is making strides in improving the diagnosis of TB among HIV positive
patients; however, there still remains room for improvement as the number of HIV
positive patients diagnosed with TB, who are referred from VCT services and put on
DOTS treatment still lags behind the total number of persons diagnosed with TB after
being referred from VCT services as seen in Figure 2.

Improvement in Services for Children with TB
The actual burden of pediatric TB in India is not known due to diagnostic difficulties, but
it has been estimated to be around 10% of the total TB load (GOI MOHFW, 2012c). With
children constituting 36% (400 million) of the total population, this has important
implications on the health system in general and on the TB control program in particular.
Pediatric patients put on DOTS increased significantly from a baseline of 59,846 cases in
2005 to 84,064 in 2011 (cumulative total of 598,869 during the project period) (IO 15).
With these figures, the program exceeded its targets.

Development of Services for Patients with Drug-Resistant TB
In 2006, it was estimated that MDR-TB contributed 3% of all new TB cases in India and
around 15% of retreatment cases. Acknowledging the urgent need to respond to MDR-
TB, the program targeted this group with the objective of (i) increasing the number of
DOTS Plus sites, (ii) increasing the number of MDR-TB patients put on DOTS Plus
treatment, and (iii) increasing the proportion of MDR-TB patients completing treatment.

The MDR-TB program had a slow start, but by 2010, a national scale-up plan was put in
place which led to a substantial increase in the number of patients diagnosed and treated
(Figure 3), despite the complex challenges. The program was successful in putting a
cumulative total of 16,826 MDR-TB patients on DOTS Plus treatment (the intermediate
outcome indicator cumulative target was 4,150) (IO 21) 4 and achieved significant


4
 Although the number of MDR-TB patients reached by the program is still small in relation to the total
estimated burden, more rapid scale-up was not envisioned by RNTCP during this phase and indeed would
have been very difficult given the cost and complexity of diagnosing and treating drug-resistant TB.


                                                                 19
expansion of DOTS Plus sites, reaching 71 sites nationwide (compared to a target of 21
sites) (IO 19). However, not all patients completed their treatment. Program results show
that 49% of patients completed their treatment compared to a target of 70% (IO 22),
illustrating the the challenges of MDR-TB treatment.5

Reaching TB Patients who Seek Care in the Private Sector
A greater engagement of the private sector is essential for increasing TB case detection
and treatment and for improving the quality of TB diagnosis and treatment. The private
sector plays an important role in the provision of care in India with around 80% of first
patients’ visits occurring with private providers (Uplekar et al, 2001). TB patients are no
exception. It is estimated that about two thirds of TB patients treated by the RNTCP have
first sought care in the private sector (Kapoor et al, 2012). To this end, increasing the
engagement of the private sector is crucial for increasing case detection and cure rates.

RNTCP started implementing in 2006 a variety of PPM schemes. The program was
successful in reaching the target by increasing the number of NGOs from a baseline of
1,000 to 2,325 participating NGOs (IO10), and from a baseline of 5,000 participating
private practitioners to 13,397 (IO11). However, these numbers can be considered
inadequate when compared to the size of the private sector in India. Further review of
program data in this area shows mixed results (Table 3). While the program made good
progress in engaging medical colleges, it was less successful with private providers and
NGOs. Medical colleges’ contribution to new case detection reached 23% compared to
only 5% by private providers and NGOs. This is attributed to several factors including
inadequate financial incentives for private providers to engage with RNTCP, delayed
payments under the PPM schemes, and lack of capacity at the local levels to fully engage
with large numbers of private providers.

  Patients identified most easily in the initial phases of scale-up are likely to be suffering from advanced
stages of the disease (leading to mortality despite treatment) while the 24-month course of treatment and
adverse drug reactions can lead to significant defaulting.

PDO 1 achievement: summary
The number of districts that met the global targets increased significantly during the
project period even though it did not reach 100% (which was likely an unrealistic
aspiration). Most of the intermediate outcome indicator targets measuring progress
towards the broader goal of expanding services to poor and vulnerable groups were fully
met while the other indicators were substantially achieved. Therefore, on balance, this
PDO can be considered as having been achieved.

PDO 2: The incidence of smear positive TB starts to decline in zones where DOTS
has been implemented for five or more years. (Rating=Satisfactory)

This PDO indicator was achieved, surpassing the target of 1.34%. The estimated
nationwide incidence of TB declined from the baseline of 1.5% (estimated from a 2000-
2001 survey) to 1.1% (estimated from a 2009-10 survey). In spite of issues with the
measurement of incidence (WHO and Stop TB Partnership, 2011), there are indications
that the risk of TB infection has indeed decreased in India. WHO estimates for annual TB
incidence decreased from 209 per 100,000 in 2005 to 181 per 100,000 in 2011. (WHO,
2011; WHO, 2012b) Program performance indicators are suggestive of a decline in
incidence. For example, the number of suspects examined for each smear positive case
identified has been increasing. The project objective as stated in the legal agreement
mentions incidence, reducing transmission, and morbidity. Incidence and transmission
are closely-related concepts, while morbidity (which can be measured by prevalence)
depends on both incidence and duration of illness. While estimated incidence has
decreased, it is also widely understood that RNTCP has reduced the duration of disease
by treating a large proportion of cases. This is reflected by declines in estimated
prevalence, falling from 358 per 100,000 in 2005 to 249 in 2011.6 (WHO, 2011; WHO,
2012b)




6
 Incidence measures new cases of a disease in a defined time period (i.e. one year), while prevalence
measures all cases of a disease (i.e. new plus existing cases) in a time period.


                                                    21
The legal agreement also mentions an aim to reduce mortality, and the program has
indeed done so by treating and curing millions of TB patients, many of whom would not
have been received care or would have received poor quality treatment. WHO estimated
that the TB mortality rate in India was 36 per 100,000 population in 2005 and 24 per
100,000 in 2011. (WHO, 2011; WHO, 2012b)

As indicated earlier, the stated project objective of decreasing incidence is a function of
how well the program performs in setting up the systems needed for implementation.
This was to a large extent achieved through service consolidation and quality
(Component 1) which are analyzed in the following section:

Overall program performance in terms of global indicators is described in Figure 1 above.
Table 3 below provides absolute numbers of suspects tested, cases identified, and cases
cured, through RNTCP’s network of more than 13,000 designated microscopy centers
(DMCs) and 400,000 DOTS providers, as well as the program’s private sector partners.
This data shows that the program successfully maintained the achievements after its rapid
scale-up before 2006, while continuing to expand coverage. In addition, as mentioned
above, during the project period, RNTCP has started to scale-up services for drug-
resistant TB, providing care to a total of 16,826 cases.

The program identified four areas in Component 1 that are critical for consolidating and
improving the quality of services. This included improvements of laboratory services,
supervision and monitoring, operations research, advocacy and health communication,
and strengthening of institutional capacity to implement the program.

Quality of laboratory services: Part of the program’s success for improving TB case
detection involved the support for substantial physical expansion of laboratories at the
state level that provide quality diagnostic services. By 2012, a network of 42 IRLs was
established, exceeding the intermediate outcome indicator target of 24 laboratories (IO
18). This was supported by the development of an accreditation system that was put in
place to monitor the quality of diagnosis and staff performance. Nevertheless, despite the
progress made in achieving the targets set by the project, several evaluation reports


                                              22
indicate that systemic problems exist that hinder program progress in this area – mainly,
poor quality of the lab infrastructure and high turnover rate among lab technicians.

Supervision and monitoring: The project started with an existing well-functioning and
robust national monitoring system and continued to strengthen the system of supervision
at all levels. Several achievements were made including systematizing the evaluation
process of states and districts’ operations, standardizing the bi-annual and quarterly
reviews that led to doubling the number of districts for in-depth evaluation per month,
improvement actions, and computerizing the system at the state level with the
introduction of a web-based reporting system. Having a strong and improved monitoring
system contributed directly to improving the quality of TB services.

Operational Research (OR): The purpose of OR is to generate an appropriate and
continuous flow of information around priority topics that will strengthen service
delivery and demand for TB services. Several achievements have been made during the
course of the project lifetime including, establishing a State and National Steering
Committees, identifying 70 OR areas and engaging medical colleges in the process.
Efforts by the RNTCP have been encouraging, and in 2011 alone, there were a total of 62
OR proposals submitted to the zonal OR committee for review. In 2011, the CTD also
established its first OR course in collaboration with a number of partner agencies.

Information Education and Communication: An important element for reaching program
objectives was to address the social determinants of the disease through community-
based approaches. In that regard, the project aimed to focus on three IEC strategies: (i)
creating awareness of TB symptoms and demand for DOTS services; (ii) advocating for
policy, and (iii) enhancing patient-provider communication and counseling.

Achievements in IEC were slow at the beginning of the project but picked up at a later
phase. Several organizational issues were needed to lay the ground for IEC operations
such as establishing, staffing and training IEC officers at state levels and communication
facilitators at the district levels. The program surpassed its targets with indicators
showing a substantial increase in the level of awareness about free cost of TB drugs for
TB diagnosis and treatment, from a base-line of 16% in 2007 to 84% by 2011 (IO7). 51%
of targeted communities were also aware that DOTS is the right way for treatment and
84% were aware that TB treatment is free at government facilities (IO7). Awareness
among government providers showed even a more dramatic increase going from 52% in
2007 to 97% in 2011 (IO6).

To focus and strengthen IEC activities, the project also established two posts to support
states and districts in their activities. At the state level an IEC officer post was established
and at the district level, communication facilitators were put in place to encourage and
strengthen the IEC component within the program. Despite this progress, it must be noted
that during ICR interviews some partners expressed concern that achievements in IEC
need to be sustained in order to continue to underline the seriousness of the TB epidemic
which may not be sufficiently realized outside the RNTCP.

Institutional capacity: Overall, the program supported the expansion of institutional
capacities and the effective implementation of national strategies and policies under the
stewardship of the MOHFW. The project assisted in establishing and staffing several key
positions and initiated a wide range of capacity building and training activities. As of
2012, the majority of the endorsed positioned were filled and trained. This included 90%
of District TB Officers (DTOs), 82% of DOTS-Plus and HIV-TB supervisors, 94% of
Senior TB Lab Supervisors (STLS), 100% of data entry operators.

3.3    Efficiency (Rating: High)

Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are a frequent measure of health benefits in a
population. DALYs are the years of life saved due to an intervention, adjusting for
disability incurred by a disease over the course of individuals’ lifetimes. Generally, health
interventions that cost less than US$ 100 per DALY gained are considered highly cost-
effective. Among many other studies, The Disease Control Priorities Project, supported
by the World Bank, has analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the DOTS strategy and found
it to be “among the most cost-effective of all interventions available to improve health? in
low and middle-income countries (Jamison et al., 2006).

In 2007, a study estimated the cost-effectiveness of the RNTCP program between US$16
(for smear positive patients) and US$63 (for smear-negative patients) per DALY gained
(Chow et al. 2007). In 2011, another study estimated the cost-effectiveness ratios
between US$21 and US$35 per DALY gained between 1997-2006. Data also suggest that
cost per DALY gained in 2006 was as low as US$ 19 (Goodchild et al., 2011). RNTCP is
by far situated at the lower end of the cost per DALYs gained when compared to other
health interventions (See Annex 3).

Cost-benefit analyses have been conducted to determine the economic burden of the TB
program in India. In a 2007 study that projected the cost-benefit ratio of DOTS from
2006-2015, it was estimated that provision of DOTS in India would avert 3.2 million
deaths with an economic benefit of more than US$ 350 billion or US$ 191 per dollar
spent (Laxminarayan et al., 2007) (See Annex 3).

Between 1997-2006, RNTCP treated 6.3 million patients. This led to a total health benefit
of 29.2 million DALYs gained and 1.3 million deaths averted. Analyses also indicate that
in terms of TB patients, each case treated under DOTS in India results in a gain of 4.6
DALYs and US$13,935 in economic benefits. The total economic gain was US$19.7
billion in 2006 and US$88.1 billion from 1997 to 2006. The return per dollar spent was
US$115 from 1996 to 2006. Following full DOTS coverage in 2006, the return per dollar
spent increased to US$155. The cost per DALY gained from 1997 to 2006 was US$26.
After introduction of countrywide DOTS coverage, the cost per DALY gained fell to
US$19 per DALY gained (GOI MOHFW, 2012c). The scale-up of TB control in India is
therefore highly cost-effective and yields very high rates of return.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The project’s overall outcome rating is considered Satisfactory based on the following
justifications:
    (i)     Project relevance was, and remains high and alignment with country priorities
            and development strategies.
    (ii)    Most of the PDO objectives and supporting indicators including addressing
            inequities were achieved and several were surpassed.
    (iii)   Strong, robust supervision and M&E system.
    (iv)    The project was implemented in an efficient way and the credit was fully
            disbursed at closing.
    (v)     The project yielded high returns on investment.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
TB is widely recognized as a disease of poverty which is associated with major relevant
risk factors such as over-crowding, under nutrition, and poor environmental conditions.
Also, the negative economic impacts of TB on the population have been well documented.
The disease disproportionally affects the most productive age groups thus reducing their
ability to work and resulting in lost potential earning. To this end, the control of the
disease clearly contributes to poverty reduction and addresses inequities in health service
provision. Research on health seeking behavior among RNTCP patients has also found
that lowest income quintiles typically take a longer time to seek medical care (5.8
months) when compared to other income quintiles (Kapoor et al., 2012). Thus, while the
project clearly targets special groups with an explicit focus under Component 2, more
focus could have been given to targeting equally vulnerable groups such as prisoners,
persons living with TB patients, and urban slum populations.

The project did not have a gender-based approach. It would have been useful to address
it since the impact of the disease and health seeking behavior related to it is affected by
gender. While two thirds of all the TB cases in India are male (1.8:1 male to female
patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB in a study conducted in 2012 (Kapoor et al.,
2012)), TB significantly affects young females with 50% of the cases occurring before
the age of 34. Research on RNTCP patients has also found that females typically obtain
care later (6.3 months) than men (3.8 months) (Kapoor et al., 2012). Similarly, ICR team
discussions with MDR-TB providers indicated that the majority of current MDR-TB
patients are males and that females tend to seek treatment at a more advanced stage of the
disease than men. Despite this, however, successful treatment outcomes are found to be
higher among females (84%) than men. Clearly, more analysis needs to be done in this
area to better understand gender determinants of care.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening has been a central theme of the Bank’s engagement in the TB
program. Progress in the area of institutional building includes:


                                            25
•    The formulation of the RNTCP’s National Strategic Plan (2012-2017). The Bank
     team worked closely with the CTD to develop a comprehensive strategic plan,
     building on what has been achieved so far and focusing on the priorities in the next
     phase.
•    Strengthening governance and setting accountability measures. Despite apparent
     deficiencies in procurement at the early stages of the project, several procurement
     arrangements and accountability measures were put in place. This included
     establishing the Central Procurement Agency, while several state governments put in
     place health sector procurement agencies, out-sourcing procurement management,
     and adopting quality assurance measures through the WHO GMP certification of
     bidders.
•    Strengthening decentralization mechanisms and expanding the role of State TB cells
     and TB units.
•    Improving the capacity for IEC as evident with the formulation of an IEC strategy
     for hard to reach groups, establishing an IEC unit at the central level to plan and
     oversee the program, and hiring and training of 35 IEC officers.
•    Continued strengthening of the supervisory and monitoring system evident in the
     well-established review mechanism with periodic internal and external reviews at all
     levels. States typically conduct internal evaluations of two districts per quarter while
     the center also provides quarterly feedback to a minimum of two states (GOI
     MOHFW, 2012c). Improvements also included automation at the state level and the
     introduction of a web-based reporting system.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

4.1 Assessment of Risk Development Outcome (Rating: Low)

The GOI is highly committed to the RNTCP agenda and is continuing to support it. This
is reflected in its draft National Strategic Plan for TB Control (2007-2012) which adopted
a new objective of Universal Access to quality TB services along with significant
planned increases in the program’s budget, in line with overall government health
spending. There is strong ownership of the program by the MOHFW supported with
effective and strong leadership in CTD. Capacities have been built at central and
decentralized levels and better fiduciary management and procurement systems are in
place. The robust M&E system continues to provide a solid foundation for implementing
the program with improved data recording and supervisory capacities at state and district
levels. All of this provides a sound basis for sustaining project momentum and results.
Therefore, the risk to development outcomes of the project is rated as Low.

Moving forward, however, the TB program faces several challenges. The ambitious
scale-up of the RNTCP and the technical rigor required to effectively manage and
implement the program may be beyond the current institutional capacities to implement
the program with adequate supervision and quality control. According to the draft of the


                                             26
2012 JMM report, the strategy to achieve universal access will require a threefold
increase in the number of senior treatment supervisors along with training and capacity
building of staff. Similarly, scaling up of the MDR-TB program will require strong health
systems, advanced diagnostic technologies, and high level of technical skills that are not
adequately available and may take a long time to develop. The low participation of the
private sector in RNTCP and its low contribution to case detection rates is a critical
hindrance to reaching the program’s goal of universal access.

Another challenge is the integration of the program with NRHM, particularly as the
program becomes less independent with regard to human resource and financial
management. According to several supervisory and monitoring reports and to ICR team
discussions with state-level administrators, the program is experiencing delays in the
release of funds, in payment of salaries, and in filling currently vacant posts (around
20%). Moreover, there are complaints of the high turnover rates among staff associated
with increased workload as state and district officials are charged with several tasks
besides TB. There needs to be continued efficient streamlining of RNTCP operations
within NRHM structures along with systemic improvements and strong technical support
to the states and district levels. The RNTCP is aware of all these challenges and is
actively addressing these issues in the new strategy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: (Rating: Satisfactory)

The Bank team worked closely with GOI and other stakeholders, including donor
partners, to design a technically sound project. The project was responsive to an urgent
need to improve TB control and response in India which was a global and local public
good. The risk assessment was comprehensive and the ratings on (i) strategic relevance
and approach, (ii) technical, financial and economic context, and (iii) environmental and
social safeguards policies were appropriate.

In 2005, a QER was conducted, the results of which were addressed by the team in the
project design. During preparation, the Bank worked with partners (Global Fund, USAID,
DFID, and WHO) and GOI and agreed on a shared results framework and on the
estimated costs and overall financing plan for the program. The Bank team also took
adequate measures to mitigate procurement risks by establishing mechanisms and
processes. The Bank team collaborated well with the CTD regarding the Detailed
Implementation Review (DIR) which led to strengthening of financial and procurement
arrangement and to the implementation of the GAAP.7




7
  A Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) of five health projects in India, including the RNTCP I was
initiated in September 2006, completed in October 2007 and made public in January 2008.


                                                27
The Bank team demonstrated good coordination with CTD in resolving implementation
issues. For the triggered environment and social safeguard policies, to mitigate the
negative impacts on the project, a biomedical waste management plan and a tribal action
plan were developed, as required by the Bank policy. The results framework was on
balance sound. However, as mentioned previously, the decision to target 100% of
districts reaching global targets was ambitious. Likewise, measurement problems with
the use of districts, instead of zones, to measure case detection rates, did not provide
accurate data regarding district level achievements. Importantly, however, the team
worked closely with the Government and other partners to align the results framework
with the overall program and to measure outcomes against the same set of indicators.

(b)    Quality of Supervision (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

This project required intensive supervision given its large scope, wide range of activities,
and multiple partners involved. Supervision was also made more challenging with the
initiation of the DIR which coincided with project effectiveness. These were challenging
times for the health sector in India, but despite that, the Bank team handled the situation
very well and continued to work closely with the counterparts. The team worked
effectively to incorporate lessons and findings into several readiness steps and mitigation
measures which subsequently led to the strengthening of the project, especially in terms
of procurement and financial management.

The Bank maintained close supervision of the operation and provided intensive support
and oversight during project implementation. The supervision missions were critical for
problem identification and solving, hence facilitating project implementation, as
highlighted by government counterparts during the ICR mission in January 2013. Two
large Joint Monitoring Missions (JMM) (2009 and 2012) were conducted with
international partners and GOI, while the Bank led annual review missions involving
other partners. Six annual reports, eight Aides Memoire and 12 Implementation Status
Reports (ISRs), adequately and candidly documented project implementation progress,
key implementation issues and actions to be taken to resolve them. Implementation
Progress towards the PDO was thoroughly reviewed and the key indicators and
assessment results systematically documented.

During the five years of project implementation, the task leadership on the Bank side
changed three times. However, this did not negatively impact the ability of the team to
ensure effective implementation support. Hand-over arrangements were successful
throughout project implementation.

Bank supervision paid adequate attention to all financial management (FM) aspects:
detailed verification of financial management reports (FMRs) which provided the basis
for disbursement of Bank funds, successful mitigation measures to delays in audit reports
caused by the merging of RNTCP financial management with that of NRHM, and active
dialogue with CTD on shortcoming in the accounting procedures of states as identified in
audit reports and field visits.




                                            28
Overall, the ICR team received very positive feedback from counterparts and partners
regarding the role of the Bank during the course of the project. They praised and
commended the Bank team for its supportive supervision and the rigor with which the
Bank team helped to keep the project on track. They also emphasized the important role
the Bank played in providing high quality technical skills and in keeping operations
focused on achieving program objectives.

What also stands out in this project is the effort to which the Bank team went to establish
collaboration and effective relationship with partners. The team was successful and
effective in establishing a common and consistent approach among the partners to
achieve program goals.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory. The project was well prepared
despite the measurement problems with some indicators, and extremely well supervised.
The Bank team was responsive to emerging situations and collaborated well with the GOI
to implement the results of the DIR.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

The strong commitment and ownership of the GOI to health in general, and to the
RNTCP in particular, is evident. A national strategic plan for 2012-2017 has been
developed and institutional arrangements to sustain the program were put in place before
the end of the project. Total central GOI spending on health is planned to increase from
around US$ 16 billion in 2002-2007 to an anticipated US$ 55 billion for the period 2007-
2012. Consequently, GOI’s allocation to the RNTCP is planned to increase from 1.3% of
total spending in 2002-2007 to 1.5% in 2007-2012, thus tripling the amount (in absolute
terms) spent on TB. Considering that a large proportion of the TB program’s funding for
the period 2012-2017 is planned to come from central government funding reflects a
serious commitment by the government to the control of TB. Moreover, the program is
embedded in state government health services where it is executed through a five tiered
network, comprising the Central TB Division in the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, State TB officers, District Tuberculosis Centers, Tuberculosis Units, and
peripheral health facilities. Administrative and clinical staff are available at each of these
levels to implement the program.

The emergence of the NRHM with RNTCP falling under its umbrella ensured the highest
levels of political commitment and ownership to the program at all levels within the
country. This integration offered some opportunities to strengthen the RNTCP as
demonstrated by additional resources in terms of laboratories, stores, lab technicians and
the involvement of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) as DOTS providers. This
integration, however, was challenged by the weak fiduciary and management capacities
at the state and district levels which led to delays in recruitment and disbursement of
funds.


                                             29
(b) Implementing Agencies’ Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)
The CTD showed strong commitment to program objectives and implementation strategy
and ensured effective coordination among partners. It has demonstrated solid managerial
and technical skills. CTD established an appraisal system which standardized the
selection process of districts for DOTS implementation. It focused on strengthening
supervision and technical assistance at central and state levels and continued to regularly
review performance at the state and district levels and intervene with targeted strategies
in low performing districts. CTD has been proactive and cooperative in implementing the
post DIR action plan, and in adopting the GAAP which focused on mitigating
procurement deficiencies by setting relevant arrangements that had a positive impact on
the project. However, the chronic human resource deficiencies during project
implementation and the slow disbursement of funds in some states as a result of program
integration within the NRHM structures negatively affected the progress in program
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

A satisfactory rating for government performance and a satisfactory for the implementing
agency performance resulted in an overall borrower performance rating of Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

A number of country-wide lessons and recommendations to improve performance of this
program have been made in numerous assessments and reports over the last several years.
The following are key lessons that have been derived from the implementation of this
project:

Government commitment, leadership and support are paramount for increasing
case detection and cure rates. There are several examples that attest to the important
role the central government can play in pushing implementation forward towards
achieving program goals. For example, the MDR-TB scale-up plan that the government
set in late 2010 led to a dramatic increase in the number of MDR-TB cases detected and
put on treatment. Similarly, the “National framework of Joint TB/HIV? set in 2009 led to
a significant increase in case detection of HIV patients with TB and their referral for
DOTS. Similar focused efforts are needed to increase the engagement of the private
sector and NGOs and increase their potential for case detection and notification. Without
involving the private sector many TB patients will continue to be outside the reach of the
RNTCP.

Sharpening the focus on targeted groups and setting realistic project targets.
Combatting TB is a complex and a long term operation. Increasing prevention, case
detection and treatment of TB and reflecting that in national figures will take a long time
to become visible. When high levels have already been achieved, further increases in case
detection or cure rates will be more difficult to achieve. Hence, having realistic project
targets within the life of the project are critical to guide future implementation. This
should be associated with a strategic selection of targeted groups. Sharpening the focus of
the program on specific groups with higher probability of TB case concentration will


                                            30
bring more return on investment. This indicates focusing efforts on groups such as the
urban poor and slum areas, prisons, and individuals living with TB patients.

Investing in new technologies is essential for moving the program to its next phase of
universal coverage. Adopting newer diagnostic technologies is more technically
appropriate and cost effective in the long run. It will ensure early detection of cases with
greater sensitivity and will reduce diagnostic delays, thus slowing down the chain of
transmission and preventing drug resistant TB. Similarly, leveraging the growth in
information communication technology by using more integrated information systems
will expedite the transfer of test results between laboratories and treatment services, and
will allow for timely referrals and treatment.

The need for more information regarding the emergence of MDR-TB in India. More
work should be done to find out the reasons behind the emergence of MDR-TB and how
to mitigate the incidence through lessons from other countries. Understanding the gaps in
DOTS program operations that may have contributed to MDR-TB is crucial for
developing an effective MDR-TB strategy. While the draft National Strategic Plan for
2012-2017 puts a lot of emphasis on MDR-TB detection and treatment, more concurrent
efforts should be given to MDR-TB prevention.

More focus on quality. As the program expands rapidly to reach its objective of
universal access, more attention and diligent efforts should be given to the quality of
services through a systematic approach using quality improvement methods and
approaches. There is a critical need for high quality DOTS and DOTS Plus diagnosis and
follow-up and that would require high quality centers and institutions. Improving the
quality of physical infrastructure of the laboratories, improving biosafety measures and
medical waste management practices, strengthening the training and technical capacity of
providers to improve the quality of clinical care, and improving the quality of supervision
and reporting are critical for the success of the program.

Addressing gender issues should be integral to program design and operations. The
current program does not focus on the impact of the disease on gender. While research
studies have been conducted on the differentials in health seeking behavior among males
and females under RNTCP, more work needs to be done to incorporate this research into
policy by integrating such findings into the program to ensure that services are being
accessed and preventive efforts are in place to mitigate relapse rates among males and
females alike. Such targeted efforts will help yield better program results by reducing
transmission rates and incidence of MDR-TB, in addition to many other health outcomes.
Documenting health seeking behavior by gender and the social factors that impact it
could provide useful lessons for TB program in India and for other countries.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost-Effectiveness

During the period 2006-11, simply dividing the total RNTCP budget (US$ 317 million)
by the number of cases put on treatment (7.45 million) provides an average direct cost per
treated case of around US$ 43. Added to this are other health system costs that are
estimated to account for about 60% of total costs, (Goodchild et al., 2011) resulting in a
total estimated cost per treated TB case of around US$ 100. This can compare to average
unit costs of other health interventions in India, such as treatment of non-severe
pneumonia (US$ 61 at the community level and US$ 133 in a health facility), treatment
of severe pneumonia (US$ 4,366 in a hospital), delivery in a health center (US$ 453), or
one year of anti-retroviral therapy for HIV (US$ 80). (Chow et al., 2007)

However, standard practice to measure the efficiency of health interventions is to
estimate cost-effectiveness ratios. Effectiveness is often defined in terms of disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs), which are a composite measure of both years of life saved
and disability averted by an intervention. The Disease Control Priorities Project,
supported by the World Bank, has analyzed available information on the cost-
effectiveness of a range of health interventions, including TB interventions. It estimated
that the cost per death averted of a 10-year program providing TB diagnosis and
treatment services (like RNTCP) is between US$ 150 and 750, while the cost per DALY
gained is between US$ 5 and 35. The cost of MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment was
estimated at over US$ 2,000 per death averted and between US$ 70 and 450 per DALY
gained. The study concluded: “The treatment of all forms of active tuberculosis (TB)
using the directly observed treatment strategy based on short-course chemotherapy is
among the most cost-effective of all interventions available to improve health in LMICs
[low and middle income countries].? (Jamison et al., 2006)

RNTCP is situated at the lower end of these ranges of estimates. A 2007 study estimated
the cost-effectiveness of the program at between US$ 16 (for smear-positive patients) and
63 (for smear-negative patients) per DALY gained.8 (Chow et al., 2007) Another study
estimated cost-effectiveness ratios of between US$ 21 and 35 per DALY gained during
the period 1997-2006. (Goodchild et al., 2011).

Cost-Benefit

Several studies have estimated the total economic benefit of the TB program in India as
well as cost-benefit ratios. These are based on epidemiological estimates of the mortality
averted (or life-years or DALYs gained) by the TB program, combined with assumptions
about the economic value of a statistical life-year. A 2007 World Bank study made



8
 Around two-thirds of TB patients treated under RNTCP are smear-positive (i.e. TB bacilli can be
observed in their sputum).



                                                   37
projections for 2006-15, estimating that provision of DOTS in India would avert 3.2
million deaths during that period, with an economic benefit over US$ 350 billion, or a
benefit of US$ 191 per dollar spent. (Laxminarayan et al., 2007)

A 2011 study used cost and patient number data for the period 1997-2006, estimating that
the cost of government-provided TB services (including the RNTCP budget and other
health system costs) at US$ 768 million. A total of 6.3 million patients were treated
during the period, saving an estimated 1.3 million lives and gaining 29.2 million DALYs.
Using an assumed value of a statistical life-year of US$ 1,892,9 the study estimated that
the program’s economic benefit was US$ 88 billion during 1997-2006 or US$ 19.6
billion in 2006 alone. This represented an economic benefit of US$ 115 per dollar spent
during 1997-2006 or US$ 155 in 2006 alone.

Equity

TB is widely considered to be a disease of poverty, associated with crowding and poor
living conditions. An analysis of the 2005-06 Third National Family Health Survey
(NFHS-3) found that self-reported experience of TB was five times higher in the lowest
wealth quintile compared to the highest. Low body-mass index and exposure to indoor air
pollution were significant risk factors. (Oxlade and Murray, 2012) At the same time, the
poorest have the greatest difficulty in accessing treatment due to both the direct costs of
paying for health care and medicines and the indirect costs associated with transport and
wage losses. Studies done pre-RNTCP found that poor TB patients seeking care from
private providers incurred significant economic costs due to health care expenses and lost
income (and also suffered from poor quality care). (WHO, 1997; Nair et al., 1997) TB
treatment involves repeated diagnostic tests and months-long courses of treatment.
Diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB in the private sector, costing thousands of dollars,
are entirely out of financial reach for poor households in India. Overall, government
health spending is low in India, about 1.2% of GDP and accounting for only around a
fifth of total health spending, while most private spending is out-of-pocket. The
RNTCP’s provision of TB diagnosis and treatment free-of-charge therefore represents an
important economic benefit to poor patients while removing a large part of the financial
barriers to access to care.10

Nonetheless, more needs to be done, as a significant proportion of TB patients continue
to pay for care in the private sector. A study of the private market for TB drugs in India
estimated that sufficient volumes were being sold annually to provide treatment courses


9
    This was based on a figure used by the US government, adjusting for India’s per capita income level.

10
  It is also thought that that the RNTCP services provide significant health benefits to the poor in that they
are often of higher quality than what is delivered by private sector providers. Studies have found significant
use in the private sector of inappropriate diagnostic tests (Jaroslawski and Pai, 2012) as well as wide
variation in prescribed drug regimens. (Udwadia et al., 2010) Inappropriate and interrupted TB treatment in
the private sector is thought to be a significant factor in the development of MDR-TB.



                                                      38
to over 2 million patients, costing an estimated $75 million (at wholesale prices). Even
those patients who eventually receive care free-of-charge from government services incur
expenses by seeking care from two or more private providers (i.e. informal providers,
chemists) before that point. A 2012 study in Delhi found that two-thirds of TB patients
interviewed had sought care from informal providers before going to a government health
service (Kapoor et al., 2012), while a 2007 study in Chennai found that over 80% of
surveyed TB patients incurred medical expenses before starting treatment under RNTCP
and these as well as other costs averaged Rs 3,211 (US$ 70). (Ananthakrishnan et al.,
2012)

Financial Analysis

RNTCP expenditures during the six fiscal years from 2006-07 to 2011-12 totaled about
US$ 400 million, of which the IDA credit of US$ 170 million represented around 43%.
Other external funding, notably from the Global Fund, totaled about US$ 160 million or
40%. Domestic funding totaled around US$ 55 million or 14%, but showed a significant
increasing trend, rising from close to zero in 2006-07 to US$ 16 million in 2011-12.
(Figure 1) Nor does this take in account the value of support to TB services provided by
state health systems, which as mentioned above are estimated at 60% of total costs –
which would value this support at around US$ 600 million over the six year period.

As noted above, government spending on health in India is considered low by
international standards. It has been increasing however, as central government health



                                                      39
spending rose from around US$ 13 billion during the government’s 10th Plan (2002-07),
or US$ 2.40 per capita, to around US$ 24 billion, or US$ 4.00 per capita, during the 11th
Plan (2007-12). RNTCP’s expenditures represented 1.3% of the 10th Plan amount and
1.5% of the larger 11th Plan total.

The government has expressed a commitment to further increase support to the health
sector, planning to triple in absolute terms central government spending on health during
its 12th Plan (2012-17). The budget of RNTCP is planned to similarly increase, to over
one billion US dollars during the five year period, compared to about US$360 million
during the 11th Plan. Although RNTCP’s share of total health spending may rise to 1.9%,
this proportion is such that the overall increased commitment to government health
spending means that increases in the program’s budget should fairly easily be met from
domestic sources. The main constraints under this scenario would be absorptive capacity
(including the scale-up potential for strategies to reach the significant proportion of TB
patients who receive care in the private sector).

                     Implementation Completion Report – January 2013

    1. Assessment of the Project’s Rationale and Objectives

India is a low-income country with a gross national income per capita of US$ 620 (2004) and a
population of 1.21 billion people. The economy grew around 6% annually in the 1990s, a period
during which India made impressive progress towards reducing poverty. Overall health
conditions have also experienced improvements during the last decades, e.g. life expectancy has
increased, infant mortality rate has been halved and fertility has declined.

Health is a major contributor to poverty in India. The share of public spending on health is a
modest 0.9% of gross domestic product’ (below Brazil (3.4) and Thailand (2.1) but similar to
Pakistan (0.9)). Public health care services are generally perceived to be of low quality and the
poor are often misinformed about the availability and cost of services. As a consequence, more
than 70% of outpatient care for those below the poverty line is provided by the private sector,
much of which is of low quality provided by unregistered practitioners. In spite of the positive
growth rate, poverty reduction remains India’s most compelling challenge. Twenty-nine per cent
of the population lives below the national poverty line while almost half of India’s 266 million
poor live in only three states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.

Communicable diseases continue to account for nearly half of India’s disease burden, of which
Tuberculosis (TB) is among the most widespread cause of morbidity, disability and mortality.
About 40% of the adult population is infected by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, causing more
than 1.8 million new cases and 400,000 deaths annually. Of the new cases, nearly 800,000 are
infectious; each of these, on an average, infects ten people. TB afflicts nearly all age groups
although most cases are among adults aged 15 to 59 years, the most economically productive
segment of society. As a result, the disease brings about enormous social and economic disruption
to the patients and their dependent families, and slows down India’s overall economic growth. It
is estimated that TB causes the society nearly US$ 3 billion annually in indirect costs.

To address this large and costly burden of disease, the Government of India (GoI) is currently
implementing the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). Revised National
TB Control programme, which is an application of the WHO recommended DOTS strategy in
India, came into effect in 1997 with support of World Bank credit amounting US$ 142 million.
This end date of this credit was 31 December 2002. But due to various reasons there was
underutilization of funds. However, all physical targets were achieved and so the project was
granted a no-cost extension on two occasions: once in 2002 for two years and again in 2004 for
one year. The project has been extended for the Drug component only till March 2006 so as to
enable the project to complete payments for drugs procured during the project.

The second credit of Bank to RNTCP was from October 2006 to September 2011 with a value of
US$ 170 million. Again the project got two six month, no cost extensions and the credit ended on
30 September 2012. Since the country had already covered 100% of the districts under the
program therefore during the second credit from bank was utilized implement the program
throughout the country.

Although the country has achieved the global targets of 70% case detection rate and 85% cure
rate on a nationwide basis in the area where DOTS was being implemented in 2004. However


                                               43
there were large differences in program performance across the country, and with full coverage
and inclusion of larger more difficult states, the overall case detection has dropped to 64% with
many districts not achieving the global targets.

RNTCP II was developed based on the lessons learnt from the implementation of the programme
over a 12-year period (1993-2005). RNTCP II was designed to consolidate the gains achieved in
RNTCP I and to initiate services to address TB/HIV, MDR-TB and extend RNTCP to the private
sector. Systematic research and evidence building to inform the programme for better design was
also an important component of the programme. The emerging needs of Advocacy,
Communication and Social Mobilization were addressed in the new phase. The challenges
imposed by the structures under NRHM were also taken into account for RNTCP II. Therefore
the program development objective of this credit was following:

a)       To achieve the global targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate in all the districts
of the country
b)       For the zones where DOTS has been implemented for five or more years , the incidence
of smear positive TB starts to decline

The project did not specify project components but did specify the following “outputs?: (1)
RNTCP services consolidated, and (2) RNTCP outreach to target special groups expanded. There
were no budget allocations to these two outputs, as relevant activities cut across the program’s
budget categories. Since 2007, the programme has been consistently achieving a treatment success
rate of >85% and a new smear positive (NSP) case detection rate (CDR) of >70%. In 2011,
RNTCP achieved the NSP CDR of 72% and treatment success rate of 88%, which is in line with
the global targets for TB control.

     2. Assessment of Project Design:

The program was based on the lessons learnt from RNTCP I (ICR No. 34692 dated June 30,
2006), from other health, nutrition and population projects supported by IDA and by International
best practice. In continuation of the RNTCP 1 activities the project also included components
like Multi Drug resistant TB, PPM etc.

RNTCP II was focused on two major Outputs which were as per the strategy paper of RNTCP for
11th five year plan (2007-12):

Output One: RNTCP services consolidated
Output Two: RNTCP outreach to Target special Groups expanded

3.      Assessment of Project Implementation and Operations:

Implementation of the revised paradigm of TB control known as the DOTS strategy throughout
the country has been the most important achievement of this project. 100% of the districts and
states have been covered under the program. The total population covered under program is 8159
lakhs. The World Bank funded areas have been covered (730 million population as per 2001
census). This includes full coverage of 35 states/union territories. 100% of the country’s
population had accessed to DOTS. RNTCP is the largest TB control programme in the world.
Even after the nationwide scale up the program has maintained quality of services.

a)      Infrastructure Augmentation/Development for TB Control:



                                                44
The implementation arrangement of the program remained the same as it was in RNTCP I. The
lowest level of service delivery point under the project is Designated Microscopy Centres (DMC)
which is established on a population of 50000. Above that Tuberculosis units are there which are
lower than District TB cell (DTC). DTC are under State TB cell (STC). In the phase II two more
TB delivery points were added to the program these were Intermediate reference laboratory (IRL)
and MDR-TB centres with designated categories of staff. By the end of project, year wise
numbers of STCs, IRLs, MDR-TB centres, DTCs, TUs and DMCs established under the program
are as follows:

Year       STC&SDS STDC             IRL        DT TB center      DTC        TU           DMC

2012       28            22         21         53                460        1853         9220


The above mentioned units were strengthened with the recruitment of designated contractual staff
at each level.

One of the key aspects during RNTCP II was setting up of procedures and systems for case
finding, treatment, case holding, monitoring and supervision, recording and reporting.

Between 1997 and 2006 a World Bank credit of US$ 96.7 million was instrumental to the scaling
up of DOTS to provide coverage to the entire country. Subsequently, the current credit of US$
170 million accounted for around half of the RNTCP’s central-level financing during 2006-12.
The Bank-financed project has consistently been rated satisfactory on implementation and
progress towards its development objectives. The program is integrated in the National Rural
Health Mission (NRHM), a central government program designed to strengthen basic health care
services, while the majority of implementation resources (i.e. health facilities, staff) are provided
by state health systems. Since 1997, the program has initiated treatment for over 12.8 million TB
patients, and saved an estimated 2.3 million lives. TB mortality is estimated to have been reduced
by 45% in comparison to 1990. In 2011, RNTCP examined 7.87 million suspected cases and
provided treatment to 1.52 million people diagnosed with TB. The program has exceeded since
2008-09 the internationally-adopted targets of 70% detection of new smear positive TB cases
(73.5% to the third quarter of 2011) and successfully treating over 85% of those cases (87.6% to
the third quarter of 2011).

b)      Supervision & Monitoring and Evaluation:

RNTCP has established a robust recording and reporting system since the start of the programme
in the country based on quarterly and annual cohort of TB patients registered for treatment. The
program has developed a strategy document for supervision and monitoring of RNTCP. The same
was updated in 2011. This strategy defines the role of each staff and officer in supervision &
monitoring of the programme from the most peripheral level to central level. Frequency of visits,
checklists for supervision, and indicators for monitoring their interpretation and possible solution
and corrective actions are defined in the strategy. The major highlights of supervision, monitoring
and evaluation are the following:

Programme review and monitoring indicators at various levels:
Review of progress and programme performance is review at various levels on a regular basis in a
structured manner. This included biannual national review meeting of STOs and Consultants.
Quarterly review of District TB Officers and programme partners at state level including the State
Task Forces for medical colleges is a regular feature. District-wise programme performance is


                                                 45
reviewed using Monitoring Indicators published by Central TB Division on a quarterly and
annual basis. Epi-Info based EPI-CENTRE is used for compilation of TU wise aggregated
information on case finding, smear conversion and treatment outcome reports throughout the
country. Programme management information at TU and district level is also compiled in the
same manner.

Programme Evaluations:
Each State/UT is expected to carry out state level Internal Evaluation of RNTCP implementation
in at least two districts per quarter. Central Internal Evaluation of at least two states is carried out
per quarter with two districts in each state. Use of Epi data software for quick data entry of
findings from visits to DOT Centres, DMCs, TUs and patient visits has been recently introduced
and the analysis of the same gives the objective insight in programme evaluation of the districts.
Structured Programme Evaluation has been a very important tool for systematic feedback to the
programme implementation at district and state level.

Composite Indicators:
For more than a decade, the focus of the programme was on achievement of the global targets in
terms of 70% case detection rate amongst the new smear positive cases. Many challenges were
found to be associated with this approach including less focus on the processes and the inputs as
compared to the outputs and undue pressure on the RNTCP staff to achieve these targets, at times
in the absence of the optimal inputs and support for necessary activities. With an objective to
ensure balanced approach with equal emphasis on inputs and processes as with outputs, the
programme developed a composite indicator. This composite indicator is calculated with weights
to 15 indictors under five thematic areas viz. Human Resource Management, Financial
Management, case finding efforts, Quality of services and Drugs & Logistics management. The
indicators in each thematic area were selected based on relevance, replicability, information
availability, possible automation in to epi-centre, relatively longitudinal performance as against
the cross-sectional performance, depicting programme change and needs. This tool is evolving
and may not be an ultimate solution as a single wonder indicator but feasible option being tested
for its utility in programme implementation.

Focused Action Plan:
Despite of regular supervision, monitoring and evaluation, there is a wide variation in
performance of the state/UTs and districts throughout the country. In many instances, the reason
is that there was no systematic attempt to find the reasons of underperformance of these areas at
local level or inadequate capacity building and support from the state level. These districts were
identified by CTD in consultation with the State/UTs. With the objective to improve the
performance in such areas, the special guidance was given by Central TB Division to the State
teams to conduct situational analysis in an objective manner. Based on the situational analysis,
focused action plans were prepared by the state teams for each of these listed underperforming
districts in the country. The same were shared with CTD and feedback on each plan was given to
prioritize and strategize high impact activities for each of these districts. With the specific action
suggested to the state teams including the concentrated efforts by the state teams for supportive
supervision of these districts and hand holding for planning and conducting activities in these
districts by state and district teams in a coordinated manner. Action Taken Reports on plan for
each of these districts in an ongoing activity since Jan 2012. The impact of the Focused Action
Plan strategy will be assessed in the year 2013.

Improving TB surveillance by transitioning to Case Based Web Based recording and
reporting:



                                                  46
Since implementation, RNTCP followed international guidelines for recording and reporting for
Tuberculosis Control Programme with minor modifications. Epi-info based EPI-CENTRE
software was being used for the purpose of electronic data transmission from district level
upwards. Initially DOS version was in use and the programme shifted to windows version in 2007.
However, the data available at district, state or national level is in aggregated form. So, with the
objective to improve TB surveillance in the country, the programme has undertaken the initiative
to develop a Case Based Web Based application named Nikshay. This is still in the early stage of
development and implementation. Currently, the basic information of TB cases is being captured.
Module for including TB notification by non-RNTCP health providers is already in place. The
plan is to develop mechanisms under Nikshay to include treatment adherence data, MDR-TB
management, referral transfer mechanisms, hand held devices, micropayment of DOT provides,
financial and drug and logistics management by June 2013. The RNTCP also conducts Joint
Monitoring Missions (JMM) at regular intervals of 3 years. The members of JMM are
international experts invited from technical, financial, advocacy, patient representatives and
program relevant areas. The objective of the JMM was to review the country’s progress towards
the TB-related MDGs, challenges and plans for TB control efforts, and to advise the GOI and
partners on the pathway towards achieving universal access to TB care. The mission has provided
inputs on strategic approaches and innovative mechanisms for achieving the key targets of 12th
Five-Year plan i.e. an ambitious goal of universal access to quality assured TB care to all and
expert guidance on how to develop, prioritize, and deploy the approaches. The JMM team has
also assessed the GF funded program activities. A Common Review Mission (CRM) is
constituted under NRHM to review the national health program. RNTCP is reviewed as part of
the overall national health program.

As per the recommendations of various monitoring missions, RNTCP has conducted various
studies to study the impact and aid effectiveness. The Economic Impact Study conducted in 2009
under the program has shown economic benefits and aid effectiveness. Tuberculosis control has
consistently been ranked as among the most cost-effective health interventions available, second
only to basic routine immunization. Though this project is typically a social development project
with no direct financial returns, the indirect returns of the project are promising. Based on the
studies of the economic impact of Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP)
expansion in India in 2009, estimates indicate that on an average each Tuberculosis (TB) case
incurs an economic burden of around US$ 12,235 and a health burden of around 4.1 Disability
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Similarly, a death from Tuberculosis (TB) in India incurs an
average burden of around US$ 67,305 and around 21.3 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
The expansion of RNTCP from 1997 – 2006 was estimated to have the following health and
economic impact, relative to the absence of the program:

    6.3 million TB patients diagnosed and treated, with 1.3 million deaths averted.
    Total health benefit of 29.2 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs),
    Total gain in economic well being from TB control of US$88.1 billion
    Total public expenditure on TB control over this period amounted to US$768 million, with
     the RNTCP accounting for US$ 299 million and other health sector costs accounting for
     US$469 million.
    The cost of TB control averaged just US$ 26 per DALY gained over 1997–2006 and
     generated a return of US$ 115 per dollar spent.

Considering this, if the project would achieve its deliverables 2012-2017 of treating >8.2 million
Tuberculosis (TB) patients with at least 88% success rate then an additional >1.3 million deaths
(due to Project) due to TB could be averted and approximately 30 million DALYs saved.



                                                47
RNTCP conducted a Joint Monitoring Mission in August 2012 and the findings of the JMM team
have been very encouraging. The committee feels that India’s RNTCP is a cause for great
national pride. Over the last 5 years, the RNTCP has examined more than 36 million persons
through sputum-smear microscopy and treated more than 7.5 million TB patients, saving more
than 1 million lives. The RNTCP has firmly established decentralized diagnosis through 13,000
quality-assured microscopy centers embedded in the health system and has expanded community-
based treatment to a network of more than 600,000 community treatment providers. On an
average day, RNTCP examines 31,500 patients by sputum microscopy and initiates treatment for
6,000 TB patients

c)      Training:

In RNTCP I series of training modules were developed for grass root level staffs like STS, MPW,
LT, STLS etc. Under RNTCP II also sound training materials have been developed for all
categories of staff. The training materials are modular in content to ensure standard quality
training and to avoid possible subjectivity and bias of the trainers. List of Modules that have
been developed under RNTCP are following:
     a. Training Module for Micro bacterium Tuberculosis Culture & DST- 2008
     b. Training module for Medical practitioners – 2010
     c. Training module for 14 intensified urban PPM sites on revised reporting and recording -
        2008-09
     d. Training module for District Tuberculosis center –Drug stores 2008
     e. RNTCP training course for program Managers; Module 1-4 & module 5-9- 2008-09

As of December 11 79% of medical staffs and 79% of Para medical staffs have been trained on
the relevant modules.

d)      Procurement:

One of the most significant achievements of the project was to procure binocular microscopes and
drugs at Central level for health facilities throughout the country. Under the World Bank project
procurement was carried out at two levels, either at National level or at state/district level. Anti
TB drugs for the entire country are being procured by the Central Government. The procurement
of drugs at the National level was mainly affected following International Competitive Bidding
procedures recommended by the World Bank. Anti TB drugs for treatment of adult and
paediatric cases under DOTS were procured in two years (2006 & 2007) through National
Shopping procedure. In RNTCP II second line drugs were also procured from Bank credit. In
RNTCP II 1500 BM microscopes have been procured. The procurement of drugs both 1st line and
2nd line is as reflected in Annexure 1 and Annexure 2.

The programme helped in considerable infrastructure strengthening in the states by undertaking
civil works at approximately 22 STDCs, 21 IRLs, 28 SDS, 53 DR TB centres 460 districts TB
Centres and District drug stores , 9220 microscopy centres, 1853 TUs (World Bank areas only).
Districts were enabled to purchase a computer, photocopier, fax machine etc. at the rate of one
per district. Consultants and contractual staff procured under the project played a crucial role in
programme implementation and monitoring and supervision.

e)      Advocacy, Communication & Social Mobilization




                                                48
        Professional Media Agency was engaged in August 2007 for developing, designing,
production, and dissemination of IEC material including mass media activities
o                 Developed three TV and radio spots for use on electronic media
o                 Organized public event on World TB Day 2008
o                 Organizing Capacity building workshops in few select states on effective use of
communication material
        IEC Capacity Audit Conducted to assess the capacity in the states to plan and implement
ACSM activities
        IEC Baseline Document developed (May 2007) which has the following crucial findings:
o                 Except three states and UTs all other states (29/35) have IEC officers in place
more than 90% of them have experience in communication and have undergone training. Yet
majority of them expressed that they need more training and capacity building.
o                 Out of the 10 large and 15 medium sized states, 50% of them felt that they were
not confident for planning and implementing ACSM activities for all the four target groups (i.e.
General public, patients and their families, practitioners, and opinion leaders): where as small
states and UTs, except Sikkim had high level of confident of planning and implementing ACSM
activities, especially for general public and for patients and their families.
        The process of engaging Communication Facilitators in the states has been slow as they
lacked clarity on the roles and responsibilities of Communication Facilitators.
        About 50% of the eligible states (13/26) responded that a helping hand at the district level
for ACSM activities will be useful.
o        Development and use of communication material hasn’t been based on any need
assessment. In fact questions pertaining to this were not responded and basis of calculation of
quantities has been number of health facilities/population etc.
        Four National Level ACSM Capacity Building training workshops (six days each) held in
collaboration with National Institute of Health and Family Welfare. The content of the training
was decided on the findings of the IEC Capacity Audit Document. Segmentation of audiences,
Advocacy and development Annul action were main focus areas of these workshops. Lot of
emphasis was on relating each topic to the RNTCP field situation. PATH, one of the international
agency, and partner of RNTCP participated in all four workshops as resource person.
        Communication material on website modified in line with the policy changes on
diagnosis of smear positive pulmonary TB
        Pilot initiated in few states to refine the role of Communication Facilitators to focus on
poor performing districts
        Questionnaire developed to collect information on effective use of communication
facilitators in the states
        Discussion on partnership with other stakeholders to strengthen ACSM Component

At State and District levels following activities have happened:
        Decentralized ACSM planning and implementation.
        Fund utilization for ACSM improving at the state and district level. There are some
districts that need to improve performance for developing ACSM activities that support TB care
services.
        Village meetings are held, involving Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs – local elected
bodies), to address social aspects of TB patient meetings & community meetings using cured
patients to motivate those on treatment
        Felicitation of cured patients, community DOT providers for increasing treatment
adherence
        Innovative approaches were piloted and documented at the state and district level,
including Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) in Kerala.

f)      Operations Research:

 Operational research under RNTCP aims to improve the quality, effectiveness, efficiency and
accessibility (coverage) of the control efforts. Operational studies are generally:

-       of low cost and limited staff time, because they should not deviate excessive resources
from service delivery and disease reduction,
-       of short duration, because the results should be available rapidly to decide on programme
changes if necessary,
-       based on simple standard protocols, to be repeated in different environments, and
-       giving priority to test solutions to identified problems and to develop new implementation
methods to improve the programme.

Some studies have contribute to the national experience and influence programme guidelines;
others have addressed local issues or produce different results depending on the area, and had
serve to develop interventions appropriate to specific populations or geographical areas.

List of studies being undertaken by RNTCP:

National Level:
A retrospective assessment of reasons and risk of default amongst Cat II patients was successfully
undertaken by CTD. The results of the study showed important risk factors and reasons for
default. The results of the study and the remedial actions to be taken have been communicated to
the districts.
The following studies have been approved and funded by CTD and are presently underway:
1.       Disease prevalence studies at 6 sites by the following institutes:
a.       NTI Bangalore
b.       MGIMS, Wardha
c.       AIIMS, New Delhi
d.       PGIMER, Chandigarh
e.       JALMA, Agra
f.       RMRCT, Jabalpur
2.       Zonal ARTI survey being coordinated by NTI, Bangalore
3.       A Study on Treatment of Genital Tuberculosis: A randomized controlled trial to compare
the 6 months of Cat I treatment with 9 months of Cat I Treatment (extension for 3 months) in
genital tuberculosis under RNTCP. (AIIMS, New Delhi)
4.       A multi-centric study on treatment of abdominal tuberculosis (intestinal or peritoneal): A
randomized controlled trial to compare the 6 months of Cat I treatment with 9 months of Cat I
Treatment (extension for 3 months) in abdominal tuberculosis under RNTCP. (AIIMS, New
Delhi)
5.       Evaluation of the efficacy of thrice weekly DOTS regimen in TB pleural Effusion at six

months duration of treatment for peripheral tubercular lymphadenitis. (PGIMER. Chandigarh)




                                                50
At the state level a total of 69 proposals have been reviewed by the Zonal OR committees since
2006 and 21 studies have been approved and funded. More than 107 postgraduate thesis have
been approved during this period by the State OR Committees.

g) TB-HIV Coordination Activities

TB/HIV activity coordination started relative early in India in 2001, in the states of Maharashtra,
Manipur, Nagaland, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The early activities were
primarily joint training of health staff in TB-HIV and cross-referrals. Cross-referral in this context
intensified case-finding at Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTC) with referral of TB
suspects to RNTCP DMCs, and referral of TB patients with HIV risk factors from DMC to ICTC
for voluntary HIV counseling and testing. These collaborative activities were extended to eight
additional states of Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan and West
Bengal beginning in the year 2004. By the end of 2006, these TB-HIV collaborative activities
were implemented in 14 states of the country.
     Two key pilot studies generated the evidence on the implementation of additional TB/HIV
activities. First, in 2007 CTD and NACO pilot-tested the decentralized delivery of Cotrimoxazole
preventive therapy (CPT) for HIV infected TB patients through RNTCP mechanisms. This pilot
was undertaken in three districts with high prevalence of HIV in Andhra Pradesh. Evaluation of
the pilot was undertaken by a team of experts from NACO, CTD and WHO in September, 2007.
Based on that experience, CPT for HIV-infected TB patients was included into national policies.
     Second, in 2008 a pilot study of provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling for TB patients
was conducted in two high HIV prevalence districts with assistance from Tuberculosis Research
Centre (TRC), Chennai and National Tuberculosis Institute (NTI) Bangalore. This study
demonstrated that routine referral of TB patients for HIV testing could be successfully and
efficiently implemented under the programme conditions without any discernable effect on TB
case notification. In this study, the efficiency of linking HIV-infected TB patients to anti-
retroviral treatment was also assessed. These studies highlighted the importance of high-quality
counseling in helping patients receive all the necessary free care and treatment available for their
continued wellbeing.
     On the basis of these pilot study experiences and taking into account the variability in HIV
epidemiology and HIV diagnostic and treatment service availability, a new national policy on
TBHIV collaboration has been developed. The first National Framework for TB/HIV
Collaborative Activities was endorsed in November 2007, and updated in Feb 2008.

The National Framework for TB/HIV collaborative activities established that essential
TB/HIV interventions were to be implemented nationwide.
Those essential TB/HIV interventions for all states include:
   - Establishment of mechanism of coordination in the form
       of coordination committees and Technical working
       groups both at the national as well as state level,
   - Training of programme officials and field staff on
       TB/HIV.
   - Intensified TB case findings at ICTCs, ART centres, and
       Care and support Centers.
   - Risk-based referral of TB patients for voluntary HIV
       counseling and testing.
   - Referral of HIV-infected TB patients to NACP for
       additional care and support, including antiretroviral
       treatment.



                                                 51
Those areas with higher HIV burdens were flagged for an “Intensified TB/HIV Package? of
services. The Intensified TB/HIV package of services includes:
    - Routine referral of all TB patients for HIV counseling and testing
    - Provision of co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) to HIV-infected TB patients.
    - Expanded recording and reporting, including recording HIV status of TB patients in the
         TB registers
    Selection of states for the intensified TB/HIV package was based on HIV prevalence,
absolute HIV burden, availability of decentralized HIV testing and treatment services, and
programme capacity. During 2008, the Intensified TB/HIV packages of services started in the 9
HIV high prevalence states (Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram,
Nagaland, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.). Additional states were recently identified for the
Intensified TB/HIV package (Gujarat and Delhi), bringing the total number of states to 11.

External Quality Assurance:
To ensure quality, external quality assurance of sputum microscopy is being introduced
throughout the country. The protocol being implemented has taken into consideration the
recommendations of the recently published international guidelines and has all components for
ensuring quality -on site evaluation, panel testing and blinded crosschecking. The four National
Reference Labs have been assigned states and they have started On-site evaluation visits to the
Intermediate Reference Labs (IRLs), which are the state level labs. All the starts have been
visited either by NTI Bangalore or NRLs. Training of trainers of all states has been completed.
All the 35 states/ UTs are implementing and reporting as per the protocol.

   h) Programmatic management of Drug resistant TB:

WHO Global TB Report 2011, estimates that approximately 64,000 cases of MDR-TB emerge
annually from the notified cases of pulmonary TB in India, based on the data available from
population based drug resistance surveys carried out in 3 states of India that revealed the
prevalence of MDR-TB to be ~3% among new TB cases and 12-17% among previously-treated
TB cases. Isolated studies have reported XDR-TB in India. However, the extent and magnitude of
this problem is yet to be determined. Preliminary results show that there is not yet any XDR-TB
amongst new cases and ~0.5% amongst re-treatment cases. However when translated into
numbers the M/XDR TB cases are significant and pose a serious challenge to TB epidemiology
unless effectively managed

One of the major milestones in RNTCP II was the initiation of PMDT services in the country in
the year 2007. The major activities that have happened in PMDT are following:

   1. Quality diagnosis and treatment services under programmatic management of drug
      resistant TB were introduced since 2007.
   2. PMDT services are available in all 35 states of the country across 380 districts covering a
      population of 588 million (49%) and are being rapidly scaled up.
   3. 11/35 states have achieved 100% geographical coverage and the remaining states are
      expected to achieve complete geographical coverage by 2012-13
   4. Anecdotal reports of TB that is resistant to all available anti-TB drugs highlights urgency
      to scale up RNTCP PMDT services for M/XDR TB nationwide.
   5. All states are expected to move towards universal access to quality diagnosis and
      treatment of MDR TB patient by gradually extending the opportunity to diagnose early
      during the treatment course of TB patients.
   6. PMDT guidelines refined and updated in June 2012 under guidance from National DOTS
      Plus committee.


                                              52
    7. To date, > 9000 MDR-TB patients have been initiated on standard treatment regimen for
        MDR TB under RNTCP, through 63 DR-TB centers (DOTS Plus sites). ~60% of these
        DR-TB centers function at Medical Colleges including some Private Medical Colleges.
    8. Diagnostic services are available through 41 RNTCP certified quality assured
        laboratories to diagnose MDR TB. Out of these 33 laboratories are certified for solid
        culture & DST, 27 certified for rapid molecular diagnostic techniques and 10 are
        certified for liquid culture and DST. Six out of these certified laboratories are from
        Private and NGO sector.
    9. Out of the cumulative total of 2625 MDR TB Cases registered for treatment 12-15
        months earlier (latest 5 quarters 4Q09-4Q10), 1920 cases (73%) were reported to be alive
        and on treatment (with 1297 (49%) culture negative and 372 (14%) culture positive) at 12
        months of treatment, while 358 (13%) died and 322 (12%) defaulted.
    10. The treatment outcomes of MDR TB for the initial sites for the early 9 quarterly cohorts
        (3Q07–3Q09) have been reported. These patients were generally heavily treatment
        experienced, chronic cases, and so expectations on treatment outcomes were limited. Out
        of the cumulative total of 967 MDR TB Cases registered for treatment 31-33 months
        earlier (3Q07-3Q09), 493 cases (51%) have been successfully completed treatment while
        175 cases (18%) died, 74 cases (8%) failed and 197 cases (20%) defaulted treatment.
        Substantial improvements in policies and procedures have been implemented to reduce
        treatment default. Research is underway to understand the unacceptable failure rates, but
        early results suggest poor outcomes have been strongly associated with pre-treatment
        ofloxacin resistance in this patient cohort. This analysis is being expanded to subsequent
        sites and cohorts to inform ongoing revision of programme policies and procedures.
    11. Systematic feasibility study under guidance and monitoring of a National Steering
        Committee on CB-NAAT (Xpert-MTB-Rif) with ethical approval from the ethics
        committee of the National TB Institute, Bangalore has been initiated in India in 2012 in
        18 sites across the country.
    12. Further, with support of WHO and UNITAID, 9 CB NAAT laboratories ( 12 CB-NAAT
        (Xpert-MTB-Rif) machines with cartridges) are being extended to India through the
        EXPANDx TB Project to address the laboratory capacity gaps and boost the laboratory
        diagnostic capacity in additional 70 districts to test additional 30,600 MDR TB suspects.
        With this intervention, an additional 5300 Rif resistance cases expected to be put on
        treatment from the beneficiary districts.
    13. As India moves into the next five year plan (2012-17), another 300 CB-NAAT machines
        and cartridges have been requested from WHO and UNITAID to support the rapid scale
        up of PMDT services in India.

The National PMDT Scale up Plan for 2011-2012, an operational plan, was developed by
consolidating the state wise PMDT micro-plans developed during the series of meetings with 35
states organized by CTD at LRS Institute, New Delhi in early 2011. The plan was developed with
the objective to articulate the operational strategy to achieve RNTCP vision for PMDT scale up to
the states and align state plans with the resources expected to be available over time (second line
drugs, and lab capacity) as per the national resources, such that the state plans are matched to
drug supply and lab capacity at different points in time over 2 years, with implications for
national training and appraisal needs and responsibilities understood by all. The timelines were
set out in the plan by the states for scale up of services by districts (geographical expansion) and
by gradually expanding MDR TB suspect criteria (towards universal access in various districts by
phases) with careful consideration of all preparatory activities like civil work up-gradations,
appointments and training of staff, procurement and plan for sample collection and transport and
drug logistic management, trainings and appraisals. The plan was endorsed by the 7th National
PMDT Committee meeting.


                                                53
National PMDT scale-up plan 2011-12 has been documented and is hosted on the programme
website. This plan was presented at the WHO SEARO Meeting of WHO country offices’ focal
points on Regional Response Plan for Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB in
April ’11 at Delhi for development.

Periodic intensive review of the progress made against the state PMDT scale up plans are being
undertaken regularly by Central TB Division with all 35 states to identify bottlenecks faced by
the states in scaling up services and address them through support from the Center in a timely
manner.

i)      ARTI: A nationwide tuberculin survey to estimate the Annual Risk of Tuberculosis
Infection (ARTI) in different parts of India was conducted by NTI, Bangalore in 2009, with
support from other institutions especially TRC, Chennai. Besides zonal differences, the ARTI
was found to be higher in urban areas than in rural areas. This difference reflects the
heterogeneity in such a vast country and population. A national ARTI of 1.1% has been derived
from the zonal estimates. This study has provided robust data on the epidemiology of TB in India
and will serve as a baseline data to assess the impact of RNTCP in the future. The ARTI seems to
have come down from the earlier ARTI of 1.5 (2002), which is an early indicator of the efficacy
of the DOTS strategy of RNTCP.

j)      PPM: In India, the private sector is the first point of care in about 80% of episodes of ill
health. This is true for TB patients as well. While most TB cases are ultimately treated by the
RNTCP, most patients by then have already approached the private sector for TB diagnosis and
treatment. Engaging the private sector (both for profit and not for profit entities) effectively is the
single most important intervention required for RNTCP to achieve the overall goal of universal
access and early detection.

The huge private sector in India comprises of a wide range of providers from private medical
practitioners of many different systems of medicine, both modern and traditional including those
having no formal training, and paramedics. Using the experiences gained from the collaborations
with NGOs and the private sector in RNTCP 1, the Central TB Division published guidelines for
the participation of the NGOs (in 2001) and private practitioners (in 2002). The guidelines for
NGO/PP schemes have undergone revisions once in 2008 and recently the National Consultation
for revision has been held with participation from various stakeholders. Currently 1,900 NGOs
and 10,000 private providers are involved (under signed memorandum of understanding) with the
TB programme in a variety of ways.

These guideline are again under process of revision.
                                                                 The current NGO/PP schemes include:
                                                                      ACSM scheme
Again this has been done with the consultation of                     Sputum Collection scheme
different stakeholders.                                               Transport scheme
                                                                      DMC scheme
As a result of PPM strategy, the efforts to                           LT scheme
involve all relevant health sectors became part                       Culture & DST scheme

health sector.



                                                  54
As a response to this situation, the Central TB Division decided to pilot an “intensified PPM
scaling-up project? in 14 urban areas of the country in 2003. The data from these sites show a
contribution of various sectors to NSP case detection rate as Health Department 56%,government
facility outside health department 9%,medical colleges 22%,private provider and NGOs 6% each
in 2011. Analyses of the reports from the intensified PPM sites have shown a steady and gradual
increase in the number of cases notified under RNTCP. In all the sites, the public health
department of the government has remained the largest contributor to case detection. Medical
Colleges, though fewer in number, have contributed a sizeable proportion of cases. The Public
Private Mix advocacy kit (flipbooks, stickers, display boards, posters etc.) has been developed for
facilitating interaction with Private Practitioners for community involvement. A training module
for the Medical Practitioners has been especially designed by Central TB Division to update them
on the technical and operational aspects of the programme.

    4. Performance Evaluation of the Borrower
The assistance provided by the World Bank contributed substantially in starting the
implementation of the DOTS strategy for TB Control in India. The benchmarking of performance
and supervisory missions conducted by the Bank were very useful for programme evaluation and
review of progress. Use of World Bank procurement procedures helped in ensuring fair prices
and quality of procured items. However the two-stage bidding system contributed significant
delays and the borrower has now sought to make it a one-stage bidding system for drug
procurement. Excellent relationship existed between the Bank staff and the Central TB Division
and this relationship continues to grow.

    5. Financial Performance
The project had an initial outlay of USD 170 million for the period from October 2006 to
September 2011. The credit was to finance USD170m. The project also got 2 extensions till
September 2012 and ended on 30th Sept 2012. At the end of the project period RNTCP has
received the reimbursement of all US$170m.

The project has decentralized the financial management to the states and funds flow from CTD to
STCS and from STCS to the DTCS. There is adequate capacity for financial management and
maintenance of accounts at State level. The States have also been given requisite authority to
manage the finances within the STCS and DTCSs. The flow of reporting is from the DTCS to
STCS and from STCS to CTD. Annual financial statements and audit reports also originate from
the district level to the STCS and are consolidated at STCS and then forwarded to CTD. The
project had developed the financial guidelines for both the State and the District and the financial
staff at TD has provided extensive training to the DTOs and accountants at State and District
level on maintenance of financial records and preparation and reporting of financial statements.
Modules of the internet and intranet based financial management system are being piloted in
some states and districts before full scale implementation.

As of 30th September 2012, the project has made an expenditure of 99% of the approved credit.
The reimbursable expenditure is Rs 458.34 Crores of an expected Rs 604.3 Crores. The category
wise expenditures are given below:

    6. Assessment of Project outcomes
The project has achieved most of the project targets which were mentioned in results framework.
The baseline was of 2006 while the end line data is of September 2012. The result framework is
placed as Annexure 3.




                                                55
Evaluation of the Performance of Bank

World Bank has provided support to the program not only on financial terms but also on technical
terms. The Bank has done regular monitoring of the program through its various Joint Monitoring
Missions. The bank was a part of various Joint Monitoring Missions of RNTCP. Apart from this
in the development of National Strategic Plan of RNTCP for 12th FYP the Bank has played key
role. The summary sheet on the challenges identified and recommendations given by bank during
various missions are placed as Annexure 4.

    7. Sustainability
The Government of India (GOI) gives the highest priority to TB control and is committed to
supporting the TB control activities for as long as it takes to achieve a situation where TB ceases
to be a major public health problem in the country. There is commitment from highest echelons
of authority that GOI would make necessary fund arrangements from domestic or other sources,
after the end of the GFATM grant period. Considering the situation prevailing at that time, GOI
would make available funds and resources from either domestic health allocation or could
consider approaching bilateral agencies for credit/grants.

Under RNTCP funds are utilized at National, state and district levels. The Programme has well
laid technical, financial and operational guidelines that are documented. The technical guidelines
are as per the internationally recommended strategy. These guidelines ensure that funds are
utilized efficiently and in a transparent manner.

TB programme is covered under the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of
India. CAG is the supreme audit institution of India that annually audits public accounts as per
the constitution of India and international best practices. Offices of the Principal Directors of
Audit are responsible for audit of the activities of the Federal Government, including Civil
Ministries and Departments. Auditing standards have been published and give overall direction
for auditing. The audit enhances accountability of the programme to the public representatives.
The Government of India, in line with the objective of providing adequate health care for its
citizens has been steadily increasing the allocations in health sector since commencement of the
Five Year Plan. During 10th Five year plan Public health spending in India has been relatively
low as a proportion of total GDP even when compared to other low and lower middle income
countries, and that the public sector accounts for a very low share of total health spending. But
the situation has improved during 11th five year plan period (2007-12). The allocation for the
health sector has been substantially enhanced from INR 363780.00 crores in the 10th FYP to INR
1, 36,147.00 crores in 11th FYP. (1 crore equals10 million).

Expenditure on Tuberculosis Control in India
The Government of India is committed towards its funding to RNTCP. The total outlay for
RNTCP during 10th FYP was 168 million US$. In 11th FYP this was increased to 358 million
US$ while in 12th FYP the proposed budget for RNTCP is US$ 950 million.

There is commitment towards the funding to RNTCP from both Government of India and donors.
During The scale-up of the RNTCP has been primarily supported by funds from the Government
of India including a Development Credit Agreement that was negotiated with the World Bank in
1997. These two sources have accounted for 67% of the RNTCP’s total budget over 2002-2007.
Apart from that, various donors like DFID has contributed towards drugs, UNITAID towards
laboratory and USAID for various activities under the program. The GOI funding towards
RNTCP has also increased in the consecutive Five Year Plans.



                                                56
In recent years, a plateau in the number of cases put on treatment (around 1.5 million since 2008-
09) is mirrored by a gradual increase in annual funding around from US$ 65 million in 2007-08
to US$ 85 million in 2011-12. The program’s National Strategic Plan for 2012-17 proposes
substantially increased funding levels, reaching around US$ 260 million annually by 2016-17, in
line with growth in the number of TB patients put on treatment (target of around 1.75 million by
2016-17).

The increase in RNTCP funding in absolute terms is in line with planned increases in overall
central government health spending (see Table 1). Central government allocations to health are
planned to increase dramatically in the 12th Plan. At the same time, the proportion allocated to
RNTCP will also increase in relative terms, from 1.4% of the total during the 11th Plan to a
proposed 1.5% in the 12th Plan. (This proportion, however, can perhaps be compared to TB
burden, as the disease causes an estimated 2.8% of all deaths in India and 6.4% of deaths among
the 15-49 age groups). In per capita terms, during the 12th Plan, average annual central
government spending on TB control is proposed to be about US$ 0.18, which represents a tripling
in absolute terms from the 11th Plan average.

    8. What Has Worked/Lessons Learned

DOTS: DOTS has been an extremely successful strategy and needs to be taken forward in the
next phase of the programme. The quality of provision of DOTS needs to be addressed in the next
phase to ensure that the observation of taking drugs by the patient takes place through provision of
increased incentives.

Availability of diagnostics: The availability of sputum microscopy has been adequately increased.
The arrangements for transportation of sputum from the suspects need to be strengthened in order
to increase the case finding.

Structure set up: The structure for implementation of the programme has been set up right from
the field level upwards. The reduction in population norms for the effective supervision can be
considered for effective implementation.

Well-defined information system: The information system is well established and the reporting
units provide information within specified time periods. These are analysed and compiled by the
programme. There remains, however, a need to strengthen feedback and follow ups.



                                                57
Availability of guidelines and protocols: The programme has developed guidelines and protocols
for every aspect and the providers are trained on these guidelines. This has standardized service
provision across the programme and facilitates maintenance of quality.

Review mechanisms: The internal review mechanisms at the state, national and district levels
have all been set in place and the programme carries this out according to a schedule drawn up.
Compliance to feedback during the reviews can be strengthened.

Technical Committees: The programme technical committees (Laboratory, Operations Research,
DOTS Plus Committee) as well as task forces at the zonal levels have been very useful. These
bodies are functioning well and facilitating programme implementation. A Treatment Review
Committee can be set up to advice the programme on change in regimens based on evidence
generated and a Technical Working Group for improving PPM must also be considered.

MDR-TB: The programme has focussed on MDR-TB and it has developed the protocols for
treatment and also is in the process of developing the laboratory capacity for strengthening this
component. Structural arrangements for early diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB patients have
been put in place. The programme however needs to address issues around management of drug-
resistance other than MDR-TB.

9.      Challenges

a)     The major challenge was that during the course of implementation many of the
expenditure which already were incurred were disallowed by bank and that resulted into the
burden on the domestic budget.

b)     The second challenge is that after dramatic and then steady increases in coverage, the
annual number of cases identified by the program has reached a plateau in the past few years.
RNTCP’s reach needs to be increased, requiring greater resources as well as new strategies.

c)       The third and related challenge is represented by the gap between the number of cases
notified and the total estimated number of new cases. About a third of total estimated cases are
not reached by the program, with these patients generally seeking care instead in the private
sector. Even those who receive treatment from RNTCP usually will have gone to several private
sector health service providers before seeking care from the program.

d)      Another major challenge is thus the need to extend RNTCP support, such as quality
standards and monitoring, anti-TB drugs, and subsidies, to patients who are diagnosed and treated
in the private sector. The main reasons this is necessary relate to the financial barriers and
burdens experienced by patients, particularly the poor, and to gaps in the quality of diagnosis and
care. These quality gaps, driven by a variety of factors ranging from the use of ineffective
diagnostic tests and treatment protocols to interrupted treatment due to financial barriers, are
driving drug resistance, which is a third major challenge faced by the program (not represented in
Error! Reference source not found.). WHO estimates that there are approximately 100,000 new
ases of MDR-TB in India annually. Drug-resistant TB is complicated and expensive to diagnose
and treat, requiring advanced diagnostics, specialized care, and a two-year course of treatment
with costly and difficult-to-tolerate drugs.

10.     Impact of the Programme
The World Bank in their supervision mission of April 2011 rated the implementation progress of
the project as highly satisfactory and Achievement of Project Developn'1ent Objectives as highly


                                                58
satisfactory .The foremost objective of the project was to shift the focus of TB control in the
country to the new internationally accepted paradigm for management of TB, namely DOTS. As
on 30th Sept 2011, there is 100% DOTS coverage in World Bank project areas and in the entire
country, about 8267lakhs population (projected population of 2005) has been covered under the
DOTS strategy. As far as impact on Incidence of the disease in the country is concerned, the
ARTI has reduced from previous estimate of 1.5% to 1.1% as measured in 2009. Program has
planned do its own TB prevalence and incidence study. Mortality has also reduced considerably
compared to the RNTCP 1. Death rates have been reduced 7-fold in DOTS areas versus non-
DOTS areas. The benefit incurred in the program during 12th FYP is following:

                                                                        11th FYP
