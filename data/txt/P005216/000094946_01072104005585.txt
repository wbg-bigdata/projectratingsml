3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Conditions prior to the project. Flash floods occurred in Tehran area with every major rainfall.
Sections of the central part of the city were flooded several times a year; traffic was disrupted for
periods averaging about three hours; electricity and telephone as well as economic activities were



interrupted for several hours. The municipality's expenditures on repairs and clean-up costs and
the risk to human life were high. Because there was no sewerage system in Tehran, storm water
flows contained some domestic sewage and wastewater from commerce and industry. Therefore,
flooding spread the danger of contamination of vegetable crops constituting a serious health risk
to consumers. The surface water drainage essentially consisted of open channels along the streets.
Over the 15 years prior to the project, the municipality was implementing a drainage master plan,
including some tunnels and open channels. In particular, the Firouzabad Canal in central and
western Tehran collected surface waters and rerouted them towards outside the city boundaries.
Unfortunately, the rapid development of Tehran has resulted in increased heavy flows in the
Firouzabad Canal and overspills into the surrounding sections of Shahr-e-Ray, a low-income
historical town to the south of Tehran.
The objectives of the project are: (i) to provide storm water drainage to divert flood waters away
from flood-prone areas; (ii) to transfer new technology for the construction of tunnels; and (iii)
to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Tehran Municipality through technical assistance for
project planning and implementation and for sound municipal finance management.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project, as outlined in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), consists of:
*  the construction of a central storm water collector system, namely the Khayam
Main Drain consisting of: (i) about 3.7 km reinforced concrete pipe ranging in size
from 1400 to 1600 mmn inside diameter; and (ii) about 10.8 km concrete lined
tunnel ranging in size from 2.80 to 3.30 m inside diameter;
o  the construction of a main drainage interceptor and outfall system, namely the
Third Outlet consisting of: (i) about 6.3 km concrete lined tunnel with 4.80 m
inside diameter; (ii) about 1.6 km concrete lined open channel with trapezoidal
shape cross section; (iii) a 600,000 m3 net capacity retention reservoir; (iv) about
6 km of reinforced concrete pressure pipe with 2,000 mm inside diameter; and (v)
about 4 diversion structures;
*  the construction of a lateral drain consisting of: (i) about 3 km in length of
reinforced concrete pipe ranging in size from 600 to 1,400 mm inside diameter for
lateral drains; and (ii) inlet structures, manholes and appurtenances;
*  the acquisition of land (about 14 ha) for construction of the retention reservoir,
tunnels access shafts and pipelines easements;
*  the provision of maintenance equipment, vehicles and spare parts;
- 2 -



*  the provision of technical assistance for: (i) construction management; and (ii)
municipal revenue and financial management studies.
3.4 Revised Components:
Three bids for the Khayam and Third Outlet Tunnels together were submitted in August 1993 and
the lowest bid amounted to US$ 140 million, twice the appraisal estimate. It was decided to split
the contract into three contracts:
* Contract No. 1: representing the first section of the Khayam tunnel to be awarded
through ICB consisting of a 4,047m long tunnel with 2,800 mm inside diameter at
an average depth of 35 m below ground level to be built under conventional
method;
*  Contract No.2 : representing the second section of the Khayam Tunnel to be
awarded under ICB consisted of a precast bolted segmental concrete tunnel 5,625
m long, 3,700 mm inside diameter at an average depth of 27 m below ground level
to be excavated by shield tunneling method using a Tunnel Boring Machine
(TBM). A major part of this tunnel lies beneath the underground water table. The
municipality constructed from its own funds outside the scope of the project about
3.7 km reinforced concrete pipe of the Khayam main Drain.
*  Contract No.3 : representing the Third Outlet Tunnel also to be awarded under
ICB had to be rerouted because of the construction of the buildings and facilities
of the Shrine of Imam Khomeiny which intercepted the initial route of Tunnel No3.
Its length was reduced from 6.3 km to 1.83 km, and its diameter from 4,800 to
4,600 mm. A 1.6 km concrete lined open channel was constructed by the
Municipality from its own funds.
The 600,000 m3 Retention Reservoir was built at another location because of the Khomeiny's
Shrine. For this reason, the length of Tunnel No3 was reduced while that of the Outlet Pipe was
increased from 6,000 m to 13,503 m. The Third Outlet Pipe initially 6 km long and 2,000 mm
inside diameter was replaced by a precast 13,503 m long concrete pipe with inner diameter of
1,600 mm. The Lateral Drain, 3 km long will be constructed by the Municipality from its own
funds and therefore, was removed from the implementation program of the project.
Complementarn   Component.  In order to replace the components removed from  the
Bank-financed Project, the Borrower proposed to include in the project, the Northern Tunnel
Branches consisting of 3,011 m long Modaress Branch and 6,820 m long Vali-asr Branch with
each tunnel having 1,800 mm inside diameter. Furthermore, the municipality had to buy 35 ha of
land mainly for the retention reservoir instead of 14 ha forecast at appraisal.
The provision of equipment has been much more important than forecast at appraisal, and
therefore the Municipality of Tehran bought directly the TBM, because it was too costly to ask
the contractor to provide this machine, and by doing so, major saving was made in the cost of the
- 3 -



project. The Technical Assistance component which financed the project management and
construction supervision was awarded to local consulting firms associated with a British firm.
However, the Revenue base and Financial Management studies was not carried out.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry was satisfactory because the feasibility studies had been carried out from 1972 to
1977 with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO). Updated in 1990, the project was
prepared quickly with only two Bank preparation missions, the first in October 1991 and the
second in January 1992. The project was ready for bidding at the time of appraisal in February
1992. The bidding process was, however, postponed by one year in order to adapt the bidding
documents already prepared by the Implementing Agency to the Bank's procurement guidelines.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall outcome can be evaluated as satisfactory particularly as regards the physical
components. The first objective to provide storm water drainage to divert flood waters away from
flood-prone areas was achieved. All the works initially included in the project have been
constructed, either under the Bank project or financed by the Municipality from its own funds.
The area protected against flooding by the project has even been enlarged because the Northern
Branches were added. The second objective to transfer appropriate technology for the
construction of tunnels has also been achieved with the second tunnel constructed using a tunnel
boring machine. This machine which was bought by the Municipality is presently being used by
Iranian contractors for the construction of other tunnels in the Tehran area. The third objective to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the Tehran Municipality through technical assistance for
project planning and implementation and for sound municipal finance management was partly
achieved.
As regards the capacity to plan and implement large projects like the drainage project, the
outcome is very satisfactory. The Municipality created the KHAKRIZ AB Company to be
responsible for all drainage works in Greater Tehran. Within this company, the project manager
heads the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) responsible for the World Bank Project. The PIU
recruited a local private consulting firm for the supervision of the works and these arrangements
worked very satisfactorily. On the institutional development aspect, it should be noted that the
creation of the Khakriz Ab company to plan and manage the project as part of the PIU and its
impressive performance in the implementation of a complex project is one of the main
achievements.
Concerning the technical assistance component which aimed to improve the municipal finance
management, the objective has not been achieved because the two financial studies, namely the
Revenue Base Study and the Financial Management Study have not been carried out (see para.
4.5 below).
-4 -



4.2 Outputs by components:
The following outputs were achieved:
*  Khayam Tunnel, split into Contracts No. 1 and No.2;
*  Third Outlet Tunnel, under Contract No.3;
* Retention Reservoir of 600,000 m3;
*  Outlet Pipe;
* Two Northern Branches (Modaress and Vali e Asr Branches) constructed instead
of the Lateral Drain and the Third Outlet Canal, built by the Municipality from its own
funds;
*  Acquisition of 35 ha (instead of 14 ha);
*  Provision of a Tunnel Boring Machine for this project and others; and
*  Provision of technical assistance for project implementation and supervision, but no
technical
assistance was financed for institutional improvement.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic analysis is based on the assumptions described in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),
the main ones of which are: (i) without the project, the flooding in the central parts of Tehran and
in Shahr-e-Ray would continue to be more severe as urban development continues in the Tehran
area; and (ii) the types of damages related to floods are of various frequencies (ranging from
frequent floods a year, once every five years to once in 30 years) and the calculation is based on
annual average flood damage.
The main project benefits are attributable to positive environmental and social benefits associated
with the reduction of health hazards posed by floods and risks to human lives and disruption to
econornic activities. The project has benefited about 50,000 low-income families residing in
flood-prone areas of Shahr-e-Rey, a historical town over a thousand years old and about 200,000
people living in the Khayam area of Tehran by protecting their lives and economic livelihood and
avoiding substantial material losses due to floods that would have occurred if the project were not
undertaken.
Direct benefits include cost savings related to: (i) flood damage to buildings and infrastructure
including substantial damage to the Tehran Railway Station; (ii) damage to property of utilities
(water, telephone and electricity); (iii) disruption to traffic and interruptions in economic
activities; and (iv) manpower that would be used for emergency preparation and clean up and
assistance to affected population. The benefit streams do not include benefits from increased
agricultural production due to water conveyance through the tunnels. Health and environmental
benefits were also not calculated, as in the SAR. The investment costs of the project are actual
amounts including civil works, land, vehicles and equipment, design and supervision charges.
Costs include periodic equipment replacements and annual incremental operating and maintenance
costs over the life of the project.
The economic analysis was carried out using "with and without project" situations. The estimated
- 5 -



economic rate of return based on the above costs and benefit streams (Annex 3) is 20 percent
(compared to the ERR estimate of 23 % at appraisal). The estimate is very robust: a one year
delay in benefits reduces ERR to about 19 percent; and a 15 percent reduction in benefits gives an
ERR of about 17 percent.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
The financial rate of return of the project is 28 percent.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional set up under the project involved the creation of PIU with Kharkiz Ab Company
responsible for planning and managing the storm water system for the municipality of Tehran. The
company functioned as the technical and planning arm of the Municipality for the storm water and
after the completion of the project, it has continued to carry out new tasks of planning and
managing stormn water for the Municipality.
The Iranians have now acquired skill and experience in new tunneling techniques and are now
operating efficiently the Tunnel Boring Machines on their own without foreign assistance. The
creation of the Karhkiz AB Co. is, therefore, a substantial achievement of the project and all
indications are that it has grown into a competent agency and that it is there to stay.
The Municipality was reluctant to carry out, with the assistance of specialized consultants two
financial studies, namely (i) Revenue based study, and (ii) Financial management study as
provided in the Loan Agreement. The Municipality felt that local consultants did not possess the
requisite skills for the Revenue based study; they were reluctant to open their books to an
international consultants and they felt it was a huge undertaking that could not be accomplished
within the context of the project. The Municipality later carried out the financial management
study after a long delay and the quality of the report was not good. The objective of strengthening
the financial planning capacity of Tehran Municipality has not been fully achieved as envisaged in
the SAR. For these reasons, the institutional development impact was rated as modest.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Not applicable.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The only major factor affecting implementation and outcome was the Municipality's reluctance to
carry out the fmancial studies required by the Loan Agreement and indispensable to irnprove the
financial operations of the Municipality. Obviously, such an improvement would have a
significant impact on the project's sustainability.
- 6 -



5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Not applicable.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The bids received for the first tunnel bidding process were so high (twice the appraisal estimate)
that the PIU had to review the design and to delete some minor components. This led to
significant savings and allowed the addition of the two Northern Branches. Initially, the Bank was
to finance 100 percent of foreign expenditures for works, goods and consultants services.
However, the failure of the first bidding for the tunnels led to the use of other construction
methods, and to a more important involvement of local contractors. Since the foreign component
was considerably reduced, it was necessary that the Bank also finance a part of the local
expenditures.
By letter of November 15, 1993, the Bank agreed to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
(1)   Works               100% of foreign expenditures and 60% of local expenditures;
(2)   Equipment           100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-
factory cost) and 70% of local expenditures for other items;
(3)   Consultants' services 100%.
This amendment alleviated the financial burden of the Municipality and allowed the Bank to fully
disburse the Loan. Finally, the Bank disbursed the full amount of the Loan, US$ 77.0 million, and
the Municipality US$ 33.1 million equivalent, against US$ 18.6 million, estimate made at
appraisal. The provision of counterpart funds by the Municipality never affected the project
implementation, because it was generally done on time.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The project achieved important institutional development objectives: (i) creation of the Kharkiz
Ab Company with its own budget and autonomy, to plan and manage the storm water system for
the Municipality of Tehran. The company continues to operate beyond the project in carrying out
new tasks and Kharkiz is now the technical and planning arm of the Municipality for storm water.
It is there to stay for a long-time to come; (ii) transfer of know-how and expertise acquired by
Iranians, particularly on the new tunnelling techniqlues; (iii) the practical experience gained on
procurement of large equipment and supervision of foreign contractors.
These achievements will be sustaineds as the Municipality has acquired under the project the
technical skills to operate and maintain the facilities. The longer term sustainability of the facility
also depends on adequacy of funds allocated by the Municipality for maintenance and
replacement. Sustainability of the project is therefore rated as likely.
- 7 -



6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The project investments have been fully integrated into the regular operations of the Municipality.
Major further improvements at the institutional and financial levels are necessary to enable the
Municipality to achieve viable operations.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank was able to react positively and very quickly to the Government's request for the
financing of a drainage project in Tehran. From this first request to the Board approval, the
elapsed time was only one year (May 1991 to May 1992), which is relatively a short period given
the complex technical design of the project. On the other hand, some components of the project
were underestimated, particularly the Retention Reservoir and the Third Outlet Pipe. Regarding
the construction method of tunnels, the Bank's decisions at appraisal were not judicious. The
appraisal mission, including a consultant specialized in tunnel construction, recommended to
launch one ICB process for all the tunnels, and to select a modem mechanical method, using a
Tunnel Boring Machine. This solution was supposed to reduce the construction period and make
possible a technology transfer. However, the lowest bid amounted to US$ 140 million, twice the
appraisal estimate. It was decided to split the contract into three different contracts, all under
ICB, one with mechanical method, and two with traditional method. The consequence was a
two-year delay.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance in supervision was highly satisfactory. There have been sixteen
supervision missions, from February 1993 to November 2000, or about twice a year, which is
reasonable. Three task managers (or team leaders) succeeded during the project's life and this
also is reasonable. The Bank reacted very quickly and positively to the changes in project
components, due to: (i) the high price level of the first bidding process for the tunnels, and (ii) the
construction of the Imam Khomeiny Shrine near the initial location of the retention reservoir. The
Bank also approved the addition of some new works (the Northern Branches), to replace some
components initially included in the project but already realized by the Municipality from its own
funds, because of their urgency.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance in preparation was satisfactory. The feasibility study had been
carried out from 1972 to 1977, with help of the World Health Organization, by an association of
foreign and local consulting firms. The project was reviewed and updated in 1990 and, therefore,
- 8 -



it was ready for bidding at the time of appraisal. It took one year to adapt the bidding documents
to the Bank Guidelines, which is reasonable.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The performance of the Municipality is rated highly satisfactory as regards the establishment of an
efficient PIU (Kharkiz AB Co) with full autonomy and separate budget allocation and satisfactory
on the timely provision of counterpart funds. On the other hand, the Municipality's performance
on carrying out two key studies on financial planning and management was rated unsatisfactory.
Overall, the Municipalities implementation performance is rated as satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The Implementing Agency was the Tehran Municipality's Technical and Development Executive
(TDE), under one of the Deputy Mayors. Within TDE, an autonomous Engineering and
Development Organization (EDO) provides construction management services. In 1993, the
Municipality created the KHAKRIZ AB Company to be responsible for all drainage works in
Greater Tehran. Within this company, the Project Manager heads the PIU responsible for the
World Bank financed Project. The PIU recruited a local private consulting firm for the
supervision of the works. This consultant was assisted by a foreign consulting firm for the
construction of Tunnel 2 where the TBM was used. The performance of PIU and of the
consulting firm was highly satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The Borrower's overall performance was rated as satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons drawn from the project is that institutional improvements are more difficult to
achieve than physical components. They require careful diagnosis of the bottlenecks and a good
understanding of the institutions involved. Furthernore, agreed upon measures for change should
be reasonable and consistent with the institutional capacity of client organizations.  Their
implementation and expected results take longer than the time horizon of a single project.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
1.    The economic analysis is based on the assumptions presented in the SAR. Two analyses
have been carried out: (i) Financial cost and benefit; and (ii) Economic cost and benefit. For
economic analysis, the shadow exchange rate has been used to eliminate the economic distorsions.
2.    Project Costs consist of: (i) the actual total cost of the project is Rials 162,780 million; (ii)
the construction period of the project is 5 years from 1995 to 2000; (iii) the actual cost of the
project has been applied in yearly basis according to physical progress; (iv) operation and
maintenance costs are applied from the year operation starts; and (v) operation period of 30 years.
The capital cost of the project includes the civil works, land, vehicles, equipment, design and
supervision.
3.    Project Benefits: The benefits in the two flood areas (Khayam and Shahr-e-Rey) can result
from a reduction of:
(a)   damage to houses and other buildings;
(b)   damage to warehouse stocks;
(c)   damage to bridges, sidewalks and streets;
(d)   costs assocciated with removing sediments and debris;
(e)   damage to telephone infrastructure;
(f)   time spent in preparing for floods and in clean-up operations;
(g)   damage to Tehran Railway station;
(h)   damage to properties along the Firouzabad Canal;
(i)   damage to crops in the Shahr-e-Rey area; and
(j)   disruption to economic activity.
4.    The benefits have been adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For the
Economic analysis, the financial prices have been adjusted to economic price. For this purpose,
economic distortions towards the world economy have been applied to an estimated 30 percent of
national economy distortion, and has been eliminated from the calculation.
Financial and Economic Rate of Return
5.    The Financial Rate of Return (FRR) is 28% and the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) 20%
compared to the appraisal estimate of 23%.

Additional Annex 8. Borrower Implementation Completion Report
Introduction
1.    Tehran Drainage Project would serve as the first of its kind to assist the Tehran
Municipality, in addition to external currency resources, in planning, design, and implementation,
as well as in transferring appropriate technology. The project reduces the risk of flood damage in
both the central area of Tehran and the low-lying areas to the southern part of Tehran.
2.    The flooding problem of surface waters in Tehran demanded execution of the Project.
The physical setting of Tebran i.e. the city's topography, geology, climate and hydrographic,
obstruction of natural drainage ravines due to rapid urban development and little comprehensive
planning, and the inadequacy of the existing drainage system, were the main causes of this serious
problem for growing population of the capital city and the center of business activities in Iran.
The greater city of Tehran with an area of 620 km is located on the southern foothills of Alborz
Mountains and the western slopes of Sepaych Mountains. Its elevation ranges from 1100 m to
1900 m above the mean sea level. The city is characterized by steep slopes in the north (%/040)
and mild slopes in the south (%0.5) and the rainfall intensity follows a similar pattern. The
average annual rainfall in north of Tehran is 400 mm whereas that over the south of the city is 200
mm. In south of Tehran due to an increase in lime and clay compounds, the soil is less penetrable
and underground water level is very high. Ground water table depth varies from 100 meter in the
higher ground to near the surface in the southern parts of the city. There are a number of
perennial rivers and streams overflowing the Greater Tehran Area. As Tehran expanded in the
northerly direction, natural streams have been either blocked by urban development or enclosed.
Flash floods which result from high intensity and short duration storms combined with steep and
rocky slopes in the watershed of mountain streams had become a major hazard as a result of
obstructing the natural drainage streams.
Prior to execution of this project and other parts of the developing Tehran Drainage
Project, what existed in the city of Tehran as the system for controlling surface water consisted of
open gutters called jubes on both sides of streets. The southern gutters received the flowing
waters of the northern regions of Tehran in a volume sometimes more than triple of their
capacities. In addition, the litter in the gutters causes for the decrease in the gutter capacity.
3.    Due to the above physical setting flash flood occurred with every major rainfall in Tehran.
The damages caused by destructive floods of Aug. 1953, springs of 1967 and 1969 and that of
July 1987, showed vulnerability of Tehran as against the floods.
The sections of Shahr-e-Ray, a low-income historical town to the south of Tehran, that
are near the Firouzabad canal - the main drainage canal receiving surface water flows from the jub
system in central and western Tehran - were particularly prone to flooding. In this area floods
occurred 6 or 7 times a year, on average, and caused 5 to 10 hours of total disruption in the town.
Traffic was disrupted for periods averaging about three hours; and underground utilities, such as
telephone and electricity service were interrupted for several hours. Floods caused damage to
buildings, roads, and infrastructure, each time they occurred. They also caused substantial
- 22 -



damage to agricultural crops in the area. Because of lack of a sewerage system in the Tehran
area, storm water flows contain some domestic sewage and wastewater from commerce and small
industry. For that mater, flooding spread the danger of contamination of pollutants in the
wastewater, and was a substantial health risk. These flows were also used on vegetable crops in
the Tehran area, constituting serious health risk to the consumers.
4.    The risk offloods to public safety and health, the cost of public and private damages and
above all the high risk to losses in human lives were the key factors that made the execution of
this project - as the major part of Tehran Drainage Project - an urgent necessity.
5.    Comprehensive feasibility study of this project began with the supervision and help of
World Health Organization (WHO) in 1972 and the report of Phase 1 and complementary studies
report were submitted in 1975 and 1977 respectively. Based on the preliminary findings the
Municipality of Tehran undertook implementation of a drainage master plan. Construction and
renovation of urban floodways, canals and tunnels especially in the unsafe areas were prioritized
and since 1990, a total of 260 km of water way systems for directing surface waters were
completed by the Development & Engineering Executive of Tehran Municipality.
In May 1991, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (MEF) of Islamic Republic of Iran
(IRI) requested World Bank assistance for implementation of part of Tehran Drainage Project,
known as Khayam Main Drain & 3rd Outlet (KMD) project. During 1990 to 1994 studies of this
project were undertaken and the quality of research and proficiency of the executive team enabled
the City Hall of Tehran to procure a 77 million US Dollars loan from the World Bank for
covering partial costs of the project.
Project Objectives
6.    The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) provide a storm water collection
system to catch and divert flood waters away from flood prone areas of the city for the protection
of human lives and property; (ii) transfer appropriate technology for the construction of tunnels;
and (iii) strengthen the institutional capacity of the Tehran Municipality through technical
assistance for project planning and implementation, and for sound municipal finance management.
The project would reduce the health risks posed by sewage overflows onto streets, and minimize
water logging and flooding problems in the low-income areas to the south of the city.
Project Description
7.    The main drainage system master plan consist of: (i) tunnels and open channels to collect
rainwater runoff within the city and divert such flows to natural drainage river courses; (ii) open
channels and culverts to intercept mountain streams and divert them around the city to existing
river courses; (iii) lateral drains, manholes, inlet structures and appurtenances to relieve the jobs
system as required and divert such surface waters into tunnels and open channels.
8.    Khayam Main Drain & Third Outlet project consist of a storm water collection and
disposal system in the city of Tehran. The project include two major sub-components; namely, a
- 23 -



trunk tunnel (KMD) along Khayam street, lateral drains and appurtenances which are required to
intercept rainwater runoff collected in the jubes in the central part of Tehran; and a main
interceptor system (Third Outlet) consisting of a tunnel, a retention reservoir, and a discharge
pipeline to the Kan river.
9.    The catchment area of Tehran from the peak of Tochal mountain to Shah-e-Ray is 693 m2
and considering the topography, floodways and existing canals have been divided into 7 major
catchments: Western district (147 km), Kan district (122 km), Northern district (137 km), Eastern
district (27 km), Southern district (76 km); Central district (120 km) and Southwestern district
(64 kni). The majority of catchment area around Tehran has access to floodways and it is
possible to renovate some of the floodways and canals in districts with less concentration of
population. However, Tehran's central district with an area of 120 km and a high concentration
of residential and business areas, was deprived of having access to natural floodways and canals.
Therefore, collection and discharge of surface waters of this district has great significance for
millions of people in this area and for the country's continuous economic growth.
The task of collecting and directing surface waters of this district was assigned to the three
tunnels of Shahrivar 17, Navab and Khayam. Among these, Khayam Main Drain & Third Outlet
Project is most important. These tunnels and the Firouzabad canal (storm water overflow) are
intercepted by the Third outlet conveyor to divert floodwaters to the Kan River away from
Shahr-e-Rey area.
10.   With completion of the Khayam Main Drain and Third Outlet, now the only remaining
major work would be the erosion control of northern mountain catchments and sediment transport
control. The latter component is currently under design for implementation in the near future.
11.   The main components of the project consist of:
i  Tunnel No. 1: 4047 meters length of concrete tunnel with diameter of 2800 mm at average
depth of 35 meter below ground level. This tunnel was constructed by applying
conventional method i.e. New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM).
*  Tunnel No. 2: 5625 meter length of precast bolted segmental concrete tunnel with inner
diameter of 3700 mm at average depth of 27 meter below ground level, constructed by
Earth Pressured Closed Shield Tunnel Boring Machine (EPBM-TBM). A major part of
this tunnel lies beneath underground water table.
*  Tunnel No. 3: 1830 meter length of in-situ concrete tunnel with inner diameter of 4600
mm., at an average depth of 10 meter below ground level, constructed by applying 3
different methods: Cut & Cover, NATM and Shoring.
*  Retention Reservoir: 600,000 cubic meter capacity water reservoir, which outstands 24
hours constant Tehran rainfall and functions as a retention tank. This reservoir is the
largest man made reservoir in Tehran.
*  Pipeline: 13503 meter length of a precast concrete pipeline with inner diameter of 1600
- 24 -



mm, that would discharge the flood from reservoir to Kan river, located at a remote part
of southern Tehran.
* Northern Tunnel Branches: Consisting of Modaress Branch with 3011 meter length and
Vali-asr Branch with 6820 meter length, both with 1800 mm diameter.
Ancillary Works including:
20 shafts with various sizes, which function as flood intakes and tunnel transitions.
36 local Inlets to divert flood from street surface to the shafts.
69 manholes for inspection.
PROJECT DESIGN
12.   Local consulting engineers assisted by expatriate experts carried out project preparation
and design. During the course of project preparation several alternatives were considered.
13.   Least cost solutions were chosen during the design and implementation of the project.
Alternative methods of construction were studied to determine the economic impact during
construction as well as cost effective methods. Although the tunneling methods initially selected
(shield machine and road-header) were demonstrated to be the least cost for different soil
conditions, bid documents provided for alternative methods to be considered. The routing of
tunnels and pipes was determined by topographical conditions, as well as by routing of major
public road right-of-way, to minimize the need for acquiring private property. The design of the
Third Outlet was determined by the limited hydraulic capacity of the Kan River, this resulted in
proposing a reservoir to retain pick flows for gradual release to the Kan River. Also, the outer
pipe from the reservoir was determined to be more economical than an open channel, as the latter
would not only require purchase of land but such canal would create social problems by dividing
private parcels of agricultural area into irregular sections.
14.    Changes and modifications in the initial design of the project became necessary due to
very high prices offered by participants in the first tender for selection of the contractors, which
was held in the beginning of 1993. These prices were far higher than the original cost estimates.
To lower the costs the following suggestions of the project implementing entity were agreed by
the World Bank:
-     To divide the project into smaller parts.
-     To ask the contractors to offer alternative design for tunneling works in dry lands.
-     To use TBM Closed Shield only for tunneling works under water.
-     The TBM shall be purchased and owned by the Tehran Municipality.
Whereas in the initial design the whole tunneling work was defined as a single project, due to
introduction of the above changes the project was divided into three different tunnels: Tunnel 1,
Tunnel 2 and Tunnel 3.
15.   A substantial saving in execution of the project was made possible due to breakdown of
- 25 -



the project into smaller parts and execution of Tunnel 1 through Conventional Method, which was
the traditional method for tunneling works in Iran for thousands of years. Savings that were
realized were applied for the construction of what is referred to as the Northern Extension
Tunnels. These tunnels extend the flood catchment area of the initial project for another 20% and
thus enhanced the value of investments made under the project.
PROJECT COSTAND FINANCING
16.   The estimated project cost was at about Rls. 133.5 billion (US$ 95.6 million equivalent)
of which about 80 percent (US$ 77 million) was financed by the World Bank.
17.   The preliminaryfinancingplan consisted of a contribution of the Tehran Municipality of
about Rls. 25.9 billion (US$ 18.6 million equivalent) to cover the entire local cost, plus a World
Bank loan of about US$ 77 million equivalent.
18.   The actual project costs - both local and foreign costs - for different components of the
Project are indicated in the below table:

19.   The difference between estimated and actual cost (110.079 - 95.6 = 14.479 million US$)
occurred mainly due to construction of Northern Head Branches, which was not included in the
initial design and cost estimation. In addition to execution of Northern Head Branches - that
extended the coverage of the project for at least 20% - the following factors effected the actual
cost of the project:
- 26 -



a) The difference between the estimated and actual annual increase of Escalation Rates;
b) The difference between the estimated and actual Floating Exchange Rate;
c) The difference of estimated and actual cost for equipment;
d) Contractors' claims;
e) The difference of the estimated and actual cost for Land Acquisition.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
20.   The Project Implementing Entity has been the Tehran Municipality's "Technical and
Development Executive" (TDE). TDE is controlled by one of the Deputy Mayors. It provides
technical and development services for the Municipality, its various subsidiaries and for other
appropriate interests. It also has a division for coordination of technical and development work to
be performed at the District level, usually of a relatively minor nature. Larger schemes, including
those covering several Districts, were typically executed by the TDE. The TDE has a department
for Administration and Financial Management. It also has a separate division for the Coordination
of Planning and Budgeting. Funds are allocated to the TDE from the Municipality's general
budget, following standard procedures, in response to TDE requests.
21.   Within TDE, there are two autonomous "Municipal Organizations". One deals with"
Technical and Engineering Consulting" and the other with "Engineering and Development".
These two entities act on behalf of the TDE - and for the Municipality as a whole - to design and
supervise projects and to implement them through construction. The Technical and Engineering
Consulting Organization (TECO) operates like a planning and design consulting firm.
Engineering and Development Organization (EDO) operates like a firm providing construction
management services. The permanent staff of both these organizations serves as a core group and
they augment their resources using outside consultants and/or contractors, as required.
22.   Project management has been carried out by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the
Engineering and Development Organization (EDO). Headed by the Chief of EDO Projects
Department and strengthened by technical, administrative and finance staff from the Technical and
Development Executive (TDE) of the Tehran Municipality, KHAKRIZ AB Co. has acted as the
PIU. A separate unit within the PIU has been set up to monitor and evaluate project
implementation, and, to this effect, it has collected and processed data about the project physical
and financial performance into a form usable for project management for assessing whether
schedules and targets set out in the project has been met. This unit has quantified changes from
the appraisal estimate over the life of the project and recommended introducing changes in project
features when it was necessary. The head of the PIU has supervised the work of the monitoring
and evaluation unit and has established a system for communication results to the Bank, the
Deputy Mayor and the other concerned parties. During the course of project execution the PIU
was strengthened by TDE within its EDO Projects Department and through a Project Monitoring
and Evaluation Program.
23.   Local Consultants assisted the Project Implementation Unit during the course of project
execution. The qualification, experience, contract terms and conditions of the local consultants
- 27 -



financed by the implementing agency were accepted by the World Bank and the local consultant
proved to be competent for carrying out the supervision of the project. In addition,foreign
consultants that were recruited and financed by the Bank assisted the local consultants on
procurement and construction management. The provision of consultancy services through
cooperation of local and foreign consultants was indispensable for implementation of project
according to technical, financial and time planning. The consultants also helped to settle the
contractors financial claims and that made possible substantial savings in project costs.
24.   Due to highly specialized nature of the work for part of tunnels, a Consortium of local
andforeign contractors was selected after International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for
procurement of civil works of Tunnels No. 2 and 3. Although the foreign partner of this joint
venture proved to be competent in execution of the project, this experience of partnership
between the foreign and local contractors was not successful as the Iranian partner left the joint
venture at the very early stages of the project implementation. It seems that in future, supervision
of the Bank would be helpful in creation of such joint ventures.
25.   Construction of part of Tunnel 2 beneath underground water table required use of Tunnel
Boring Machine (TBM) and for that matter an advanced Earth Pressured Closed Shield TBM
(EPBM-TBM) was procured through international shopping. The decision was made to procure
this TBM by the Tehran Municipality and this decision tumed out to be not only a wise
investment that reduced the overall cost of the project considerably, but also a transfer of
technology was made possible that could be beneficial for future investments in similar projects.
Tehran Municipality in another part of Tehran Drainage Project (Bahmanyar Tunnel) is currently
using the TBM and the local staff has been trained to secure its use in this and other similar
projects in future.
26.   Local Contractors, which were selected through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB)
accepted to the bank, carried out execution of civil works for other parts of the project, including:
Tunnel No. 1, Retention Reservoir and Pipeline, Northern Tunnel Branches and also the related
ancillary works.
27.   Various training obtained by local staff has helped local engineers to equip themselves
with latest practices and techniques in planning, design and construction of tunnels. At the time of
start of this project there were few local contractors capable for quality tunneling works.
- 28 -



28.    The Implementation Period for this project was estimated at 6 years. This estimation was
based on duration of contracts and construction methods specified, spread of the works involved
and on the time-cost relationship. The commencement and completion dates of the project were
respectively anticipated at July 1992 and June 1998. However, the Project was actually
commenced at December 1995 and was completed at December 2001. The below table shows
the rates of physical progress in different parts of the Project during the Implementation Period:
The rate of progress in percent (%)
Project                            1995   1996   1997       1998     1999    2000
Tunnel 1                           15      48     78       89        100
Tunnel 2                           1       5       15      62        90       100
Tunnel 3                           5       29     47       73        89       100

Moddares Head Branch               0       0      0        0        2.5       100
Nobakht & Taleghani Head Branch    0       0      0         2        13       100
29.   The delay in commencement date of the Project occurred due to rebidding and the actual
finalization of agreements with the World Bank.
30.   The minor delay in Implementation Period was mainly the result of the delay in
procurement of TBM, the actual period required for land acquisition and the effect of climatic
conditions - snow and rainfall - on part of construction works. This delay was widely
compensated by savings in investment costs that resulted to execution of Northern Head
Branches.
G.   PROJECTBENEFITS
31.   The main project benefits are related to reductions in risks to losses in human lives and in
flood related losses, primarily in the heavily populated Khayam area of Tehran and in
Shahr-e-Rey, an area inhabited mostly by low-income people. Tangible benefits include savings in
the costs of: (i) flood damage to buildings and infrastructure, including substantial damage at the
Tehran Railway Station vicinity; (ii) damage to utilities (water, telephone and electricity); (iii)
disruptions to traffic and interruptions in economic activity; (iv) manpower for emergency
response programs and assistance to the affected population, and (v) in Shahr-e-Ray, losses in
crops that are usually damaged during flooding. An additional benefit is the value of buildings
along the Firouzabad canal that would collapse if the project were not undertaken.
- 29 -



32.   The implemented drainage project has been based on the results of the environmental
analysis and according to that analysis has been classified under environmental category B. There
are no fauna, flora, and known sites of cultural heritage importance within the routes of the
proposed tunnels, pipes and the retention reservoir. The reservoir would retain peak storm water
flows and collect sedimentation. It would enable releases of floodwaters gradually within the
hydraulic capacity of the Kan River.
33.   The project has a significant social impact by protecting the lives (numerous deaths
incidents associated with flash floods) and property of hundreds of thousands of people living in
low-income households in the Shahr-e-Ray area - a historical town over a thousand years old -
and in the Khayam area of Tehran. In the absence of the project works to divert the flows away
from Shahr-e-Ray, permanent evacuation of the flood-prone areas of Shahr-e-Ray would have
been eventually necessary, at enormous financial cost and human suffering. Short-term solutions
would have merely postponed the necessary investments by shifting the problem to other areas of
the town. The project would not affect downstream agricultural areas, as only the storm water in
excess of the base flow in the existing drainage channels would be diverted to the third outlet
conveyor.
34.   Before implementation of the Project, because of the lack of a sewerage system in the
Tehran area, storm water flows contained sewage and wastewater from commerce and small
industry. Flooding spread the danger of contamination of pollutants in the wastewater, and was a
substantial health risk. The water from the Firouzabad canal, which was known to contain many
kinds of pathogens and some heavy metals, as well as sludge extracted from a local "informal"
drying pond using polluted storm water drainage, was used on vegetable crops in the agricultural
area near Shahr-e-Ray. Since many of these vegetables were consumed raw (lettuces, radishes,
etc.), this was an extremely unhealthy situation. The diversion of the major storm water flows
away from the area would substantially reduce the health risk to the population subject to
flooding, and to the consumers of these vegetables in Tehran and other areas.
35.    Several historical sites lie within or adjacent to the areas that would be susceptible to
damage from flooding, if the Project was not undertaken. In central Tehran, these would include
the Gholestan and Marble Palaces, some historical buildings in the Bazaar area and Hassan-Abaad
square, and Shams-Al-Emareh. In Shahr-e-Ray these include the Shrine of Abdul Azim, which is
over one thousand old, the Shrine of Imam Abdulla and an adjacent cemetery, and several
picturesque old buildings in the Bazaar area. In all, an estimated 10-20 ha of old buildings in the
town would risk flood damage over the next few decades, if the Project were not implemented.
36.   The Project would contribute indirectly to improved water resources management in the
Tehran area. The Project would allow future use to be made of the storm water runoff to be
diverted to the west, where there is the possibility of artificially recharging other parts of the plain
west of Tehran, through the karaj rivei bed.
37.   Another potential use of the implemented tunnels is to convey the excess groundwater in
the southern areas of Tehran in the vicinity to the Kahyam Tunnel to irrigate about 10,000
- 30 -



hectares of fertile, arable land, which is located in the Shahriar and Robat-Karim area, about 30
km southwest from Tehran.
38.   The quantifiable benefits attributable to reductions in flooding in the heavily populated
sections of both the Khayam area of Tehran and Shahr-e-Rey town include the savings in costs
related to flood damage to buildings and infrastructure, in costs related to disruptions to normal
economic activity, and in the costs of manpower for emergency preparation and clean-up. The
costs of flood damage to the Tehran Railway Station in the southern part of the Khayam area also
constitute a benefit. In Shahr-e-Rey, additional benefits are associated with the costs of the
damage sustained by buildings along the Firouzabad canal, and of damage to agricultural crops
during flooding. Quantifiable benefits are summarized as follows:
One.        Damage to houses and other buildings;
Two.        Damage to warehouse stocks;
Three.      Damage to bridges, sidewalks and streets;
Four.       Costs associated with removing sediments and debris;
Five.       Damage to telephone infrastructure;
Six.        Time spent in preparing for floods, and in clean-up operations;
Seven.      Damage to Tehran Railway Station;
Eight.      Damage to properties along the old Firouzabad canal;
Nine.       Damage to crops in the Shahr-e-Rey town; and
Ten.        Disruption in normal economic activity.
39.   With inclusion of only these direct benefits in the calculation of the Economic Rate of
Return (ERR), the calculated ERR of about 22 percent is considered a very conservative estimate.
H.   BANKS' PERFORMANCE
40.   The World Bank Mission during each visit imparted valuable guidance and support by
suggesting corrective measures in project implementation. They adjusted project content in
accordance with the practical situation, in order to guarantee smooth implementation of the
project. Their work was efficient and of high quality during the whole project implementation.
Cooperation between both parties - Bank and the Borrower - was friendly and sincere and
opinions on project issues were exchanged frankly between the World Bank representatives and
the Project Implementation Unit. This helped to solve various problems, which occurred during
project implementation.
I.    RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANK
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran would like to place on records its appreciation of the
valuable support, guidance and professional advice from successive Bank missions during the
course of the project, which indeed went a long way in the successful completion of the project.
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran would look forward for such co-operation in the
future for development activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
