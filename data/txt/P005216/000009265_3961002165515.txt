MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE TEHRAN MUNICIPALITY WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
FOR ThE TEHRAN DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Tehran Municipality (TM) with a guarantee from the
Islamic Republic of Iran, for US$77 million equivalent to help finance the
Tehran Drainage Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.    Belstrd.  Iran is a lower middle-income country with a 1990
population close to 57 million people, growing at over 3 percent per year, and
a GNP per capita income estimated at US$2,&50 (1990).  Iran's principal
natural assets are its petroleum and gas deposits, other valuable minerals
(e.g., chromite, copper, zinc, gemstones), and substantial agricultural and
water resources. Agriculture accounts for around 20 percent of GDP; industry,
including oil and gas production, for another 20 percent; and services, for
the remaining 60 percent of GDP. Nearly 30 percent of Iran's labor force of
around 15 million is engaged in agriculture; 25 percent, in industry; and 45
percent, in services.
3.    Iran's merchandise exports, averaging US$10-14 billion per year, are
dominated by oil and gas, which constitute 90 percent of total exports. Non-
oil exports include carpets, fresh and dried fruit and nuts, and a variety of
manufactured goods (e.g., canned foods, electrical goods, glassware,
industrial equipment, leather goods, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and
textiles). Merchandise imports to Iran, averaging US$10-15 billion per year,
comprise mainly intermediate goods (58 percent of total). Capital goods
constitute 24 percent, and food and other consumer goods the remaining 18
percent of total imports of goods.
4.    Iran's economic policies and performance in the last decade were
influenced by the change of regime in 1979 and the war with Iraq from 1980 to
1988. During the war years, the economy was subject to controls and
administrative interventions in the determination of the prices of various
goods and services, domestic and external trading, investment decisions, and
the ownership of firms and enterprises. The country also faced trade and
financial embargoes and, in 1986, experienced a virtual collapse of oil
income.
5.    Economic performance was mixed.  An 8 percent per year rate of GDP
growth in 1980-85 was followed by a slowdown to 3 percent per year in 1985-88.
Inflation averaged 20 percent per year in 1985-88 due to excess money supply
created to meet public deficits (averaging 8 percent of GDP during 1985-88).
Iran formulated its post-war reconstruction policies and priorities in the
country's First Five-Year Plan (FFYP) spanning 1989/90-1993/94.
6.    The Government's major policy objectives in its FFYP include the
progressive elimination of financial imbalances, the decentralization of
economic decision-mak'ng and the privatization of state enterprises. To
eliminate budgetary imbalances, the FFYP proposed raising revenues and
containing expenditures, whereas, to eliminate imbalances in the external
accounts, it proposed rationalization of the exchange rate and the trade and



- 2 -
payments systems. The decentralization policy proposed devolving local
taxation and expenditure authority to provincial and town councils and
promotion of urban and industrial centers outside existing conglomerates. The
privatization policy required the state sector to sell off shares in various
enterprises.
7.    Plan implementation has proceeded smoothly, with economic management
improving markedly over the past three years. The most recent reforms have
included: the raduction of multiple exchange rates from seven to three, these
now being: the official rate (rials 701US$), the competitive rate (rials
600/US$) and the floating rate (rials 1400/US$); a large effective
depreciation of the rial for non-oil exporters; the removal of non-tariff
barriers on imports at the floating rate; the decontrol of most domestic
prices; the dissolution of price enforcement courts; completion of draft
legislation to revamp the tax system; increases in public utility rates; the
abolition of credit ceilings; the expansion of the Tehran Stock Exchange; and
Cabinet approval to fully divest 250 public enCerprises.
8.    The economy has been recovering steadily.  GDP grew 4 percent in 1989
and 10 percent in 1990; it is estimated to have grown by 4 percent in 1991.
The government (i.e., central and provincial governments) deficit came down
from 9 percent of GDP in 1988 to 2 percent in 1990. In 1991, despite lower
oil revenues, the government contained the budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP
for the fiscal year which ended in March 1992.
9.    The growth of net credit to the Government and that of broad money
declined between 1988 and 1990, helping to lower inflation, from 29 percent in
1988 to around 10 percent in 1990. However, a large depreciation of the rial
in January 1991, with price liberalization, pushed inflation to 18 percent
during the year. Iran's external accounts also improved in recent years such
that overall balances were about US$2 billion each in 1989 and 1990. In 1991,
the balance of payments turned unfavorable as oil prices fell, underscoring
the importance of export diversification for Iran to reduce its vulnerability
to oil price fluctuations.
10.   Over the medium term, there is considerable potential for growth in the
economy. The shift in relative prices towards tradeables would sustain
agricultural and industrial growth. The large gas reserves in Iran should
contribute to electricity generation, petro-chemical and metallurgical
industries. Real GDP growth in 1992-96 is expected to average 4 percent per
year.
11.   Medium-term export earnings ares projected to grow steadily, due to
increased oil and gas export voltmm.a, and the reform-induced increases in non-
oil exports. But import needs are expected to be high to enable Iran to
liberalize its economy and to undertake reconstruction and growth-related
investments. The country can be expected to finance up to 80 percent of
investments with national savings; the balance would need to be mobilized from
external sources.
12.   Iran's terms of trade are projected to decline in the medium term
averaging US$3 billion (3 percent of GDP) each year from 1992 to 1996.
Consequently, the external current account deficit could increase to US$6



-3-
billion (8 percent of GDP) in 1993 but is projected to decline to 5 percent of
GDP by 1996 and turn into a surplus two years thereafter.
13. Iran's medium- and long-term debt at the end of its fiscal year 1990/91
was estimated at about US$1.8 billion (1.5 percent of GDP). There were, in
addition, short-term debts and trade-related credits of between US$2 billion
(Central Bank estimate) and US$7 billion (OECD estimate). Using the higher
estimate of short-term debt, the total debt stock at the end of 1990/91 was
around US$9 billion (close to 8 percent of GDP); the debt service ratio in
1990/91 was about 3.5 percent. While the stock of its external debt will rise
as Iran undertakes reconstruction and other investments, it is expected that
the debt service ratio will remain manageable, provided it borrows for viable
projects, as well as manages its mix of financing for the public and private
sectors. Such a strategy will be important to sustain the country's future
creditworthiness. Based on its current low indebtedness, its export potential
and its exemplary payments records, Iran is considered creditworthy for IBRD
and other external borrowing.
14. Bank Country Strategy. Iran has been an IBRD member in good standing
since December 1945. The Bank began lending to Iran in 1957 and stopped in
1974 when the country's financial resources increased due to the 1973 oil
price increase. Between 1957 and 1974, Iran received 33 loans for projects in
agriculture, infrastructure, population and education. The Bank disbursed
US$1,023 million, virtually all now repaid, with US$32.24 million outstanding
at the end of March 1992. Iran joined the IFC on December 28, 1956. Through
the mid-1970s, seven Iranian companies obtained cumulative gross commitments
of US$42.5 million. All past investments of the IFC in Iran have been repaid.
15. Two years ago, Iran approached the Bank Group for assistance in
rebuilding the country's economy damaged during 1978-88 by the war with Iraq.
As the IBRD and IFC had been inactive in Iran for 17 years, the Bank agreed
with the Government to assess Iran's economic policies and conditions; its
expenditure and external capital requirements; and its financial and economic
prospects, including its creditworthiness for Bank Group and other external
borrowing.
16. While the economic assessment was in progress, a severe earthquake hit
northern Iran in June 1990. At special government request, the Bank approved,
on March 14, 1991, a US$250 million loan to Iran as an emergency operation,
which became effective July 3, 1991. Soon after, macrr%conomic and key sector
reviews, and an assessment of financial prospects, were completed and
presented in the economic report (9027-IRN) of July 30, 1991.
17. The Government's ongoing economic reform program is constrained by the
financing required to undertake the large backlog of reconstruction and
development expenditures. Its access to international capital markets
continues to be limited even though during the last decade Iran kept the stock
of its external debt within manageable limits and did not incur any major
payments arrears.



-4
18.   The major objectives of Bank assistance strategy in Iran are to: (a)
assist the Government to implement a sound economic reform program;
(b) support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Iranian economy and
human resources development; and (c) strengthen Iran's international trade
relations and access to capital markets. The assistance program would
involve: (i) investment lending for reconstruction and the rehabilitation of
physical infrastructure and human resources development; (ii) economic and
sector work to support economic and sector policy dialogue, and provide the
basis for lending operations; and (ifi) the mobilization of international
financial resources including the co-financing of Bank operations.
19.   The Project Area.  The proposed project is located in the central part
of the city of Tehran, an area of about 80 km2, and the low lying areas to the
south. The proposed project represents a part of a major program for
providing drainage to Tehran and its vicinity. It will benefit about four
million people residing in the project area, plus a transient population of
about two million -hat visits the business district daily.  It will also
benefit about 200 km2 oi agricultural land to the south (Shahr-e-Rey) and
south-west of the city, inhabited by about one million low income people.
20.   Surface runoff from intense flash floods, which occur several times each
year, accumulate on city streets and low-lying areas to the south. This
runoff results in severe traffic disruptions, high cleaning costs, extensive
damage to public and private property, the loss of stock and personal effects,
water logging and flooding problems, as well as endangers the lives of city
dwellers and visitors (deaths associated with flash floods have been
reported). The flooding of the southern municipal district (Shahr-e-Rey) is
considered the main cause of the in situ sewage disposal overflows, which
creates unhealthy conditions, and of the waterlogging, which threatens the
structural stability of buildings and underground infrastructure (telephone
and electricity).
21.   Project Objectives.  The project objectives are to:  (i) provide a
stormwater collection system to catch and divert flood waters away from flood-
prone areas for the protection of human life and property, (ii) transfer
appropriate technology for the construction of tunnels; and (iii) strengthen
the institutional capacity of the Tehran Municipality through technical
assistance for project planning and implementation, and for sound municipal
finance management. The project will reduce the health risks posed by sewage
overflows into streets and will minimize the water logging and flooding
problems in the low-income areas to the south of the city.
22.   Proiect DescriRtion.  The project consists of:  (i) an outfall drain
(Third Outlet) consisting of a 6.3 km tunnel, a 1.6 km open channel, a
stormwater retention reservoir, about four diversion structures and about 6 km
of pipe to convey surface waters from the city center to the Kan river located
to the south-west; (ii) a main drain (Khayam Main Drain) consisting of a 10.8
km tunnel and a 3.7 km pipe along the Khayam road in the town center for local
surface runoff drainage; (iii) inlet structures and lateral stormwater drains
to collect surface waters into tunnels; (iv) maintenance equipment and spares;
(v) technical assistance for specialized construction works (tunneling) and
construction management, for improving the financial planning and management



v5-
of the municipality; and (vi) acquisition of about 14 ha of barren land for
the construction of a retention reservoir and for pipeline easements.
23.   Proiect Cost and 2in8ncing.  The project has been estimated to cost
about US$95.6 million equivalent, of which about US$77.0 million equivalent or
about 80 percent, correspond to the foreign cost (Schedule A). Project
financing consists of a Tehran Municipality contribution of US$18.6 million
equivalent to cover the local cost plus a Bank loan of US$77.0 million
equivalent for the foreigni cost. Procurement and disbursement arrangements
are given in Schedule B.
24.   Project Management and Implementation.  The project will be implemented
by the municipality's "Technical and Development Executive" (TDE). The TDE is
controlled by one of the six deputy mayors responsible for the management of
municipal affairs. The TDE provides technical and development services for
the municipality, its various subsidiaries and for other appropriate
interests. Its Engineering and Development Organization (EDO), which is
responsible for construction management of municipal development activities,
will be responsible for project implementation. The Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) in the EDO Technical Department will be strengthened under the
project through technical assistance in the management of international
contracts, tunneling technology and overall management. Qualified expatriate
consultants familiar with tunneling construction and with Bank regulations and
procedures will be retained to assist the local consultant who will be
responsible for construction supervision. These arrangements are satisfactory
to the Bank. Project preparation is well advanced and the first group of
tenders will be issued in July 1992. The project will be implemented over a
six year period. The timetable of key processing e;ents is given in Schedule
C and the status of Bank Group operations in Iran is given in Schedule D.
Maps (IBRD 23587 and 23588) and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 10480-IRN dated
May 5, 1992, are also attached.
25. Project Sustainability. The project has been designed to ensure
sustaLnability. Structures have been designed to mitigate flood damage in
flood-prone areas, and sized to withstand the most severe hydraulic and
structural conditions. Provisions have been taken to ensure sound
construction methods and strict supervision for quality control. Provisions
have also been taken to introduce preventive maintenance to ensure a long
useful project life.
26.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Covernment of Iran (GOI) is
undertaking a major economic restructuring and reconstruction program to
correct economic distortions and to restore and upgrade infrastructure
neglected during the eight-year war (paras. 4 and 7) or damaged by natural
disasters (earthquakes and floods). In urban areas, government policy places
this responsibility upon municipal governments (para. 6). Municipalities,
however, are not wel. equipped to implement such a policy due to weak
administrative capacity for both project planning and implementation, as well
as for municipal services. Although recently enacted legislation will enable
municipalities to mobilize internal resources, financial assistance will be
required to cover foreign costs and to manage international procurement.



- 6 -
27.   The proposed operation will be the first of its kind to provide the
Tehran Municipality, in addition to foreign exchange resources, assistance in
project planning, design and implementation, managing international
procurement, as well as in the transfer of appropriate technology. The
proposed project will also assist in addressing the financial planning and
management, revenue enhancement and institution building needs of the Tehran
Municipality. This will be accomplished through technical assistance for
completing two studies being carried out by the Municipality. The first study
is reviewing the existing financial management system and will recomend
measures to improve it; and the second study is reviewing the sources of
revenue and will recommend options for streamlining and restructuring the
revenue base of the Municipality.
28.   Given the long hiatus in lending to Iran, and considering the urgent
nature of the project, the proposea operation will give the Bank an
opportunity to be responsive to GOI needs while simultaneously deepening its
knowledge of the urban sector in Iran.
29. Agreed Actions. Agreement was reached on the required technical
assistance for strengthening the financial management capacity of the Tehran
Municipality, as well as for project planning, design and implementation.
Agreement was also reached that the Municipality will take measures to ensure
that its revenues are sufficient to cover its recurrent expenditures,
including debt service and its contribution to the capital expenditure
requirements.
30.   .ivironmental and Social AsRects.  On the expectation that negative
environmental impacts from the project would be limited in extent and amenable
to mitigation, the proposed project was classified under environmental
category B at the Initial Executive Project Summary (IEPS) stage. An
environmental analysis carried out by consultants and reviewed by the Bank
concluded that the proposed project will have a positive environmental and
social impact and will protect cultural heritage in the flood-prone area. The
project will also reduce the health hazards posed by flood aftermath and the
risk to human life posed by flash floods. It will directly benefit about
45,000 low-income people residing in flood-prone areas who suffer substantial
material losses annually as a result of floods. There are no fauna and flora
habitats or known sites of archaeological value in the project area that could
be affected by the proposed works. Land acquisition is minor (about 14 ha),
and there will be no relocation of people. The Municipality will compensate
affected families based on legislation which provides for purchase at market
value; however, additional compensation in kind will be provided for hardship.
These arrangements are satisfactory to the Bank.
31. Benefits. The project will yield substantial economic benefits. The
economic rate of return of the project, based on the economy-wide shadow
exchange rate (Rls 920 per US Dollar), has been estimated at about 23 percent,
excluding such benefits as reducing the loss of human life, improving health
and protecting cultural property. Tangible economic benefits include:
averting losses of economic assets such as infrastructure and public and
private property; reducing agricultural losses; and minimizing disruptions to
traffic and economic activity. The project will alleviate poverty by reducing
economic losses in Shahr-e-Rey area (paras. 19 and 20).



32. Risks. The main risk will be potential delays in project implementation
which could arise due to the borrower's lack of acquaintance with Bank
guidelines and procedures, which is the result of the long hiatus in the
Bank's working relationship with the country (para. 15); this could lead to
protracted procurement resulting in slow project implementation. However,
this concern is being addressed by providing the necessary expatriate
technical assistance and by conducting Bank seminars on procurement,
disbursement and overall project implementation early in the project cycle.
Risks associated with floods, which may occur during construction, are being
addressed through proper design and construction measures and close
supervision. Risks associated with financial management programs being
developed by the Tehran Municipality are being addressed through the provision
of technical assistance to strengt'en financial planning and management
studies and ensure the timely implementation of the agreed recommendations of
such studies.
33. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
