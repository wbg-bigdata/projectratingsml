LILONGWE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT E'ROJECT, PHASE II
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project which would be the second phase
of the Lilongwe Agricultural Development Project (LADP) and for which an IDA
credit of US$7.25 million equivalent is proposed. In 1968 an IDA credit of
US$6.0 million (Credit 113-MAI) was made to Malawi for Phase I of the proj-
ect. The first phase has progressed satisfactorily, and current estimates
indicate that it will generate an economic rate of return of 11%, compared
with 9% estimated at appraisal. A second agricultural credit (Credit
114-MAI for US$3.7) was also made in 1968 for the Shire Valley Development
Project; this project has made good progress.
ii.       The LADP is an integrated program including land conservation,
agricultural extension, credit and marketing facilities, the provision of
water supplies, road development, farmer and staff training and the evolu-
tion of social and administrative structures capable of managing, maintain-
ing, and indeed improving upon it. In Malawi, where 90% of the population
is dependent on subsistence agriculture, the LADP is looked upon as a fore-
runner for similar programs, capable of accelerating the transition to cash-
oriented farming systems and increased farm incomes and national exports.
Malawi's ability to raise resources for development and reduce its external
budget support requirements is dependent upon its achieving increased
agricultural exports. By full development, the annual additional exports
from the Phase I and Phase II project areas would be about 78,150 tons of
maize worth US$2.50 million, and 22,800 tons of groundnuts worth US$4.10
million. Additionally, the production of beef for domestic consumption
and import substitution would be worth about US$0.30 million each year.
iii.      The program area comprises about 1.1 million acres and this would
become a single local Government administrative district when Phase II is
initiated. The Phase I and II project areas include a total of about 521,000
acres of arable land and a 161,000 acre-ranch, and about 52,000 farmers are
involved. The Phase II project would include development of the ranch,
construction of about 540 miles of roads, 1,700 miles of drainage ditches,
160 boreholes, and 14 unit service centers, all of which would serve some
240,000 acres of arable land, as well as the continuation of extension,
credit and marketing services throughout the areas developed under the two
phases.
iv.       Phase II project costs are estimated at US$8.6 million equiva-
lent. The proposed credit would finance 84% of project costs, covering
foreign exchange costs estimated at US$3.4 million, and 74% of local cur-
rency costs. The balance of US$1.3 million local costs would be met from
Central Government revenues and from program farmers who would purchase
some farm inputs for cash. The Government would onlend US$194,000 to the
Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) at 6% over 20
years for the construction of the 14 produce markets that would be constructed



- ii -
at the service centers and a fertilizer store. Project costs include
US$220,000 for the experienced staff needed to set up a Malawi Agricultural
Bank (MAB). These funds would be disbursed through the project authority.
Where practicable, project procurement would be by international competitive
bidding; goods obtained in this way would have a value of about US$1.62 mil-
lion. Goods obtained within Malawi would be subject to local competitive
bidding procedures. Retroactive financing amounting to about US$105,000
would be required for the initial development of the project ranch.
v.        The Phase I project is being carried out by a section of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR), headed by a program
manager, responsible to the Permanent Secretary through the latter's Chief
Agricultural Development Officer (CADO). While field management is excel-
lent, the long chain of command above it has proved unsatisfactory. For
Phase II, changes would be made to ensure the full support and cooperation
of Government agencies. To ensure ministerial coordination, Government would
set up a liaison committee of representatives from the Ministries most con-
cerned with the program. The program manager would be responsible to the
Under Secretary of MANR and quarterly and interim reports would be reviewed
by the liaison committee. Plans for continuation of extension and local and
technical support services after development is completed would be submitted
to the Association for approval by June 30, 1972. The borrower would imple-
ment the approved plans in accordance with a schedule which was acceptable
to the Association.
vi.       At full development the Phase I and II areas would include about
156,300 acres of maize, 104,200 acres of groundnuts, and about 3,000 farm-
ers stall-fattening an average of two beef animals each year. Average
annual net farmer incomes would increase by about US$74/annum. Direct
Government revenues, together with FMB operating surpluses generated by
increased crop production by program participants, would cover Phase I
and Phase II project costs by 1979/80, and would be sufficient to cover
program area extension services and debt service costs, thereafter. In
addition, estimated incremental Government revenue, mostly from consumer
taxes, would amount to about US$1.0 million annually at full development.
Based on current yield and price forecasts, the estimated economic rate
of return from investments in the combined Phase I and Phase II projects
is 13%.

LILONGWE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, PHASE II
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project appraised in this report would be the second phase of
the Lilongwe Agricultural Development Project and would be carried out by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) (see para 6.02).
1.02      The Lilongwe Agricultural Development Prolect is an integrated ag-
ricultural development program based on a plan prepared for the Government by
the Bank's Agricultural Development Service (ADS) under the supervision of the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. This plan recommended the improvement of
agricultural production on an area of about 500,000 acres in the central
region of Malawi through a program which included an integrated package of
soil conservation works, crop extraction roads, water supplies, marketing,
storage and credit facilities, and, in particular, a greater agricultural
extension and credit effort. In addition, a system of voluntary land re-
organization and registration of family holdings was included in the pro-
gram. The program was designed to result in the increased production and
productivity of food crops such as maize, as well as cash crops, including
groundnuts and tobacco, and, consequently, the development of a market-orien-
tated agricultural industry.
1.03      In January 1968, IDA approved a credit of US$6 million (Credit
113-MAI) to finance the first phase of the development project. During phase
I land conservation and road building have proceeded faster than planned,
while the supply of farm inputs and land registration have fallen behind
project targets (see para 3.19). Therefore, Government's Phase II project
proposals for a rate of development of 100,000 acres/year has been reduced
to 60,000 acres/year and project integration emphasized.
1.04      Development of the LADP area's livestock potential was not included
in the original plan. Livestock development has substantial potential, how-
ever, and consequently would form a component of the Phase II project.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of an IDA mission to Malawi
in September/October 1970, consisting of Messrs. Denness, Gold, Lowenstein
and Cole, and a mission by Mr. Stoneham to survey agricultural credit.
1.06      In addition to Credit 113-MAI, the Bank group has made one other
agricultural credit to Malawi; this was of US$3.7 million in 1968 for the
Shire Valley Agricultural Development Project (Credit 114-MAI), a project
with many similarities to the Lilongwe program. Progress on this project
has been good.

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Malawi, a landlocked country extending some 700 miles from north
to south, and 120 miles from east to west, has a total land area of about
36,000 sq miles, of which about half is cultivable. Its 1969 population
of about 4.4 million is increasing at more than 3% annually, and while the
average population density is 122 per sq mile, this figure is more than 250
per sq mile in the good agricultural areas, especially the central and
southern regions. About 90% of the population are dependent on subsistence
farming and obtain incomes less than Malawi's per capita GDP of about
US$52 a year.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.02      Principal subsistence crops are cereals (usually maize, the
staple food), beans and other pulses including pigeon pea, which is some-
times used for livestock feed. Substantial quantities of maize, surplus to
family consumption requirements, are marketed, part directly to shopkeepers,
and the remainder to the Farmers' Marketing Board (FMB). Except in years
of a national deficit - the majority of FMB's purchases are subsequently
exported.
2.03      Many farmers, particularly those in the Central Plains region,
grow groundnuts and dark-fired tobacco 1/as cash crops; like cotton, the
main cash crop of the lowlands, these are mainly for export.
2.04      Estimated contributisa by agriculture to GDP was K 93.2 million
or 41% in 1966, while the contribution of subsistence agriculture was 27Z.
In 1969 comparative figures were K 114.7 million, 37% and 24%, respectively.
Lne decline in agriculture's contribution has resulted from reductions in
quotas for smallholder tobacco (to avoid overproduct;ion) and to adverse
weather in 1968 and 1969.
2.05      Prior to 1967, the long-term growth of agricultural production was
achieved primarily by expansion of acreage. Because of the limited availa-
bility of suitable agriculture land, future growth is dependent principally
upon productivity increases, and a shift towards a more market-orientated
agriculture. The results of projects financed under Credit 113 (Lilongwe)
and Credit 114 (Shire Valley) and the Salima Lake Shore Project financed by
the Federal Republic of Germany, show that productivity gains are possible

and that farmers are responsive to cash incentives. Yields of maize, ground-
nuts and cotton, obtained by farmers fully participating in these projects,
have increased between 50% and 100% within the short period of two to three
years.
2.06      Experience indicates that significant improvements in productiv-
ity can be obtained by an integrated package program consisting of soil
conservation measures, improvements in rural infrastructure, a concentrated
extension and credit effort, and land reorganization and registration of
holdings -- the latter provides farmers with recognizable units of land and,
consequently, promotes long-term farm improvements. The success in Malawi
of the integrated project approach justifies what in 1968 was a departure
from the usual type of Bank/IDA agricultural project. The land-locked
location of the country has made it difficult and costly to connect prom-
ising agricultural areas with export evacuation routes; and the poor con-
dition of existing, mainly gravel, roads and low standards of vehicle
operation, make the timely support of agricultural inputs and export of
agricultural produce difficult and expensive. These conditions call for
the concentration of the development effort in areas where production
potential is high and attention can be paid to streamlining the transporta-
tion of farm inputs and exports.
III. THE LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
A. The Program Area
3.01      As shown by the map, the Lilongwe Agricultural Development Project
(LADP) area comprises some one million acres of the central plateau of Malawi.
The area was selected because it has the highest agricultural potential of
any region of Malawi, its population is receptive to change, the country's
main agricultural research and training facilities are within the area, soils
are satisfactory and permit good responses to fertilizers, rainfall is
adequate and reasonably reliable; and, while good agricultural land remains
uncultivated through lack of village water supplies, abundant supplies of
potable underground water at a depth of about 100 ft remain untapped.
3.02      General Description.  The original LADP area, as defined by the
Lilongwe Agricultural Development Area Order, 1967, consisted of about
500,000 acres lying to the west of Lilongwe town, the administrative and
trading center of the central region. Between its southwestern boundary
and the Mozambique border (see Map), there is the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve
and an area of lower potential productivity which would not be developed
under the project. For the second phase project, the program area would
be redefined to include a net addition of 260,000 acres of high potential
land, 116,400 acres of low productivity land and 161,000 acres of the
Dzalanyama Forest Reserve, for the phase II project ranch; a total of
1.0 million acres.



- 4 -
3.03      The LADP area, lying at an altitude of between 3,500 and 4,000
ft above sea level consists of gently undulating plains with slopes of up
to 5%, intersected with low-lying seasonal swampy areas, known locally as
Dambos. Annual rainfall is 25-43 inches, almost all falling between December
and March. Average temperatures range from 60°F in June to 74°F in November.
Soils consist of well drained yellow-red to red, clay to sandy loams which
give way to brown sandy clay loans near swamps. Dambos consisting of grey-
black clays cover about 30% of the area. The main soil types which are
slightly acid, normally contain adequate reserves of nitrogen, potash and
phosphates, but continuous cropping quickly depletes these reserves and
fertilizers are required to maintain economic yields. This combination
of rainfall, temperature and soils is suitable for intensive production of
maize, groundnuts and tobacco. Soil erosion is a problem but is controllable
through the construction of rainfall diversion channels and crop production
on properly aligned ridges.
3.04      Communications.  Lilongwe, the administrative center of the region,
is linked by a new paved road, financed under Credit 112, to Blantyre in the
south, and by a low standard paved road to Salima, the railhead to the port
of Beira in Mozambique (see Map). At present all heavy goods imported for
Lilongwe are railed to Salima and then trucked to their final destinations.
The final twenty miles of rail -- Chipoka to Salima -- are in poor repair;
speed is restricted and heavier types of rolling stock cannot be used. This
situation is aggravated by congestion of goods at Salima. Malawi Railways
have insufficient road trucks to carry goods out of Salima, and commercial
truckers are short of roadworthy vehicles. In view of the poor condition of
the Chipoka-Salima stretch of rail, the construction of the new road, Blan-
tyre to Lilongwe, and the rail link, Nacala-Liwonde, FMB have decided cor-
rectly to erect their new fertilizer stores at Liwonde.
3.05      Within the LADP area, existing roads do not provide adequate
access either to market centers or for the delivery of farm inputs to villages
remote from main roads. While a limited mileage of main roads is necessary,
the area's main requirement, which would be met by the program, is for feeder
roads connecting remote villages with markets and the program's service
centers.
3.06      Population and Crops.  The 1966 census showed that the average pop-
ulation density of the LADP area, excluding the ranch, was over 212 per sq
mile, more than twice the national average, and one of the highest in Africa.
Estimated annual population increase is about 3%. There are about 52,000
families, each with about five acres of crop. Average single family size is
five. In the 1969/70 season, the Phase I project evaluation unit (PEU) sur-
veyed 406,600 acres of the program area not yet covered by program develop-
ments. It found that 50% of the land was under crops, with maize on its own
covering 33% of cropped land, and in crop mixtures another 27%, that tobacco
occupied 9% and that confectionery groundnuts, which are becoming of increas-
ing importance, occupied 17% and 9% in pure and mixed stands, respectively.
The remaining 5% was under minor crops and other crop mixtures, including
beans, sweet potatoes, pigeon peas and cassava.



- 5 -
3.07      LADP area farmers are of Bantu origin, their basic unit being
the extended family which expresses itself geographically in the family
village. Village committees are evolving, and beginning to play an impor-
tant role in assisting authorities to demonstrate better farming practices,
and to organize activities which lead to the improvement of village life.
3.08      Land Use.  Aerial photographs show that the revised LADP area of
1 million acres (see para 3.02) includes in addition to the ranch (161,000
acres) and private estates (31,000 acres), 776,000 acres of good arable land
and 116,000 acres of agriculturally marginal land. The photographs show
also the following land use pattern: land not cultivable 30%, cultivable
15%, fallow 5%, and already cultivated 50%.
3.09      Few farm inputs are purchased, although the use of fertilizer is
increasing. All arable crops are grown on ridges; soil preparation, plant-
ing, cultivation and weeding are done with hand hoes. The number of work
oxen is increasing, but they are used mainly for carting, and the number
of ox-drawn ploughs and ridgers in use is insignificant. Harvesting, thresh-
ing and groundnut shelling are by hand. Crops are stored on-farm in mud
and thatch cribs in which grain storage losses are about 20%. Rainfall is
low after harvest and crop-drying presents no problem.
3.10      More than half of the Lilongwe District farmers own small live-
stock and over 80% keep poultry. About one in four owns cattle and the
number of animals stall-fattened for beef is increasing.
3.11      Land Tenure.  Land is cultivated under customary rights of usufruct.
Succession is matrilineal and a man acquires use of land only by marriage
to a woman who has land cultivation rights. However, since customary
marriages are neither monogynous nor necessarily lasting, families frequently
show no interest in making permanent improvements to the land, and are
only concerned with the immediate benefits to be derived from its use.
3.12      In recent years, this system has tended to change as farmers take
a much greater interest in educating and providing for their direct families.
To encourage this trend, Government, in 1967, enacted three laws enabling
the legal reorganization and registration of customary land, and the grant-
ing of ownership titles to individuals or to family groups. Since the enact-
ment of the laws, however, no land has been registered, mainly because it
is extremely difficult for an individual farmer's land to be clearly defined.
Progress is being made to overcome this problem through allowing, initially,
land registration by large family groups with the ultimate goal of individ-
ual registration.

B. Crop Marketing, Prices and Exports
3.13      The Farmers' Marketing Board (FMB) 1/, established when Malawi
became independent in 1964, is a statutory corporation wholly owned by the
Government; though under the general direction of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Natural Resources, it is autonomous in its day-to-day operations.
Details are given in Annex 1. ADMARC has a monopoly to purchase all major
crops grown on smallholdings at prices which it fixes; so far, however, it
has chosen to exercise this privilege only with respect to cotton, ground-
nuts and tobacco. Maize is dealt with largely through licensed traders
who purchase from the farmer in his village and resell to FMB at its central
depots.
3.14      The responsibilities of the ADMARC are comprehensive.  Apart from
the purchase, storage, processing and disposal of produce grown on African
smallholdings, FMB maintains a price stabilization fund, and stock food re-
serves to meet possible local shortages, and supplies agricultural equip-
ment and production requisites, operates groundnut and tobacco grading
centers, and a seed production farm.
3.15      Market System.  ADMARC operates permanent markets which have full
facilities for grading, weighing, buying and storage; and temporary or bush
markets consisting of a buying shed, enclosure, cash register, and spring
scale. About 600 markets are operated throughout Malawi, the majority of
them temporary. In 1969/70 the FMB operated 53 markets, 10 permanent, with-
in the LADP area; these purchased groundnuts 17,992 tons, maize 16,431 tons,
and tobacco 5,551 tons from the program and surrounding areas (see Annex 1).
3.16      In the LADP area, licensed traders are not permitted to operate
since at this time it would not be feasible for them to collect farmers'
credit repayments, and ADMARC has committed itself to purchasing all crops
throughout the program area in line with infrastructure development and
the provision of farmers' support services under the Phase I and proposed
Phase II projects.
C. The Program
3.17      The targets of the LADP as revised during implementation of the
Phase I project, full details of which are given in Annex 2, include:
(a) Detailed land use and conservation plans for the LADP
area, and provision of appropriate roads, soil conserva-
tion works, water supplies and markets.

(b)  Development of agriculturally suitable land now lying
idle and the better utilization of land now lying fallow.
(c)  Development of a 161,000-acre ranch to provide annually
at full development 200 tons of beef and 3,700 animals
for stall-fattening by program area farmers.
(d)  A tenfold increase in the marketable surplus of
maize, increased production of export groundnuts,
increased tobacco yields, and the increased produc-
tion of stall fattened cattle by program area
farmers.
3.18      Lilongwe Land Development Project, Phase I (Credit 113-MAI).  The
prolect partly financed by Credit 113-MAI (US$6 million) is the first phase
of the Lilongwe Agricultural Development Project. The credit provided funds
for developments on about 168,000 acres consisting principally of:
--   construction and maintenance of 1,400 miles of
rainfall diversion channels: 165 miles of crop extraction
roads, 125 boreholes equipped with hand operated
pumps, aerial photography, map preparation and
surveving required for farm allocation and regis-
tration, and the establishment of a suitably staffed
office to carrv out such work;
--   construction and equipping of eleven permanent markets
and a 8,500 ton crop storage facility;
provision of project management, staff training, ex-
tension, input supply, credit services, and evaluation
and review of project progress.
The project is being carried out by a speciallv established section of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and is being developed over
the period March 1968 through January 1972.
3.19      Progress has been good, physical targets will be completed by
April 1971, a year in advance of schedule and infrastructure development
has been initiated on a further 100,000 acres with IDA's approval. Develop-
ment of this additional area is expected to be completed by October 1971.
Extension work has been satisfactory but the supply of farm inputs on credit
has yet to reach the levels forecast at appraisal, principally because
project management wished to ensure high repayment levels in the first two



years. The flow of credit is increasing rapidly, however, and the overall
credit recovery rate of 97% is good. Yields are developing in line with
appraisal report estimates. Costs have proved to be within estimates, and
while disbursements were delayed due to administrative problems (disbursements
were US$2.4 million at December 31, 1970 against total project expenditures
of US$3.3), the recent correction of these matters has allowed most of the
backlog to be disbursed. During appraisal of the Phase II project, the
estimated economic rate of return from the revised Phase I investments was
recalculated as 11% on the basis of actual costs and estimated benefits,
compared with 9% calculated in 1968. Further details of Phase I project
progress are at Annex 3.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      Phase II of the Lilongwe Agricultural Development Project would
be carried out over a four-year investment period, 1971/72-1974/75. This
phase would involve:
constructing about 540 miles of crop extraction road,
1,700 miles of rainfall diversion channels and boring
and equipping 160 boreholes to serve an additional
240,000 acres of the program area;
constructing 14 service centers, each including a produce
market, a 450 ton fertilizer/seed store, and associated
offices and housing;
surveying, farm demarcation and reorganization, and land
registration over about 375,000 acres of the phase I and
phase II project areas;
continuing agricultural extension and staff and farmer
training services within the Phase I project area, and
extending such services to an additional 24,000 farmers;
providing seasonal and medium-term credit to Phase I and
Phase II project farmers by means of a revolving credit
fund operated by the project administration; and establishing
arrangements for cash sale of inputs to project farmers;
establishing a ranch to provide upgraded feeder stock for
program area farmers;
establishing a liaison committee to provide coordination
between various agencies of Government for project activities;



- 9 -
developing plans for continuing LADP services and for
maintenance of infrastructure after the development phase;
and
continuing a project evaluation unit.
B. Detailed Features
4.02      Roads, Soil Conservation and Boreholes.  The proposed schedule of
road, drainage ditch and borehole construction is as follows:
1971/72   1972/73   1973/74   1974/75   Total
Program Area Covered (acres)  60,000    60,000    60,000    60,000   240,000
Roads:   24 ft ditch to
ditch (miles)              75         75         75        75        300
16 ft ditch to
ditch (miles)              60         60         60        60        240
Drainage Ditch (miles)              423       423        423        423      1,692
Boreholes                            40        40         40         40        160
4.03      To facilitate LADP management and farm development, the LADP area
has been divided into units of about 20,000 acres; 14 units have been estab-
lished during Phase I, (I through XIV), and an additional 12, (XV through
XXIV) would be created and developed under Phase II. Within each unit up to
45 miles of crop extraction road would be constructed. Where such roads
would form part of the area's planned main road system, maximum road width
would be 24 ft, while crop extraction roads would have a maximum width of
16 ft.  Although a road width of 24 ft does not meet the 36 ft minimum width
required by the Ministry of Works, it would be sufficient for the levels of
crop production and farm input requirements which are expected to develop
within the program area during the next ten years. Should production in-
crease beyond present estimates, and roads become inadequate, widening
would not be difficult or expensive. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Government that LADP roads would be built to maximum widths
of 24 ft and 16 ft.
4.04      About 1,700 miles of Vee bottoTned rainfall diversion channels
would be constructed to prevent soil erosion by reducing run off to safe
non-erosive velocities. Ditches would have a 9 sq ft cross sectional area,
1:400 grade and a capacitv of 22.5 cusecs. They would be spaced generally
at 220 yd horizontal spacing, be a mile in length and about 100 acres of
arable land would be protected by each ditch.



- 10 -
4.05      To provide potable water for LADP area farmers, who now draw pol-
luted water from rivers and drainage channels, about 160 boreholes equipped
with hand pumps and surrounded by a protective concrete apron, would be
constructed. Pumps would be sited so that water would be within 3/4 of a
mile of most villages.
4.06      Service Center.  A service center would be constructed in each
unit. Each center would have a market where farmers' groundnuts and surplus
maize crops would be purchased, and credit repayments withheld from crop
sale proceeds, a 450 ton fertilizer/seed store, and the housing and offices
required for market and extension staff. Service center markets, and a
railhead fertilizer store would be constructed by the Agricultural Develop-
ment and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC), and Government would on-lend
US$190,000 of the credit to the ADMARC at 6% interest over 20 years, for
this purpose. Local shopkeepers would be encouraged to establish their
premises close to service centers, and they would be able to obtain official
planning permission for this purpose.
4.07      Land Survey, Farm Demarcation and Reorganization and Registration.
Aerial photographs of the LADP area would be taken and used to produce
1:5,000 contour maps. These maps would be used for planning rainfall diver-
sion channels, road network, layouts, and demarcating existing holdings.
After completing the physical layout of drainage ditches and roads, farmers'
holdings would be demarcated and existing boundaries reorganized to
straighten boundaries, compensate for use in road and drain construction
and to consolidate fragments. A cadastral survey would then be made to de-
marcate and record the new holdings and to be used as a basis of land title
issuance. During Phase I, surveys were unable to keep pace with other proj-
ect activities because of Government's difficulty in recruiting suitable
staff, and by October 1971 surveys will be about 213,000 acres behind other
project activities. Phase II would include sufficient staff and equipment
to complete surveys prior to land registration, over the following areas:
1971/72     1972/73     1973/74    1974/75
Project Year                 1           2            3          4
Area surveyed up to Farm
Registration (acres)          75,000     100,000      100,000     100,000
Further details are given in Annex 4.
4.08      To retain the integrated nature of LADP development and to ensure
that farmers are able to register their land, should they wish to do so,
Government has given an assurance that if project staff is unable to meet
land survey targets, surveys would be let to contract.
4.09      Extension and Staff Training.  During the first two and a half
years, after establishing a unit, one extension worker would serve 200 farm
ffmilies, and this would be reduced to one worker for 400 families during
ti.f following two and a half years.  This intensity has yet to be reached
in the Phase I units due to the shortage of trained extension workers and



- 11 -
management concentration on infrastructure development, but would be achieved
during the Phase II project development period within which extension services
would be extended to an additional 24,000 farming families. A livestock ex-
tension unit would be included under the project and would be responsible
for improving the program area herd, through improved disease control and
management, and for increasing stall-fattening of stock by program area
farmers.
4.10      Training for LADP staff and Phase I farmers is now being carried
out at the Project Training Center and at unit service centers. This would
be continued and extended to provide for the Phase II families.
4.11      The project evaluation unit (PEU), established during the Phase I,
would continue to operate field surveys within the LADP area. Surveys would
collect yield data for project evaluation. These data would be analyzed at
the computer at the Malawi Regional Testing Center.
4.12      Credit.  Proposed arrangements for credit and sales of farm in-
puts to Phase I and Phase II farmers are described in paragraphs 6.08-6.12
and in Annex 5. It is estimated that during the project period about 55%
of total input supplies would be provided on credit, the remainder being
sold for cash. Credit would be issued to some 5,000 Phase I and Phase II
farmers during year 1, and the number of credit accounts would increase by
about 3,000/annum, reaching an estimated total of 14,000 in the final Phase
II year.  Within the four-year development period a total of about K 1.25
million (US$1.5 million) would be issued on credit for an estimated 10,000
tons fertilizer, 1,700 tons of improved seed (see Annex 6) and for insecti-
cides.  Medium-term credit for maize shellers, tree seedlings for fire wood
and building poles, work oxen and ox-drawn implements would total K 126,000
(US$151,000) during the same period. Cash sales of seasonal inputs are
expected to total about US$1.44 million for the four project years for some
12,000 tons of fertilizer and 543 tons of seed.
4.13      Ranch.  A ranch of about 161,000 acres would be established in the
Dzalanyama Forest Reserve (see Map) to provide upgraded feeder stock for
stall-fattening by LADP area farmers. The ranch would be started initially
with immature zebu type animals purchased locally. These would be crossed
at first with improved zebu type bulls until a satisfactory animal health
program had been carried out when either approved Friesian bulls would be
imported or artificial insemination employed.
4.14      At full development, after 12 years, the ranch would produce
annually 3700 young stock for stall-fattening and sufficient culled
animals to give 200 tons of beef (see Annex 7).
4.15      Project Administration.  A liaison committee composed of senior
representatives of concerned ministries would be established to coordinate
the various program policies of Government agencies. The program manager
would be responsible to the Under Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Re-
sources. Further details are discussed in paragraph 6.01 of this report.



- 12 -
4.16      Credit After Project Development.  Malawi farmers at present re-
ceive agricultural credit under three ma4or, and four minor. develonment
projects. The countrv's development plans envisage a large increase -n tie
number of farmers receiving credit, but at present n^ central credit organi-
zation exists. There is an urgent nrnd for a centr-' credit agency to handle
farmer credits, and graduallv to take over the credit funct-ons of develop-
ment projects. By June 30, 1972 plans would be submitted for IDA approval
concerning development of such an institution (see para 6.05).
4.17      Ecology.  The ecology of the 'eveloped areas would be substan-
tially improved by Phase I and Phase II project activities. The slow
wasting of the soil by erosion would be halted by the construction of
drainage ditches and contoured ridges, and the soil structure would be
improved by the increased use of fertilizers. Timber planting would make
use of non-agricultural land, and would i-self assist to improve soil and
water conservation. The human environment would improve also through the
reduction of water-borne diseases as boreholes would be constructed to
provide potable water.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Phase II Project Costs
5.01      Estimated Phase II costs would total K 7.16 million (US$8.59 mil-
lion) of which the foreign exchange component is about K 2.80 million (US$3.35
million) or 39% of total costs.
5.02      Costs include a 10% price contingency on farm inputs, vehicles,
machinery, buildings, borehole and road construction materials and project
administration and operation works, 5% on livestock purchases, and 3% on
salaries of expatriate and local staff. Physical contingencies are not in-
cluded since Phase II estimates are based on Phase I experience and provide
for the maximum requirements permitted by the project. Farm family labor
costs are excluded since no cash cost is attributed to familv labor. Costs
do not include import duties, and are based on Government salary and wage
scales, up-to-date building costs, recent quotations given by suppliers of
vehicles, materials, and farm inputs. The breakdown of costs is detailed in
Annexes 5, 7, and 8 and summarized in the tollowing table.

B. Proposed Financing
5.03      An IDA credit of US$7.25 million would be made to Government for
84% of Phase II costs. US$3.35 million, or 46% of the credit would cover the
estimated foreign exchange costs. The balance of US$3.90 million or 54% of
the credit would finance 74% of local currency costs. The Government contri-
bution of US$0.94 million (11% of total Phase II costs) would be made from
budgetary sources, while the farmers' contribution of US$0.4 million (5% of
total project costs) would be made through the cash purchase of incremental
seasonal farm inputs. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Government that all funds needed for the Phase II would be made available in
advance and in block form based on quarterly estimates prepared by the
program manager. In addition to budget expenditures, the program manager
would be authorized to maintain separate revolving funds financed initially
from the credit for the procurement of farm inputs for cash and credit sales
to farmers. If Government requires payment of import taxes on items included
in Phase II costs, such taxes would be added to Government's financial con-
tribution to LADP costs. Phase II would be financed as follows:
K Million      US$ Million    %
Government                        0.78            0.94        11
IDA Credit                        6.04            7.25        84
Farmers                            0.33           0.40         5
Total        7.15            8.59       100
5.04      It has been necessary to start development of the LADP ranch
to prevent delays in livestock development that would be included in Phase
II. It is recommended, therefore, that the cost of ranch development begin-
ning October 1, 1970 up to the signing of the Phase II credit prior to
Phase II signature, amounting to US$105,000 be retroactively financed.
The existing project authority for Phase I has followed satisfactory procure-
ment procedures.
C. Procurement
5.06      Procurement of vehicles, machinery, equipment, fuel and incremental
credit supplied fertilizers valued at US$1.62 million would be subject to
international competitive bidding, except for individual tenders totalling
less than US$25,000. Phase II's building program of housing and stores
costing about US$900,000 would be too small to attract international
competition because of the small size of individual contracts. These would
be subject to local competitve tender. There is a sufficient number of
local contractors to ensure an adequate degree of competition. All Govern-
ment tenders, local and international, would be processed by the Central



- 15 -
Tender Board. The Board's procedures are satisfactory. Roads, boreholes
and rainfall diversion channels would be constructed under force account
by the project authority.
D. Disbursement
5.07      Disbursement of the IDA credit would be made against 88% of the
cost of categories of expenditure (Annex 9, Table 2). The IDA credit would
not include the cost of working capital for farm inputs to be purchased for
cash from the project authority. US$0.42 million would remain unallocated
and would be disbursed to meet contingency requirements. Expenditures would
be evidenced by contracts, shipping documents and certified records of
expenditure. Any surplus credit amounts would be cancelled. Estimated dis-
bursements of the credit over the four-year project period are shown in
Annex 9, Tables 1 and 2.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.08      LADP accounts would be maintained by the project headquarters
for all project expenditures, farmers loans and cash sales of inputs. In
addition, ranch expenditures and receipts, 1/ and the credit and cash sales
funds would be audited separately. The accounts would be maintained accord-
ing to the breakdown of project estimates in Annex 8. These accounts would
be audited annually by the Auditor General. An assurance was obtained during
negotiations that audited accounts of project expenditures would be sub-
mitted to the Association within six months after the close of the
financial year.
5.09      The Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC),
formerly PFB, would maintain accounts for funds on lent to it under the
project. Audit of these accounts would be carried out by independent auditors
acceptable to ADMIARC and the Association, and assurances were obtained during
negotiations that audited accounts would be submitted to the Association
within six months of the close of the Board's financial year.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Organization
6.01      Phase I is carried out by a section of the Ministry of Agriculture
andI Natural Resources (MANR) headed by a program manager (an expatriate
Agricultural Development Service staff member). The manager is responsible
1/   Including a valuation of fattening stock supplied to project farmers
on credit.



- 16 -
to the Ministrv's Permanent Secretary through the latter's Chief Agricultural
De^velopment Officer (CADO).  While project management at section level is
excellent, the chain of command above the manager leads to innumerable delays
and problems. With initiation of a second phase, changes are needed. Apart
from streamlining the policy making process, changes would be made with the
purposes of:
(a) obtaining the support and full cooperation of the increasing
number of Government: agencies involved in LADP operations:
and ensuring that after the conclusion of the development
phases, farmers would be provided with the support necessary
for the generation of estimated project benefits; and that
project infrastructure would be maintained satisfactorily;
and
(b) integrating technical program management with the political
administration of the program area.
6.02      The Project Manager would be made responsible directly to an
Undersecretary of MANR. There would be a Liaison Committee under MANR to
assist the Ministery in coordinating all aspects of the project, to review
quarterlv progress of the project and to ensure close cooperation of all
interested organizations. The borrower would establish this Liaison Committee
within 12 months of the date of the credit agreement. Members of this
committee would be representatives of the departments of MANR and of other
concerned Ministries, such as Treasury, Local Governments, Works, and the
Cabinet. Plans to provide support service in the program area subsequent to
the development phases should be formulated and activated well before the
end of Phase II of the project.
6.03      The Phase I and II projects involve heavy investments in infra-
structure - buildings, roads, conservation works, and boreholes. Buildings
are either ADMARC property and would be maintained by ADMARC, or housing and
offices which would be taken over by MANR. The maintenance of water supplies,
roads and soil conservation works are, in Malawi, the responsibility of
local Government Councils. Present program area taxation levels are inade-
quate to meet the financial burden created by program-developed infrastructure
without Central Government contribution. The increase in production and pro-
ductivitv in the program area would permit an increased level of taxation,
and propram participants should contribute to the maintenance costs of the
improved infrastructure development from which they benefit.
6.04      At project authority level, management would continue to be exer-
cised by the project manager at Lilongwe. Changes would be made at this
level, in particular the appointment of a financial controller and chief ag-
ricultural credit officer, and creation of five management divisions: Man-
agement Support, Development Services, Construction, Training and Developed
Areas (see Annex 10). Provision is made under the project for the employ-
ment of four Malawian management trainees. They would be employed as as-
s- stants to the Prolect Manager, Financial Controller, Evaluation Officer,
ar;d the Senior Conservation and Planning Officer, who initially would all



- 17 -
be expatriates.  The trainees 'ould work with each of the above officers in
turn, for six months, after which they would be considered for permanent
positions within the program. At the field level, the program would be or-
ganized on a unit basis; each unit would be about 20,000 acres and would be
run by a development officer.
6.05      The above arrangements for program management are not necessarily
final. At Lilongwe a continuous process of developing and testing systems
is occuring and by the time the final phase of development is completed, it
is anticipated that an administrative organization geared to the needs of
the situation would have evolved. An assurance was obtained during negotiations
that before June 30, 1972, Government would submit for IDA's approval its
detailed proposals for continuing LADP services, including plans for a central
credit agencv, and maintenance of infrastructure after the development phase.
Government would establish a time schedule for implementing these proposals
which would be acceptable to IDA.
B. Staffing
6.06      Problems are not anticipated in filling project senior staff posi-
tions, since the majority of staff emploved under the Phase I project would
be retained for Phase II. Government continues to be willing to appoint ex-
patriate staff when necessary, and there should be no difficulty in filling
the new posts created under the Phase II project. During negotiations, as-
surances were obtained that appointments to the posts of Project Manager,
Financial Controller, Chief Agricultural Credit Officer, and Ranch Manager
would be mutuallv acceptable to Government and the Association and would be
a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.  Also, assurances were obtained
that the terms of reference and conditions of employment of these officials
would be mutually acceptable to Government and the Association and would be
a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.
6.07      Phase TI middle level management posts would be filled by promoting
Phase I staff, and their positions together with new ones created under
Phase IT would be filled by Bunda 1/ graduates and prolect staff successfully
completing an upgrading course at Bunda. Junior extension staff would be
recruited from Colby 2/ and credit assistants would be secondary school
leavers who would receive in service training.
1/   The Agricultural Faculty of the University of Malawi offering a five-
year Degree course and a three-year Diploma course.
2/   School of Agriculture, offering a two-year course leading to a
certificate of Agriculture.



- 18 -
C. Farm Inputs - Credit and Cash Sales
6.08      Fertilizers, seeds, insecticides, fencing materials, maize shellers,
work oxen and implements, fattening cattle and tree seedlings would be made
available to program farmers by the project authority on credit and for cash.
The total value of such inputs is expected to increase from about K 400,000
annually in 1971 to about K 950,000 in 1974. About 55% of seasonal inputs
and all work oxen, implements, fattening cattle and tree seedlings would
be supplied on credit.
6.09      Individual credit accounts handled by the project would increase
from 5,000 to 14,000 during the project period, including a small number of
loans to registered creditworthy farmers' groups. Individual loans would
be given for not more than 70% of a farmer's seasonal credit requirement,
and it is expected that the average seasonal crop loan would decrease from
K 38 to K 31 as farmers' cash incomes increase.
6.10      After 1972-73, the sale price of all inputs would include a
minimum markup of 10% to cover handling charges; 10% interest on seasonal,
and 8% interest on medium-term loans would be charged.
6.11      Unit credit staff would maintain credit records, authorize credit
sales and collect bad debts, while extension staff would provide technical
supervision. As areas are developed each farmer would be registered at
the service center market through which he would obtain his input supplies,
and to which, if he received project credit, he would be obligated under the
terms of his loan agreement, to sell his produce. Credit repayments would
be collected by ADMARC market staff and paid into the credit fund at project
headquarters. ADMARC would be reimbursed the cost of debt collection, and
during negotiations an assurance was obtained from the Government that
ADMARC would collect such repayments at its markets. The policv of FMB not
licensing buying agents in the developed area, would be continued and an
assurance to this effect would be obtained during negotiations. Feeder
stock issued on credit would be collected subsequently by project staff,
sold at Government operated markets, and credit repayments deducted from
the animals' sale price.
6.12      Cash sales would be mainly for tobacco and groundnut fertilizers,
but some hybrid maize seed, fertilizers, insecticides and ranch produced
feeder stock would be purchased also for cash. All input sales whether for
cash or on credit would be handled by project marketing staff and the project
authority would be responsible for input procurement.

VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, FARMERS BENEFITS
AND GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
A. Yields and Output
7.01      The large number of farm families (about 52,000) involved in the
Phase I and Phase II makes variations in farm management standards, and yield
inevitable. For LADP calculations it was assumed that project farms would
fall into five maize and four groundnut production categories, details are
given in Annex 2. Category 1 maize farmers who would comprise 45% of all
maize farms by 1979/80, are expected to obtain average yields of about
3,000 lb/ac by using hybrid seed and fertilizer, while category 5 farmers are
expected to ignore project advice and assistance and thus obtain the present
program area average yield of 1,000 lb/ac.  The overall average maize yield
from the Phase I and Phase II project areas is expected to increase from
1,100 lb/ac to 2,000 lb/ac by 1979/80.  The feasibility of achieving such an
average is demonstrated by yields of 7,000 lb/ac obtained on trials in the
area and the average yield of 3,400 lb/ac obtained in the 1969 maize growing
competition.
7.02      Category 1 groundnut farmers using improved seed and good manage-
ment practices are expected to average 800 lb shelled nuts/ac and category
4 farmers, the present program area average of 500 lb. Average groundnut
yields are expected to reach 725 lb/ac by 1979/80.
7.03      Tobacco yields are expected to increase to 500 lb/ac by 1979/80.
Presently, they average 200 lb, but yields in excess of 1,000 lb are
Already obtained by better farmers following advice and using necessary in-
puts.
B. Markets and Prices
7.04      Except in drought years, it is expected that the Phase I and Phase
II project areas will produce an exportable surplus of 89,000 tons of
maize/annum from 1978 onwards. Export market prospects are good, and on
the basis of the Bank Economics Department analysis, it is expected that
the average long term price of maize, fob Malawi in terms of 1970 dollars,
would be K 27.0 ton (US$32.4).
7.05      The low oil content and large and uniform size of the groundnuts
makes them a well established export crop. It isassumed, therefore, that
the additional groundnut production of about 22,800 tons annually by the
two phases after 1979/80 would be absorbed easily by world markets, without
adversely affecting world prices. The long term groundnut price projection
in terms of 1970 dollars is K 149.0 ton (US$178.80) fob Malawi.



- 20 -
7.06      ADMARC, through its close contact with tobacco manufacturers abroad,
can adapt the production of its registered growers to potential demand.
Under these circumstances, it is assumed that the present price of K 0.29/lb
(US$0.35) would be maintained.
7.07      Beef production from the two phases is expected to increase to
some 1,714 sh tons annually from 1973 onwards. Demand data indicate that
this increase will be consumed locally (Annex 11, para 3), and that the
minimum long term real prices would remain at 1969 levels. The latter
averaged K 7.3/100 lb liveweight. Although a strong local demand for beef
exists, the key to successful marketing will be efficient operation of the
Cold Storage Company (CSC). CSC, while operating profitably, would be
critically short of working capital; as the CSC is wholly owned by Govern-
ment, an assurance was obtained during negotiations that Government
would ensure that CSC had adequate working capital to purchase project
fattened cattle.
C. Farmers Benefits
7.08      The variation in size and cropping patterns of program farms and
the different farmer responses to project activities preclude establishing
typical farm budgets, but cropping patterns are shown in Annex 2. The range
of individual net incremental incomes would be from zero in the case of the
unresponsive farmer, to about K 100 (US$120) per annum in the case of the
farmer fully participating, producing stall fattened cattle. The average
net income from a 10 acre holding, including subsistence maize consumption
of 2,700 lb/family for the 52,000 Phase I and II farmers, is estimated to
increase from about K 80 (US$96) at pre-development to about K 142 (US$170.4)
at full development. These increased incomes have proved satisfactory
incentives in the case of Phase I development.
D. Government Benefits
7.09      At present only poll taxes are collected from program area far-
mers, and there are no export or other taxes on production. Government
considers it impractical to raise the poll ta:es or to impose an income tax
on program farmers, and believes that revenues; to meet program expenditures,
including recurrent expenditures, can be generated by the existing tax
system, which is based on taxes on consumer gioods. The program cash flow
for the Phases I and II projects at Annex 12 shows that Government would
recover all program expenditures by 1978/79, and a surplus uf about K 570,000
(US$680,000) over the 20 year program life from margins on farm input sales,
ranch profits, profits on credit. operations and ADMARC operating surpluses
from handling program area production 1/. In addition, it is estimated that
1/   It has been Government's practice to use  \DMARC's (formerly FMB)
operating surpluses as a source of Go"-rnment revenue.



- 21 -
at full development the Phase I and Phase II areas would generate an annual
national income increase of some K 4.52 million (US$5.43 million) 1/, which
would result in government revenues from consumer taxes amounting to about
K 868,000 (US$1,041,600) 2/, and a total revenue for the program life of
K 12.32 million (US$14.78 million).
VIII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      Primary benefits from the Phase I and Phase II would be
the increased production of maize, groundnuts and beef and resultant net
annual foreign exchange earnings or savings amounting to about US$5.0 at full
development. Other benefits would be the demonstration of improved agricul-
tural techniques, and institutional development. Further benefits would be
generated by the construction of about 1,200 miles of road and 350 boreholes,
and the conservation of natural resources. The program would make a
significant contribution to Malawi's economic development through demonstrat-
ing a method of land reorganization and registration.
8.02      Eased on expected world prices for maize and groundnuts and the
programs primary benefits the return to the economy from combined Phase I
and Phase II project investments is 13% (see Annex 13). The calculation
excludes any allowance for family labor since project benefits have been
calculated on the incremental value of production, which would accrue mainly
from the increased use of non-labor inputs; while additional labor would be
required the amount would be small and alternative employment opportunities
are negligible. Therefore, the opportunity cost of the additional labor
has been taken as zero.
3.03      The rate of return has been tested for sensitivity at various cost
and revenue (price/yield) levels. The return is most sensitive to variation
in groundnut revenue since incremental groundnut production makes the greatest
contribution to project benefits. At constant project costs and revenues
from maize and livestock, a 20% reduction in groundnut revenue reduces the
rate of return by about 3%. A 10% increase in farm input costs with constant
revenue levels, reduces the rate of return by about 1%. Details of the
sensitivitv analysis are given below and the assumptions made are described
at Annex 13.
1/   Direct income of K 3.2 million (US$3.88 million) times a multiplier
of 1.4.
2/   Assuming a marginal revenue/monetary GDP ratio of 20%.

8.04      While the economic rate of return from investment in the Dzalanyama
ranch are included in the above, it has been estimated separately, also. The
estimated financial rate of return from ranch investments, taking into account
a residual value of the ranch herd, would be about 10%; additional economic
benefits would accrue from stall fattening by project farmers of ranch pro-
duced feederstock. Taking into account these benefits, the economic rate of
return on ranch investment would be about 14%.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained from Govern-
ment that:
(a) that project roads would be built to maximum width of
24 ft and 16 ft (para 4.03);
(b) should project staff be unable to meet land survey targets,
Government would let survey contracts on terms mutually
acceptable to the Government and IDA, (para 4.08);
(c) government would make available all funds needed for the
project in advance and in block form on the basis of
quarterly estimates prepared by the Program Manager (para 5.03);
(d)  government would submit audited accotnts on project expenditures
within six months of the close of the financial year, (para 5.08);
(e) the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation's accounts
on project expenditures would be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the government and IDA, and that copies of the
audited accounts would be submitted to IDA within six months
of the close of the financial year. (para 5.09);



- 23 -
(f) that before June 30, 1972, Government would submit for IDA's
approval. its detailed proposals for continuing project serv-
ices and maintenance of infrastructure (para 6.05);
(g) during the IDA credit disbursement period, appointments
to the posts of Program Manager, Financial Controller,
Chief Agricultural Credit Officer and Ranch Manager, their
terms of reference and conditions of employment would be
mutually acceptable to Government and IDA (para 6.06);
(h) ADMARC would assist the program management in collecting
credit repayments (para 6.12);
(i) no buying agents would be licensed by ADMARC to market
produce in the developed parts of the program area
(para 6.12); and
(j) the Cold Storage Company would have adequate working
capital to purchase project fattened cattle (para 7.07).
9.02      A condition of effectiveness and loan disbursement would be that
the Program Manager, Financial Controller, Chief Agricultural Credit Officer
and Ranch Manager had been appointed with terms of reference and conditions
of employment mutually acceptable to Government and IDA (para 6.06).

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Phase II Project
Crops, larketing, Prices and Exports
A. The Farmers Marketing Board
Responsibilities
1.        The Farmers Marketing Board (FMB)-/ is responsible for marketing
much of the agricultural output of the Lilongwe Project, and its facilities,
organization, viability, and efficiency are essential to the success of the
project.
2.        FMB was established when Malawi became independent in 1964, and is
a statutory corporation wholly owned by Government. Its Board of Directors
consists of 14 members; four are senior government officials, four are
members of Parliament, and one is the Executive and Chairman of the Board.
Although autonomous in its day to dav operations, RB is under the general
direction of the Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).
Responsibility for overall administration is delegated to an expatriate
manager, and a Malawian Regional Manager, located at Lilongwe, is responsible
for the Central Region.
r-FM is the main purchaser for export and domestic resale of all
important cash crops except for estate grown tea and tobacco. Although it
has the right to purchase all crops surplus to producer needs, in practice
it does not exercise this right, allowing farmers to barter among themselves
and to sell to local retailers.
4.        The reqponsibilities of FMR are comprehensive.  Apart from the
purchase, storage, processing and disposal of produce grown on African small-
holdings, they include the maintenance of a price stabilization fund, the
maintenance of food reserves to meet possible local shortages, the supply
at cost or at subsidized prices of agricultural equipment, the sale of
seasonal supplies and provision of seasonal credit to farmers, and marketing
petroleum.
Marketing System
5.       PTM  operates about 600 markets throughotut the country, (within
the program area there were 53 markets in 1969-70 as well as FMB's main

Development and Mlarketing Corporation.

Lilongwe Depot). FMB markets handled 17,992 tons of groundnuts, 16,431 tons
of maize, and 5,551 tons of tobacco harvested in 1969. 1/ There are two
types of markets; permanent and bush (temporary), and FME also licenses
traders to buy maize and to deliver thJ- to its main depots.  The permanent
markets have proper facilities for grading, storage, weighing and buying
commodities. Bush markets consist of a temporary buying shed, an enclosure,
a cash register and a spring scale. Purchases must be moved promptly from
bush markets to more permanent storage. Purchases by type of market and
the number of markets of each type are shown below:
Commodity       Permanent Markets       Bush Markets       Traders    Total

These data show that most maize moves through traders, most of the groundnuts
are bought at bush markets, and all of the tobacco is marketed at permanent
markets.
6.        Tobacco is delivered by farmers to FMB markets at a fixed price.
In past years, farmers have complained that the price has been too low. In
1969, the system was changed and FMB instituted a two-stage pricing system
for tobacco. A fixed price was paid the farmer when the tobacco was
delivered and after the tobacco was sold, an additional return was paid to
the farmer. Farmers prefer this latter system and are now filling all their
market quotas.
7.        Tobacco is graded by FMB and then moved to auction floors.  On
the auction floor, representatives of buying companies place their own
grades on the tobacco and bid against each other for the tobacco. The
purchaser then exports the tobacco.
8.        Surplus production of maize, which is not bartered or traded to
local shops, is purchased by FMB or its licensed traders at fixed prices.
Currently FMB pays licensed traders K 0.80 per bag (200 lb) more than it
pays farmers who deliver maize to its local markets. FMB supplies small
quantities of maize to local millers and operates its own mill. Foreign
trade data indicate that, in recent years, most of FMBE's purchases of maize
have been exported, as shown below. Export markets are principally Western
Europe and Zambia.
1/   1970 harvest data were unavailable at the time of writing.

Financial Condition
10.        In 1966, FMB made a small profit and its commodity stocks more
than doubled, rising from K 3.0 million to K 6.2 million.  FMB's books
show stocks at the end of a fiscal year as beginning stocks at the start
of the new fiscal year. The value of the ending stocks are deducted from
expenditures during the old fiscal year and the value of beginning stocks
are added to expenditures for the new fiscal year. In 1966, the increase
in groundnut stocks was valued at K 3.2 million or about the same as the
increase in the value of stocks of all commodities. Liquidation of these
groundnut stocks took about three years. Even though FMB started reducing
its stocks of groundnuts in 1967, it accumulated stocks of tobacco and
maize (Table 1). Carrying large stocks of commodities from one year to
the next is expensive and dangerous. There is a risk of sharp price
declines, as occured in 1967 for groundnuts (see paragraph 28), and certain
storage losses. In addition, interest charges (prime rate of 9% per annum
in Malawi) for carrying such large stocks are costly.

12.       One of FMB's responsibilities is to accumulate a commodity price
stabilization fund, which is held in the form of cash and liquid assets.
The management estimates that a stabilization fund of K 5 million is needed;
and this appears to be a satisfactory estimate. On March 31, 1970, FMB had
K 3.8 million in this reserve (Table 2). These funds are held as cash and
short-term investments.
13.       In 1970, due to low domestic production caused by poor weather
FMB imported 100,000 tons of maize at an average cost of K 6.65 per 200 lb
bag. It is now selling this maize at K 4.5 per bag. Losses on this import

operation together with FMB investments in large-scale direct farming, will
reduce the stabilization reserve to less than K 2.0 million by March 31, 1971.
14.       The FMB trading account shows research contributions, seed distrib-
ution costs, and losses on the Toleza Farm (seed production) of ME 122,845
for the year ending March 31, 1970 (Table 4). Of this total, losses on the
Toleza Farm amounted to ME 20,718. FMB intends to Improve the management of
this farm and is now trying to engage a management consultant to help improve
its financial situation.
15.       FMB's balance sheets show net assets of ME 4.5 million as of
March 31, 1970, compared with M¢ 2.5 million a year earlier (Table 5). On
March 31, 1970, current assets exceeded current liabilities by ME 40,897.
Cash deposits and cash on hand totalled ME 1.0 million and accounts receiv-
able were ME 0.7 million.
Maize
16.       Maize production in Malawi is estimated by FMB, the Department
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and the Economic Planning Division
at 1.1 to 1.4 million short tons per annum. Most of the maize produced in
Malawi is consumed within the country. A small proportion has been exported
in the past (see table below). Malawi will need to export larger quantities
of maize as supplies increase because of anticipated production
increases in the Lilongwe project area.

17.       In the past, Malawi has exported white maize to Europe at a
premium of up to 23% over prices for U.S. maize. This maize was used
mostly for distilling purposes. Some maize was exported to African countries
fetching export prices somewhat lower than these obtained in Europe. In the
future, premiums and discounts, depending on destination, are expected to



ANNEX 1
Page 6
counterbalance each other and the average export price will probably be in
line with these of US No. 2 and No. 3 maize cif European ports.
18.       Consistent quotations for Malawi maize, cif London, are not avail-
able, but prices for US No. 2 and 3 in 1975 are projected by IBRD at around
K 48.4 (US$58.08). Based on US maize prices, it is assumed that the farm
gate value of maize would be about K 20.0 per short ton for Phase II; about
the same as from 1968 through 1970 and about K 3 below that of 1967. The
difference being made up by K 21.6 for shipping costs from Malawi to Europe
and K 7.0 per short ton for internal marketing (see table 6).
19.       In 1969, Malawi's maize exports were 52,000 tons, compared with
total world trade in coarse grains of 43 million tons in 1968-69, including
a maize trade of about 29 million tons. World trade is expected to grow
because of an increasing demand for coarse grains generated by a growing
demand for livestock products. One projection of world coarse grain trade 1/
shows a growth in international trade of 3.5% a year or more from 1964-66
to 1980. This forecast indicates an increase in world trade in coarse
grains of more than 20 million tons from the 1968-69 level. Malawi should
be able to export its surplus at the world prices (quoted above) with little
difficulty.
20.       Normally, Malawi imports little maize - less than 500 tons per
annum in 1964, and 1966 to 1969. However, in years of crop failure, Malawi
has been forced to import more maize and in 1970, imports were about 100,000
tons, and in 1965 7,300 tons. Production of maize in the Lilongwe program
area is expected to increase sharply and because of improved production
methods the effects of poor weather conditions in the program area will be
lessened. Consequently, dangers of severe under-supplies should diminish.
The program would produce about 25,000 short tons of surplus maize in 1971-
72 rising to 83,000 tons in 1978-79 and to about 89,000 tons from 1978-79
onwards. If this surplus is exported at an fob price of K 27 per ton (see
Table 6), project export earnings from maize would increase from about
K 672,000 to K 2.4 million between 1971-72 and 1978-79 (Table 8). Net
export earnings are discussed in paragraph 26.
Groundnuts
21.       Groundnuts grown in Malawi are in demand for confectionery pur-
poses (cocktail nuts) and sell at a premium of about US$20 above groundnuts
used for oil and meal purposes. The demand for confectionery groundnuts is
growing stronger than the demand for crushings. It is unlikely, however,
that the premium will increase appreciably since importers will substitute

groundnuts used for oil crushing for confectionery purposes if the premium
increases. Consequently, prices for confectionery groundnuts are influenced
by price developments for all other groundnuts.
22.       Prices for groundnuts varied from K 122.0 per ton to K 157.2 per
ton fob Malawi as shown below.  The ITRD price projection for groundnuts, fob
Malawi, centered on 1975, is K 149.0 (US$178.8) per ton. Marketing costs
are about K 27.2 per short ton, leaving a net price of about K 121.8 per ton
or K 0.06 per lb. Such a price is about K 0.02 per lb higher than prices now
being received by farmers and reflect FMB profits from the marketing of
groundnuts. Costs of shipping groundnuts from Malawi to London are about
K 21.4/ton and the cif London price is expected to be about K 170.4/ton
(Table 7).

Implementation of Phase II of the Program, is expected to increase ground-
nut exports by some 23,000 sh tons to a total of 31,500 tons in 1970.
At an fob price of K 149.0 per ton (Table 7) gross export earnings
should rise to K 4.7 million by 1981 (Table 9). Net export earnings are
discussed in paragraph 26.
24.       Almost all of the tobacco produced on the Lilongwe project is
exported. Fire-cured tobacco is uused mainly for plugs, rolls and snuff.
These are products which are gradually declining in use.  On the other hand,
world production of fire-cured tobacco has declined in recent years (Table
10), thus stabilizing the market. The price projection for this tobacco
is about K 0.29 per lb fob Malawi. Marketing costs are around K 0.11 per
lb, leaving an economic return of about K 0.17 per lb. The price paid
farmers in 1969-70 was about K 0.08 per lb. The balance of K 0.09 per lb
goes to FMB profits.
25.   Production of tobacco on the Lilongwe Project is not expected to
increase above 5,500 tons. Therefore, no benefits from larger exports are
projected.
Foreign Exchange Earnings
26.        Net foreign exchange earnings are expected to increase sharply
because of larger exports of groundnuts and maize, under phases I and II
of the project (paragrah 24 and 21). Earnings are expected to increase
from K 0.3 million to K 6.2 million per annum between 1971-72 to 1980-81
(Table II). In 1970-71, the foreign exchange used by the project will
exceed its foreign exchange earnings by K 0.2 million. Net foreign ex-
change earnings from 1970-71 through 1980-81 will total K 37.3 million
(Table 11).
27.       Gross foreign exchange earnings of these phases of the project
are estimated to be between K 506,000 and K 7,092,000 per annum from
1970-71 to 1981-82. From these earnings, current foreign exchange ex-
penditures are deducted from K 744,000 to K 925,000 per annum. The ex-
penditures cover imported fertilizer, pesticides, equipment and materials
for development, expatriate salaries and allowances.
Conclusion
28.       When managed adequately, FMB is an efficient organization.
Sufficient funds result from its operation (about K 4.1 million profit
in the 1970 fiscal year) to finance expansion of marketing and storage
facilities required by larger production from the Lilongwe Program, 4.1
million cu ft over nine years costing K 1.22 million. Such profits are
also sufficient to provide a satisfactory stabilization fund. However,
the funds accumulated under FMB's operations are often siphoned into un-
economic investments. If such investments are made in the future, an
adequate stabilization fund will not be maintained and funds will not be



ANNEX 1
Page 9
available tc finance the needed expansion of marketing functions. Effi-
cient management is essential for the continuing success of the organiza-
tion and present management levels must be maintained if losses are not to
replace profits as they did in 1967, when management standards declined.
29.       Demand for the additional output of maize and groundnuts result-
ing from the Lilongwe Program appears to be sufficiently strong to
significantly expand the foreign exchange earnings of the country. The
economic benefits from this additional output will be quite important to
the future of Malawi.

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, PHASE II PROJECT
Export Market Prospects and Prices for Malawian Maize
1.        Malawi's competitive position as a maize exporter improved signi-
ficantly after the government purchase price guarantees for maize were
reduced (in dollar terms) in 1968 and 1969. Although FMB transactions in
maize were unprofitable during 1964-68, profits were earned in 1969 on export
sales. At recent and projected selling prices for maize in Malawi, maize
of this origin can be delivered to the United Kingdom and other important
markets at prices fully competitive with current and project prices for equi-
valent grain supplied by major exporters.
2.        Under a wide variety of defensible assumptions, imports of maize
and other coarse grains by Western African and West Asian countries are
projected to increase between 4.4-5.8 million tons by 1980, and Japan's
imports alone should grow by 6.5-10.4 million tons over the next ten years.
Although prospective increases in imports by Western European countries are
much smaller, Malawian white maize offered at competitive prices should
retain its share of 50-80 thousand tons a year of this market.
3.        During 1979-81, prices for U.S. No. 243 yellow corn, c.i.f.
London or Liverpool, are projected to average between $55-57 per short ton
(expressed in terms of 1970 dollars). Price premiums for white maize over
U.S. yellow corn in the United Kingdom are traditional and should continue.
These premiums should vary between 5-15 percent, depending on how much white
maize is offered for export by the Republic of South Africa, which is the
single large seller, and on the season of the year in which Malawi ships
its grain. Export prices (f.o.b. Limber) for both yellow and white maize
consigned to neighboring countries and Japan during the 1980's should compare
favorably with prices received on sales made to the United Kingdom.

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, PHASE II PROJECT
Atgriculture in the Program Area and Changes Expected
to Occur as a Result of Project Activities
A. General
1.        The major crops in the program area are maize, groundnuts and
tobacco in order of production volume. Tobacco production, however, is
limited by Government quota, and due to improved husbandry, yields are ex-
pected to increase, releasing tobacco land for alternative crop production.
2.        All villages have some cattle, but these and other livestock are
poorly managed.
3.        Cotton and rice are not grown in the Lilongwe program area.
Crops such as beans and sweet potato are grown on a minor scale as are fruit
crops such as mangoes and bananas.
B. Climate, Topography and Soils
Rainfall
4.        The Lilongwe Plain is situated 140 south of the equator and its
climate is influenced by its altitude (3,600-4,000 ft). Other factors in-
fluencing climate in the project area are the large expanse of Lake Malawi
about 75 miles to the east of Lilongwe, and the still higher altitudes,
7,000 ft and above, of much of the surrounding country to the west and
south. Annual rainfall varies from 25 to 43 inches. Ninety percent of the
rain falls between November and March. Early rains are heavy and can cause
serious erosion where soil conservation measures are not practiced.
Soils
5.        The predominant soils of the project area are red/brown loams,
varying in structure from clay-loam to sandy-loam. Shallow valleys, known
throughout Malawi as dambos, which are wet weather swamps probably formed
by colluvial deposits from surrounding ridges, make up about 25% of the
project area. The dambos are used for dry weather grazing by village cat-
tle herds but they are poorly exploited, and considered by Malawian agri-
cultural authorities to be vulnerable to erosion. However, controlled



ANNEX 2
Page 2
utilization of dambos, as envisaged on the Dzalanyama ranch, could produce
substantial benefits.
6.        Soils on the upper and middle slopes are generally deep, well-
drained and moderately productive. Levels of major plant nutrients are
adequate but maize and tobacco respond to nitrogen and phosphate fertiliz-
ers, particularly after several years of cropping. Although potash fer-
tilizers do not give economic responses at present, indications are that
nutrient levels are falling and potash would be required in the future.
Fertilizer recommendations for the project area are made by the agricultural
research station at Chitedze, situated in the program area, about nine
miles from Lilongwe town. Recent recommendations have included the appli-
cation of sulfur and boron; applications of 10 lb of sulfur per acre have
doubled groundnut yields in trials conducted at Chitedze.
Land Use and Cultivation
7.        Precise information on acreages and yields of crops grown is not
available. The Phase I Project Evaluation Unit (PEU) has been operating
since May 1969 and has collected sample statistics for one year's cropping
on the Phase I project area. These indicate that there are about 70,000
individual farm holdings within the 1,100,000 acres of the program area.
The average holding is 10 acres of which about two-thirds is cultivated.
Approximately 50% of the cultivated area is under maize and between 30% and
35% under groundnuts and tobacco. The latter have been changing: maize
acreage is remaining constant, but the acreage under groundnuts is increas-
ing gradually to about 30% of an average holding, while tobacco acreage is
falling to about 5%. The remaining 15% or 20% of the average farm is
planted to other crons, such as fruit trees and vegetables, with a propor-
tion in fallow.
8.        Cultivation is by hand, principally.  There is very little agri-
cultural machinery in use in the area, but under Phase I the use of ox-
drawn implements is being encouraged through the provision of medium-term
credit for the purchase of oxen and implements. This would be intensified
under Phase II.
Soil and Water Conservation
9.        When heavy early rains fall on cultivated but bare soil there is
a high risk of erosion. The Department of Agriculture has successfully
trained large numbers of farmers to grow their crops on ridges, but as these
frequently do not follow exactly the natural contours of the land, erosion
remains a serious problem. Phase I included the introduction of soil con-
servation measures, and the Phase I project area of 281,000 acres has been
divided into 14 operational units (I through XIV). In each 20,000-acre
nilt, 140 miles of diversion ditches have been constructed on the contour
at a total cost, including depreciation, of ME 1.5 per acre. These works
are built to strict specifications which have been modified as experience
L,s been gained during Phase I.  Further modifications would be made under
:liast 11, principallv: the depth of the ditch would be increased from



ANNEX 2
Page 3
1.5 ft maximum to 1.75 ft, the interval between ditches would be raised
from 660 ft to 750 ft, and the area protected by one ditch increased from
80 to 100 acres. In order to provide controlled run-off from the diversion
ditches, banked waterways are being constructed, about one for every 1,500
acres.
10.        To encourage and assist farmers to plant their crops along the
contours, parallel to the diversion ditches, marker ridges are put in by
tractor as guidelines from which farmers align their planting ridges.
These marker ridges cost about ME 0.25 per acre.
C. Crop Development
Maize
11.       Yields.  Phase I project development has not progressed far enough
to determine accurately the impact of project activites on maize yields.
Yield data for 1969/70, a drier than normal year, are the only available
statistics for a complete growing season. Analysis of this data shows
that program area farmers who received no benefits from the Phase I project
obtained an average maize yield of about 900 lb/ac (this compares with a
pre-development yield of 1,100 lb/ac estimated during Bank appraisal of the
Phase I project). Therefore, since 1969/70 was a particularly dry season,
a pre-development average yield of 1,000 lb/ac is used in Phase II calcula-
tions.
12.        Despite the poor weather in 1969/70, there is ample evidence of
excellent future yield potential. A maize-growing competition in 1969/70,
in which 46 farmers took part, was won with a yield of 6,800 lb/ac by a
farmer using hybrid seed and fertilizers. Competitors' yields varied from
an average of 3,000 lb/ac in Unit I to 3,600 lb/ac in Unit V. It is esti-
mated that implementation of the program will increase average maize yields
from a present 1,000 lb/ac to 2,000 lb/ac at full development in 1979/80.
The breakdown of the maize acreage by production categories is estimated to
develop as 'ollows:

13.       Category 1 farmers are expected to achieve average yields of 3,000
lb/ac through the use of hybrid seed at a rate of 22 lb/ac and 100 lb/ac of
a NP compound fertilizer at planting and 150 lbs N fertilizer as a top
dressing.  In the view of the high cost of seed and fertilizer, it is as-
sumed that this category of farmers would need credit to purchase these in-
puts.
14.       Category 2 farmers, who would purchase all inputs for cash, are
expected to obtain an average yield of 2,400 lb/ac. They would purchase
the same inputs as Category 1 farmers, except for nitrogen fertilizer, of
which only 100 lb would be applied as a top dressing.
15.       It is assumed that Category 3 farmers would purchase the same
fertilizer inputs as Category 2 farmers, but synthetic seed from the prev-
ious year's production or through a project exchange arrangement would be
used instead of hybrid seed. It is expected that average yields for this
category would be 2,000 lb/ac.
16.       Yields from Category 4 farmers would be about 1,100 lb/ac -- an
increase of 100 lb/ac, as only improved husbandry techniques would be used.
Category 5 includes those farmers who would not respond to program activi-
ties.
17.       The following table compares the proportions of land and produc-
tion within the Phase I and Phase II project areas that now (1970/71) fall
into the five categories described above, and the situation forecast for
1979/80 when development in these two areas would be completed.

18.        Storage Losses.  After harvest, farmers store what they consider
to be sufficient maize to last them until the next harvest; the remainder
only is sold. Storage methods are poor and losses from pests and other
causes average 20% of total grain stored. The project extension services
are introducing improved corn storage cribs and are encouraging the use of
pesticides through providing these for cash and on credit. This development
would be intensified under Phase II.
19.       Seed Supplies.  Most farmers participating in the Phase I project
have been supplied with synthetic seed of the variety Askari S7-37 and
this has been well received. It is expected that the use of synthetic
maize varieties will decrease significantly as better yielding hybrid vari-
eties become more available. A local hybrid, Bingo IH 11 has been devel-
oped at Chitedze and the University of Malawi's College of Agriculture at
Bunda, both within the Lilongwe program area. Production of hybrid seed
is limited currently, but Government has drawn up proposals for the estab-
lishment of a seed production association comprising the Ministry of Agri-
culture, Bunda College, Farmers Marketing Board (fMB) and commercial grow-
ers. These proposals appear satisfactory and provide that Bunda College
would produce most of the program's hybrid seed requirements. As an in-
surance, however, hybrid seed would be imported should Bunda not be able
to meet program demands. As yet there are no commercial seed growers in
Malawi, but the Government's seed production proposals (Annex 8) provide
for the encouragement of such growers and estimate that 200 tons of hybrid
seed would be produced by commercial growers in 1972 and 300 tons in 1973.
Groundnuts
20.       Yields.  Data collected by the PEU indicates that average shelled
groundnut yields in 1969/70 obtained by growers not benefiting from project
activities were about 575 lb/ac.  .;is compares with a Bank estimate of
500 lb when Phase I was appraised. It is estimated that average yields
during Phase II of the program would increase to 725 lb/ac. Until recently,
groundnuts have shown little response to fertilizer, but in 1970 the
Chitdedze Research Station recomumended the use of sulfur. Experiments
have given groundnut yields up to 2,000 lb/ac using 10 lb of sulfur/ac,
and it is assumed that farmers will obtain at least 40% of experimental
levels. The estimated proportion of land producing different levels of
groundnut production are as follows:

21.       Category 1 farmers would obtain yields of 800 lb/ac of groundnuts
by using sulfur and adopting improved planting and cultivation techniques.
Category 2 farmers would not use sulfur, but would benefit from improved
husbandry techniques only, while category 3 farmers would benefit from a
much smaller improvement in crop husbandry. Category 4 would comprise
those farmers not responding to program activities.

23.       All groundnut shelling is carried out by hand in Malawi.  A number
of mechanical shellers have been tested but all have caused excessive damage
to the large nuts thereby reducing their value in the confectionery market.
FMB is continuing its efforts to find a suitable mechanical sheller. If
and when their testing is successful, FMB would purchase and install the
equipment together with the extra storage that would be requirec. at program
area markets.
Tobacco
24.       In 1968 a quota system was introduced to prevent a repeat of the
eavy over-production of Malawi dark-fired tobacco and consequent slump in
prices that occurred in 1967. A new grading structure was introduced also.
And in 1970, prices received by project farmers ranged from K 0.18/lb for



ANNEX 2
Page 7
the top grade to K 0.03/lb for the lowest grade. The average price re-
ceived by farmers was slightly over K 0.11/lb, comparing well with K 0.08/lb
in 1969 and K 0.07 in 1968.
25.       The program area's overall tobacco quota of about 9 million lb
will be raised to 10 million lb during the implementation of Phase II.
Yields are estimated to rise from about 200 lb/ac, where farmers have not
received project assistance, to 500 lb/ac with the help of fertilizers and
extension services. As the number of farmers growing tobacco and the total
quota are not expected to change, the acreage under tobacco will fall and
probably will be replaced mainly by groundnuts.
26.       Fertilizer recommendations for tobacco are similar to those of
maize (see para 12) and are available on both credit and cash terms. Seed
is provided by FMB.
D. Reafforestation
27.       Tobacco production in the program area is dependent on the avail-
ability of firewood for tobacco curing. The Forestry Department estimates
that at the present rate of population increase, all sources of firewood
within the program area will be eliminated within 20 years; this estimate,
however, could be an exaggeration as data on firewood availability is
sparse. There are only about 5,000 acres of planted forest in the program
area, and the Forestry Department further estimates that meeting the timber
and fuel needs of the program area requires establishing the equivalent of
0.5 acres of forest per family, or 5,000 acres of forest per 100,000 acres
of land.
28.       Many reafforestation programs have been attempted in the past, but
few have been successful. Experience has shown that farmers will not plant
timber trees on land they cannot own, and also that they are not prepared
to pay for tobacco curing wood fuel, grown on Forestry Department or District
Council plantations.
29.       An afforestation program is required, but it must be carried out
as part of an integrated development program involving the registration of
family holdings. Therefore, the Phase II project would include provision
for family groups with registered land to obtain timber seedlings on a
credit basis from the project authority, and technical advice from project
forestry staff. Farmers would be charged K 0.02 per seedling.
30.       The timber species used would be Gmelina arborea, a quick-growing
species, grown in Malawi.  Gmelina is a good general purpose timber, pro-
viding termite-resistant house-building poles and fuel suitable for tobacco
curing. Plantings would be carried out on land immediately surrounding
villages and on holding boundaries in strips 3 to 4 trees wide.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
31.       The Forestry Department estimates that over an 8-year period, one
acre of Gmelina would yield about 170 cu yd of firewood or 1,000 building
poles.
E. Livestock Development
32.       There are no extensive grazing areas within the Phase I project
area and all livestock are integrated with the existing arable cropping
pattern of maize and groundnut production. During the wet season, cattle
graze non-cultivated arable land and the drier areas of the dambos, besides
utilizing any conserved crop residues; during the dry season, after ranging
over the harvest fields, they return to the dambos.
33.       Program area cattle numbers are estimated at 33,000, or about
27,000 livestock units, an overall stocking rate of 21 acres per livestock
unit. Weaning percentage is about 51% and mortality about 10%. Cow and
bull culling rates are very low, resulting in a high number of old animals,
low herd fertility and a high mortality ratio. Due to heavy sales of young
stock (about 13% of the total herd annually) the program herd growth rate
is very low.
34.       During Phase I, a small number of farmers have been encouraged to
fatten steers under a stall-feeding system using home-mixed concentrates
and crop residues. During 1968/69, 82 steers were stall-fattened, giving a
net profit of about ME 8 per head over an average feeding period of 140
days. This net profit is considered very satisfactory and has led to an in-
creasing demand for stall-feeder cattle. The program area is adequately
covered by Veterinary Department personnel and the Department contemplates
the introduction of compulsory dipping. In the light of adequate markets
and chilling facilities, an increasing local demand for meat and the
planned increase in crops and crop by-products, a component of Phase II
would be a planned increase in program area meat production.
35.       Phase II project organization would include a Livestock Unit pri-
marily responsible for improving the program area herd and expanding the
production of stall-fattened cattle. By the end of Phase II, the Livestock
Unit would include the following staff:
(a) Livestock Officer;
(b) Assistant Livestock Officers;
(c) Senior Veterinary Assistant;
(d) Veterinary Assistants; and
(e) 23 Unit Veterinary Assistants manning 23 new cattle dips.



ANNEX 2
Page 9
36.       It is estimated that the extension and disease control activities
of the Livestock Unit would increase the productivity of the program area
herd through increasing the weaning percentage to 60% and reducing overall
mortality to 5%. Credit would be made available under the Phase II project
to farmers wishing to erect fences for controlled grazing.
37.       Stall-fattening would be expanded and by 1983 it is estimated
about 6,000 animals would be fattened annually in the program area. Ini-
tiallv, feeder stock produced by local farmers would be purchased by the
project and allocated to selected farmers on a credit basis. Subsequently,
all fee(ler stock made available to program area farmers on credit would be
produced on the program ranch.  However, some farmers would continue to pur-
chase their feeder stock requirements privately.

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM PHASE II PROJECT
Phase I Project Progress
ProectAppraisal Report Targets and Actual Performance
e    .  .   _J1 5 .j_1a_&
1.        Project targets for physical development - buildings, road con-
struction, soil conservation, borehole drilling will be completed by April
1971, together with these same activities on an additional 13,000 acres.
In addition, these works will have been initiated in a further 100,000 acres,
and if development continues at its present pace, most development work will
have been completed on a total of 281,000 acres - 113,000 acres ahead of
project targets - by October 1971. The conservation and road building works
will be completed within total project costs. Land conservation, however,
lhas moved too far ahead of other project activities. This has not yet
created serious problems, but the future pace of land conservation will be
reduced and land allocation and farm registration extension, credit and pro-
vision of farm inputs, will be more closely integrated with land conservation.
Costs_ Loan Disbursements and Financing
2.        Most unit costs have proved to be within estimates despite a
general rise in costs in Malawi. Credit disbursements at December 31, 1970
totalled US$2.4 million compared with a total expenditure at the same date
of USS3.3 million of which about US$2.8 million is reimbursable under the
credit. The low initial rate of disbursement reflects early administrative
problems, but these have been corrected recently. Project management has
experienced no problems in obtaining funds from the Government for the project.
Project Organization and Administration
3.        Project organization with a long chain of command whereby the
program manager is responsible to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, through the head of the Agricultural
Development Branch (ADB), has proved unsatisfactory. Delays have occurred
in decision making, tenderin_, accounting and disbursement procedures.  The
program manager has found it difficult to keep accurate financial records,
and obtain a satisfactory level of coordination between the several minis-
tries involved in the development program. Proposals for improving program
organization are given in Chapter 6 of this report.
4.        Adequate numbers of qualified staff have been appointed to carry
out the project, except for land survey and demarcation, and to a lesser
extent, for credit and extension services. Government have been unable to
recruit sufficient surveyors, and consequently land survey is substantially



ANNEX 3
Page  2
behind other project activities.  Proposals to reme(iy this situation during
Phase II are given in para 4.07 of this report.
5.        Although delays occurred in anpointing sufficient credit and
extension staff, these problems are receiving attention, and will soon be
satisfactorily resolved as morc Malawian staff are apnointed.
6.        Project account. lhave been satisractorilv maintaine'. and although
au(lit of 1968/69 project '7iJ Farmers Mar'-oting Board accounts lave been
completed by the Auditor General, copies of these accounts have not been
received by the Association; audit of 1969/70 project and  MPt accounts has
not been completed.  Receipt by the Association of auclite,d aiccounts for
1968/69 and 1969/70 shouldl be a condition or Phase II credit negotiations.
Credit, Extension, ivaluation
7.        Althouglh, during Phase I most project activities have proceeded
satisfactorily, the supply of farrm inputs on credit has not reached the
levels envisaged during appraisal even though land development is ahead of
schedule. This has been due to managerent policy to restrict loans until
fanrers are well aware of repayment discipline, and to delays in setting up
the project credit organization. This situation has itproved, as farmers
have become aware of the benefits to be obtained thirough using purchased
seasonal inputs, and the need to repay loans promptly. Credit repayments
have improved steadily and by October 1970, 97% of loans given in 1968 and
1969 had been repaid.
8.        Extension work has been satisfactory, with Malawian staff forming
a substantial and increasing part of the extension force. Once over their
initial mistrust of the project, farmers have proved very responsive to
extension workers advice.
9.        The project evaluation unit, established to provide a continuous
survey of project progress and to provide planning data, had carried out
satisfactorily, field survevs within the program area. Survey results show
that actual yields before project development are close to appraisal esti-
mates, while post development incremental yields are consistent with appraisal
estimates.
Rate of Return
10.       During appraisal the rate of return for Phase I was estimated at
about 9%. However, in view of the 100,000 additional acres covered by proj-
ect land conservation works, a K .20 reduction in the farm-Rate price of
maize, and 20% increase in the fob value of groundnuts from K 124/ton to
K 149.00/ton, the estimated economic rate of return for Phase I project
investments is about 11%.

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, PHASE II PROJECT
Land Reorganization and Demarkation
A. Survey
1.        Under Phase I of the project finance was provided for equipment
and staff to enable the Survey Department to provide maps on which to base
the programs of roads and conservation, and to survey farm holdings prior
to land registration. The Department has had considerable trouble in ob-
taining suitably qualified staff and although the development program has
not been held up, the land registration program has been delayed substantially.
In addition, expensive photographic equipment bought with IDA finance is
standing idle due to lack of staff to operate it.
2.        Under Phase II finance would be provided for sufficient staff and
equipment to complete the surveys needed for land registration of over
100,000 ac annually from April 1972 onwards. Until April 1972, however,
the maximum area that could be surveyed would be 50,000 ac by which time
the survey program would be 200,000 ac, or two years behind infrastructure
development and the provision of extension and credit services. The backlog
of 200,000 ac has not seriously affected the project progress so far. It
would, however, have the significant project repercussions in the long term,
as the success of benefits initiated under the program would be mainly dependent
upon farmers being able to own their land in perpetuity, and therefore having
a much greater interest in maintaining and continuing improvements on their
land. In addition to a staff shortage during Phase I of the program, or-
ganizational and administrative difficulties have been encountered. During
the second phase, therefore, all survey would come under direct project
management control. Should staff shortages continue to limit survey progress,
an(d should the survey program fall more than 200 ,000 ac behind the develop-
ment program, surveys would be done on contract.
B. Demarkation and Registration
3.        Under Phase I it was intended that the ownership of each farm
hold'ing (about 10 ac) would be registered. This has proved to be impracti-
cable at this stage and holdings are being grouped by family (about 140 ac)
for demarkation and registration.  "Family" is defined as a Itconsanguineous
'roun within which marriage is not permitted."  The early problems of
educating the farmers to accept the principle of ownership rights have been
overcome and the demand for registration is increasing.

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM PHASE II PROJECT
Estimated Farm Input Use
Cash Sale and Credit Arrangements
1.        Prior to the Phase 1 project, purchased farm inputs were used
only on tobacco; while maize and groundnuts, the main subsistence and cash
crops, were grown by traditional methods using local seed and a long fallow
period. The more intensive methods of farming introduced by the program
rely heavily on purchased, seasonal farm inputs, and a substantial increase
in the use of these inputs would be essential to produce the improved
yields anticipated under the program. During the four years of the Phase I
project, about 5,500 farmers purchased seasonal inputs, mostly on credit.
During Phase II the number of farmers from the Phase I and Phase II proj-
ect areas, purchasing inputs annually would increase to about 25,000 in
1974/75. In addition, the project authority would supply feeder stock,
and some medium term farm inputs to Phase I and Phase II project farmers.
A. Maize
Credit Purchases
2.        During the Phase II project, credit would be given to Phase I
and Phase II project area farmers for hybrid maize production only, usually
in packages containing hybrid seed, fertilizer and insecticide as shown
under category 1 in the table below. Total acreage under hybrid maize
in this category, is estimated to increase from about 10,000 acres in
1971/72 to about 50,000 acres at full development in 1978/79 (see para
12, Annex 2). Category 1 farmers would obtain seed and fertilizer on
credit for two acres of maize, and probably they would grow in addition,
a third acre of maize using fertilizer purchased for cash, in quantities
shown for category 2 below:

Cash Sales
3.        During the Phase I project, farmers have de.monstrated an encouraging
willingness to purchase seasonal maize inputs. In 1969/70, 75 short tons of
fertilizer were purchased from the project authority, in addition some ferti-
lizers, seeds and other inputs were purchased from FMB stores. It is assumed,
however, that farmers who purchase inputs for cash probably would use less
fertilizer per acre than those obtaining fertilizer on credit, and would
therefore fall into categories 2 and 3 (para 2 above). The acreage of maize
under category 2 is estimated to increase from 6,500 acres in 1971/72 to
32,500 acres at full development in 1978/79, and the total area under category
3 from 8,700 acres to 11,600 acres over the same period (para 20, Annex 2).
Total estimated consumption of cash purchased inputs for maize production is
given in the following table:

4.        During the Phase IT project 50% of program area farmers coming into
the project would receive, for one of their first twqo years under the project,
improved groundnut seed and sulfur on credit. Thereafter, farmers would be
expected to purchase sulfur, for cash and to produce their own seed. The
normal groundnut credit package would include 120 lb of seed and 10 lb of
sulfur. Estimated groundnut input credit sales are shown below:

nut inputs would be purchased for cash and about 50% of the total groundnut
acreage would receive a sulfur application of 10 lb per acre. Estimated

C. Tobacco Inputs
Credit Sales
6.        During the Phase II project, increased tobacco yields would be
achieved by applying 20 lb of P 0 and 40 lb N fertilizer/ac. About half
2 5-
of program area tobacco farmers use fertilizers already, and as tobacco
growers are generally of a higher than average standard compared with other
program area farmers, almost all should be nurchasing fertilizers for cash
after about 4 years under the project. It is assumed that tobacco fertilizer
credit would be provided to 50 of tobacco farmers coming into the project.
Such credit would be available to each farmer only once, after which he
would be expected to pay cash for his input requirements. Estimated tobacco
credit sales are shown below. Tobacco input requirements are based on one
acre per grower and 520 growers to each 20,000 acre unit.

D. Stall Feeding
8.        During the Phase II project, the two main sources of feeder stock
would be the ranch and the existing program area herd. After 1971/72 only
ranch produced animals would be available to project farmers on credit. The
following table shows the source and estimated numbers of feeder stock that
would be financed by credit.

Medium-Term credit Inputs
9.        It is expected that the following medium-term credit would be
issued during the Phase II project.
1971/72   1972/73   1973/74   1974/75
Oxen and Implements              22,000     8,000    22,000    33,000

Total Medium-Term Credit         48,000    34_O0    46,00Q    52,000
The project would supply seedlings of a timber tree suitable for tobacco
curing fuel, on credit to selected farmers with registered land. K 14,000
is included under project extension services for each project year, to meet
seedling production and distribution costs, and therefore no financial pro-
vision is required for the credit fund.
E. Credit: Sales Organization
10.       During the Phase I project, the use of credit inputs has not kept
pace with other project activities. In 1968/69, K 4,800 (US$5,760) were
issued on credit for fertilizers and seed to 700 farmers. In 1969/70, al-
though the total amount of credit increased to K 7,000 IUS$8,400) only 650
farmers received credit. Credit repayment have reached the satisfactory
level of about 97%, and in 1970/71 4,000 loans valued at K 84,000
(US$100,8000) were made. Therefore, at the beginning of the Phase II pro-
ject the Credit Fund would have a capital of about K 93,000 (US$110,400).
11.       During Phase II, the number of loan accounts would increase from
5,000 in 1971/72 to about 14,000 in 1974/75 and about 25,000 in 1978/79.
The project authority would be able to handle the number of accounts satis-
factorily. However, growers would be encou.aged to purchase their input
requirements for cash, and credit facilities will be used primarily to
initiate growers to the use of new inputs. Throughout the program period,
credit sales are expected to account for about 55% of total seasonal farm
input sales, and would increase in value from about K 190,000 (US$228,000)
in 1971 to about K 715,000 (US$ 858,000) annually after 1979, when seasonal
credit would be used mostly on seed and fertilizer for hvbrid maize produc-
tion.



ANNEX 5
Page 9
Credit Manapement
12.       During the project period, credit policy and operations would be
controlled from project headquarters by a Chief Agricultural Credit Officer,
assisted by an accounting unit to maintain central accounts and audit Unit
records. After completion of the Phase II project development period, re-
sponsibility for agricultural credit in the program area would be assumed by
the Malawi Agricultural Bank (MAB), which the Government is establishing
(see Annex 8).
13.       Credit field administration would be based on the Units were a
Unit Development Officer would be assisted by two credit assistants to
handle an expected maximum of 1,000 credit accounts per Unit. Extension
staff, also under the Development Officer, would identify creditworthy
farmers and supervise the use of inputs. Credit assistants would be re-
sponsible for maintaining records, issuing supplies in cooperation with
marketing staff, and collecting bad debts.
14.       During Phase I, potential borrowers were identified by extension
officers and referred to local village committees for final approval. This
process, however, is slow and becomes unnecessary, once farmers are familiar
with credit discipline, and therefore, during Phase II, borrowers would be
identified by extension staff and assessed for creditworthiness by the
credit officers. In addition to individual loans, project farmers would
be assisted to form registered creditworthy groups, thus reducing credit
service costs.
15.       As program Unit areas are developed every farmer would be
registered at the market of the service center through which he obtains his
inputs, arnd under the terms of his loan agreement he would be obligated to
sell all his produce through the same market. To reduce the risk of farmers
selling produce outside their registered market, buying agents, licensed by
the Farmers Marketing Board would be excluded from the project area until
tlhe use of credit has become firmly established. The Unit FMB market
officer would he expowered to direct farmers' debts from produce sales,
and would provide repayment records to project headquarters.  Credit repay-
ments would be credited to the credit fund administered by project head-
quarters. The project would reimburse FMB for its debt collection service.
The above procedures would be followed for seasonal and medium-term loans
and would replace current procedures whereby credit fund records are main-
tained by the Chief Agricultural Development Officer.
16.       Stall fattening cattle loans would be managed by project livestock
and credit staff. Stock would be brought from the ranch to selected farms
by the livestock officers. Delivery records would be maintained by Unit
credit assistants. After 4 to 5 months, the livestock officers would collect
fattened stock and deliver them to Government for auction or to the Cold
Storage Company for slaughter. Farmers' debts including a 10% interest
charge would be repaid from sale proceeds into the credit fund, and the
balance paid to the farmers.



ANNEX 5
Page 10
17.       All seasonal crop credit would bear a minimum interest charge of
10% and a further minimum charge of 10% to meet project procurement and
distribution costs. Both charges on credit items would be used to finance
the credit fund. Medium-term credit would be issued at 8% per annum over
5 years, with a distribution charpe of 10%. In the absence of individual
land ownership security would be taken only on crops and chattels. Bad debts
are not expected to exceed 3% of total lending.
18.       Credit administration costs would increase from K 48,000 (US$57,600)
in 1971/72 to K 76,000 (US$91,200) in 1975/76, when all 26 units would be
developed.  Interest charges would exceed annual operating costs by 1077/78
after which the balance of earnings would be available for capital expendi-
tures.
Credit Fund
19.       Assuming that the credit fund contained K 93,000 (US$110,400)
from the Phase I project, an additional K 162,300 (US$194,760) would be re-
quired for the fund during the period project. After 1975/76 the fund
would be self-financing, and able to contribute to credit operating costs
in the program area. The estimate of additional credit funds required
annually during the project period is given in the Table below, where it
is assumed that only 50% of the ranch stall fattening stock would be sold
on credit to project farmers and that repayments for these would be made
to the credit fund.

20.       A Project Marketing Officer would be responsible for distributing
inputs. Stocks would be held and sold at the Unit level by a Unit Market-

would maintain stocks for credit sales, and would issue these after author-
ization by the Unit Credit Officer.

21.       The Project Financial Controller and headquarters accounts section
would assist the Project Marketing Officer on financial and accounting
matters relating to farm input procurement and distribution. The project
would charge 10% on cash sales to cover operating costs.
Storage
22.       Covered storage for 450 tons of fertilizer, and open storage
facilities would be provided at each Unit. These would be provided at each
Unit and would be sufficient for program area requirements until at least
1978/79, when annual consumption within all Units would reach about 460
tons of fertilizer and 350 bags of maize seed. A 2,500 ton railhead store
would be built to hold buffer stocks prior to delivery by road to Unit
stores. The opportunities to use produce stores for inputs would be limited
as sales would reach their peak at, or immediately after, harvest.
Cash Sales Fund
23.       Project headquarters would maintain a cash sale revolving fund to
finance input procurement. It is assumed that the funds capital would
increase from nothing in 1971/72 to K 408,000 (US$489,600) in 1974/75.
Fund details are shown at Table below.

G. Procurement
24.       During the Phase I project, FMB was responsible for fertilizer
and seed procurement. This arrangement has not been satisfactory and
project staff have taken on some procurement and distribution responsibility.
During Phase II, the project manager would be responsible for procurement
and distribution of farm inputs. This would insure that supplies would be
available when required by growers, and would increase the coordination of
sales with the extension and credit activities.



ANNEX 5
Page 13
25.       The project probably would purchase most of its supplies of
fertilizers from the FM , which is responsible for obtaining supplies for
Malawi. Fertilizers purchased in this way would be financed from the
existing balances in the cash and credit sales revolving funds.  However,
as FMB has found it difficult to comply with the Association's guidelines
for procurement, fertiliz:ers that would be reimbursed with the IDA credit
funds would be purchased directly by the project. The value of such pur-
chases would not exceed the total incremental value of credit input sales
for the project period, and would amount to about K 162,000 (US$194,000.
All other farm inputs would be procured by the project and financed from
the revolving funds.

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, PHASE II PROJECT
Summary Proposals for the Establishment and
Development of a National Seed Development and Production Association
1.        Government has proposed that a national association be established
for the development and production of improved seed. Initially, the
association would begin the production of adapted varieties of double-cross
hybrid maize. The activities of the association would be directed by a body
composed of one member from each of the interested parties: the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Bunda College of Agriculture, Farmers Marketing Board,
and commercial growers. The functions of each party would be:
(a) Ministry of Agriculture
(i) to coordinate the association's activities
with national seed requirements;
(ii)  to advise, propose, and initiate legislative
actions for efficient seed production;
(iii) to develop, within the Ministry, an agency
for controlling seed quality and purity; and
(iv)  to coordinate its own research with national
seed requirements.
(b) Bunda College of Agriculture
(i) to train qualified staff for the regulatory and
inspection services of the Ministry of Agriculture,
and for commercial growers;
(ii)  to continue plant breeding and testing, and the
production of initial stocks of parent material
for new approved varieties; and
(iii) to produce commercial seed from available parent
stocks during the period seed growing farms are
being established.
(c) Farmers Marketing Board
(i) to finance the development of seed production;
(ii) to market and distribute commercial seed; and



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(iii) to establish and manage a company which will
produce commercial seed in Malawi.
Development
2.        Until commercial growers are in operation, production would be met
by Bunda College and such other qualified growers as can be identified. Using
an estimate of one ton of clean seed maize produced per acre, projected
demands indicate that four farms would be required, with seed production
phased as shown below:

3.        While Bunda is producing seed commercially, its production would
be defined by a contract with the proposed Seed Development and Production
Association. To meet its production targets, Bunda would require financial
assistance of about K 12,000 for land clearance, equipment, and crop finance,
and it is proposed that a line of credit for this amount should be established
by FMB. Negotiations with the Ministry of Agriculture and FMB for the use
of equipment available within Malawi would determine the amounts of the
loan used. If the 1970-71 production targest are met, Bunda expects to be
self-supporting for the balance of its period of contribution to commercial
seed production.
Staffing
4.        Qualified staff, the requirements of which are shown below by
members of the Association, would be trained at Bunda.

Seed inspection posts would be staffed by degree graduates, while
the assistant farm managers would initially be diplomates in general agri-
culture, with Bunda providing specialized training during their third year
to prepare them for commercial seed production.
Organization
6.        The four seed farms proposed above would be developed by a company
managed and partly owned by the FMB. The company would have a general
manager, witlh one section manager and two assistant managers on each farms.
Accounting would be carried out by the FMB project accountant. The cash
requirement for the central management of the seed production company would
be K 30,000, and K 60,000 would be required for each of the four farms. A
total of K 270,000 would be required over the years 1971 to 1974.

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, PHASE II PROJECT
Dzalanyama Ranch
1.        During recent years the demand from Malawi smallholders for a
reliable supply of feedstock cattle for stall-fattening, using low-cost
maize, pigeon peas and crop by-products such as groundnut haulm has been
increasing. About 80 animals a year are fattened successfully by program
area farmers in home-constructed stalls. As part of the Phase II project,
161,000 acres of the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve (see Map) would be developed
as a breeding/feeder/steer ranch, to provide stall-feeders for program area
farmers.
Ranch Development Proposals
2.        The ranch would be located in the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve, which
is situated to the west and southwest of Lilongwe, some 30 miles from the
new capital city site, and adjacent to the Land Development Project. Its
western boundaries would follow the Malawi-Mozambique border on the south
and the foot of the Dzalanyama Range in the north.
3.        The ranch would cover 161,000 acres of natural Brachystegia-
Julbernadia forest reserve in the major catchment area of the Lilongwe
River. Rainfall is up to 60" per annum, with most occurring during the wet
season from November to late March. The topography is gently rolling with
some lightly forested areas. Some areas of heavier forest would require
thinning by ring-barking. The area has two distinct grazing categories:
(a) the southwest, covering 88,000 acres, of which 22,000
acres are "dambos" 1/ and 66,000 acres are lightly for-
ested. The area is generally wet and better suited for
dry season grazing than the remainder; and
(b) the northwest, covering 73,000 acres with 11,000 acres
of "dambos" and 62,000 acres of more heavily forested
well-defined ridges suitable for wet weather summer
grazing.
4.        Ranch management would control stock movement from the southeastern
dry season grazing areas to the northwestern wet season grazing areas. In
addition, firebreaks would be constructed and some ring-barking undertaken
1/   Broad, gently concave valley floors with hydromorphic soils and marsh
grassland.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
in order to improve the utilization of the forested areas.  These actions
would be inexpensive but would provide better grazing control and permit
a carrying capacity of about 1 A.U. to 14-15 acres.
5.        The ranch would produce:
(a) ranch-bred half-bred feeder stock for sale at about 30
months and weighing 650 lb liveweight to smallholders
within the Lilongwe land development area;
(b) ranch-purchased (at 12-18 months) immature steers for
sale to smallholders for finishing at about 30 months and
weighing 550 lb;
(c) surplus crossbred heifers for sale to smallholders for
milk production; and
(d) cull cows and bulls for sale to local butchers.
6.        The ranch would be stocked with immature stock purchased from the
adequate supply which exists in the central and northern regions. Initial-
ly, improved Zebu type bulls would be used on the ranch, but after an
adequate animal health program had been implemented, either approved Friesian
bulls would be imported from adjoining countries, or artificial insemination
techniques employed.
7.        Ranch development would be carried out over a four-year period,
with the majority of the investment in the first two years. The ranch would
be boundary-fenced (109 miles) to prevent squatter encroachment. Internally,
the ranch would be divided into 30 grazing units (each of approximately
5,000 acres). These units would not be fenced, but would be surrounded by
firebreaks (203 miles). In addition, nine fenced paddocks of between 2,000
to 3,000 acres would be constructed for breeding purposes. Sufficient dams
and boreholes would be constructed under the project to supplement natural
water supplies. Further investments would be made in housing, buildings,
dips, handling yards, machinery, equipment and breeding livestock. Young
steers purchased for growing out would be financed out of working capital.
Finance

year development period:

/1   Includes annual purchase of immature steers used for growing out prior
to stall fattening on project farms.
9.        Project contingencies include 10% for capital on-ranch investments
and operating expenses and 5% for livestock purchase. Ranch costs and
benefits details are shown in Tables 1 to 6 of this Annex.
Organization and Management
10.       The ranch would be managed by a qualified Ranch Manager experienced
in Central African ranching conditions. He would be responsible to the
Project Manager for all management and development aspects. The ranch would
not employ its own veterinary officer, but would receive whatever veterinary
services it might require as part of the normal extension services of the
Veterinary Department.
11.       A small committee comprising the Directors of Veterinary and
Forestry Departments would advise the Project Manager on all matters af-
fecting animal health, forest use and watershed protection. Since the
ranch would annex a substantial part of a gazetted Forestry Reserve, a
management agreement giving the Project Manager full control of the ranch
area would be signed between the Forestry Department and the project author-
ity.
Marketing
12.       At full development, the ranch would produce annually about 1,800
improved steers for fattening, 180 cull heifers, 690 improved heifers for
milk production or fattening, and about 750 cull cows and 20 cull bulls for
sale to the Malawi Cold Storage Corporation or local butchers. A satisfac-
tory marketing system and a market sufficient to absorb all project-produced
beef exists (see Annex 5).



ANNEX 7

Ranch Benefits
13.       It is assumed that ranch-produced animals would average the fol-
lowing liveweights and values when sold from the ranch:
Average     Price/    Average
Animal                                   Wei,- '_lb)  100 lb        Value
Cull cows, years 4-14                                 -          -          K40
Cull cows, years 9-16                                 -          -          K50
Ranch-bred steers and cull heifers, years 4-7        550        K8          K44
Ranch-bred steers and cull heifers, years 8-16    650            K8         K52
Ranch-bred heifers in-calf                           700         KS         K56
Zebu steers                                          550         KS         K44
Stall-fattening is expected to add values of K 9.4 for zebu animals and K
14.9 for half-bred stock. These values are net of feeding expenses, and
are equivalent to an average grading for half-bred animals midway between
the choice and prime grades (K 9.76/100 lb liveweight); and for zebu ani-
mals, prime grade (K 8.9/100 lb liveweight). During stall-fattening, live-
weight gains are assumed to average 1 lb/day, and the added value takes
into account an expected improvement in the grading of the animals from
the time they enter the stalls to the time they are slaughteredl.
14.       The economic rate of return from investment in the ranch over a
20-year period would be about 14%, taking into account the benefits from
stall-fattening (Annex 14, Table 6). The ranch's financial rate of return
would be about 10.0% for the production of fattening, dairy and cull stock.

/1   Though included here for beef, these may be used for dairy production
and breeding.
By year 1983, it is estimated that 11,160 animals would be slaughtered an-
nually in the program area. Of this total, about 6,000 animals would be
stall-fattened, providing 1,256 tons of choice and prime grade beef, or 73%
of the total increased beef production of 1,613 tons in the program area.

Demand
2.        During the 1960's, demand for beef in Malawi has been strong.
Malawi has imported beef (para 7) in every year since 1964 and in recent
years has consumed domestically all beef produced in the country.
3.        Demand indicators provide strong evidence for larger domestic
consumption of beef in the future, which would absorb all future production
from the program area. A recent consumer expenditure survey shows an in-
come elasticity for beef of unity. This, together with a minimum 3% annual
population growth rate without a Government birth control policy, and an
annual GNP growth rate 1/ of 7% over the next six years, is the basis for
this projection.
4.        In the unlikely event of beef production becoming surplus to do-
mestic requirements, beef would be exported. An IBRD appraisal report on
Zambia 2/ states: "By 1975, local supplies should rise to perhaps 80,000
head, which would require 85,000 carcass equivalents to be imported if
present trends in demand persist, which is considered likely by knowledge-
able Zambia agricultural planning officials." The Malawi Cold Storage Com-
pany considers also that there would be a good market for exporting beef
to South Africa. Therefore, if the domestic demands for beef would be
oversupplied some time in the future there would be satisfactory export
markets.
Sup pji
5.        The most reliable data on the number of cattle in Malawi 3/ indi-
cate that the national herd rose from 374,635 in 1961 to 498,000 head in
1969. This increase represented an average growth rate of 3.4% per annum.
On this basis, the national herd for 1985 is projected at 839,600 head and
compares with about 498,000 head in 1969 (Table 1).
6.        Data on the slaughter of cattle shows an average of about 9.4%
of the national herd were slaughtered from 1961 to 1966, when it suddenly
increasedl and stayed at a level between 11% and 11.5% -- averaging 11.2%
from 1967 to 1969. The apparent higher level was caused by a change in
reporting metlhods, which was instituted by the Department of Veterinary
IMedicine. The slaughter percentage since 1966 appears to be reasonably
stable and, therefore, the average slaughter percentage of 1967-69 is used
for projection purposes for this project. The average cold-dressed weight

per carcass of beef slaughtered in Malawi increased from 280 lb in 1966 to
292 lb in 1969, largely because of better animal husbandry practices, in-
cluding more stall-fattening. These developments are expected to continue
in the future and the Lilongwe Land Development Program would contribute to
a strengthening of the trend towards heavier carcass weights. By 1985 the
average national cold-dressed weight would be about 313 lb/carcass, and it
is expected that Malawi's beef production would approximate to the following:

7.        As shown below, beef imports from 1964 to 1968 were erratic, rel-
atively small, and largely of the better grades:

1970 (Jan-Aug)                                          90
Production of choice beef from the project would more than substitute for
these imports as the supply of such beef on local markets increased.
Prices
8.        Minimum prices for cattle within the country are controlled by
the purchasing operations of the Cold Storage Company (see para 10). In
1969, the liveweight prices paid by the Cold Storage Company averaged about
K 7.3 per 100 lb. These prices varied by grade as shown below:

For projection purposes, prices are assumed to be the same in the future
(in terms of constant price levels) as they were in 1969.
Marketing
9.         Cattle and beef marketing in Malawi is divided into two distinct
parts:
(M)  the Cold Storage Company (CSC); and
(ii)  local butchers.
10.        Cattle are auctioned at local markets and are bought either by
local butchers or by the Cold Storage Company. The CSC announces the price
it intends to pay in advance so that local butchers can always outbid the
CSC. Local butchers slaughter their animals and market the beef through
their own facilities.
11.       Cattle purchased by CSC are either put in holding grounds before
being trucked to a railhead, or taken directly to a slaughtering and chill-
ing plant. The CSC estimates that each animal loses an average of 70 to
80 lbs between purchase and slaughter. From 1965 to 1969, the Cold Storage
Company purchased about 22% of all cattle slaughtered in Malawi (Table 2).
12..      The Cold Storage Company is wholly owned by the Malawi Development
Corporation, which in turn is wholly owned by the Government. The paid-up
shares are ME 100,000. CSC's operations have shown a satisfactory profit
and in 1969, the trading profit was ME 59,814 and net profit before divi-
dends was ME 54,006, compared with ME 52,189 and ME 34,470 in 1968 (Table
3).
13.       The CSC had net assets of ME 342,292 at the end of 1969, compared
with Mt 281,793 in the previous year (Table 4), consisting of fixed assets
of ME 353,903 (Table 5), less net current liabilities of ME 11,611. On
balance, CSC appears to be well managed and is exnected to perform its
marketing functions satisfactorily.
14.       The Cold Storage Company's gross profit percentage to sales was
2(.55% in 196S and 23.84! in 1969.  At the samc time, direct expenditures



ANNEX 1 1
Page 5
in relation to the costs of sales declined from 12.25% in 1968 to 7.75% in
1969. The ratio of trading profit to sales increased from 8.94% in 1968
to 9.95% in 1969.  Debts in relation to assets are not burdensome.  In
1968, outstanding debts were 22.7% of assets and in 1969 they were 24.9%.
CSC is expanding its facilities and on December 31, 1969, it had capital
works in progress valued at ME 91,272.
15.       Many of the cattle purchased in Malawi are raised in the north,
while most of the demand for beef is located in the central and southern
parts of the country. Therefore, cattle must be transported to the areas
where the beef is consumed. At present, CSC moves the cattle to Blantyre
for slaughter and storage.
16.       Malawi has plans to construct a new capital city at Lilongwe.
As this city develops, the demand for beef at Lilongwe will expand. CSC
is already expanding its facilities to meet this demand and has an abattoir
and chilling plant under construction at Lilongwe which should be in opera-
tion early in 1971. Initially the Lilongwe plant will be capable of hand-
ling 15 carcasses a day (4,500 carcasses per annum), and is designed so
that the capacity can be easily expanded in the future. A refrigerated
truck is on order and carcasses will be trucked from Lilongwe to the large
storage plant at Blantyre, where there is sufficient capacity for carcasses
from Lilongwe, until more chilling capacity is constructed at Lilongwe. If
necessary, animals surplus to Lilongwe's needs would be transported live by
road to Blantyre.
17.       The Cold Storage Company purchases all skins and hides produced by
local butchers and markets them with those from its slaughter operations.
This commoditv is exported principally to Greece and Portugal. In 1968 and
1969, the value of these sales was ME 74,932 and ME 85,464, respectively.
18.       Although the company has shown reasonable profits during 1968 and
1969, the cash position of CSC is not strong. At the end of 1969, it had
a bank overdraft of ME 50,000 and had cash on hand and on deposit of only
ME 1,000. Most of its assets are in fixed assets, stocks and stores, and
accounts receivable (Table 4). However, since the company is wholly owned
by the Government, Government would be expected to ensure that the CSC had
sufficient funds to purchase all cattle offered for sale in the program
area at all times.
Conclusion
19.       Despite larger beef production from the Lilongwe Program of 1,613
tons by 1983, demand for beef within the country is expected to remain
strong. The increased production from the program would be easily absorbed
by domestic consumption and cattle prices would probably be maintained at
recent levels.
20.       The new abattoir and chilling plant being built by CSC at Lilongwe,
will be in operation shortly and is sufficient to cater for the estimated



ANNEX 11
Page 6
increase in beef production. Should production increase more than anticipated
this abattoir can easily be expanded. There is a refrigerated truck on order
to deliver beef carcasses from Lilongwe to Blantyre.
21.       Cash held by CSC is short and a more liquid position for the com-
pany is desirable. The operations of the company seem to be efficient and
the company's books show reasonable profits.

LILONGWE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, PHASE II
Rate of Return Calculation
1.        The annual costs and returns used in calculating the economic
rate of return for the project are shown in Table 1.  Based on the same
assumptions, Tables 2 and 3 show the rates of return for Phase I on its
own, and for the overall program of three phases. Annex 4 shows the
costs and returns for the ranch. A sensitivity analysis with respect to
changes in farm input costs and benefit levels assumed in the main calcula-
tion at 'Cable 1, is shown in para 8.03 of the main report.
2.        The following assumptions and data have been used in the
calculations:
(a) Project Area. In calculating the project's economic rate
of return, Phases I and II are combined to make up an area
of 521,000 acres of arable farm land and a 161,000 acre
ranch. When fully developed the arable land would include
about 104,200 acres of groundnuts and 156,300 acres of maize.
The calculation for Phase I (Table 2) takes into account
only 281,ono acres of arable land, and excludes all ranch
costs and returns; when fully developed this area would
include about 56,000 acres of groundnuts and 84,000 acres
of maize. The full program calculation (Table 3) takes
into account 581,000 acres of arable land and the 161,000
acre ranch; and
(b) Project Life. The project is part of an integrated develop-
ment program including conservation measures, infrastructure
for transportation and marketing, and extension, credit and
general administrative services. The effective life of these
developments will vary but in assessing direct benefits
the program's life is assumed to be 20 years. In subsequent
years a direct relationship between program investments and
production becomes tenuous. Phase II would run from midway
through year 3 to midway through year 7 of the 20
year program, and for the rate of return calculations,
benefits from the area developed during the first three years
of the program are included as are all the costs of producing
the benefits. 1/
1/   If such costs are treated as sunk, the rate of return for the project
is about 25%.

(c) Project Costs
(i) Project Administration. All project administration
costs, both capital and r- t'rrent arising from the
implementation of Phases I and II are included. They
take account of initial development costs 1/ and the
continuation of extension, credit and administrative
services over 20 years starting 1968/69 and ending
in l917/88. Residual values are included for
houses and machinery that have a remaining value
capable of producing benefits beyond the project
period 2/. A residual is included for the incremental
value of the ranclh herd.
(ii)  Iarketing Costs.  The prices used for produce are
net of marketing costs, and only a small element of
marketing capital costs is included in the calculation
for market stores constructed at unit centers.
Operational produce marketing costs are not included,
since these would be covered by the marketing differ-
ential allowed in the prices used for calculating
benefits.
(iii) Farm Labor. It is assumed that only family labor
would be used, and as benefits are calculated on
the incremental value of production, family labor
has not been costed. The incremental labor require-
ments necessary for the projected increases x7ould
be small as the major benefits would come from the
use of fertilizers, improved seed and improved farm-
ing methods.
(iv) Farm Inputs. These are costed for the program life
and are based on the amounts necessary to achieve
projected benefits. Any increase in consumption
of purchased inputs would be more than compensated
for by additional benefits. The cost of farm inputs
excludes subsidies and taxes. The 10% mark-up
charged to cover distribution and procurement costs
is excluded also as it is met by project administration
costs.
1/   Including actual and estimated costs for Phase I and estimated costs
with a contingency of 10% on capital, operational and maintenance costs
for Phase II.
2/  lWhen residual values are omitted, the economic rate of return is 12.9%.



ANNEX 13
Pago 3
(d) Benefits
(i) Maize. Maize yields and value of production are shown
in Table 4. A price of K 2 per bag, which corresponds
to the projected fob price net of marketing costs, is
used in the main calculation. At full development
average vields are estimated to be 10 bags per acre
and the incremental yield is obtained by deducting
the equivalent of 5 bags/acre (the predevelopment
average yield). Benefits derived from better farm
storage are also shown in Table 4, and are based on
a saving of two bags annually per farmer using
insecticides.
(ii) Groundnuts. Groundnut yields and value of production
are shown in Table 5. A price of K 122/ton corres-
ponding to the fob price net of marketing costs is
used for the main calculation. Average yields are
expected to rise from 575 lb of shelled nuts per acre
to 725 lb/acre at full development. The incremental
production includes doubling the current acreage through
the use of land released from tobacco production and
new land brought into cultivation. (Tobacco land will
be released because of increased yields under a locally
enforced production quota).
(iii)   Livestock.  Livestock benefits included in the main
calculation derive from total ranch production, and from
stall fattening steers and heifers from the ranch and
program area herds. The costs used for the economic
rate of return calculations for the ranch are shown
in Annex 4, while returns used for the program rate of
return calculation include sale proceeds direct from
the ranch and the added value from stall feeding ex-
ranch and project herd stock (Table 6). The stall
fattening margins used for both ex-ranch and ex-project
herd animals are net of feeding costs and vary for
half-bred and zebu animals (Table 7).
