Project Performance Audit Report
MALAWI LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
PHASE II
(Credit 244-MAI)
PREFACE
Credit 244-MAI for US$7.25 million was signed in May 1971.     It was
the second in an ongoing series of three IDA credits helping to finance the
Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP). The first IDA credit (US$6.0 mil-
lion) was signed in February 1968. A third credit (US$8.5 million) was signed
in May 1975. A performance audit report (PPAR) on the first project was
issued to the Board in October 1975 (No. 751).
LLDP started to attract widespread Bank interest in 1972 when it
was included as a case study in the Africa Rural Development Study, managed
by the Development Economics Department. The report of the case study was
released late in 1974, and was followed within 12 months by the audit of
the first project, by a follow-up evaluation for the case study, by a sepa-
rate report prepared by the Development Economics Department questioning
some of the findings of the earlier three reports, and, finally, by a project
completion mission staffed by the Regional Office. A monitoring and evalua-
tion capability was developed within LLDP in 1969, making this one of the
few programs in the Bank's portfolio with several years of monitoring experi-
ence and explaining some of the interest in LLDP.
In terms of lessons for the Bank, this is one of the more important
of the smallholder projects in its portfolio. Nevertheless, the intensity of
recent reporting, including issue of a PPA on the first project little more
than a year ago, persuades OED not to mount another full audit at this time.
Also, the controversial topics will not be clarified until more years of
farm performance have elapsed. The project completion report (PCR) for the
second project, which forms the bulk of this performance audit report, brings
the most important issues in LLDP up to early 1976, when the PCR was finalized.
The audit of the third project will be the occasion for another in-depth
review by OED.
The short audit memorandum was based on a review of the three
appraisal reports, the earlier ex-post evaluative reports, correspondence
touching upon those reports, separate studies of two other Malawian special
rural development activities implemented at Shire Valley and Salima in the
same period as Lilongwe, and the PCR. A two-day visit to Lilongwe in
March 1976 provided an opportunity to discuss with Government and LLDP staff
the draft audit report. The PCR is judged in the light of the other material
and comments received to present a good discussion of the project. The audit
memorandum focuses on four subjects which follow from the substantial body of
literature. The assistance of Project staff, farmers, and Government officials
who provided data and responded so readily to questioning of the PCR and audit
missions is gratefully acknowledged.

MALAWI LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
PHASE II
(Credit 244-MAI)
HIGHLIGHTS
The audit reviews progress during the second of three phases of
the Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP), the oldest of Government's
four major area development schemes. Beginning with preparation in 1966,
the Bank has been closely involved in the Program and has now committed a
total of US$22 million in three separate credits. The Program, one of the
first "integrated" rural development schemes, is more complex than most
because the construction of physical infrastructure and delivery of ferti-
lizer/seed packages was preceded by land survey and registration and other
tenure reform. Phase II consolidates progress in the phase 1 area and
extends LLDP activities to an area of about equal size. When phase III,
begun in 1975, is completed in 1978, LLDP will cover almost one million
smallholder acres and over 109,000 families.
The Program through phase II is considered to be successful, but more
so with respect to changes and innovations introduced to the farmers and in Gov-
ernment policies and services than with respect to the original productivity
objectives. The Bank, which for three years has been looking closely at this
experience for lessons of relevance to other integrated programs, has shown
concern for the lag in the rate of farmer adoption of the high yielding crop
packages, the leading edge of the Program according to the appraisal report.
That concern has generated fruitful discussion of the costs and benefits of
yield measurements and of the role of LLDP's special Evaluation Section.
The following points may be of particular interest:
- The impressive evidence of progress and its interpretation
(paras. 5-9 and PCR paras. 3.06-3.10)
- Changes in crop yields and their limitations as indicators
(paras. 6-7 and PCR paras. 3.02-3.04)
- Major efforts in extension and other forms of farmer
training (PCR paras. 2.07-2.10)
- Controls over credit repayments and the near absence of
delinquency (PCR paras. 2.11-2.14)
- Impact of price changes on fertilizer use (PCR para. 2.15)
- Delays in recruitment, promotion and localization
(PCR para. 2.21)
- Efforts to improve the project evaluation system
(PCR paras. 2.22-2.24)






Project Performance Audit Memorandum
MALAWI LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
PHASE II
(Credit 244-MAI)
1.        The Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP) grew out of a pilot
exercise begun in 1965 with British aid. Discussion with the Bank started
at the same time. The first project was prepared the next year by ADS
staff connected to the Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa, and appraised,
along with the proposed Shire Valley agricultural development project, in
1967. The Government was at the same time finalizing plans for a third
"integrated" agricultural development project at Salima, with German aid.
The three projects were to be run by separate units under a new office -
the Agricultural Development Branch - in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources (MANR). (A fourth project, partly financed by the Bank,
was started at Karonga five years later.) A credit agreement for US$6.0
million (Cr. 113-MAI) was signed in February 1968; the credit was closed,
fully disbursed ahead of schedule, in August 1972 (Project Performance Audit
Report No. 751, dated 5/23/75).
2.        The second phase, the subject of this Report, was appraised in
1970 as a direct sequel of the first phase. This phasing had been antici-
pated in the original plan, but the area covered by LLDP was to increase
even more than in that initial design. The most important innovation of
the second phase was to introduce livestock activities - a state ranch
and facilities for smallholder fattening of feeder stock from the ranch -
to what had previously been an exclusive crop orientation. An agreement
for a credit of US$7.25 million was signed in May 1971, became effective
in August of that year, and was closed, fully disbursed, on schedule in
March 1976.
3.        That five-year implementation period was intercepted by several
studies organized in the Bank outside of the Regional Office. LLDP's
importance is partly explained by the fact that it included since its
inception many elements of "integrated" rural development activity. It
involved Bank staff in planning for integrated activity long before the
latter became fashionable; it is the oldest program of the type in the
Bank's portfolio; and it offers for review eight years of implementation
experience. Its interest to the Bank is also explained by its Evaluation
Unit, a small section, said to be understaffed at the supervisory level,
which has unexpectedly found itself in the spotlight of the international
development community with a reputation as being one of the most important
experiments to date in farm level monitoring and evaluation (the work of
the Unit is discussed in PCR paragraphs 2.22-2.24). The several studies
of LLDP have provoked debate over the meaning and significance of the



- ii -
collected field data, some of which has never been analyzed, so that LLDP
is at once one of the best known and one of the more controversial among
the Bank's rural development projects.
4.         The Program will ultimately cover about one million acres of the
plateau west of Lilongwe town, now the capital of Malawi. The area is the
breadbasket of the country with an estimated population of 109,000 farm
families. The dominant objective of LLDP has been to increase yields and
production of smallholder maize and groundnuts, on expanding acreage, while
increasing yields and maintaining production levels for tobacco on a reduced
cropped area. The leading edge of the crop program, as discussed in all
three appraisal reports, has been the maize package, a mix of a (then) new
"Askari" synthetic variety, fertilizer, credit and effective extension. The
maize package distinguishes Lilongwe from Shire Valley and Salima, lowland
areas where the programs emphasized cotton and where maize played a much
less important role. All three areas were rainfed, but conditions in the
Lilongwe area are superior to the other two and the Lilongwe smallholders
include the most progressive in the country. The economic rate of return
to projects I and II strung together was estimated at appraisal in 1971
at 13%.
5.        LLDP is much more than a maize fertilizer program.     It includes
the construction of approximately 40 unit centers, rural road improvements,
conservation works, investments in health posts and boreholes (water for domestic
purposes), organized extension, organized input delivery and crop purchasing
systems, etc., all as described in the PCR. Although in the area as a whole
the yield performance of the three crops has been variable and generally well
below expectations, and although the volume of fertilizer sales on credit
has fallen short of targets (especially, but not only, because of the
increase in the price of these chemicals in 1974), the improvement of hus-
bandry practices and yields on adopting farms and the creation of new
physical infrastructure are apparent to observers. Moreover, the program
projects an image of prosperity and vigor (see PCR paragraph 3.07).
6.        OED will add four comments to the discussion of the PCR.     The
first is that LLDP's image of success is related less to signs of progress
toward original crop and rate of return objectives than to other desirable
improvements - increased farm consumption, new shops and other rural non-
farm investments, experience in the administration of rural programs,
training of Malawians for service on other schemes, etc. - which,
although implicit as long-term goals, were not spelled out in this
appraisal. It was the means to those ends which were specified in the
first appraisal, and these targets were unambiguous; to intensify farm



- iii -
practices in order "to raise the yields of food crops, especially maize and
groundnuts".I/ The infrastructure was to be strengthened in order to ensure
the widespread adoption of the food crop packages. This concept is echoed
in the appraisal report of the second project. Except for the beef fattening
activity, all rates of return analyses for the second project are tied to
quantified estimates of yield increases on the average farm within the proj-
ect boundary; all supplementary expenditures are justified in terms of the
support they bring to the food crop production and marketing systems.
7.        Early data suggested that yields of adopting farmers had been
lagging, but Government believes now that those farmers are catching up to
the forecasts. Nevertheless apparently only about half the farmers expected
to adopt the high yielding packages have done so thus far, and average yields
in the area therefore fall considerably short of projections.2/ The relia-
bility and significance of the yield and adoption data have both been challenged,
partly because of the high incidence of home consumption and smuggling. But
the point is that LLDP cannot yet be called a success by appraisal standards
on the basis of existing evidence, and the Region does not consider it so.
1/ Appraisal Report, January 3, 1968, page 2:
"A new Agricultural Development Branch has been established within
the Department of Agriculture to assume responsibility for major
agricultural development schemes in Malawi. The Government's agricul-
tural development policy is concentrated on improving the production
of the main existing smallholder crops. Two major development schemes
are being launched to increase the yields of cotton, the main export
crop. The rapid growth of population and the imminent threat of loca-
lized domestic food shortages, however, require greatly intensified
efforts to raise the yields of food crops, especially maize and ground-
nuts, which are most economically grown in the Central Plains near
Lilongwe, the commercial hub of the populous Central Region.
Past experience, based on successful pilot schemes, indicates that inten-
sification is best supported by an integrated package program, on a
scale which is large enough to be effective but still manageable. Such
a program would consist of soil conservation measures; improvements in
the rural infrastructure; cultivation of remaining unused land; an
intensive extension and credit effort concentrated in a well-defined
geographic area in order to accelerate the use of modern inputs; and
land reorganization and registration of holdings, which would provide
farmers with recognizable units of land and thus promote long-term farm
improvements and sustain the results achieved in the short run."
2/ The PCR's updated yield estimates (PCR para. 3.02) are below those given
in the last Bank evaluation of Lilongwe (June 1975), which, in turn, were
higher than and used to challenge those of two earlier reports (September
1974 and May 1975). Substantial yield shortfalls are reported also in the
Shire Valley and Salima projects, especially for the maize components. The
PPA for Shire Valley I (No. 895) says there was no progress at all in maize
productivity.



- iv -
8.        Emphasis has been given in some other Bank reports,however, to the
broader benefits of LLDP, postponing an assessment of husbandry improvements for
several years when the ettects ot the erratic rainfall pattern of the early
1970s will have less influence on the averagesl/and when the adopter/non-
adopter ratio will have stabilized. Also, it is argued that since the costs
of securing accurate and meaningful yield estimates are high, LLDP and the
Bank may have to settle for proxy indicators or for the other signs of
increased economic activity and smallholder prosperity. This view was
pressed on OED at MANR, which said it was prepared to accept yields lower
than appraisal estimates (provided other program spinoffs remained high) and,
therefore, was reluctant to exhaust the funds of evaluation units chasing
after elusive yield estimates.2/ OED sees a danger, however, in bypassing
the husbandry standards of appraisal. It is possible to be fooled by the
physical appearance of input and market systems which are developed to sup-
port new crop technologies. Program monies can buy those roadside appear-
ances. If the underlying technical transformation of the farm enterprise
is not successful, either the one predicted in the appraisal reports or a
substitute, those appearances cannot be maintained without continuing sub-
sidy from outside the food crop economy.
9.        To date, one still must accept the conclusion of the audit of the
first project that no convincing evidence is yet available to repudiate or
to confirm the economic viability of the investment undertaken. MANR says
the same thing - that none of the information on yields, production and
sales adequately measures the output effects of the obvious improvements
in crop husbandry. Officials have a gut feeling that there has been an
important increase in production due to the project. But it cannot be
confirmed. The economic rate of return is not updated in the PCR; the
project authority has not recalculated it either. Since the cost schedule
1/ The early appraisal missions guessed wrong on the incidence of bad
weather. The first appraisal report states: "the annual rainfall is
reliable, reducing the risks that accompany the use of fertilizer by
smallholders in less fortunate areas."
2/  MANR also suggested that the Bank's insistence on improvements in the
measurement of yield and other crop variables reflected the Bank's interest
in drawing universal lessons from LLDP, an objective which Malawi must con-
sider a luxury and hopes will attract external support. MANR does not
intend to ignore the output record. But it would like to discover a
methodology which can use the cheaper input measures as a fair and ade-
quate proxy for output. It looks to the Bank for advice on methodology,
both to find the surrogate input indicators and to measure the "other"
benefits.



was completed roughly on schedule, changes in the rate of return will hinge
on shifts in the benefit schedule. If we accept the argument that adopter
yields are now on target but that the rate of adoption of the full package
is half as fast as expected, and assume therefore that the quantity of incre-
mental crop production is and will continue to be about two thirds the apprai-
sal level, then under these conditions, and holding all other factors constant
(and ignoring other benefits), the rate of return for phases I and II combined
would fall from the appraisal figure of 13% to about 8%. The latter figure
allows for price changes,both for the relative increase of maize prices in
Malawi in the years after appraisal, and for smuggling of Lilongwe maize into
Zambia and Mozambique, where prices are at least twice as high.
10.       The second point is related to the first.   It is easily conceivable
that a dynamic development process has been generated in the LLDP area, pre-
sumably induced by LLDP, but that it is not dependent on the maize and ground-
nut packages per se. The implications are intriguing. They could mean that
the alleged core of the Program, the high yield maize fertilizer package and
the extension and credit services that are linked to it, is essentially irrel-
evant to the growth process that has been observed, or at least that it served
as no more than an instrument for bringing available human resources together
and for loosening the civil service system sufficiently to bring good talent
in the Ministry quickly through the ranks to management positions. In ways
that have not yet been explained, the growth process may be attributable to
the roads, to the dynamization of extension activities, to the backward and
forward influences exerted by the new market facilities, to the jobs and
incomes created in the construction period, etc. The new maize and ground-
nut technologies undoubtedly play some role in the process, but may not form
the leading edge except as resource mobilizer. Other packages may have
served the same purpose. Credit, or extension,may not be essential to it.
The point to be made is that the link between the signs of prosperity and the
food crop packages has not been made, and in fact would appear to be weak.
That leaves a host of interesting questions to be answered about the mech-
anism of development in Lilongwe. The PCR hints at another interpretation
of the process, that labor and land resources have been freed by the partly
successful maize and groundnut packages and it is the uses of those extra
resources that is fueling the growth process (paragraph 3.04). Thus, though
there is a basis for confidence that the LLDP is moving in the right direc-
tion, not enough is known to say how and why.
11.       And this suggests a third point to be made.   The hard pressed Eval-
uation Section probably does have a special role to play. It has a data
base, especially the collection from three consecutive years of intensive
farm sample survey, which will serve as a baseline and early program record



- vi -
against which new information can be measured at the end of the decade and
important growth hypotheses tested. The PCR argues that the Bank and the
Government should find a way to capture the important micro detail of the
surveys, because they offer a rich resource for subsequent ex post analyses
(paragraph 2.24). The audit supports that view. The monitoring work should
continue as well.
12.       Fourth, and finally, one hopes that the micro detail of the Lilongwe
farm studies ultimately will help identify the main factors limiting the rate
of adoption and efficacy of the new crop technologies. The forecast yield
and benefit schedules presented at appraisal are not unreasonable, at least
for maize and groundnuts (the tobacco yield estimates look optimistic).
In 1970 the appraisal team reported that research trials in the Lilongwe
area with the Askari maize synthetic yielded 7,000 lb/acre, that the average
yield in a 1969 maize growing competition was 3,400 lb/acre, and that the
average yield for all farmers was 1,100 lb/acre. The team set 1979/80 targets
of 3,000 lb/acre for the most progressive half (45%) of the LLDP farmers, and
2,000 lb/acre for all farmers living in the Program area, including non-adop-
ters. Those targets, interpreted as forecasts in the economic analysis, seem
acceptable. Nevertheless doubts have been raised by performance during the
first half of the 1970s whether those average targets can ever be reached.
Similar shortfalls from apparently reasonable food crop yield targets are
reported in the majority of smallholder projects in the LDCs, and have yet
to be adequately explained.l/
1/ The Program unit stresses the importance of price policies on the rate of
adoption; the Bank has picked that up as a major issue and recommended
that Government reform its input and crop pricing formulas, both of which
now tend to discriminate against the farmer.

extends only through the 1974/75 season, and, with
the exception of a few added footnotes (marked by an

the PCR effectively covers the disbursement period.

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
PHASE II
I. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
1.01      The Lilongwe Land Development Program was conceived to be
implemented over 13 years in three phases, starting in 1968. The first
phase,partly financed under Credit 113-MAI, was completed in 1972 and
performance was reviewed by the Operations Evaluation Department in
Report No. 751-MAI dated May 23, 1975. The second phase, the Project
under review, covered four years between 1971 and 1975.    Invest-
ments under the third phase, appraised in May/June 1974 for financing
under Cr. 550-MAI,started in August 1975. The Program was initially
designed to increase production of major farm crops over 500,000 acres,
especially maize and groundnuts to meet rapidly rising domestic demand,
and to intensify tobacco production for export. The Program area was
later extended to 1.1 million acres and beef, dairy and poultry components
were added. The Program was the first of four similar rural development
programs operating in Malawi and together covering some 20% of the
country's farmers. All take a similar approach of integrating provision
of roads, market and administrative centers, water supplies and conserva-
tion measures with intensified extension services, credit and input
supplies and varying levels of social services. Following recommendations
of the Bank's Agricultural Sector Review report of 1973 (235a-MAI),
planning of modified programs to cover the remaining areas of the country
is now under way.
1.02      The Phase II Project includes construction of crop extraction
roads, rainfall diversion channels and boreholes to serve an additional
240,000 acres of the program area divided into 14 units,each with its
service center including a produce market and input store and staff
housing and offices. It expands the provision of agricultural extension
and training services. It continues the management organization estab-
lished in Phase I and expands provision of inputs for cash or credit.
It includes the establishment of a ranch to provide feeder stock for
stall fattening by project farmers. Details are given in Annex 1.
1.03      The Project cost was estimated at US$8.6 million of which
foreign exchange costs were US$3.35 (or 39%).    The Credit of US$7.25
million was to meet 88% of major expenditure items. Retroactive financing
for US$105,000 for ranch development was included. The Project became
effective on August 18, 1971. It was to have been completed by September
30, 1975. The closing date is March 31, 1976.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
2.01      "Phase II" can variously mean an area--a series of units--of
the program area in which work was started in the period 1971/72-1974/75,
or, alternatively, operations taking place in that period in both the
area mainly developed in Phase I and the Phase II area. The meaning is
generally clear from the context.



-2-
Development Work
2.02      Most physical construction was close to appraisal estimates in
total and generally somewhat ahead of schedule in timing. At the start
of Phase II land development works covered 286,000 acres compared with
some 163 000 acres originally planned. During Phase II, in 1972/73-
1974/75, 11 standard "units" totalling 235,000 acres were brought into
the Project against 12 units, estimated at 240,000 acres at appraisal.
In addition five "modified input areas" totalling 140,000 acres (vs.
116,000 acres at appraisal) were incorporated in the Project, and 161,000
acres of the Dzalaryama Forest Reserve were developed as a ranch, as
scheduled (see para 2.05 below). In total these areas cover about
77,000 farm families, 50% ahead of appraisal estimates. The Phase II
Project aimed to reach 24,000 new farmers in the Phase II area as well
as continue services to 28,000 in the Phase I areas at the intensities
planned in Phase I but not achieved.
2.03      Unit offices and staff housing were built in all unit service
centers as planned. Input stores have been built in all standard units,
but two still lack permanent markets, to be constructed by ADMARC. Road
construction exceeded estimates by 10% and 47 bridges were constructed,
24 in Phase I units and 23 in Phase II area. Rainfall diversion ditches
were close to anticipation and some 260 miles of artificial waterways
were developed in addition. Details are given in Table 1.

2.04      At the time of the appraisal of Phase II, survey under Phase I
was behind-hand due to shortages of qualified staff, and although the
development program was not held up, land registration has been delayed.
The staff situation was rectified by the end of 1971. During Phase II
survey of some 376,000 acres was completed, above estimates and ahead of
schedule (Table 2), and survey is no longer a bottleneck.

Land allocation and registration only got under way in 1971 and have
lagged, while farm demarcation, which was getting ahead of allocation/
registration has been held back. In the Phase II period about 262,000
acres were demarcated and 97,000 registered. Given a well-advised policy
of not hurrying this process and given the enormous effort needed for
this task, this seems, within the guideline of its objectives, creditable.
However, land reform does not finish at allocation--people have to take
up their allocations and transfer plots--and although there are no data on
progress with this, there are reports of slow take-up of allocations.
Dzalanyama Ranch
2.05      The scheduled 161,000 acres of the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve
were released to the Project and are being developed as a ranch to
provide feeder stock for program farmers. However, the build up of the
herd has been restricted by shortage of stock in Malawi and high prices
due to this and competition from a number of livestock projects. By the
end of Phase II the herd was scheduled to be about 11,000 head: it was,
in fact, only slightly over 5,000 (see Table 3), and instead of sales to
farmers of fatteners of about 2,000 a year the level was about one-third.
The fattening component appears to be operating well and is showing a
handsome gross profit to farmers (see Annex 2). There is some suggestion,
however, that feed (principally maize stalk) would be inadequate for the
level of development which was planned: the evaluation unit is to
investigate this.
* The herd continued to expand in 1976, though the head count can be mis-
leading because of the success of the programs for selling heifers and
steers to smallholders. The March 1977 Supervision Report shows herd
size at 92% of appraisal forecasts in December 1976.

2.06      Considerable loss of grazing has taken place through brush
fires, apparently particularly prone to enter from the Mozambique border.
The cost of establishing fire breaks would be considerable but from
information available could be a viable operation. The wood resources
of the ranch area are not being methodically exploited although selective
cutting would appear to be beneficial to both forest and grazing, and
remain essentially on a protected basi6 as the area is gazetted forest
reserve. A cost/benefit analysis of both fire control measures and full
exploitation of the timber resources of the Ranch area vould be justified.

Extension Services and Training
2.07      The appraisal report called for expansion of extension coverage
to an additional 24,000 farming families for a total of almost 50,000. In
fact cover, as defined by the number of farm families within the orbit
of unit centers, had reached nearly 78,000 by 1975. The ratio of extension
workers to farmers was expected to be 1:200 for the first 2 1/2 years after
establishing a unit and 1:400 thereafter, a level which was not, however,
achieved in Phase I because of a shortage of trained extension workers.
Similar difficulties continued into Phase II and the overall Program ratio
was 1:374 in 1975,or 1:348 in the Phase II project area alone if it is assumed
that Phase I areas and early Phase II areas each had a 1:400 staffing ratio
(Table 4). Given tnc resuurce constraints, Government feels that these ratios
are quite satisfactory an' that the appraisal target was unrealistic.

2.08      Mere numbers do not, of course, make an efficient extension
organization; it has to have a well structured line of communication to
and from farmers, and have up-to-date and worthwhile advice to transmit.
In this, LLDP seems strong; a pyramid structure provides a ladder from
the Principal Field Officer, through Senior Field Officers in charge of
groups of five units, each headed by a Field Officer supervising two Field
Assistants per unit; and staff transportation seems adequate.l/ Impres-
sive monthly farm activity schedules are drawn up and these together with
regular briefings on project matters from Project Manager through
Divisional and Section heads down to contact staff ensure the pyramid is
used. Each farmer should be contacted about four times a year. Random
checks during field visits left some doubt whether this level was achieved,
whether everyone who should be reached is regularly reached, and whether
the information is passed on adequately (producer price information did
not appear to reach the village very reliably): but the general impression
was an extension service that was enthusiastic, well briefed and active.
Effectiveness is harder to judge in a short visit outside the main crop
period, and in large part depends on such exogenous factors as producer
price levels.
2.09      The cattle dipping program expanded during the Phase from
covering nine units to 24 units, and the rather shaky data suggest an
increase in the proportion of the herd dipped. Dipping rates vary
seasonally, principally because access is limited by crop cultivation,
but in 1975 it appears that about 80% of the 48,000 head herd in LLDP
was covered. Unfortunately there has been no attempt to measure the
effectiveness of the program within LLDP.
2.10      Staff and farmer training programs appear to have continued at
the Project Training Center and Nsaru FTC respectively much as anticipated
by the appraisal mission. The level of 200-250 days of staff training
maintained each year appears satisfactory given the virtual exclusion of
training in the main agricultural season, November through March. Courses
averaged 5-7 days with 20 resident places filled per course. Farmer
training contact increased through the Phase and in 1973/74 (the last year
for which figures were complete) there were 94 residential courses over
313 days involving 2,700 students and 7,600 student days: whilst day
courses involved over 30,000 students that year. One-third of all resi-
dent students, and over a half of day class participants were women. No
courses were current during the completion mission, but the interest of
training staff supported the impression from the figures that the training
program was operating well.
Credit and Input Supply
2.11      Nearly all seasonal inputs used in the Project have been made
available on credit in kind. During the Phase II period the number of
borrowers rose from under 5,000 to over 25,000 in the peak year 1973/74
1/ And possibly excessive in quality: the proportion of four-wheel drive
vehicles in the LLDP fleet may be greater than is justified given the
road conditions and probably low cost of delays in operations which
the use of standard vehicles would entail.

when the total loan value was K495,000. These were close to appraisal
estimates for 1974/75 1/ in which year there was in fact a decline in
borrowers but an increase in the amount lent and a doubling of average
loan size (Table 5) all caused by the sharp increase in world fertilizer
prices that year. In 1973/74 rather under 40% of families covered by the
extension services in that year received seasonal credit: but credit was
received by 75% of families in units established for at least two years
and who were, therefore, most likely to have been appraised for credit-
worthiness.

2.12      The efficacy of a credit service should be judged by whether the
items supplied on credit have the desired effect of securing effective
use of new techniques which would otherwise have failed to take on because
farmers had a liquidity problem and whether, after a few years of using
credit, farmers became independent of it. There is little information on
how the credit program has performed on these criteria--yield data have
been somewhat controversial (see paras 3.02-3.04) and production with and
without credit has not been evaluated while most of the uptake of inputs
has been associated with credit issues. Cash sales were only 1% of total
value in the first two years but rose to 10% in 1973/74 and 1974/75. There
are no data on farmers being weaned from the credit program.
2.13      Typically, repayment rates have been more closely monitored.
These have been well above the levels typical of African agricultural
credit operations (Table 5), axiin the last two years-, with over 90% of
sums lent recovered by the due date, have been particularly commendable.

2.14      Good recovery rates variously reflect profitable input packages
made available on credit on the right scale; sound judgment on the selection
of borrowers (done in this case largely by the extension service with
the help of headmen); a simple recovery mechanism which gives borrowers
good opportunity to pay back (and little to avoid it); and the certainty
of punitive action for wanton default. In LLDP credit is for suitably
sized packages combining inputs of plant nutrients and seed that have
proved technically and economically beneficial in tests, and must be
presumed sound. Although subject to criticism among LLDP staff, especially
concerning failure to stop past defaulters getting loans from neighboring
Units, the extension services seem to have been effective at weeding out
bad risks. However, the system of rating used does probably tend un-
necessarily to exclude some borrowers who could benefit from credit. The
collection at markets, immediately after payment, seems fair, efficient
and persistent. A K2.00 surcharge added immediately on any default
doubtless encourages payment on time, but as this charge never increases
a borrower, once a defaulter, does not have any incentive to clear his
debt. The coercive element then comes from the traditional courts which
are, naturally, not subject to the jurisdiction of the Project. These
have failed to keep up with credit default cases during Phase II and in
one area at least have set a bad example with all the court officials,
themselves defaulters. Mobile recovery teams of LLDP credit and extension
staff have operated with some effect in 1975, but it is hoped that the new
creation of a special mobile court with adequate capacity to cope with
the default flow expeditously, will ease the expense and resource diversion
involved in thus maintaining good repayment rates. It has been estimated
that for the credit program to be self-supporting a charge of 26% would
be needed.2)' At present, most of the field extension staff is involved to
some degree in credit collection.
2.15      Seasonal inputs supplied under the Project include fertilizer
(CAN, Sulphate of Ammonia, Urea or a 20:20:0 mixture) for maize and
tobacco; seed for maize and groundnuts; and sulphur dust for groundnuts.
These are provided in packages suitable for one acre application in
combinations which reflect extension advice. In 1974/75 there were 17
different packages available: 12 for maize, 3 for groundnuts, and 2 for
tobacco; a total of 37,750 were sold, down from 42,600 in 1971/72 when
there were nine different packages. Fertilizer use increased markedly
over Phase I, but expansion has been checked, probably by a combination
of the increase in fertilizer prices and increased interest charges which
greatly raise total package price..Z/ In 1974/75 fertilizer use was little
different from the start of Phase II, enough for about 40,000 acres. Total
issues of fertilizer in 1974/75 were only half of those projected, although
during the previous three years they were acceptably close to estimates
(see Table 6).*
1/ Interest charges which had been 10% on the season were raised to 12-1/2%
in 1974/75:  this is the equivalent of 15-16.5% a year.
2/ The weighted average cost of a package in 1971/72 was K7.70: in 1974/75
it was K28.20.
* Fertilizer use rebounded in the next two seasons, following a decline from
the high prices of 1974/75. Total tonnage sold increased to an all time
high before the end of 1976/77 (on a larger area, however), and is expected
to reach appraisal forecasts (Supervision Report of March 1977).

2.16      The expected shift to cash purchases has not taken place and
even in 1973/74 when total issues were close to projections, under one-
third of the expected cash purchases took place. It is interesting to
consider how soon a farmer participating in a credit program can be
expected to switch to cash purchases. Such change will obviously be
delayed if credit is relatively cheap, and the more so if the farmer, a
risk averter above all, thinks there is a chance either of avoiding
repayment or, in the event that there is a widespread crop failure, a
general moratorium on credit repayments.
Costs and Financing
2.17      To August 31, 1975 expenditures under the Project totalled
K6,647,712 which, together with contingent liabilities of K130,000 for
vehicles still to be delivered and K118,000 against storage constructed
by ADMARC and not yet billed, brought costs virtually to the appraisal
estimates for Government and IDA financing (farmers' contributions of a
further K330,000 were anticipated through the cash purchase of seasonal
inputs). Considerable variation took place within the overall total
(Table 7). Generally good control seems to have been exercised over
expenditure units, but saving also reflects procurement problems: e.g.,
livestock costs are down because cattle have been harder to obtain than
was expected, major savings on expatriate staff reflect recruiting
difficulties (which have put a considerable strain on the senior staff
in post), and the under-expenditure on local staff in the extension
services are also accounted for by a shortage of these key workers.
Building costs have tended to exceed estimates although the worst of
the world-wide cost escalation was avoided by completion of major invest-
ments early in the Project. Savings seem to have been made in vehicle
orders without impairing efficiency, due to good management control on
their use and an effective maintenance organization.

2.18      The final credit allocations by category are close to the pattern
of total expenditures. Disbursements have been remarkably close to
appraisal expectation (Table 8), and no major problems with disbursements
were reported by project management. There was some complaint at Ministry
level on the inflexibility which Bank procurement procedures introduce in
a country in which dealerships are limited and stocks held are small.
The $25,000 exclusion from ICB was felt to be too low in view of rising
prices (this limit was raised to $30,000 in Phase III). Total procurement
times for vehicles are currently rumning at about 18 months including
preparation of documents, advertizing time, clearance with RMEA (30 days)
and the Central Tender Board, and a 12-month delivery time from placement
of orders.

Organization and Management
2.19      Changes recommended at appraisal in the organization of the
Project were carried through with only minor modifications. The Program
Manager was made directly responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources (MANR) at Deputy Secretary level; a Liaison Committee
was created within 12 months of signing of the Project Agreement; a
restructuring of management divisions took place; and management trainees
recruited. The Liaison Committee, with the Secretary for Agriculture and



- 12 -
Natural Resources in the Chair has been extended to include the Managers
of the other rural development projects, has generally met quarterly, and
is felt by management to have improved inter-ministry relations. Member-
ship of the Committee is shown in Annex 3.
2.20      Five functional divisions were created in 1973 covering Cons-
truction, Finance and Credit, Field Development Services, and Administration
and Transport each with a Divisional Head in charge and a fifth division
embracing Project evaluation and land allocation under the Program Manager.
The organization appears satisfactory except for the inclusion of land
allocation under the Program Manager. This has arisen due to Government's
failure to recruit a competent person to handle the delicate issue of
land allocation and the accident that the PM was previously in charge of
land allocation. Although the present Program Manager is extremely
hard working, the combined task is too much, a situation aggravated by the
show-piece nature of LLDP which involves much of his time in public
relations, the shortfall of senior staff in other divisions, and possibly
also his personal inclination to play a direct role in most facets of
project operations.
2.21      Although there were delays in recruitment the required appoint-
ments of principal accountant and senior agricultural credit officer has
been made, and three Malawians are in post as management trainees.
Staffing problems have been continuous, slow Government procedures parti-
cularly affecting senior staff recruitment and replacement, and low
salary scales affecting higher and intermediate levels, so that on this
subject the appraisal report looks rather optimistic. Some recent
improvement was reported, but even so as at August 1975 there were 32
vacancies in senior posts defined as TO and above, or 25% of the establishment;
and 45 vacancies (8X of the total) among junior posts. Overall 11% of all
posts were not filled. Inadequate promotion opportunities were reported
to be affecting morale of lower technical staff (there were recently over
600 applicants for 16 vacancies as senior technical assistants) and
although 1-year upgrading courses have been reintroduced, this remains
a problem.
2.22      The Evaluation Unit.   An area particularly hit by staffing
problems has been the Evaluation Unit: a unit which is especially vulnerable
to gaps in staffing because of its small size and the need for continuity
in its work. Over the Phase II period the staffing position has been:

- 13 -
No one person has been in post throughout the Phase, only one post has
been filled continuously, vacancies have existed for some 7 of 20 man years
of time. There has been no shortage of enumerators and clerks, but there
has been inadequate supervisory and analysis capacity for the 34
enumerators on strength.
2.23      This situation has undoubtedly impaired the performance of the
Evaluation Unit, and it has also had other problems. It was set up under
Phase I, a year after the Program started, and without clear terms of
reference on its activities or mode of operation; received no further
guidance (or even mention) from the Phase II mission; and has developed
a program without clear priorities which has resulted in substantial
collection of data which is either unanalyzed or irrelevant to immediate
needs. There was also a feeling within the Unit that although it should
be monitoring project progress principally for the Program Manager (with
which I agree), most work had been done principally for the Bank. This
view did not appear to be well supported, however. In another coTmunication
Government indicated its satisfaction with the useful information flowing
from the evaluation units of LLDP and the other major programs. It points
out that lessons learned in the program areas lead to policy changes which
have a salutory effect throughout the country.
2.24      Reflecting concerns expressed by a Bank mission to Malawi in
January 1975, and following an initiative taken by the Karonga Evaluation
Officer, a Working Party on Evaluation was set up "to examine the role of
Project Evaluation Units in Rural Development Projects in Malawi and
related topics" and has since reported to MANR. The Report (dated August
1975) makes proposals for the rationalization of data collection in
Malawi, discusses ways to bring the various data collection bodies into
a common methodological basis, and makes proposals for centralizing
enumerator training. The Report makes useful distinctions between dif-
ferent levels of data collection but has little to suggest on methodology.
Close attention was also paid to the Evaluation Unit in the recent Project
Performance Audit Report of Phase I. 1/ I fully agree with the comments and
contentions of that report and do not propose reiterating them here. I
would only add three comments:
a)  that Lilongwe is a prime example of the need for the Bank to
clarify its views on the data requirements, collection and
analysis methodologies, organization, and work programs required
of evaluation units and find a way of building these requirements
into all projects which embrace an evaluation component.     The
need for terms of reference for evaluation units to be written
into project reports has support in Malawi, this being a
recommendation of the Working Party;
b)  it is by no means clear that the activities of the Evaluation
Unit should be limited to collection of data on acreages and
yields as "the Bank" is alleged to have suggested to the
Agricultural Economist in charge; and
1/ Report No. 751-MAI dated May 23, 1975.



- 14 -
c)  that if the Planning Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources is unable to do the work, a way should be
found to provide funds for the analysis by an outside body of a
3-year farm management survey of 120 households which is in
danger of being lost if no action is taken.
Legal Covenants
2.25      The covenants appear to have been adhered to.
III. PROJECT IMPACT
3.01      Probably more has been written about the impact of LLDP since
its inception than any other Bank project. The following is largely to
supplement rather than repeat the detailed conclusions of others.
Crop Yields
3.02      Insofar as LLDP is involved in intensification of production,
yields per acre become a key indicator of project impact. Yields have
been measured for maize and groundnut production and are shown, for
developed and undeveloped areas and with averages compared with appraisal
projections, in Table 9. Considerable year-to-year fluctuations are
apparent and generally yields have been behind projections through Phase II.

3.03      Examining the causes of these fluctuations, Anderson 1/ found
that groundnut yields were set back for three years by rosette, whilst after
an encouraging start to Phase II, maize was set back by high fertilizer
prices. Poor rains in 1972/73 affected both crops. Anderson concludes:
"Even with these set backs, however, yields are higher than
before the program, higher in the developed areas, and higher
than what would have been achieved without the program. The
reasons are that husbandry has improved remarkably--the improve-
ments have also spread widely to the undeveloped areas--and,
until recently, maize farmers were moving to the high yield
seed-fertilizer packages. The response of the farmers to the
program has been enormous; hopefully the problems now occurring
with fertilizer and crop prices will not be allowed to undermine
the response."
3.04      Although observation, and also data on input supply (Table 6)
lend support to this summary, the yield data in fact provide only weak
corroboration. Some of the optimism in Anderson's report is the result
of high initial estimates for groundnut yields for 1974/75 (672 ' 75 vs.
495 lbs/acre finally recorded after his report was issued) which lead him
to expect a stronger recovery than appears to have occurred. In fact the
actual yields in 1974/75 barely recovered to the levels of the last year
of Phase I and were below the base-line of 575 lbs/acre which, on rather
slight evidence, was the level revised from (an implied) 550 lbs/acre in
Phase I. Maize yields to 1973/74 were also 25% behind the appraisal
estimate: the 1974/75 data show a good increase,* Tobacco yields,
expected to rise from 200 lbs/acre to 500 lbs/acre were 419 and 269 lbs/acre
respectively in 1973 and 1974.2/ The tendency for average yield projections
to be over optimistic in project appraisals appears to have applied in
LLDP Phase II, but 5 years is too short a time-span for this to be
conclusive, and for this reason, as well as the problems of field measure-
ment, yields are not a totally satisfactory monitoring index. Moreover,
even if per acre yields of one crop do remain static this does not neces-
sarily mean that inputs are having no effect on the farm business. By
raising the productivity of labor, seasonally still probably the
scarcest resource in Lilongwe, inputs and improved techniques may be
permitting an area expansion or a change in the enterprise mix which is
achieving as good or better results than the direct impact of yield
increases on the target crop. Such changes cannot be detected without
careful monitoring of the whole farm, not single enterprises or input
applications in isolation.

* More recent LLDP figures for average yields of maize "all varieties":
show slight declines from 1973/74 to 1974/75 and again to 1975/76. Some
special varieties ("SR 52 Hybrid" and SV 37 Synthetic) show increases
however. LLDP figures for average yields of groundnuts show a decline
from 1974/75 to 1975/76 (SuDervision Renort MnirTnnhvr 91 1Q 7r\

Production and Sales
3.05      Sales of the three major cash crops to ADMARC are shown in
Table 10. Unfortunately there is no guarantee of their reliability,l/
nor do sales to official markets have much relationship to marketed
production in a situation where outside markets are more profitable than
the official one, Nor, in a semi-subsistence economy, do sales have a
constant proportional relationship to production. Kinsey 2/ estimated
maize production to be well ahead of appraisal estimates for 1971/72 and
below estimates by rather less in 1972/73. There are no comparable data
for the remaining period of Phase II. Kinsey similarly suggests that
production of groundnuts in 1971/72 and 1972/73 were two-thirds and one-
third respectively of appraisal estimates but this conclusion has been
contr,versial and the fact is that reliable total crop production data
and total sales data are not available.

Incomes and Wealth
3.06      The level of lending operations and fertilizer use (see Tables
5 and 6) suggest, however, that a very real impact has been made in
introducing new technology to smallholders in the LLDP and prima facie
their incomes may be expected to have risen as a resiult. Again, there are
few data available on changes in farmers' earnings. But there is
impressive secondary evidence in the LLDP of change taking place and it is
a reasonable presumption that the program has played a leading role in this.
3.07      A number of farmers, mostly selected at random to avoid undue
bias, were visited on field trips. They generally showed good knowledge
of and enthusiasm for the program. Many were showing considerable commer-
cial acumen and could point, on the one hand, to changes in their farm
enterprises brought about by the Project and, on the other hand, capital
and consumption expenditures derived from it. Among these, rather
consistently, house improvements, ox-carts, bicycles, radio, clothes and
education were cited as expenditure items with house improvements fre-
quently first or second and no discernable priority in the other items.
1/ There are many versions of sales data. Those used in Table 10 were
supplied by LLDP management.

The standard of housing seen was very high compared with many other areas
of Africa and on casual examination appeared to be significantly superior
to areas near to Lilongwe. The most impressive observed evidence of the
program's impact is the spontaneous development of quite well stocked
retail stores in Unit centers in the area, the satisfaction of shop-
keepers' with business, the number of new stores under construction, and
the associated development of craftsmen, mainly carpenters and bricklayers.
The program allocates plots in Unit centers but provides no capital
aid or credit. Most shopkeepers appear to have been or continue to be
farmers. The growth of shops in the Phase II area is shown in Table 11.

3.fe      Self-help contributions have also been impressive in the program
area. These have been raised by farmers typically by contributing maize
for sale. In this way over K10,000 is reported to have been raised in the
Phase II period with farmers also contributing molded bricks for projects
of which clinics for under-fives have been easily the most popular. In
addition, in the 1975 "youth week", 363 projects involving labor contri-
butions were recorded. The quality of work is hard to judge, but the
politically inspired mobilization of the people in the LLDP area does
appear to have been rather effective.
Nutrition
3.09      Although there are people in the area interested in guaging it,
and potential facilities for it, no measure of the nutritional impact
of the program has been established.
Conclusion
3.10      In terms of measuring the impact of an investment, a mid-program
review, and particularly one taking place immediately following completion
of the Phase, has limitations: the physical progress of the program is
easier to establish. This last has been impressive and reflects well on
successive managements and the support of Government. If some accurate
measure is to be required of the project's impact on farm incomes and
farm-family well-being, which are the ultimate objective of the program,
the nature of such measure, the means by which it can be obtained,
and the resource implications of the data gathering and analysis process
should be discussed and agreed with project management as soon as possible.
IV. THE FUTURE AND BANK/PROJECT RELATIONS
4.01      Phase III of the Lilongwe Program became effective in August 1975
under a $8.5 million Credit to help finance development of a further 15
unit centers and cover an additional 32,000 farm families. The Phase III
closing date is June 30, 1979, but projected maximum crop production is
not expected until 1985/86 and an administrative structure and staff will
need to be maintained after 1979. Under the Phase III Credit Agreement
Government is to submit proposals to IDA by September 1976 for post-program
continuation of services.
4.02      Proposals are already under discussion, and appear to envisage com-
ponents being directly run or maintained by the relevant ministries or
District Councils, with ADMARC taking over all stores. Satisfactory
proposals for the coordination of the many facets of development in the
LLDP area when the Project Unit is removed would appear to be key, and
so too will be the provision of adequate finance to continue operations.
4.03      In view of this and of the Government of Malawi's intentions to
develop more LLDP-type projects in a national program, it was suggested
at a roundup meeting that Government should be more fully aware than it



- 20 -
is of the impact of programs of this nature on the national budget. The
point was accepted and it was agreed that the Treasury should take the
lead in deciding how to monitor such impact and carry out the measurement.
4.04      Other matters discussed included:
a) the need to fill staff positions more rapidly and to provide
promotion channels for technical staff (para 2.21);
b) the need to reconsider the evaluation program and in particular
establish a means of guaging the receptivity of farmers to the
program and the effects of the extension services, credit and
other measures. It was agreed that guidelines on target data
and methodology would be valuable (para 2.24);
c) the need to establish the costs and benefits of fire control
measures and to consider an approach to exploiting the timber
resources to achieve optimum development on Dzalanyama Ranch
(para 2.06); and
d) in view of the show-piece nature of LLDP the need for Government
to provide an experienced Public Relations Officer to handle
visitors and take this burden from the Program Manager (para
2.20). This was agreed.
4.05      Government staff at the meeting felt that its Government/Project
relations with the Bank had been good on LLDP and other projects, that
supervision missions had been useful and particularly commented that RMEA
staff had been most cooperative and helpful. One constructive observation
was that if project management could be informed in advance of the emphasis
of any supervision mission steps would be taken to assemble relevant data
ready for the mission.

ANNEX 2
MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The Stall Fattening Component
1.        In the second phase of the Lilongwe Project there has been a
major expansion of beef production by smallholders by fattening steers
in stalls.
2.        Farmers purchase on credit 2-2 1/2 year-old steers from the
Lilongwe Ranch. The steers are fattened for 150 days on maize stalks,
bran, groundnut stover, banana leaf or local legumes with supplementary salt.
3.        Tick control is by hand picking.   Bedding straw is typically
used for manure when the stalls are vacated. Stalls are normally 9' x 9'
although in some cases local zebu are in 9' x 4 1/2' subdivisions and
these seem satisfactory. A recent development has been the building of
stalls in rows of 14, as 14 steers make up a single truck load for both
delivery and purchase. A farmer typically has two steers fattening at any
one time; therefore, rows are shared by 7 farmers in a village. Stall
construction is typically of eucalyptus poles with a grass thatch roof.
Locally, materials for two-stall units cost K15 (US$18) and last three
years.
4.        Live weight gains have been 1.2-1.8 lbs per day and over the
past six years steers costing between K37 and K62 per head have sold on
average at K54-100 after 150 days, giving average gross margins of K17-42
per head on average cold dressed weights of 340-450 lbs. As a farmer
could put through four head a year, he can make gross margin of up to K175
(US$210) a year from this enterprise. Details of average performance are
shown in Table 1, in which, however, it should be noted the small cash
outlay for salt has been omitted and no charge made for labor.
