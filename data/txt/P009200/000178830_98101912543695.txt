CHAPTER I
THE WATER SUPPLY AND
SEWERAGE SECTOR
Generai
1.01     the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo (SAP Kosovo) is
situated in the southwestern part of the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (bFR Yugoslavia) and has, as its neighbors, Albania and the
Socialist Republic of Montenegro to the west, the Socialist Republic of
Serbia to the north and east, and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia to
the south. The area of the Province is about 10,877 km2, representing
about 4.25% of the area of the country. The climate in the Province is
mostly continental except in those areas above 1,000 m.a.s.l. (about 20% of
the total provincial area) where a mountain type climate prevails. The
Province is divided into 22 communes, and the project area is situated
within two of these communes - Pristina and Podujevo. Population density
in the Province is estimated at about 120 inhabitants/km2 as compared to
about 85 inhabitants/km2 for SFR Yugoslavia as a whole. Kosovo is the
poorest of the less developed regions of Yugoslavia. There are about 2.6
dependent people for every actively employed person, as compared to the
national average of about 1.2. The spread in per capita incomes between
Slovenia, which is more developed, and Kosovo, in 1979, was 6 to 1. House-
holds in the Province are relatively large, with an average of somewhat
more than seven persons, compared with a national average of less than
four. In Kosovo about 52% of the population is below the age of twenty,
while the national average is about 36%. Seismicity in the Province is
defined as somewhat unfavorable with the general possibility of tremors of
the order of 70MCS (Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale).
Water Resources
1.02     The water courses of SAP Kosovo flow into three seas; and of the
total runoff, about 50% goes to the Black Sea, 43% to the Adriatic Sea, and
7% to the Aegean Sea. The Province is divided into the catchment areas of
four main rivers: Belic Drim with an average flow of 65 m3/sec to the
Adriatic; Ibar and its tributary, the Sitnica, with a combined overage flow
of 37.6 m3/sec to the Black Sea (the project is principally within this
catchment area); Binacka Morava with an average flow of 8.6 m3/sec flow-
ing to the Black Sea; and Lepenac with an average flow of 8.4 m3/sec
flowing to the Aegean Sea.
1.03     The existing source of surface water for Pristina is the Gracanka
Reservoir (about 7 km southeast of the community) which has been in service
since 1906 supplying the community as well as the ore flotation plant at
Kisnica (about 90 I/sec). The Gracanka River catchment area above the dam
is about 114 km2, and average annual rainfall in the area is approxi-
mately 640-800 mm per year. The 45 m high dam has a maximum water depth of
42 m, maximum storage capacity of 32 MCM and live storage of about 21 MCM.



The utilizable water quantity for any two successive average dry years is
approximately 420 1/sec, according to hydrological studies performed by
Jaroslav Cerni Institute, Beograd. Studies by Energoprojekt, Beograd
indicated somewhat lower figures. However, under ideal hydrological condi-
tions, the reservoir presently can supply up to a maximum of 410 1/sec of
water to the system. The quality of the raw water in the reservoir is
rapidly deteriorating due to the continuously growing concentration of
manganese and organic pollutants in the lower layers, and flushing is
impossible because the dam's bottom outlet is out of operation. As the
storage capacity of the reservoir is being reduced, the utility of the
reservoir is, therefore, also being reduced.
1.04     The only other substantial surface source presently suitable for
use by the Pristina and Podujevo areas is the existing Batlava Reservoir
which is located about 10 km southeast of the town of Podujevo. Prior to
the initiation of the Bank project, the reservoir was used only to supply
Kombinat Kosovo 'A' near Obilic. The Batlava River catchment area com-
prises about 224 km2. The dam has a 42 m height, a maximum water depth
of about 35 m, maximum storage capacity of 40 MCM and live storage of about
29 MCM. The quality of the river water is generally alkaline with little
mineralization, and is medium, hard.  Ouality of the reservoir water, how-
ever, indicates high turbidity at the bottom, with manganese and iron depo-
sitions. (The project includes repair of the bottom outlet which will
allow bottom flushing.)
1.05     A future source for the towns south of Pristina might be the
Stimjle Reservoir, whose construction is planned as part of the Lepenac
segment of the Ibar-Lepenac water system. This 120 MCM reservoir, which
would be located about 25 km south of Pristina, presently is in the concep-
tual stage only.
1.06     Groundwater and spring development in the Pristina service area
has been limited due to relatively low yields of wells. Two well fields,
one at Kuzmin and the other at Kojlovica, yield approximately 120 1/sec and
50 l/sec respectively.  However, the number of wells (nine in the Kuzmin
well field and five in the Kojlovica well field) indicate low individual
well yields, and a similar situation exists with the two Podujevo wells.
Hydrogeological investigations by the water authority indicate that no
further exploitation of these fields is possible. A spring at Grmija
yields somewhat more than 5 1/sec.
Service Levels
1.07     In SAP Kosovo the cities of Pec, Prizren, Kosovska Mitrovica and
Pristina have reached at least some degree of solution as far as water
quantity and quality are concerned. Other towns, such as Djakovica,
Leposavic, Urosevac, Kacanik and Gnjilane, have only partial distribution
systems installed. Water source development is also required in most other
towns as well.



1.08     At present, about 45% of the communities in SAP Kosovo utilize
surface water sources; about 35% obtain their water from springs, and the
remaining 20% abstract water from locally situated wells.
1.09     Approximately 40% of the total Provincial population is provided
with water from a piped municipal supply, and about half of these have
house connections. The remainder are served through yard hydrants or
public standpipes. Somewhat less than one fifth of the households (about
10,000 dwellings) are not supplied with water through organized systems;
and about 15,000 village families obtain their water from open fountains,
springs or streams. Individual dug wells are common in rural areas.
1.10     House connections were available to users in the project area in
1979 as follows:
Pristina (including
Kosovo Polje & Obilic)         - 12,565 or about 75% of households
Podujevo                         -    800 or about 10% of households
Total                           13,365
1.11     The Pristina water supply system distributes treated water of
fluctuating quality; and because of low storage capacity and excessive
hydrostatic pressure (due to under-sized lines) in some areas, is subject
to pressure control problems. The quality of water supplied in Podujevo is
affected by the considerable hardness of the well water. Both areas expe-
rience intermittent service, particularly during summer months. Although
all of the Pristina house connections are metered, up to one-third of the
meters need repair or replacement.  Meters have not been installed in
Podujevo.
Sector Development Strategy and Program
1.12     Development and utilization of water resources in SFR Yugoslavia
occurs primarily at the Republic and Provincial level. The general pattern
in Yugoslavia is to supply and distribute water to domestic (urban), com-
mercial and industrial users through self-managed enterprises, usually
designated as "Vodovods". These financially autonomous enterprises operate
J         under Yugoslavia's normal self-management principles, but are, however,
subject to control by the Communes 1/ regarding their investment programs
and tariffs. Usually, for each commune, a Vodovod exists, which develops
1/ The Commune, in Yugoslavia, is an administrative area, normally cover-
ing a town, and its surrounding rural communities. It has an Assembly
and an Executive Council.

a single water source. However, as limited local sources become fully
exploited, Vodovods and communes seek to develop more distant water
sources; and self-management agreements with other communes and Vodovods
become necessary, leading to the formation of "Water Communities of Common
Interest" 1/ (WCCIs) in order to develop joint supplies.
1.13     In addition to Vodovods, another type of water authority, the
water economy enterprise (e.g., Ibar Lepenac Enterprise) has responsibility
for river management, flood control, and, occasionally, acts as an investor
for the construction of water supply and irrigation projects.
1.14     "Water Funds" in each Republic and Province were in existence up
until a few years ago, financed principally by Government allocations,
local water taxes, and voluntary contributions pledged through referenda.
The Water Funds have now been superseded by the WCCIs. Although the WCCIs
derive some capital from Government taxation and grants, they depend to a
great degree on locally raised finances; and although WCCIs have been
established at the Province and Republic levels, these generally serve in a
coordinating role. At the regional and communal level, WCCIs deal with
specific problems, taking prime responsibility for the substantive work in
water development.
1.15     The financing of specific community water supply projects in
Yugoslavia has previously been mainly at the communal and Vodovod levels,
with considerable dependence upon voluntary contributions, enterprise sub-
scriptions, and water tariffs. In Kosovo some economic constraints have
been induced by limited water supply; but in the absence of adequate long-
term loans on reasonable terms, the development and expansion of water
facilities has been inhibited. However, under the Kosovo Province
Five-Year Plan (1982-1986) which is in the final stages of approval,
special attention is being given to water resources utilization. Directed
principally towards potable water supplies, irrigation, and industrial
water, the Plan's water elements will emphasize construction and rehabili-
tation of water systems, water course regulation, flood and erosion protec-
tion and rational utilization of the surface and groundwater resources.
1.16     Because the communes have decided that the provision of potable
water and sanitation services is of high priority, the next Communal Five
Year Plan (1981-1985) will also emphasize the need for urgent measures to
be taken to meet the water supply and sewerage requirements in the project
area. Since the proposed project is regional in nature, covering four
1/ WCCIs and other "Self Managing Communities of Interest" are associa-
tions which are authorized to decide together on equal terms with the
Assemblies of the competent socio-political communities (Communes,
Provinces, Republics) on all matters in the general sphere of educa-
tion, science, culture, health and welfare and in specific spheres such
as housing construction, power production, water resource management,
etc.



-5-
municipalities and two communes, coordination between commune and Province
planning is in progress. In this context the Regional Physical Plan for
Kosovo Province which was prepared in December 1976, and approved by all
the Communal councils of the Region, includes the proposed project.
Similarly, the Assembly of SAP Kosovo includes this project in its
Provincial Physical Plan (June 1975), as part of a regional solution to
water supply problems in the Province.
1.17     The proposed project represents the first element of a regional
strategy aimed at solving the water supply problems in SAP Kosovo. Future
extension of service to the Province's rural communities contiguous to the
project facilities is under consideration as a subseqent stage of develop-
ment. Additionally, the proposed project has been studied in consonance
with the execution of the Ibar Multipurpose Project (Loan 777-YU), and also
with the proposed Kosovo Irrigation Project which would have sufficient
excess capacity to serve additional areas south of Pristina, after the
Kosovo Irrigation Project materializes.
The Sewerage Subsector
1.18     Collection and treatment of sewage and industrial wastes in muni-
cipal systems in the Province has not developed to the degree required to
satisfactorily solve waste disposal problems. Somewhat over 10% of the
Kosovo population is served with piped collection systems, and fewer than
5% have indoor flush toilets. In Pristina about 55% of the inhabitants are
served with a sanitary sewerage network. A surface drainage system has
been constructed in the central area of the town. In other areas during
periods of heavy rains, eroded clay soil and refuse which has accumulated
in the open space between buildings and along the roads are washed into the
streets. The mixed flow is carried to the lower elevation of the city,
finding its way into the main watercourse which meanders through the town,
the Pristevka River (which has been only partly converted into a covered
channel), rendering it an open unsanitary sewer. In 1967, a sewage treat-
ment plant was constructed for Pristina downstream from the city.  The
plant, which is comprised of Imhoff tanks, trickling filters, circular
clarifiers and sludge drying beds has not been connected to the sanitary
sewer system and has never been operated. All mechanical equipment has
been removed, and the remaining structures have deteriorated considerably.
Because the plant is situated near the city, it is questionable whether
placing it into operation is desirable, even if renovation could be techni-
cally and economically feasible.
1.19     Sewers have been partly, though unsystematically, constructed in
some other towns of the Province, including Prizren, Djakovica, Leposavic,
Urosevac, Kacanik and Gnjilane, where the sewage treatment plant is still
not in operation although it has been completed for several years. Some of
the sewers in Prizren date back to the 13th century. In Podujevo the main
area of the town is served by sanitary sewerage. A sewage treatment plant
has been designed, but has not been built.



- 6 -
1.20     Of the industrial plants in the project area only the food proc-
essing plant at Kosovo Polje has complete waste treatment, utilizing a
mechanical treatment plant. At Kombinat Kosovo two biological treatment
plants (one for the lignite drying operation and the other for the gas-
works) have been built, but they are only in partial operation. The waste-
water load of the gasworks will be in excess of the plant capacity by a
factor of three by the year 2000. Wastewater from the lignite drying plant
contains about 85.5 mg/l of volatile phenols and that from the power plant
and gasworks about 11 mg/l.  Presently, the wastewater serves as a vehicle
for transporting ash to a lagoon where the phenol level is reduced to about
3.5 mg/l. However, the effluent discharged into the Sitnica River has a pH
of up to 12.6 with dissolved solids as high as 2,735 mg/I.
1.21     The Regional Waterworks Batlava (RWB) is proceeding with a pro-
posed program for sewage collection and treatment for the communities of
Pristina, Obilic and Kosovo Polje including Kombinat Kosovo. Feasibility
studies and preliminary engineering were completed in 1979 by Hydroprojekt,
Praha. The studies recommend a central wastewater treatment plant near
Obilic which could also handle sludge pumped from a large pig feeding
complex at Gornje Dobrevo. The mission suggested the possibility of a
biogas installation at the pig farm. With a population of 25,000 pigs,
about 110 m3 of sludge is produced daily and the resultant dry organic
matter is about 7,000 kg/day. Final designs for sewerage will reflect
energy effective and least cost solutions. Estimated lengths (m) of sewage
collection systems are as follows:
Existing       Planned       Total
Pristina             31,240        110,558      141,798

33,740        176,656      210,396
1.22     The proposed Bank project includes a component covering the finan-
cing of the foreign exchange element of the final designs for the above
planned collection systems.
Bank Role in the Sector
1.23     The Bank, in addition to its institution building role, has empha-
sized improvement in the economic selection and analysis of water resource
associated projects. Further, the Bank has introduced new technology for
sewage treatment and disposal and for pollution abatement. Through its
association with a number of water supply projects in Yugoslavia, the Bank
has gained considerable knowledge in sector organization. Regional econo-
mic studies have been conducted by the Bank for the Province of Kosovo and
also the Republics of Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Berzegovina.  Under
the Morava Region Development Project (Loan 1262-YU), a regional develop-
ment study was prepared for the South Morava River Basin, emphasizing the
need for orderly allocation and utilization of water resources. Addi-
tionally, the Bank has already participated in the financing of significant



- 7 -
water projects, viz., Dubrovnik water supply and waste water project (Loan
1066-YUT); Sarajevo water supply and sewerage project (Loan 1263-YU); and
Ibar (Loan 777-YU), Metohija I (Loan 1360-YU) and Macedonia (Loan 1371-YU)
multipurpose projects. The Ibar, Metohija and Macedonia projects include
community water supply, irrigation and power generation elements. The
Morava project involves flood control principally, while the Dubrovnik and
Sarajevo projects concentrate on the provision of community water supply
and wastewater disposal. Water supply and sewerage projects including
elements of pollution control have been identified for Kosovska-Mitrovica
and Tuzla.

CHAPTER 11
TIIE PROJECT AREA
General Features
2.01     Morphologically SAP Kosovo can be divided into two categories:
the plain or lowland regions and the hilly or mountainous regions. Commu-
nity water supply systems in the plain regions, where most population and
economic activities are concentrated, lend themselves to regional
approaches since large central water sources are available. The sparsely
settled hilly areas are characterized by separate water systems which are
technically and economically more appropriate. The regional water system
for this project conforms with the pattern for development in a plains
region.
2.02     The Commune of Pristina  is situated in the central part of SAP
Kosovo and consists of 94 communities including the city of Pristina, the
administrative and cultural center of the Province (Map IBRD 15684). The
town area is situated on the lower western slopes of the Grniija Hills, the
promontories of which interrupt the terrain relief of the built-up area.
The topography of the city opens towards Kosovo Polje, 7 km to the south-
west; and the industrialized zone of Pristina extends in this direction as
well. The developed area of the community of Kosovo Polje is generally
concentrated along a principal road traversing level terrain, about 7 km
northwest of Pristina, and the anticipated future growth of this town is
projected symmetrically along this road. Obilic is located northwest of
Pristina and has also developed along the main artery between the two com-
munities. The town of Podujevo, the administrative center of the Commune
of the same name, is situated approximately 30 km north of Pristina in an
area called Malo Kosovo (small Kosovo) in the Lab River valley. While most
of the town extends between the left bank of the river and the Nis-
Pristina-Kosovo Polje railway, the new Nis-Pristina  highway constitutes
the southern border of the town. The built-up area of the town is predomi-
nantly on flat terrain rising in a northeasterly direction.
2.03     The industrial enterprises within the city of Pristina occupy a
relatively small area, and this is reflected in the present relatively low
industrial water demand.  The university campus buildings, high-rise apart-
ment houses and commercial buildings dominate the building scene in the
city's central area. Industrial plants are generally located in the sub-
urban area towards Kosovo Polje. These include plants for production of
synthetic fabrics, wall paper and shock absorbers, as well as food proce-
ssing, bakery, and fodder producing industries. Expansion plans for all
these industries are in various stages of implementation. A large auto-
mobile assembly plant is also under construction with commissioning planned
in 1985. (The plant will obtain its water from a separate line from a well
in the village of Lukare, east of Pristina). South of the community of
Obilic there is the Kombinat Kosovo 'A' which processes lignite from



-9-
open-cast mines, produces gas and synthetic fertilizers and also operates a
power plant. At present Kombinat Kosovo 'B' is under construction north-
west of Obilic with a greater capacity than the power plant at Kombinat
Kosovo 'A'. The only major industry of the town of Podujevo is a wood
product enterprise. However, a new factory for brick and tile production,
an enterprise for production of radio components and a spinning mill are
envisaged by 1985.
Existing Water Supply Facilities
2.04     The Pristina area, which includes the towns of Kosovo Polje and
Obilic, is presently principally supplied from the Gracanka Reservoir and
to a lesser degree from the Kuzmin well field (para. 3.01). From the
Gracanka Reservoir a 784 m long 700 mm diameter pipeline transports the
water by gravity to a raw water pumping station. The pipeline also
supplies raw water (about 90 1/sec average) for flotation in an ore-
dressing plant at Kisnica. The pumping station lifts a flow of 320 1/sec
about 87 m to a water treatment plant. The treatment consists of spray
aeration, pre-chlorination, coagulation, settling, rapid sand filtration
and postchlorination.. From the treatment plant, water flows through a
gravity transmission main (600 mm diameter steel) about 7 km to the
Maticane Reservoir (maximum water level 680.74 m.a.s.l.) in Pristina
which consist of two 340 m3 and two 5,000 m3 compartments.  The gravity
main serves part of the Badovac community, the housing and drinking water
requirements of the Kisnica ore-dressing plant, the communities of
Gracanica and Ajvalija, the pig feeding complex at Gornije Dobrevo, and
part of the Caglavica and Maticane communities. From the Maticane
Reservoir water is supplied through the Pristina distribution system to the
600 m3 Dragodan Reservoir (maximum water level 655.20 m.a.s.l.) and to
the 600 m3 Kasagija Reservoir (maximum water level 660.00 m.a.s.l.).
2.05     Although the Pristina distribution system lies in an elevation
range of 550-700 m.a.s.l., it is not divided into pressure zones.  The
total length of distribution lines is approximately 60 km, including
asbestos-cement and cast iron pipes of 80 mm to 500 mm diameter and about
10 km of smaller diameter pipes. The system has been extended indiscrimi-
nately with resultant pressure problems. In the older sections of Pristina
and also the central area of the city the system is undersized. Newer
sections of pipelines in the southern and southeastern areas are of
adequate dimensions.
2.06     A 200 mm diameter transmission line from Dragodan Reservoir serves
the Kosovo Polje area.  Although the flat terrain of the built up area,
ranging from 540 to 560 m.a.s.l., does not require division into pressure
zones, the high hydrostatic pressure in the system creates problems. The
total length of water main is over 20 km, and the diameters range from
50 mm to 200 mm. In addition to Kosovo Polje the transmission main
supplies Orlovic, Crvenka Vodica, Krusevac, Veliki Balacevac, Donji
Grabovac and Obilic, comprising about 33 km of water mains in all. The
Kuzmin well field is connected into the Kosovo Polje system through a 200
mm diameter line.



- 10 -
2.07     In Poduievo two pumping stations above the two wells discharge the
water directly into the distribution network. Three pressure vessels in
one pumping station (total volume of 19 m3) balance pumpinR discharge
versus instantaneous demand, reduce surge pressure, and control automatic
pump operation. Sodium hvpochlorite dosing is utilized for disinfection.
The distribution system, which has been built in a haphazard fashion, con-
sists of about 5 km of steel pipes with onlv about 1-1/2 km of lines of 150
mm and 200 mm diameter; and the remainder is of smaller diameters.
Unaccounted for Water
2.08     Because the production meter at the Gracanka (Kisnica) water
treatment plant is inoperative and none exists in the distribution system,
data on water produced can only be estimated. RWB and its consultants
have, in lieu of metering, based production estimates on filter runs and
pump characteristics including electric power consumption. These estimates
are, therefore, only very approximate. The consultants who prepared the
feasibility studies and preliminary engineering for the proposed project
(Hydroprojekt, Praha) and those engaged in the execution of the final
designs (Energoprojekt, Beograd) have agreed on an estimated figure of 30%
for unaccounted for water, which is reasonable. Of this amount, about half
would be due to leakage due to pressure problems and lack of maintenance,
and the remainder to under-registration of consumers' meters and to miscel-
laneous causes. In the proposed project provision has been made for the
acquisition of leak detection equipment and the institution by March 31,
1982 of a preventive maintenance program which will help reduce the level
of unaccounted-for water to 20% by 1987 (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03 (b)).

CHAPTER III
DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
Present Water Production and Consumption
3.01     Current available water production supplied to the Pristina area
of the system, averages about 450 l/sec, which is made up of 320 1/sec from
the Gracanka Reservoir, and the remainder from the Kuzmin and Koljovica
well field (para. 1.06). In the Podujevo area the two shallow dug wells on
the Lab River supply approximately 16 1/sec. The limitation of the supply
of water from the Gracanka Reservoir is caused by two factors: (a) the
average inflow into the reservoir is less than 360 I/sec; and (b) the
capacity of the Gracanka water treatment plant is limited to about 344
1/sec. During some years the flow in the Gracanka River has fallen to 233
1/sec; and extracting even a minimum of 320 1/sec under such conditions
would, of course, result in over-depletion of the reservoir, with no mini-
mum hygienic flow in the river below the dam.
3.02     The Kuzmin well field, near Kosovo Polje was discovered during
investigations connected with locating lignite deposits in the Kosovo Polje
area. The depth of the wells, 15 m to 22 m, is limited by the presence of
large lignite deposits below the aquifer. Future lignite production will
probably result in loss of the well field. Since the aquifer is only 6 m
below ground surface in some areas, the possibility of contamination is
apparent. The small Koljovica well field supplies water from dug wells
(4-7 m), which must be filtered. No further extensive exploitation of the
above well fields can be considered.
3.03     The production level reached about 410 1/sec in 1978, or somewhat
less than 13 MCM. However, sales approximated 9.1 MCM, with the
unaccounted for water level at about 30%. Of the total sales for 1978,
4.30 MCM were to domestic, 0.32 MCM to institutional, and 4.48 MCM to
industrial and commercial users. Thus, 53% of the water sold was to the
latter two categories. In 1979 a similar situation existed in which total
sales were at a 9.4 MCM level, with domestic sales at 4.75 MCM, institu-
tional at 0.40 MCM and industrial and commercial at 4.25 MCM. Again, the
non-domestic categories used about 50% of the water sold. Compared with
A         other cities in Yugoslavia, in which the commercial and industrial develop-
ment is similar to that of the proposed project area, it appears that an
imbalance exists in the Pristina area. Proportionately more water is being
sold to the institutional, commercial and industrial users than to domestic
users, indicating a suppressed domestic demand. Unaccounted for water in
1979 was again about 30%. The consultants to RWB (Energoprojekt) estimated
a 1979 deficiency, principally domestic, of at least 120 lps, during peak
demand conditions.
Population Forecast
3.04     A new population census was initiated in SFR Yugoslavia beginning
March 1, 1981. Preliminary planning for the census included questions



- 12 -
regarding the availability of water supplies to the households. Availa-
bility date of census statistics, however, has not been determined as yet.
3.05     Estimated mid-year population figures for 1978 through 1995 are
shown in Annex 2. The population trends for SAP Kosovo, its communes and
the commune centers is given in the Regional Physical Plan of SAP Kosovo as
prepared by the Institute for Urban Planning and Design. Percentage growth
rates as defined and projected by Hydroprojekt, Praha and OTAM (Omnium
Technique d'Amenagement), Paris, are as follows:
-------------Annual Growth Rate (%)--------------
Systems         Area          1961-70 1971-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995-2000

3.06     RWB has combined the project area into the above system areas.
Population projections from 1979 to 1995 for the areas are forecast as
follows: Pristina 'A' will increase from 140,000 to 260,000; Pristina 'B'
will increase from 21,000 to 38,000; and, in Podujevo the increase will be
about 13,000 to 25,000. The Institute for Urban Planning and Design, is
preparing the new Master Plan of the Pristina-Kosovo Polje area, but this
has not as yet been published. A General Urban Plan has been developed for
Podujevo and comprises projections to the year 2000. The built up area of
Pristina is to be extended to the surrounding elevated periphery in the
form of family housing (in Dragodan and Kasagija), and also by multi-family
buildings in the elevated areas towards Maticane and along the road to
Skopje. This would place most of the future housing at an altitude of
535-710 m.a.s.l. The industrialized zone is to be extended in the future
in the Kosovo Polje area.
3.07     The present population density varies from 20 inhabitants per
hectare in outlying areas to 400 inhabitants per hectare in the commercial
and highrise apartment areas of Pristina. In Kosovo Polje the range is
from 20 to 180 inhabitants per hectare, while in Obilic the density
increases to 270 inhabitants per hectare. For Podujevo the upper level is
250. Industrial enterprises in Pristina city do not occupy a large area of
the city, nor do they require a large quantity of water. The construction
of industrial plants in Pristina city is not envisaged in the future. In
the Kosovo Polje industrial area, several industries have been established,
and these require water from the community systems.
Forecast of Consumption
3.08     The mission projected water production and consumption from 1978
through 1995, the year by which both the Gracanka and Batlava Reservoirs



- 13 -
will be exploited to a maximum level. Project construction will be com-
pleted in 1984, thereby allowing an eleven year horizon for future planning
and design. Projections of water consumption are in Annex 2.
3.09     RWB provided water consumption statistics for the several cate-
gories of customers for the years 1978 and 1979.  The average domestic
usage has been estimated by RWB at about 130 lpcd for 1978, and this
accounts for about 47% of the total consumption.  The balance of about 147
lpcd represents the consumption of institutional, commercial and industrial
users.  For comparison purposes, it is noted that the domestic consumption
for Cacak in 1978 was about 140 lpcd; and for Belgrade the 1976 figure was
263 lpcd for water sold to non-industrial users. The 1978 usage in
Podujevo was about 100 lpcd which would be expected because of the rela-
tively small size of the town. In 1979, in the RWB service area, commer-
cial and industrial consumption fell somewhat, while the domestic and
institutional usage increased. Average annual industrial demand for 1980
was estimated at about 2.0 MCM by RWB.
3.10     By 1995 it is estimated that about 91% of the population in the
RWB regional service area would be connected to the distribution network
through slightly more than 25,000 connections, as compared with about 75%
of the population being served in 1980 with 13,820 connections. Water
sales are expected to increase from 13.07 MCM in 1978 to 37.99 MCM in 1995
resulting from satisfaction of the existing suppressed demand, rapid exten-
sion of services, renovation of existing defective distribution systems,
upgrading of living conditions and subsequent accelerated per capita
demands for water. Total per capita water production will increase from
277 lpcd in 1978 to 402 lpcd in 1995. All connections will be metered.
3.11     The present level of unaccounted for water is estimated by RWB and
its consultants at about 30% of production (para. 2.08). The leakage
detection and repair program which will be initiated in 1982 is expected to
reduce the percentage to 25% by 1984, and 20% by 1987. Because of the
absence of exact data reflecting patterns of water consumption, particu-
larly in view of the suppressed demands, the maximum monthly demand has
been estimated at 110% to 120% of average daily demand. The maximum daily
demand is projected to be 40% more than the average daily demand.

CHAPTER IV
THE PROJECT
Genesis
4.01     Following a request from the government of SFR Yugoslavia to the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 1971,the World Health
Organization (WHO) was designated executing agent for the preparation of
feasibility studies and preliminary engineering for a community water
supply, waste disposal and pollution control project in SAP Kosovo. In
late 1973 WHO retained as consultants the firm, Hydroprojekt, Praha
(Czechoslovakia) to prepare the reports related to the technical and
organizational aspects of the studies which covered the Pristina and
Podujevo Communes. Initial studies (Phase I) were completed in December
1976 for the period to 1980; and the final report (Phase II) published in
December 1979, projected the needs to 1990, 1995 and 2000. Concurrently, a
Regional Physical Plan was being prepared for the Institute for Urban
Planning and Design, Pristina, under a program supported by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
4.02     In May 1979, water shortages in Pristina reached a crisis level to
the extent that the Pristina Communal Executive Council decreed that water
could be used legally for drinking purposes and personal hygiene only. The
crisis also led both the Communal and Provincial Authorities to call for an
urgent solution of the water supply problem in their draft Provincial Five
Year Plan.
4.03     Bank assistance was requested by the Provincial Government of
Kosovo in February 1980.
4.04     In August 1980 the GWE retained consultants (Energoprojekt,
Beograd) to carry out the final designs for the water supply system suffi-
cient to meet the projected needs to 1995. The procedures followed in
hiring the consultants were in accord with Bank recommendations and were
consistent with Bank policies and procedures; and GWE kept the Bank
informed of all developments in this regard. Although the contract was
signed only on August 22, 1980 the consultant started final design activity
including pilot plant design for the treatment plant in late July 1980
after being notified of selection. Draft tender documents for equipment
were completed in February 1981. Completion of the balance of final
designs and tender documentation is envisaged during the third quarter of
1981.
Project Objectives
4.05     The basic objective of the project is the alleviation of the
increasingly serious water shortage problems in the project area and the
substitution of costly consequential emergency measures with reliable
permanent facilities. The reconstruction and augmentation of the water
supply systems is considered by the authorities to be absolutely exigent



- 15 -
for the universal social and economic development of this region of the
Province. The proposed new and improved facilities would have sufficient
capacity to meet the maximum day demand up to 1995. Through the
rehabilitation and leakage control elements of the project, the
unaccounted-for water level would be reduced to about 20% from 1987
onwards. In addition to providing sufficient water for the rapidly growing
population as well as improving the cultural and hygienic standard of
living in the project area, the project would have an important hearing on
the development of industries and other economic activities including the
continuing evolution of Pristina as the administrative and cultural center
of the Kosovo Province. Another objective would be the strengthening of
the regional water supply and wastewater disposal authority which will
assume responsibility for these services, replacing the existing structure
wherein the responsibility is divided among several communal agencies.
Additionally, the regional authority will serve to develop local capability
in the institutional and financial administration, engineering, and
operation and maintenance, with particular emphasis on RWB's own staff
assuming additional responsibility for project supervision.
Project Description
4.06     The project includes:
A.   Main Supply System Elements
(a) intake at the Batlava Reservoir;
(b)  pumping station (I m3/sec capacity) and delivery line (900
mm-3,530 mm length);

(b) Kosovo Polje system (10,800 m - 80 mm to 600 mm dia.);
(c) Obilic svstem (12,900 m - 80 mm to 500 mm dia.);
(d) Podujevo svstem (28,000 m - 100 mm to 500 mm dia.); and
(e)  Podujevo Reservoir (3,000 m  capacity).
D.   Construction of, and equipment for, a technical operations
building at Pristina.
E.   Provision of 15,000 water meters and a meter repair facility.
F.   Implementation of a leakage detection program.
C.   Consulting services for the final designs of sewage collection
systems for Pristina, Kosovo Polie and Obilic.
H.   Consulting services for water supply construction supervision.
4.07     A general layout of the proposed facilities is shown on Map
IBRD 15684. Water from the Batlava Reservoir will be extracted through a
vertical tower intake and will flow by gravity through a 1.0 m diameter
pipe about 4 km to the water treatment plant near Sajkovac. The treatment
plant will incorporate micro-straining, pre-treatment ozonation, floccu-
lation, mixed media (sand/anthracite) filtration, and final ozone disinfec-
tion. Treated water will flow bv Rravity to the Podu;evo distribution
system through a 400 mm main (about 10 km). A 25 km long (900 mm dia.)
transmission main will conduct treated water by gravity flow to the
Pristina area where the flow will split, one branch feeding the Vranjevac
Reservoirs and the other the Dragodan Reservoir. Further division of flow



- 17 -
and pumping will transport the water to the Maticane and Kasagiya
Reservoirs serving Pristina. The Dragodan Reservoir will supply water to
the Orlovic Reservoir which will serve Obilic and Kosovo Polje.
Cost Estimates
4.08     The total estimated cost of the project is Din. 2,076.1 million
(US$72.85 million) excluding interest during construction with a foreign
exchange cost of Din. 969.0 million (US$34.0 million) equal to 47% of the
total cost. Detailed cost estimates of the project elements are shown in
Annex 7. A summary of the cost estimates is as follows:

The cost estimates are based on actual construction prices prevailing in
similar large scale water supply and sewerage projects in Yugoslavia as of
January, 1981. The water supply projects used as comparators had capa-
cities ranging from 500 lps to 2,000 lps. The prevailing (1981) exchange
rate of US$1.00 = Din. 28.5 has been utilized. Physical contingencies of
15% were added to the base costs. Construction supervision has been esti-
mated at 4% of the base construction costs. Sewerage system design and
tender document preparation has been estimated at 140 man-months of consul-
tative services. The estimated cost of these services, including salaries,



- 18 -
fees, travel and subsistence is US$1.11 million or an average of
US$7,900.00 per man-month. To provide for price escalation during the
project execution, expenditures for foreign goods were escalated at an
annual rate of 10% for 1981, 9% for 1982, and 8% for 1983 and 1984. Local
expenditures were escalated at annual rates of 25% for 1981, 20% for 1982,
18% for 1983 and 15% for 1984.
Project Implementation
4.09     Construction of the project is scheduled to begin in the second
half of 1981 and to be completed in 1984. Details of the project implemen-
tation schedule are given in Annex 3. Final designs and tender documents
are being prepared by Yugoslav consultants, and will be completed during
the last half of 1981.  The tender for pipe supply has been advertised both
locally and internationally and except for the tender document for the
water treatment plant, all other tender documents are in an advanced stage
of preparation.
4.10     RWB will engage consulting engineers for supervision of construc-
tion of the project. Its own Investment Department (para. 5.03) will also
play an increasingly important role in construction supervision.  Agreement
has been reached that RWB will retain engineering consultants under terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank to assist in project construction
supervision, and to further develop its expertise in the Authority.
Procurement
4.11     Equipment and materials contracts estimated to cost more than
US$200,000 and civil works contracts estimated to cost more than US$500,000
will be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. For the purpose of bid evaluation, it is
proposed that domestic manufacturers of equipment and materials be given a
margin of preference of 15% or customs duties, whichever is lower. Other
equipment supply and civil works contracts of an aggregate cost of
US$ 1,000,000 and US$ 2,500,000 respectively, would be awarded on the basis
of competitive bidding advertised locally. Minor works, such as replace-
ment of service connections and additions and renovations to existing water
supply networks are scattered over the project area and as such are neither
amenable to proper packaging for tendering, nor attractive to contractors.
Since RWB has the inhouse capability to carry out this work in an efficient
and cost-effective manner, it would be executed by force account, under
arrangements acceptable to the Bank, up to a value in aggregate not
exceeding US$4.5 million.
4.12     Contracts for the supply of equipment for the water treatment
plant and other specialized equipment are expected to be awarded to foreign
suppliers. Contracts for the supply of pipes and for construction of the
main transmission line have been awarded to Yugoslav suppliers following
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guide-
lines. All other equipment supply and civil works contracts are expected
to be won by Yugoslav firms. Several projects of similar scope and
complexity are in progress or have recently been completed in the country.

Estimated disbursements of the Bank Loan are shown in Annex 5.
4.14     Disbursement for works on force account will be made against
certificates of expenditure, the documentation of which is not to be
submitted for Bank review, but will be retained by RWB and kept available
for inspection by Bank supervision missions.
Monitoring Criteria
4.15     Annex 6 shows the key indicators which would be monitored during
project execution to measure the technical, financial and administrative
goals set for RWB operations. Agreement has been reached that RWB will
report the evolution of these indicators to the Bank during project exe-
cution and for five years following project completion, and that it consult
the Bank on any remedial action it deems reasonable and appropriate for the
efficient conduct of its business.
4.16     Assurances have been received from RWB that, within six months
following the closing date of the Loan, the organization will prepare and
submit to the Bank a project completion report reviewing the planned
objectives and the achievements of the project, including: costs and bene-
fits derived; performance of all entities associated with project execu-
tion and system operation.

CHAPTER V
THE BENEFICIARY
Introduction
5.01     The beneficiary of the proposed loan would be the Regional Water-
works Batlava (RWB) which is legally responsible for water supply and
sewerage service in the Communes of Pristina and Podujevo. As of January
1981, the new enterprise is the successor to the former Gracanka Water
Enterprise (GWE), from which it has acquired all existing staff, assets and
liabilities. It has also acquired the existing Batlava Dam and Reservoir
from SAP Kosovo and will physically take over the personnel, assets and
liabilities relative to water supply in the Podujevo Commune when the new
Batlava waterworks comes on stream. In January 1981, the proposed project
was declared of general social interest by the Assembly of the Executive
Council of SAP Kosovo, a decision which carries with it the right for RWB
to proceed as necessary with land and real estate expropriation in the
Communes of Pristina.and Podujevo. Actions to establish right of way
ownership were initiated in February 1981.
Organization and Management
5.02     RWB's highest decision making body is the Workers' Council, which
is selected by the Assembly of Workers. This Council maintains two advi-
sory commissions: Employment and Discipline, and also elects the Executive
Board of the Enterprise. The Board in turn appoints the General Manager
who actually runs the Enterprise.
5.03     Three departments report to the General Manager:  Technical,
Administrative and Investment. The Technical Department is responsible for
operation and maintenance of the water supply and sewerage facilities,
minor network extensions and repairs, water meter calibration and repair,
mapping of the water and sewerage systems and for workshops and transport
vehicles. The Administrative Department is responsible for the personnel,
legal, commercial, financial and accounting functions.  The Investment
Department prepares medium and long-range plans and oversees the execution
of major projects. RWB's organization chart appears in Annex 1.
Personnel
5.04     RWB's current staff consists of about 240 regular and 25 temporary
employees, compared with authorized levels of 260 and 25 respectively. As
noted in para. 5.01, the water supply service staff employed by the
Podujevo Commune, currently seven, will join RWB only when water becomes
available through the proposed Batlava system. Most of the vacant
positions are in the newly created Investment Department. No difficulty is
expected in finding suitable candidates (para. 5.05). Staff morale is high
and turnover is negligible. Under existing work loads, RWB is temporarily



- 21 -
overstaffed, especially in the lower staff echelons with approximately 12.5
employees per 1,000 connections, exclusive of staff engaged in construction
activities. Progress in the level of staffing will be monitored throughout
the implementation of the proposed project (Annex 6).
5.05     As a result of its good personnel management practices, its
reasonably competitive salaries, the number of Yugoslavian trade schools
available and the expanding labor market, RWB has had no difficulty in
attracting the number and quality of staff required. The need for institu-
ting a formal system of in-service education and training had not arisen
until recently. Orientation and basic job-related training for new or re-
deployed staff had been provided as required informally on the job by
supervisors and other experienced staff.
5.06     It is estimated that the increased activities which will result
from the proposed project will require about 100 additional staff, or an
increase of about 40% over the current level. RWB's management concurs
with the view that in consonance with this expected growth, training acti-
vities should henceforth be promoted. In this respect, agreement has been
reached with RWB that it will continue to assign one of its staff as a
Training Coordinator and submit to the Bank for its comments a training
program no later than March 31, 1982, embracing the project implementation
period, which it will then carry out. This program should include skills
reinforcement arfd updating of existing staff, particularly the supervisory
staff engaged in operation and maintenance.
Operating Efficiency
5.07     Since the water production meter at the Gracanka treatment plant
is inoperative, and none exists in the system other than consumer meters,
daily production has to be estimated. This coupled with the fact that some
5,000 consumer meters are defective, makes it difficult to account satis-
factorily for water. It is thus estimated indirectly from filter runs,
pump characteristics and electric power consumption that unaccounted for
water has been running at about 30% of water produced (para. 2.08).
5.08     Among the causes for excessive water losses are:  (i) chronic
breakdowns due to excessive operational pressure in the Pristina system;
tne proposed project would remedy this by creating separate pressure zones
for different topographical areas; and (ii) the lack of preventive mainte-
nance; the proposed project would assist RWB in surveying the four cities
included in this project, to establish appropriate water supply system
documentation, and in carrying out a leak detection program, and would
provide consumer meters, production meters, a new water meter repair faci-
lity as well as maintenance vehicles and equipment. Water losses and the
progress of the leak detection program would be monitored throughout the
implementation period of the project (Annex 6). Agreement has also been
reached with RWB that no later than March 31, 1982, it will start implemen-
ting a program of preventive maintenance in accordance with generally
accepted practices in the industry.



- 22 -
Accounting, Billing and Collection
5.09     RWB uses the standard Yugoslav chart of accounts and financial
statements. Although certain expenditures are treated as appropriations of
profit, the statements may be readily transformed into the format normally
used by Bank for public utilities.  Adequate accounting arrangements exist
and statements are produced in sufficient detail to enable the financial
results of water supply and sewerage services to be presented separately
from the construction activities undertaken for third parties. Agreement
has been reached that RWB will maintain its accounts in sufficient detail
to enable this separation.
5.10     Billing and collection arrangements are generally satisfactory.
Consumers with defective meters are billed on the basis of prior consump-
tion. The estimated number of illegal connections is negligible. Outstan-
ding receivables which at present are the equivalent of about four months
of sales, are expected to come down to about two months' equivalent by 1986
as a result of special collection efforts. Progress in reducing the pro-
portion of outstanding receivables would be monitored throughout project
implementation (Annex 6).
Audit and Insurance
5.11     In line with Yugoslav practice for Bank loans, RWB's accounts will
be audited by the Social Accounting Service (SAS) according to inter-
nationally accepted standards. Agreement has been reached that beginning
with the financial year 1981, RWB will prepare annual statements and have
these statements audited by SAS. The audited statements would be submitted
to the Bank within six months of close of each fiscal year. Agreement has
also been reached that SAS would give a separate opinion as to whether
satisfactory procedures are in operation to ensure that withdrawals
supported by certificates of expenditures have been used for the correct
purpose.
5.12     RWB will continue the practice of the former GWE of insuring
buildings, equipment and vehicles against the normal risks of fire, damages
and theft. The water supply and sewerage network is not insured except for
landslide risks. This practice is satisfactory.

CHAPTER VI
FINANCE
Past Performance and Present Position
6.01     RWB's revenues are mainly derived from monthly water and sewerage
charges based on metering.  In cases of defective meters, charges are based
on estimated consumption. Meters are owned by the consumers, and there are
no meter rents or deposits. Sewerage charges are levied on water consump-
tion for consumers connected to the sewerage system.
6.02     A further substantial source of RWB's revenues has been the small
but lucrative construction activities it has undertaken for business enter-
prises in Pristina. In the years 1978-1980, this accounted for about 20%
of its total revenues. Out of a total work force of 265 in RWB, about 25
people are directly associated with this activity.
6.03      In the past, proposals for tariff increases have been geared to
meeting the financial needs of RWB. Since income from the construction
activity has figured largely in RWB's sources of income, it has to a degree
subsidized the water supply operation.
6.04     RWB has until now been unable to borrow major funds for system
improvements and expansion. Its current debt:equity ratio is 9:91. Its
equity is small and its debt consists of several small long-term loans at
low interest rates which RWB has no difficulty to service from current
revenues.
6.05     Although RWB has shown some small profits in the past few years,
the inadequacy of its internally generated funds has made it difficuilt to
operate and maintain its existing system properly, let alone to invest in
additional facilities to meet the rapidly growing demand within its service
area.
Tariffs
6.06      RWB's requests for tariff increases for water and sewerage coin-
cide with the preparation of its annual budget which, when approved by its
Workers Council, are forwarded to the Commune for approval of the tariff
increases envisaged in them.
6.07     RWB's existing tariff schedule (effective July 1, 1981) is as
follows.



- 24 -
Consumer Category                                    Tariff (Din./m3)
Domestic                                                  3.50
Public Institutions                                       5.50
Commercial and Industrial                                 9.00
Sewerage Surcharge                                        1.80
Raw Water (Bulk Supply)                                   1.50
Weighted Average (for water supply)                       5.00
6.08     The average revenue collected by RWB is currently only about half
of the long-term marginal cost (para. 7.02) of providing water in its
service area. Existing average charges in certain other cities of
Yugoslavia are twice as high.
6.09     By the time the proposed project is completed large increases in
water tariffs will be necessary, both to provide an adequate level of
maintenance, and maintain RWB's financial viability. RWB's tariffs have
received a 40% increase for 1981. In order to meet its financial obliga-
tions, RWB will need further increases of 30% in 1982, 1983, and 1984, 40%
in 1985 and 20% in 1986. This amounts to a four-fold increase in nominal
terms and a doubling in real terms in water tariffs by 1986.
6.10     In view of the magnitude of these tariff increases the management
of RWB will need to undertake a public relations campaiRn, explaining to
the citizens the need for these increases similar to the one used to gene-
rate public support for voluntary contributions. Agreement has been
reached that RWB will submit to the Bank, three months from the beginning
of each fiscal vear, its plan of action in this regard.
Financing Plan
6.11     Annex 4 Rives a forecast of the sources and applications of RWB's
funds. The following table summarizes RWB's estimated funds requirements
and sources for the period of project construction (1981-1984).

- 25 -
6.12     The proposed Bank loan of US$41.0 million would provide about 45%
of the total financing requirements or about 97% of the foreign exchange
cost (comprising US$34.0 million in project costs and US$7.0 million in
interest during construction on the proposed Bank Loan). The period of the
Loan would be 15 years including 3 years grace.
6.13     Voluntary contributions would provide 33% of RWB's financing
requirements. The citizens of the Pristina Commune overwhelmingly agreed
at a referendum held in January 1981 to contribute 2% of their salaries for
five years (1981-1985) towards the construction of the new water supply
system. Similarly, the Workers' Councils of the organizations of asso-
ciated labor within the Commune also voted in July 1981 to contribute a
portion of their income for a five-year period (1981-1985) towards finan-
cing this project. These contributions are non-refundable and tantamount
to equity. An estimate of the total amounts to be raised is as follows.
Din.           us$
----Millions-----
Voluntary contributions:
-  citizens (1981-1985)                   750.0           26.3
- organizations of associated
labor (1981-1985)                     660.0            23.1
Total                                   1,410.0           49.4
6.14     The above estimates are conservative in that they are likely to
provide higher than forecast cash flow since they are based on current
levels of wages and incomes of enterprises in the Commune without taking
into account natural growth and the effect of inflation.
6.15     However, since the above contributions will be made over a period
of five years (1981-1985) while the project execution period is only
through 1984, RWB will have to borrow from local banks to cover the finan-
cing gap during the period of project construction. Moreover, as a condi-
tion of effectiveness for the proposed loan, RWB will have entered into an
agreement with Udruzena Kosovska Banka Pristina in form and substance
satisfactory to the Bank for the provision of additional funds as and when
needed for the carrying out of the projects.
Retroactive Financing
6.16     Reflecting the high priority assigned the project by the Yugoslav
agencies and in view of the commitments made by communal authorities to
provide improved service, RWB has prepared tenders, received bids and in
August 1981 awarded contracts for the construction of the main transmission
line. The contract for the supply of transmission line pipes, which
amounted to the equivalent of over US$8.0 million, was awarded in June
1981, in compliance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Tender



- 26 -
documents for the reservoir have already been completed. Construction
startup prior to the advent of winter in Kosovo is beneficial in limiting
lost time due to inclement weather. Foreign exchange expenditures for
these contracts are expected to be approximately US$6.0 million prior to
the loan approval, and it was agreed that these expenditures could be
eligible for retroactive financing.
Future Performance
6.17      The financial forecasts 1981-1987 for RWB and the assumptions on
which they are based are in Annex 4.
6.18     The volume of water sold is expected to double in the period 1980-
1987. This coupled with the forecast tariff increases would produce
revenues which would grow more than eight-fold. In the same period, opera-
ting expenses, including depreciation, would increase only about six times,
leaving a margin which combined with voluntary contributions would be
sufficient to meet RWB's obligations. Agreement has been reached that
beginning in 1982 and in each year thereafter, RWB will implement tariff
increases which combined with the voluntary contributions will provide for:
(i) expenses of operation and maintenance (excluding depreciation);
(ii) depreciation or debt service, whichever is higher; and
(iii) adequate working capital.
6.19      RWB's present debt:equity ratio is 9:91.  It will peak at 54:46 in
1983, mainly because of the local loans needed to meet the cash deficit
during the project implementation period (four years) while the voluntary
contribution will only be paid in over a five year period. These contribu-
tions along with the substantially higher operating incomes in the years
following project completion will allow RWB to pre-pay all of its local
loans by 1985, the debt:equity ratio falling to 30:70 by 1987. The debt
service coverage is expected to be around 1.7 times during 1983-1986, and
then improve to 2.2 times by 1987. Agreement has been reached that without
the concurrence of the Bank, RWB will not incur any debt, other than the
ones specified for the purposes of this project, unless a reasonable fore-
cast of its net cash generation before depreciation and interest, exceed
1.5 times its debt service in any future years, including debt service on
the amount to be borrowed.

CHAPTER VII
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
7.01     The proposed project aims at improving the water supply facilities
in Pristina, Obilic, Kosovo Polje and Podujevo particularly with regard to
overcoming the suppressed domestic demand. The proposed works would
increase water production sufficiently to overcome the existing deficit and
also meet the domestic, institutional, commercial and industrial needs to
1995. Design of the proposed system is in accordance with sound engineer-
ing principles utilizing acceptable design criteria and valid approaches.
The overall design of the proposed system was reviewed by the mission
including the pipe sizes and configuration of the mains and distribution
system and also the locations of reservoirs and pumping stations. Five
proposed alternatives for the main water supply system incorporating dif-
ferent routes for the transmission main and also different arrangements of
pumping stations and reservoirs, were analyzed. The alternative selected
proved to be technically superior, and also was the least cost solution at
discount rates of 8%, 10% and 12%.
Average Long-Term Incremental Cost
7.02     The average long-term incremental cost of water in 1981 prices and
at a discount rate of 10%, which is appropriate for Yugoslavia, is esti-
mated at about Din. 11.3/m3 (US$0.40/m3). On the basis of the proposed
tariff increases RWB's average tariffs (in real terms) will be about Din.
6.8/m3 (US$0.24/m3) by the year 1986.  The average tariff for domestic
consumption will be about 40% of the average incremental cost while that of
commercial enterprises will be about 110%. This however does not take into
account the substantial voluntary contributions which both the citizens and
the enterprises in Pristina will make during the next five years towards
financing the project.  The proposed tariff increases combined with the
voluntary contributions compare favorably with the average long-term incre-
mental cost of water and is consistent with the principle of economic
efficiency in resource allocation.
Internal Rate of Return
7.03     There are a variety of benefits associated with the provision of a
safe and convenient water supply. The more important among these is the
health, social and economic well being of the population being served.  It
also facilitates economic development and helps create and expand employ-
ment opportunities for the general public. These benefits, however, cannot
be meaningfully quantified. The internal rate of return was, therefore,
calculated using the incremental water sales at 1981 prices and the volun-
tary contributions which the consumers and enterprises have expressed a
willingness to pay, as a minimum measure of the benefits accruing from this
project. The rate of return would be 14.2% (Annex 9). Sensitivity



- 28 -
analysis of the rate of return indicates that it is moderately sensitive to
increases in capital investment or reductions in tariffs. For an increase
in capital investment of 10% the rate of return would be about 11.0%.
Conversely, a reduction of 10% in benefits accruing from water sales would
result in about 12.7% rate of return.
Risks
7.04     In early 1981 RWB succeeded GWE, which had been established in
1966. The management and staff of RWB have already demonstrated their
capability to meet its growing responsibilities. The formation of the
Investment Department in 1980 further reinforces the strength of RWB,
particularly in project planning and execution. RWB's experience in
project implementation and supervision will be supported and augmented
through close, active participation with consultants in the proposed
project. System structural elements and the welded steel transmission main
have been designed to reasonably withstand lateral forces due to seismic
ioading. Other risks in construction will be normal for a water supply
project. The willingness of the users to pay for water supply is evident.
The increase projected in per capita consumption will not be difficult for
the users to absorb, even at the higher tariff levels. Thus, the risk of
not achieving the organizational, technical or financial objectives of the
project is minimal.
Environmental Impact
7.05     The overwhelming result of the referendum and the decision of the
communes and the Province to accord high priority to the provision of
adequate water supply and sanitation services (para. 1.16) reflect the con-
viction and strong objective of improvement of existing environmental
conditions in the project area. Through implementation of this project,
RWB will supply safe water to a larger number of persons in an expanded
service area. Rehabilitation of defective elements in the existing service
area will also improve levels of service for domestic users, particularly,
and will contribute towards overcoming the deficit in domestic consumer
demand.  At a later date, following the preparation of final designs, which
represents an element of the proposed project, the construction of an
adequate wastewater disposal system would further improve the ambiance of
the areas included in the proposed project.

service in any future years, including debt service on the amount
to be borrowed (paragraph 6.19).
8.02     A condition of effectiveness will be that RWB will have entered
into an agreement with Udruzena Kosovska Banka Pristina in form and
substance satisfactory to the Bank for the provision of additional funds as
and when needed for the carrying out of the project (paragraph 6.15).
8.03     The project would be suitable for a Bank Loan to the Regional
Waterworks Batlava (with the guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia) of US$41.0 million equivalent for a term of 15 years including
a 3-years grace period.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTS
General
Rates of Inflation:
1.                          Year             Foreign        Local
1981                10            25
1982                 9            20
1983                 8            18
1984                 8            15
1985                 -            12
1986                 -            10
1987                 -            10
Income Statements
2.        The forecasts assume that the tariffs for all categories of retail
consumers will increase as follows: 40% in 1981, 30% in 1982, 1983 and 1984,
40% in 1985, 20% in 1986, and 10% thereafter. The sewerage surcharge, which is
the same for all categories of consumers, will also grow by the same percentages.
3.        Connection charges which consist of a one time charge, are assumed to
grow by the local inflation rate. Revenues from connection have been calculated
as the product of the connection charge and the number of connections projected
to be installed each year.
4.        Income from construction has been held at the projected 1981 levels,
adjusted for local inflation in subsequent years.



ANNEX 4

Operating Costs
5.        Salaries are based on current staffing levels, adjusted for growth
in staff and inflation in future years. Administration costs have been assumed
at 10% of salaries, and taxes and contributions at 15% of salaries. Power and
chemcial costs have been projected to increase in line with system expansion
and adjusted for inflation.
6.        Depreciation expense has been calculated on the basis of four broad
categories as follows:
Existing works                -       3%
Hydraulic works               -    3.5%
Distribution network          -       5%
Other                         -      10%
Balance Sheet
7.        In Yugoslavia, fixed assets are revalued from time to time as directed
by the Federal Government. The bulk of the fixed assets on the books of RWB at
the end of construction period will be new, and therefore, currently valued.
Interest has been capitalized during the construction period (1981-1984).
8.        Accounts receivable have been projected at four months of sales through
1982, and gradually reduced to two months by 1986. Inventories have been assumed
at 1% of net fixed assets from 1982 onwards.
9.        Accounts payable have been assumed at 12.5% of operating expenses not
including depreciation. Other current liabilities have been held at current levels
and adjusted for inflation.
