KOSOVO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN 2055-YU
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
this report reviews the preparation, implementation and achievements
of the Kosovo Water Supply Project for which Loan 2055-YU of US$41.0 million
(later reduced by amendment to US$23.0 million) was made to the Regicnal
Waterworks Batlava (RWB), the borrower and implementing agency. The Loan was
guaranteed by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). It was
signed on December 14, 1981, and became effective April 15, 1982. The final
disbursement was made in September 1986.
The report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Region. It is based on the findings of a project completion mission which
visited Yugoslavia in February 1986 and on a review of the Staff Appraisal and
President's Reports, the Loan Agreement and supervision, progress and other
reports related to project implementation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Borrower for comments. However, no comments
have been received.

SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
KOSOVO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 2055-YU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 2055-YU of US$41.0 million equivalent was approved on
November 10, 1981, became effective oni April 15, 1982 and was clc-ed un
April 30, 1986, after the loan had been reduced by US$18.0 million due to
significar.tly lower than expected costs in US dollar terms.
Major Loan conditions were met.  However, instead ot using
consultants to assist in project supervision, the Borrower lecided Lt do it
with his own staff and did it successfully (paras. 1.06 to 1.08).
Project costs were 65% higher in local costs and 55% lower in terms
of US dollars than foreseen at appraisal. The local cost variance was due
mostly to much higher than anticipated local inflation (para. 1.10). The
foreign cost variance stemmed from (i) an overestimatior of pr.ce
contingencie.; due to deficient appraisal forecasting methods, and (ii) the
fact that most contracts were in Dinars without price adjustment anid that the
Dinar was substantially devalued over the project implementation period
(para. 1.12).
The contractors performed well and close supervision by the Borrower
ensured boLh quality and general adherence to schedules (para. 1.1.4).
In this period of rapid inflation and severe reduction in real
income, the Borrower was able to increase its tariffs an average of 35. per
year in currenit terms and about 10% in real terms.  ft was thus able to meet
its financial commitments and to finance about 20% of its investments from
internally generated funds (para. 2.03).
The project represents the least cost solution. The major project
objectives of eliminating serious water shortages and strengthening the
Borrower were accomplished.
The project confirms the need for appropriate cost forecasting
methods tu reflect substantially different forecast local and foreign
inflation (para. 1.12).

LOAN 2055-YU
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
. PROJECT
GeDesis
1.01     In 1971, the Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (SFRY) requested the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to
prepare feasibility and preliminary engineering studir for expanding water
supply, and wastewater disposal facilities in the Socialist Autonomous
Province of Kosovo (SAP Kosovo). The World Health Organization (WHO) was the
executing agency. The stud.ies were finalized in 1979. In the same year,
water shortage in Pristina, t4e capital of SAP Kosovo, reached a crisis level.
compelling the local government to restrict water use to drinking and personal
hygiene. Bank assistance was requested in February 1980. The project was
prepared and implemented by the Working Organization of Regional Waterworks
Batlava (RWB).
Project Objeftives
1.02     The main objectives of the project were the alleviation of serious
water shortages in the communes of Pristina, Obilic, Kosovo Polje and
Podujevo, by substituting permanent facilities for costly emergency measures,
and the strengthening of RWB. These objectives were met.
PLoject Deserption
1.03     The project as implemented included:
a)   a main supply system consistinig of a raw water pumping station
(1.0 m3/sec), a raw water tunnel and pipeline ronnecting the raw
water pumping station to the water treatment plant (3.5 km), a water
treatment plant, a treated water transmission main (25.5 km), four
treated water reservoirs (27,500 m 3capacity), a pumping station
(155 lps), and primary distribution mains (19.6 km);
b)   primary distribution consisting of two pumping stations (300 lps) and
two reservoirs (6,000 m );
c)   secondary distribution consisting of pipe networks (58 Km), and a
reservoir (3,000 m );
d)   administration building, shops and storage;



-2-
e)   water meters and metar repair facility;
f)   a leak detection program;
g)   consulting services for preliminary designs of sewage collection
systems for Pristina, Kosovo Polje and Obilic; and
h)   consulting services for construction supervision.
1.04     The project was expected to be completed in December 1984.  This was
achieved except for the preliminary desiga of sewage collection system im-
provements and the acquisition of some operation and maintenance equipment,
which were completed at the end of 1985.
Loan Covenants and Conditions of Effectiveness
1.05     A Guarantee Agreement between the Bank ana the SFRY and a Loan
Agreement between the Bank and RWB were signed on December 14, 1981.
1.06     The major conditions contained in the Loan Agreement were that RWB
would:
a)   retain engineering consultants under terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank to assist in project construction supervision;
b)   =ontinue to assign one of its staff as a Training Coordinator and
propose and submit to the Bank for comments a training prograW, no
later than March 31, i982;
c)   start implementing a program of preventive mainLenan e, no latL-r than
March 31, 1982;
d)   prepare annual statements and have th.6e statements audited by the
Special Audit Group of the Social Accounting Service and submit these
audited statements to the Bank within six months of the close of each
fiscal year beginning with the financial year 1981;
e)   implement tariffs which combined with the voluntary contributions
would, beginning in 1982, provide for (i) expenses of operation and
mainterance (excluding depreciacion), (ii) depreciation or debt ser-
vice, whichever ic higher, and (iii) adequate working capital;
f)   not incur any debt without the ccncurrence of the Bank, unless a
reasonable forecast of it. net cash generation before depreciation
and interest would exceed 1.5 times its debt service in any future
year; end
g)   prepare and submit to the Bank a project comp'etion report within six
months following the closing date of the Loan.



- 3 -
1.07     A condition of effectiveness was that RWB would have entered into an
agreement with Udruzena Kosovska Banka Pristina for the provision of addi-
tional funds as and when needed for the carrying out of the project.
1.08     All except the condition described in para. 1.06(a) were complied
with. RWB successfully supervised cotnstruction wit> its own staff rather than
using consultants (pare 1.12).

-4-
1.10     The project cost in Dinars exceeded the appraisal estimate by 652,
mainly because of local inflation, During the five-year implementation period
inflation was 460% as compared with the 90% appraisal estimate during the
four-year forecast implementation period.
1.11     In equivalent US dollars, however, the total project cost was 55%
less than the appraisal estimate. Only two project components had cost over-
runs: (i) operational equipment because the Borrower, with Bank concurrence,
increased its purchases of pipes, supplies, spare parts and accessories by
extensions to existing contracts, and (ii) constructioni supervision because of
overtime incurred in an etfort to complete the project on schedule.
1.12     The main reason for the overall decrease in terms of US dollar equi-
valents was that most contracts were denominated in Dinars and, to the benefit
of RWB, did not have price escalation clauses. As a result of the rapid de-
valuation of the Dinar during project implementation, the Dinar payments in
terms of US dollars under thege contracts were much less than anticipated at
appraisal.  Also, implied in the method used to translate project costs at
appraisal was the assumption that the Dinar would not be devalued even though
substantially different rates of foreign and local inflation were used in the
forecast. This assumption resulted in an unduly high price contingency for
the US dollar equivalent cost estimate.  Adhierence to Bank Group guidelines
issued in February 1982, after the project was appraised, would mitigate if
not entirely avoid overestimation due to large disparities between local and
foreign inflation.
1.13     Lecausp of the substantiallv lower than estimated cost in US dollars,
US$18.0 million was cancelled from the original Bank loan of US$41.0 million.
Implementation
1.14     Forecast and actual con6truction schedules are shiown in Annex 2.  RWB
supervised the construction of Lhe project with its own staff resulting in
development of RWB's project implementation capability. All major project
componerts were constructed on time.  The contractors performed well and close
supervision by RWB's staff ensured botth quality and adherence to schedules.
Only the preliminary design for a future sewage collection project and the
acquisition of some operation and maintenance equipment were compieted Later
than planned.
1.15     RWB submitted all its project implementation reports in a timely
fashion. The audit reports, however, were submitted with substantial delays
mainly because they had to be translated.
1.16     The institutional objective of developing RWB into a well run re-
gional water supply and sewerage organization was accomplished. In particu-
lar, RWB's project planning and implementation supervision capabilities have
improved significantly. Also, the leak detection program implemented under
the project has been successful in reducing unaccounted-for water from 30% at
appraisal to 25%.

1.17     RWB's staff were trained abroad in the operation and maintenance of
the treatment plant, pumping station and maintenance equipment by the sup-
pliers of these equipments. RWB staff were also involved from the very begin-
ning in both construction supervision and installation and testing of equip-
ment, and received valuable on-the-job training from contractors and equipment
suppliers. RWB's current organization chart appears as Annex 3.
II. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
2.01     The financial and economic justification of this project was predi--
cated on RWB's ability to raise substantial revenues from a combi-aation of
consumer charges and contributions.  In current terms, such revenues exceeded
appraisal estimates in the period 1981-35. However, as the real income of the
average household declined sharply in the period, RIB was unable to increase
its tariffs in real terms as much as foreseen at appraisal. This is analyzed
further below.
Financial AR4y§
2.02     The appraisal forecast and actual income statements, cash flow state-
ments and balance sheets for the period 1981 to 1985 are given in Annexes 4
to 6.
2.03     During the project implementation period, the volume of water sold
was lower than anticipated and tariffs were not adjusted sufficiently to keep
in line with rapidly increasing operating expenses. This shortfall, however,
was more than offset by higher than anticipated consumer contributions. over-
all, RWB was able to cover its operation and maintenance expenses, debt ser-
vice, working cap.tal requirements and about 20% of its investments through
consumer charges and contributions. This is a remarkable achievement in a
period of very high inflation and severe reduction in real income.
Economic Analysii
2.04     During the project implementation period, economic activity stagnated
and personal incomes and standards of living fell both in Yugoslavia and the
project area. This is partly reflected in RWB's lower than projected domestic
water sales. RWB adjusted its Lariffs by about 35% per year in current terms
or about 10% in real terms. The project's recalculated rate of return is 10%
compared with the appraisal estimate of 14% (Annex 7).
m. BANK EFFECTIVENESS
3.01     An excellent rapport existed between the Borrower and the Bank which
was facilitated by the high degree of motiv-.ion and dynamism prevailing among
RWB m&nagement and staff. The Bank supervised the proiect about twice a year



-6-
and missions fielded were balanced, provided continuity and had the required
expertise. The implementation of the sewerage project prepared as part of the
project, has been postponed due to lack of local funds.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
4.01     The project represents the least cost solution.  It was well con-
ceived and well prepared. Major works were completed in a timely fashion.
The primary objectives of improving water supply service in the project area
and of developing RWB were achieved.
4.02     The project confirms the need to properly factor the effect of price
contingencies in cost estimates when local and foreign inflation are projected
to be substantially different (para. 1.12).
