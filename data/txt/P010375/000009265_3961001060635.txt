MEMORANDUM AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ISLTMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A KARACHI PORT MODERNIATION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$91.4 million equivalent to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with a 20-
year term, including a five-year grace period; US$60.5 million would be onlent
by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on the same
terms with KPT paying a foreign exchange premium to the State Bank of
Pakistan; the remainder of the loan woull be used by GOP to improve landside
access to Karachi Port. The loan would help finance the modernization of
Karachi Port.
2.    Bac kgroud.  Pakistan's international cargo traffic increased from 9
million tons in 1970 to 24 million tons in 1989. To meet this increase in
demand, Pakistan has progressively developed its port facilities.  Originally
Karachi Port was Pakistan's only port, but a second port was built in the
early 1980's at Qasim. In spite of the expansion in port facilities, little
has been done at Karachi Port to improve cargo handling. This has resulted in
costly operations, long turn-around times of ships and has restricted the
types of ships visiting the port. Manual processing of documents also slows
down cargo flow. At a time when many countries are introducing modern, cost-
effective port facilities and streamlining trade facilitation procedures, the
growth of Pakistan's international trade and the competitiveness of its
exports, are handicapped by these traditional practices. Karachi Port needs
modernization and improvements to overcome these constraints.
3.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's assistance to Karachi Port
through projects in 1955, 1964, 1973 and 1974, supported capacity expansion,
as well as financial and organizational improvements. Delays in procurement
and cost escalation could have been minimized, if the prequalification
criteria had been strictly applied and if the tendering process had been
completed expeditiously. Experience with financial covenants was mixed. The
lower than covenanted rate of return on net fixed assets after 1982, was due
to GOP's reluctance to permit a tariff revision between 1979 and 1988; despite
this KPT has not requested or received budgetary support from GOP. The
proposed project is designed to minimize the risk of these problems recurring.
A 55X increase in tariffs has just been approved and an annual review of
tariffs and internal cash generation requirements during project
implementation have been agreed. GOP's action in ensuring that adequate
tariff changes continue during the implementation period of the project and
thereafter will influence possible future Bank operations in the transport
sector.
4.    In the mid-1970s, the Bank declined to assist with the construction of a
second port (Port Qasim) in the FArachi area. This decision was based on
Karachi Port's development po-e Aial and Qasim's physical and locational
disadvantages. Other donors, however, did assist with the construction of



- 2 -
thls port. There had been a hiatus in port development following construction
of Port Qasim. In 1987, the Bank's Transport Sector Report found that port
modernization at Karachi was urgent, and GOP subsequently asked for Bank
assistance for Karachi Port. Project preparation work provided the analytical
basis for a 50 tariff increase for KPT in 1988, and has also provided an
opportunity to continue our dialogue with the Government on its port
development strategy.
5.    Proiect Objectives.  The principal objectives are to: (a) assist with
the development of an appropriate strategy for the medium/long term
development of the port subsector; (b) reduce port costs at Karachi through
improved cargo handling productivity, accelerated cargo and document clearance
and improved landside access to the port; (c) strengthen the Karachi Port
organization through changes in institutional, managerial and financial
structures; and (d) expand liquid cargo handling facilities.
6.   PXolect Descriution,  The project consists of:  (a) construction of an
oil-terminal to meet medium-term oil import needs; (b) construction of an
elevated roundabout with a flyover to improve the port's landside access; (c)
reconstruction of quayside pavements to enable cargo to be handled with modern
equipment; (d) modification to Keamari Groyne Access Road to permit the
effective use of the Groyne area; (e) procurement of a bucket dredger with two
self-propelled dump barges to maintain water depths in the port; (f)
procurement of equipment to provide marine environmental protection; (g)
expanded computerization of KPT to improve port management information
systems, communications within and outside the port, and clearance of cargo;
(h) procurement of radar and related equipment to control ship movements and
increase the number of ships entering/exiting port per tide; (i) procurement
of spare parts for KPT's equipment; and (j) provision of consultancy services
for the preparation of feasibility studies, tender documents and supervision
and for conducting studies of: KPT's computerization and institutional
strengthening, environmental protection, dredging, radar and related
equipment, handling by the private sector of general cargo (through multi-
unitization), bulk and containers, and a master plan of Karachi Port.
7.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$143.1 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$91.4 million (641).
Retroactive financing is proposed in the amount of US$3.5 million for
mobilization costs and interim payments for construction of OP-V until Loan
signing and in the amount of US$0.6 million for payments to consultants
covering the period beginning September 1989. In addition 1.5 million of the
loan would repay PPF advances. The duration of retroactive financing is an
exception to the Bank policy which is justified on the basis of the unexpected
delays experienced in processing the project due to a series of changes in
management at KPT and at the national level between project appraisal (June
1988) and project negotiations (April 1991). As a result of these changes,
project processing was stalled for about 18 months and further PPF financing
during this time could not be approved. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group



. 3 -
operaticns in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 7470-PAK dated, May 13, 1991, is also attached.
8.    Agreed Actions.  The Government and KPT as appropriate have agreed on
the following actions: (a) GOP will consult with the Bank as appropriate to
decide on a medium-to-long term port development strategy and prepare specific
programs; (b) KPT to implement measures based on the institutional
strengthening studies being carried out under the project including
environmental control procedures, computerization, finances and; (c) KPT to
monitor the achievement of cargo handling productivity targets; (d) KPT to
prepare a program in consultation with the Bank to retire obsolete and worn
out equipment; (e) KPT to implement agreed marine environment protection
measures; (f) GOP to implement the recommendations of the port subsector
strategy and tariff study to be financed by the Asian Development Bank; (g)
KPT to revalue its fixed assets; (h) that KPT tariffs would be revised
annually starting from 1992/93 as necessary, for KPT to generate sufficient
funds to cover all of its cash operating and maintenance expenseL and debt
service charges and contribute not less than 404 of the average annual capital
expenditures related to KPT port operations during that year and the following
fiscal year and (i) that KPT will not make any major modifications to its
investment program throughout the project period without prior consultation
with the Bank.
9.    Special conditions for effectiveness of the loan are:
(a)   For KPT to designate a qualified Deputy Manager for the
Pakistan Simplification of International Trade Procedures
Committee (PAKPRO) and its three task forces; and
(b) Signing of subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOP and KPT.
10.  IErgngza2JLW  AMFts.  Karachi Port is located within the mudflats and
mangrove areas of the coastline, which are the breeding grounds for fish and
shrimp. This area is exposed to pollution from garbage, raw sewage and
industrial effluents from the city; these are being addressed to some extent
under the Bank's Urban Development Projects.  Pollution caused by the visiting
ships which includes oil spills, sewage and garbage, in spite of the efforts
made by KPT, is not under control, due to lack of equipment and accountability
in KPT. Under the project, equipment for containment and cleaning of oil
spills and solid and toxic wastes and analysis of pollutants, will be procured
and a marine environmental unit will be established in KPT. Projects of this
kind now would require a formal environmental assessment. Since this project
was prepared and appralsed before October 15, 1989, a modified procedure was
followed in which a study was undertaken during appraisal by an environmental
specialist and a series of measures based on this study's recommendations have
been agreed upon with KPT to protect the marine environment.
11.  Benefits, The internal weighted average economic rate of return of the
three major components is 36X, well above the opportunity cost of capital, and
the project is well justified on economic grounds. Without replacement of
dredging equipment, port capacity would continue to decline significantly with



. 4 -
substantial costs to Pakistan's international trade. The roundafout and
fly-over would reduce traffic congestion resulting in savings in vehicle
operating costs and transit times. The additional oil import capacity would
relieve the existing overextended facilities and would prevent intolerable
congestion from occurring within a few years which would result in
increasingly costly demurrage charges. Improved cargo handling at Karachi by
the private sector would reduce handling costs and ship turn-around time,
permit the use of more cost effective ships and postpone port expansion
requirements.
12.   Rlsks. The project entails minimal risks.  The procurement process is
well advanced, and consequently project implementation is not expected to be
delayed. If construction of an oil terminal at Port Qasim were to go ahead in
the second half of the 1990's, this would not endanger the returns to the
proposed oil pier since rising oil imports would require further facilities
during 2000-2005.
14.  Reommendati   . I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recovmend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
