I.       SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President1 for a
Level Two2 restructuring of both the Haiti Electricity Loss Reduction Project (Grant No.
IDA-H2510-HA) and its corresponding Additional Financing (Grant No. IDA-H5100-
HT), henceforth collectively referred to as “the Project?, and to proceed with the
corresponding amendments to the Project’s legal documents. The Project has been
previously restructured on June 25, 2010, to re-adjust its activities and deadline
consecutively to the earthquake that has affected Haiti on January 12, 2010 (see chapter
6). The proposed restructuring would (i) increase funding to Components 1.1, 3 and 4.1 to
strengthen support for specific items such as information systems, remote meters,
technical assistance, and implementation units; (ii) decrease funding to Components 1.2,
2 and 3 for reallocation of funds in completed activities and categories ; and (iii) extend
the closing date of the Project by six months.

2.      Haiti’s fragile electricity sector is progressively recovering from the 7.0
magnitude (Richter scale) earthquake on January 12, 2010 that severely impacted its
infrastructure. Current Government of Haiti (GoH) expressed an important involvement
in the Energy sector, recognized as a key national priority for development and economic
growth. This involvement is relayed by a dynamic Electricité d’Haïti’s (EDH) new
management team, which has permitted to move forward the sector’s reconstruction
agenda. However, EDH’s still weak technical and operational capacity constitutes the
main hurdle to the state power company’s financial recovery. As of December 2012, the
electricity total losses were above 60 percent and the Cash Recovery Index3 was around
33 percent.

II.      PROJECT STATUS

3.      The original IDA Electricity Loss Reduction Project, PREPSEL (US$6 million,
effective on July 31, 2007) and its Additional Financing (US$5 million, effective on
December 15, 2009) have had a level two restructuring on June 25, 2010, the combined
US$ 11 million restructured Project sought to implement the following activities:
      • Component 1: Improvement in EDH management systems and practices
      (US$4.62 million)
      • Component 2: Improvement in quality of service and increase in revenue
      collection of EDH for selected groups of customers (US$1.91 million)
      • Component 3: Participatory approach, project management, M&E and impact
      evaluation and replication strategy (US$1.49 million)
      • Component 4: Management support to EDH (US$2.78 million)
      • Contingency Reserve (US$0.2 million)

1
  As the restructuring involves an extension of the additional grant closing date beyond the three-year limit
(OP 13.20), Regional Vice Presidency’s approval is needed for such a request.
2
  As a Level Two restructuring, the proposed restructuring would retain the Project’s original Development
Objective which is, “to contribute to the sustainable improvement in the quality of electricity services to
customers and to strengthen the financial and operational performance of the public electricity utility,
Electricité d’Haïti (EDH)?.
3
  Cash Recovery Index (CRI): index representing the combined technical and commercial efficiency of a
power utility.
                                                     5
4.      As of December 2012, 72 percent of the Project budget was disbursed and 94
percent was committed. Successful implementation4 of the Project’s key activities since
the previous restructuring has permitted to reach important milestones, paving the way
for EDH’s sustainable improvement. These key activities and achievements include: (i)
the installation of a new billing system (Customer Management Service, CMS) to
reestablish the flow of funds into the utility, (ii) the installation of a new grid
maintenance system (Technical Service Management System, TSMS) to allow the utility
to identify and repair breakdowns in the system, (iii) the technical assistance to EDH
management, in particular to design the company’s commercial action plan (under
implementation) and sector master plan (under preparation), (iv) the installation of
remote meters at the private producers’ delivery points and (v). the award of a firm for
the supply and installation of remote metering for the large customers.

5.      Efficient procurement under the Project for the completed activities engender a
substantial amount of uncommitted funds – around US$ 495 thousand – to be reallocated
to strengthen the Project’s impact and prepare activities of the newly approved
operation5. Unfortunately, important and unexpected delays outside of EDH control
recently occurred during the implementation of the Project’s major activity, the supply
and installation of remote meters (see paragraph 16).

6.      The Project’s achievement of its Development Objective is currently rated
moderately satisfactory and moderately unsatisfactory for the Implementation Progress,
essentially due to the tight timeline for delivery of the last major activity under
implementation (supply and installation of remote meters for EDH electricity suppliers
and priority customers). The Project is in compliance with all of the covenants imposed
by the Financing Agreement. The fiduciary management system is rated satisfactory.
Audit reports for the Project were submitted on time for 2009 and 2011 (3 month delay
for the 2010 report), and their review did not highlight any significant issues. There are
no unresolved environmental, social or other safeguard issues affecting the Project’s
implementation

III.    PROPOSED CHANGES

7.     The previous Level Two restructuring approved on June 25, 2010 (i) increased
funding to Components 1, 2.3, 3.2 and 4.1 for specific items such as information systems,
remote meters, technical assistance, and operating costs; (ii) decreased funding to
Components 2.2 and 2.3 for grid rehabilitations works and standard meters; (iii) modified
outcome indicators accordingly; (iv) postponed the deadline for submission of EDH’s
audited financial statements; and (v) extended the closing date of the Project by one
year6.

4
  The implementation of the Customer Management and Technical Service Management Systems (CMS
and TSMS) has been completed in October 2012, and the technical assistance to the MTPTEC has ended in
June 2012.
5
  Haiti Rebuilding Energy Infrastructure and Access project, P127203 approved by the Board of Directors
on September 26, 2012.
6
  Extension of closing date from February 28, 2012 to February 28, 2013, which extended the additional
grant period from two to three years.
                                                   6
8.      This restructuring proposes to reallocate funds among the various components and
categories, to postpone the deadline for submission of EDH’s audited financial
statements, and to extend the closing date of the Project by six months, from February 28,
2013 to August 31, 2013. The reallocations would increase funding for: (i) the
sustainable installation of billing system, (ii) the monitoring of installation of remote
metering systems for large customers, (iii) capacity building for the EDH technical unit,
(iv) technical assistance for EDH’s management, and (v) realization of monitoring and
evaluation surveys to measure the Project’s satisfaction level inside EDH and for EDH’s
customers.. The restructuring proposes to decrease funding for the punctual expertise to
support EDH Management and to use remaining funding of completed and activities like
capacity building for the MTPTCE energy unit and grid works and standard meters for
residential customers (activities partially funded by other donors).

       A. Reallocations among Components and Categories

9.      Increase Component 1 by US$0.14 million: The budget for Component 1 would
be increased by US$0.14 million to US$4.76 million. EDH’s new billing and grid
maintenance systems have been successfully installed in February 2012 and are currently
in operational use. However, usual difficulties linked to the replacement of operational
systems may appear and potentially engender commercial losses, in particular for the
CMS. For this reason, the Project plans to provide supplemental assistance to EDH by
training its commercial staff and providing expertise to accompany this modernization
process.

10.     Decrease Component 2 by US$0.07 million: Bank financing of Component 2
would decrease by US$0.07 million, as the works on the grid have been completed in a
satisfactory and efficient manner.

11.    Decrease Component 3 by US$0.13 million: This component would increase by
US$0.13 million to US$1.36 million, as the energy unit to support the MTPTCE has been
closed by the Minister of TPTCE, to be replaced by an Energy Cell supported by the new
Bank funded Energy operation.

12.     Increase Component 4 by US$0.06 million: Funding for this component will
increase by US$0.06 million to US$2.8 million. The additional funding will be dedicated
to purchase and install prefabricated offices , computers and communications equipment
for the recently created EDH technical unit in charge of the supervision of donors funded
projects, and in particular the Haiti Rebuilding Energy Infrastructure and Access project
(P127203).


       B. Change in Outcome Indicators and Values

13.     Outcome indicators will not need to be amended consequently to the
restructuring, as no change occurred in the nature of the Project’s activities. End-of-
project values have been re-assessed in 2011, six months following the approval of the


                                            7
previous Project restructuring. These values will be kept identical, viewing the short
duration of the proposed Project’s deadline extension and the inertia of these indicators.



           C. Extension of Closing Date

14.     A six month extension of the closing date to August 31, 2013 is requested to
allow sufficient time for the Project to complete its main activity – installation of a
remote metering system for priority customers - and observe the impact of this modern
infrastructure provided on EDH commercial revenues7, and thus on the Project’s
development objectives.

15.     Only 10 percent of the remote meters activity (representing US$ 1.7 million, 15
percent of the Project’s envelope) has been disbursed, 60 percent of the activity’s budget
was expected to be used at the supply of all equipment purchased, 20 percent at the
completed installation of all meters and the remaining 10 percent at the operational
reception of the infrastructure by EDH. Until the supplier’s unexpected notification of
delay in January 15, 2013, the remote meters activity was planned to be completed before
February 15, 2013 as initially planned in the contract. The contract is for 400 units of
‘Type 9S8’ meters, and 29 units of ‘Type 16S’ meters. However, the manufacturer
mistakenly produced only 29 of Type 9S, and 400 of Type 16S. Correcting this error will
result in an expected supply of goods by March 15th, 2013 and its installation completed
by April 30th, 2013. With this new development, the project will be unable to reach its
Development Objective without this extension, requested on an exceptional basis as the
additional grant has reached the three-year limit. It is now expected that implementation
delays will be inevitable; all possible alternatives have been analyzed by EDH, its
supplier and with the assistance of the Bank Project’s team. There are no practical
alternatives for the supply of equipment by the current closing date.

16.    As the delays entirely due to the supplier’s negligence are outside the control of
EDH teams and would lead to the non-completion of this activity before the Project’s
deadline, EDH’s overseeing entity (Ministry of Public Works, MTPTEC) has requested
an extension of the Project’s deadline (see request letter of January 23rd, 2013 attached).
The restructuring therefore proposes an extension of the Project’s end date, from
February 28th, 2013 to August 3131th , 2013, to allow the complete installation of the 429
remote meters for EDH’s key customers.



IV.        APPRAISAL SUMMARY

           A. Economic and financial analysis


7
 The installation of remote meters for the state power company’s 429 priority customers would potentially secure up to
60% of the utility’s commercial revenues.
8
  A ‘9S type’ meter is an indirect measurement electricity meter (via power transformation), suited for very large customers. A ‘16S
type’ meter is a direct measurement electricity meter, suited for small industries and businesses. Construction cost and process are
similar for these two different meters.

                                                                  8
17.     From a financial point of view, the major benefits to EDH of implementing the
project remain the same. EDH will benefit from increased revenues due to a progressive
widening of its customer base, increased billed sales of electricity, secured metering for
large customers representing the large majority of the utility’s revenues, and an
improvement in the collection/billing ratio for electricity.

18.    An economic and financial analysis have been conducted by the consultancy firm
Tetra Tech in March 2012, conducting to the firm’s commitment to achieve a CRI target
of 40 percent by the end of its contractual assistance to EDH, in end-April 2013. The
Project re-assessed its CRI target accordingly, but the incomplete re-assessment of the
post-earthquake indicators’ baseline lead to an inability to quantify benefits. In
September 2012, EDH launched an ambitious commercial action plan aiming to connect
100,000 new residential customers and achieve a CRI target of 57 percent by September
2013.

19.     Based on a preliminary qualitative analysis done consecutively to the previous
restructuring, it is already possible to assert that from an economic point of view, the
customers’ benefits continue to accrue because of the consumer surplus created by the
additional electricity to be added to the network at a price below the consumer’s demand
curve. From the societal perspective, the economic losses incurred by not serving the
corresponding electricity demand are deemed to be far higher than the cost of serving that
demand.

       B. Risk

20.     The elimination of works – and in particular the installation of a modern remote
metering system for key clients - could negatively affect commercial and financial
performance of EDH, hence the overall quality of service. The impact is expected to be
mitigated because other donors intend to finance works on the networks serving the large
industrial customers. As a result, the overall risk rating of the original Project and its
Additional Financing remains substantial.
