MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVTLOPMENT ASSOCIAT'ION
t10 THE EXECUlTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THF, REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRF,
FOR A LABOR FORCE TRAINING SUPPORT PROJECT
1.            I submnit tor your approval tie following memorandum  and recommnendation on d
proposed development credit 1(, the Republic of Cote d'lvoire in an amount of SDR 12.1 million
(USS7.0 inillion equivalent). on ztandard IDA terms with a maturity oi 40 years. rhis credit would help
finance a project that aims to improve, through skills training. the employability and productivity of the
project beneficiaries, of wVhicii a large proportion of wvamen, and thus help improve the country's overa'll
competitiveness.
2.            Countrv Background. Since the early 1980s, C6te d'lvoire has faced several fiscal and
balance of payment crises. They reflected not only inadequate macroeconomic policies but also more
fiundamental distortions in trade, finance, public sector, and pricing policies, thereby adversely affecting
the efficient a'location of resources and constraining sectoral growth prospects. The Government has
coped with these situations by adopting various IMF and World Bank-supported stabilization and
adjustment programs which relied solely on internal adjustment. This strategy was also at the core of
the Government's medium-term economic framework (MTF), adopted in 1991, which aimed to restore
international competitiveness and to return to a path of sustainable growth, through (i) structural reforms
in tne areas of trade and finance and (ii) the pursuit of tight fiscal and monetary policies. Moreover, the
Government has initiated a privatization process. involving about 50 public enterprises, and sought to
strengthen human resources development. The MTF was supported by three SECALs, including the
Human Resources Development Program, and a stand-by arrangement with the IMF. In addition, the
IDA has approved three technical assistance credits since 1992 to support the Government in
implementing its economic reforms. privatization program, and human resources development program.
3.            Despite progress in implementing key parts of the economic program, economic
developments until 1993 show that the Ivorian economy continued to suffer from substantial fiscal and
balance ot payments imbalances and considerable structural rigidities. On the fiscal side, the primary
deficit which had improved in the early 1990s, from 2.4 percent of GDP to 1.4 percent of GDP between
1990 and 19921, is estimated to have again widened to about 3 per. At of GDP in 1993. With this
deterioration and a heavy interest burdent equjivalent to about 13 percent of GDP. the overall fiscal deficit
remains at the unsustainable level of about 16 percent of GDP iP 1993, thereby creating serious financing
problems to the Government. As a consequence. the Government resorted mainly to arrears financing
as a means to cover the deficit. On the external side, the current deficit account remained at around 11.5
percent of GDP during 1990-93. Significant improvements in the current account balance were offset
by the high interest charges on the country's external debt, depressed international prices for cocoa and
coffee as well as by an overvalued currency. As a result, substantial arrears were accumulated over the
1990-93 period, reaching the equivalent of about 60 percent of GDP by end-1993. These macroeconomic
difficulties, combined with investment levels remaining at around 10 percent during the early 1990s,
This has been achieved through cuts in prinary expenditure which overcompensated the partly tecession-
related decline of Government revenue during 1990-92.



2
stagnant export receipts for the country's main export products, coffee and cocoa, and stagnant industrial
production, resulted in the fall of real GDP, on average, by about I percent a year during 1990 to 1993.
4.            The internal adjustment program pursued by Cote d'lvoire and the other CFA countries
througih 1993 was unable to halt the economic decline which started in 1986. With the recent re-
alignment of the CFA franc-, the Government has reformu'ated its medium-term adjustment program
in a Policy Framewvork Paper (PFP) for the 1994-96 period. During that time, this program aims to: (i)
raise the rate of growth to about 6 percent beginning froni 1996, (ii) achieve primary surpluses in the
Government's budget, (iii) strengthen external competitiveness thronugh trade, price, and regulawory
reformns, (iv) seek deht relief from official bilateral anid commercial creditors at concessional terms, and
(v) intensify human resource developmenlt and expand poverty alleviation measures with a view to
proteciing the miost vulnerable groups during the adjustmenti period.
5.            The realignment of the CFA Franc is expected to give added impetus to sEructural reforms
the Government has been undertaking over the last couple of years. With regard to trade reform, to
create a more open and competitive foreign trade regime. thereby establishing the conditions for rapid
growth for non-traditional exports, the Government immediately adjusted import tariffs after the
devaluation, reducing the maximum rate to 35 percent, and intends to remove most non-tariff barriers,
eliminate import exonerations, and simplify foreign trade procedures. A comprehensive debt work out
at concessional terms, involving bilateral and commnercial creditors, in combination with a restrictive
fiscal and monetary stance is expected to lead to (i) a sustained reduction in interest obligations,
generating savings of about USS500 million per year, (ii) an overall improvement of the current account
deficit (from about 11 percent of GDP in 1993 to about 7 percent in 1996), and (iii) the return to a path
of positive real growth rates in 1994, accelerating to annual rates of 5 percent and higher from 1995
onwards. The recovery will be led by a sustained increase of investment levels mostly financed by
domestic savings.
6.            The Government expects that with tile parity change and the implementation of the
accompanying fiscal, monetary, and structural adjustment policies mentioned above, the Ivorian economy
will be able to strengthen its international competitiveness and return to a sustainable growth path. In
this context, the Government's prograrm is being supported by the World Bank tnrough an IDA-led
lending program and the IMF through an Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) over three
years. The present project aims to contribute to this long-term effort by improving the productivity and
employability of the workforce.
7.            Sector Background.  Important changes in the structure of the population and the
distribution of the labor force in the country have taken place over the last twenty years. The country's
high population growth (3.8 percent per year) is translated into an even higher growth rate of the labor
force (5.6 percent per year). The proportion of the occupied labor force in agriculture has decreased
from 76 percent in 1975 to about 68 percent in 1992, and during the same period the proportion of Tural
population has declined from 68 percent to 51 percent as the result of an intense urban-rural and
international migration, primarily into urban centers. Modern sector employment, currently about
400,000 (8 percent of total employment), including about 100,000 in the civil service, has decreased
regularly during the last decade (1.25 percent per year) as the result of production decline and firm
closures (about 15 percent of registered firms closed between 1982 and 1990). In comparison with this
rapidly declining labor absorptive capacity of the modern private sector, increase in open unemployment,
according to official statistics, has been low (from 2.7 percent in 1975 to 6.7 percent in 1992); that of
21     On January 12, 1994, the CFA Franc was devaluated by 50 percent.



3
graduate unemployment has been much higher, however. This is be partly explained by the facr that the
decline in modern private employment was compensated for by increases in othier sectors: agricultural
employmetit grew at 3 percent per year. civil service employment at about 3 percent per y'ear, and
infornmal sector employment (of mainly low-skilled and uneducated work-ers) at 9 percent per year. rhe
labor market is dominated by verv small firms (more than 92 per-cent of employment). Womern who are
increasingly entering the labor market as the result of a combination of factors, inicludinlg edlucation
expansion and limited family income, are found essentiall in informal sector activities (63 percent of
informal sector employment). Their share of modern sector employment is increasing rapidly, however.
8.            Education achievements in Cote d'lvoire are lower than mnost countries of the same GNP
per capita group; the performance of the education system is also belvw o' what could be expected frorn
a country which has consistently devoted. for more than a decade, one of the wvorld's lhighest shares of
the government recurrent budget to education and training (up to 44 percenit in the 1980s). Lo"
achievements were, in part, the result of a serious misallocation of resources and large wastage at every
education level. The illiteracy rate of the population aged 15 and above has fallen from 95 percent in
the 1960s to 46 percent at present. During the same period, primary school enrollment has only slightly
increased from 60 percent to 72 percent, and secondary enrollment from 6 percent to 20 percent.
Consequently, the education and training level of the labor force is very low: more than 50 percent of
the employees in the formal sector and 80 percent in the informal sector have received no formal
education or any kind of training. In ad,Jition, important gender disparities exist since, even within the
educated and trained labor force, women are considerably less likelv to have had training and
apprenticeship opportunities than men.
9.            The structure of employment has changed notably since independence. The proportion
of technical (high-level and mid-level) professionals has risen steadily as a consequence of the
technological changes that took place during this period. A close analysis of the labor market indicates
increasingly serious structural imbalances between educated labor supply and demand. The structure of
the supply has changed inversely to the pattern of demand since 1983. Supply of technical professionals
has increased in relative terms from 1.3 percent of total job seekers for high-level professionals and 5.5
percent for mid-level (maitrise) to 2.1 percent and 6.7 percent in 1991, respectively. During the same
period, demand for high-level professionals decreased from 5 ' percent to 2.5 percent and that for mid-
level (maitrise) decreased from 13.8 percent to 4.8 percent. Further, although the number of job seekers
in each of these categories constantly exceeded the demand, unsatisfied demand for qualified/trained labor
has been rising over the last ten years, from about 20 percent to a current high level of about 45 percent,
indicating that employers' labor requirements are not met by the available supply and revealing a critical
lack of response of the labor supply to changes in demand. Such imbalances point to important needs
to be adjusted through training.
10.           Government's strategy is now evolving towards one of increasing employers' participation
(in terms of guidance and financing) in the provision of pre-service training, which had previously been
largely Governnent's responsibility, in addition to maintaining in-service training. This trend in strategy
is clearly consistent with the policy recommendations of the Bank. However, to avoid having the entire
financial burden of the new approach fall on employers (who are now even less able to support in-service
training than in the past), thus reducing their competitiveness, this strategy also implies the need for a
new approach to financing training: involving the Government and industry resources under shared
management. The creation of the Fonds de Developpement de la Formnation Professionnelle (FDFP) to
manage employer-generated resources has been a partial response to this need.  It is now the
Government's responsibility to provide additional resources directly to FDFP to complement employers'
contributions.



4
11.           Government's strategy for both pre-service and in-service training has been relatively
silent on gender equity issues, although access to education and training are quite inequitable: girls
represent 41 percent of primary students and 29 percent of secondary students (including 30 percent of
VET students). In-service training has yet to design a clear strategy to enhance women's job skills,
women currently represent 12 percent of the number of employees having benefited from training between
1987 and 1992.
12.           The monitoring of labor market trends and the identification of training needs and other
supporting measures is constrained by data limitations and by lack of analysis of labor market issues.
This is so in spite of the great number of sources and survey instruments providing information on the
labor market. These sources include a population census, an industrial census carried out every 5 years,
a Financial Data Bank (BDF), a multi-purpose household survey, administrative records from the social
security registers, several enterprise-based surveys, the records of the National Manpower Bureau
(OMOCI), etc. The information collected for different purposes is dispersed, the data are inconsistent
reflecting different definitions and methods of measurement of the same concept. In addition, the
coverage of the data (national, regional or sectoral) is often different. What is therefore missing in the
labor market information chain is a consistent, sustained data gathering and analysis effort capable of
providing timely and reliable data on the evolution of labor markets and of instructing the education and
training systems on the changes in skills requirements. The Government is trying to correct this with the
elaboration of a new employment policy and the esta&'lishment of a new institution, the Agence d'etudes
et de promotion de 1'emploi (AGEPE), a labor market information and analysis center, as well as an
employment promotion institution.
13.           Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project is to improve the country's
economic competitiveness through the enhancement of labor productivity and employability. It would
support Government's efforts in three key areas : (i) training, retraining and apprenticeship; (ii) training
outreach support; and (ii-) labor market monitoring and analysis. Project support in these areas would
contribute to (i) greater labor force productivity and mobility through technical and basic skills training,
with special emphasis on the needs of small informal sector and women's enterprises; and (ii) the
Government's capacity to monitor and analyze labor market conditions, relevant to the formulation of an
adequate labor force development strategy, including the improvement of the skills match between labor
supply and demand.
14.           Proiect Description. Following a time-slice format, the proposed IDA Credit would
finance:
(a) Training. Retraining and Apprenticeship (US$13.8 million) would support training activities
aimed at (i) increasing the productivity and competitiveness of small, micro and informal sector firms,
with a particular focus on women-managed firms; (ii) enhancing the employability of long-term
unemployed and retrenched workers from public and private enterprises; and (iii) easing the transition
from school to work for numerous school leavers and graduates. To achieve this, the project uould assist
FDFP in (i) extending the coverage of the continuing vocational training system beyond its traditional
clientele of medium and large formal sector enterprises and addressing, following a strictly demand-driven
approach, training needs of small/micro-enterprises and of the informal sector; and (ii) supporting training
and consulting activities to upgrade and adapt the skills and other aptitudes of the unemployed, school
leavers and graduates to the needs of the economy and assist in their search for jobs.



5
(b) Training Outreach Support (US$0.9 million including PPF financing) would support FDFP's
efforts to publicize its activities and inform the potential beneficiaries and sponsors of the services
available. This would be achieved through site visits and canvassing, dissemination of printed materials
and extensive use of the media.
(c) Labor Market Monitoring and Analysis (US$2.3 million) would support (a) the institutional
development of the Observatoire de I'Emploi, des Metiers et de la Formation (OEMF), including staff
training and recruitment, consulting services, and equipment, and (b) a program of activities involving
the following: (i) the review, gathering and processing of all available information from various sources
(surveys, administrative registers, and other existing databases) and the necessary technical assistance;
(ii) a program of specific surveys and studies to be carried out in collaboration with employers or
contracted to private sector firms, and (iii) the regular and timely production and dissemination of short-
term and long-term statistics to allow for the monitoring, on quarterly, annual and multi-annual bases,
of changes in employment, labor costs, productivity, and skills requirements.
15.          Project Imnlementation. The proposed project would be implemented over four years.
Components A and B would be managed by the FDFP, which is mandated by the Government to
administer the apprenticeship and continuous vocational training taxes. These two taxes were, prior to
the creation of the FDFP, managed separately by the Office National de la Formation Professionnelle
(ONFP) anci the Fonds National de Regulation (FNR). The establishment of FDFP resulted from a
decision (supported as a key condition of the FY92 Human Resources Development SECAL) to pool the
revenue of the two taxes into a single "fund', to be managed independently of the Government by a board
with equal representation of employers, employees and Government. Both ONFP and FNR have now
been officially liquidated and FDFP effectively began operations in early 1993. It has since prepared
financing for some 88 training programs with a cost of about CFAF 1.5 billion. It is administered by
a 12-member tripartite Management Committee (Government, employers, and unions), each of them
represented by four persons, and overseen by the Ministry in charge of Economy, Finance and Planning.
The FDFP is currently structured to receive, evaluate, finance and monitor sub-projects efficiently, and
does so. Its current staffing of some 33 persons, includes 10 professionals; among these 9 are training
specialists. Its present capacity, subject to an increase in project evaluation staff by four professionals,
would be fully adequate for managing the additional t.aining requests (now running at an annual rate of
some 150). However, considering the increased emphasis to be given to gender-specific concerns, FDFP
would be encouraged to employ female professionals to participate in the evaluation process. FDFP
would --valuate, finance and supervise the implementation of sub-projects based on conditions outlined
in its operations manual.
16.          AGEPE would execute Component C.  As a Commercial and Industrial Public
Establishment (EPIC), AGEPE is expected to provide services for fees, and to seek a large proportion
of its resources from other sources than the Government budget. These sources include public and
private national and international institutions, FDFP, and external aid. As activities develop, AGEPE
is establishing its organizational structure and the recruitment of its personnel, who in large part is
selected among the most highly qualified professionals from the Office de la Main d'Oeuvre de COte
d'lvoire (OMOCI) and ONFP. AGEPE will resort, as needed, to local and international consultants to
assist in the execution of its program of activities. AGEPE's present capacity to carry out some labor
market survey activities is progressively building up and data collection teams for the 1994 National
Manpower Survey (an establishment-based survey) have already been fielded. The project would finance
staff training and systems development of the OEMF, one of the two services of AGEPE, with the
objective of obtaining a flow of information and advice to policy makers, private sector firms and other
agencies and institutions involved in labor market issues and labor force training. The Regional ILO
Office has confirmed ifts interest in supporting this initiative with its own program, in parallel wit. ' *.



6
17.           Proiect Sustainability.  FDFP is thus far supponed through earmarked taxes for
appreniticeslhip and continuous training, to which it has direct access. With low overheads relative to the
actual budge; fOr training purposes. Fl)FP appears to be a finanicially sustainable institWuton. An
assessinent of its techinical capacity supports this conclusion. The increase in activity under the project
would require a 25 lpercenit increase in FDFP recurrent operating budgets (persotnme plus operating
overhead) to about 8 percent of- its total budget. Should, following project completion, the increase in
opcraong expenditures bezonme uinsustainiable, FDFP's flexibility in reducing staffing and theretore
operating expendimres woald permit a quick return to a balanced budget.
18.           Lessons Learned from previous Bank/IDA involvement. This project is the first of
its kinld in Cote d'lvoire although the Bank-supported FYEt; Regulatory Reform and Cotrpelitiveness
(IPASCO) and Iluman Resources Development Progranms (HRDP) have provided important lessons. I'he
main lessons learned from  Bank's involvemient in VET in C6te d'Ivoire are related to its low internal
efficiency, low enrollment with regards to capacity and level of investment (and therefore high unit costs),
and weak links with the !abor market requiremetits. More recently, the HRDP addressed the major
causes of the poor performance of the forrmal a-A informal education and training system and stressed
its lack of relexanlce, its inability to anticipate changes in the structure of the labor force of the country
and future employment opportunities resulting from  weak links with employers.  The tripartite
management structure of FDFP and its financing respond to many of the lessons learned in C6te d'lvoire
and elsewhere which suggests that, for technical in-service and pre-service training to be effectively
demand-driven, it should be directed with the stakeholder fully repre'ented, and financed through what
amounts to a user charge. The project would be incorporated into this system. The project would also
rely on motivated self-interest on the part of potential beneficiaries, which is consistent with !essons
learned from successful "social fund" type activities. In addition however, the project incorporates
special assistance to help "formalize" and strengthen the ability of the self-motivated to access the Fund,
which has beenl idenltified as a possible risk to improving contact with NGOs and the informal sector in
C6te d'lvoire. Transparent and well-publicized criteria and operating procedures would guide the
operation of the project, which is consistent with a demand-driven approach.
19.           Rationale for IDA Involvement. Over the la3t few years, the Bank has argued with the
Government on the need to adopt policies which will allow to restore competitiveness of the economy.
To this end. it has financed two adjustment operations --the FY92 Financial Sector and Regulatory
Reforrn and Competitiveness SECALs-- to achieve market conditions which favor growth. A third FY92
adjustment operation, the Human Resources Development Program, explicitly recognized the necessity
of improving vocational and technical training performance, both in-service and pre-service, to provide
the quality in tfe labor force (human capital) required by a competitive and growing economy. Among
other provisions, it included the fusion of management of the apprenticeship and the continuation of
training taxes under a unified tripartite Board. Government met this condition by inaugurating the FDFP
and consolidating the revenues from the two taxes into a readily accessible account outside the Treasury.
The Government has also embraced the Bank-recommended policy on technical and vocational training,
and has begun the process of introducing a demand-driven approach to these training services at the pre-
secondary, secondary and post-secondary levels. The proposed project would provide a next step in this
process and - ould help consolidate the new policy, and further advance training of women as part of the
overall sectoral strategy. The Bank is also impressing upon Government the need for addressing issues
relating to poverty alleviation through the creation of remunerative employment, advancing women's
participation in development, and encouraging self-help initiatives for vulnerable groups. Information
and Know-how are key elements in dealing with these issues. At present, initiatives are being taken
through various NGOs to address these issues. The project would provide an additional vehicle for a
flexible response to the many needs for information and know-how that these socio-economic groups
have. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) note will be presented to the Executive Directors on June



.7
28 in the context of a proposed Economic Recovery Credit (ERC). The CAS will confirm that the
proposed project is an integral part of said strategy.
20.           Agreed Actions. Conditions for credit effectiveness consist of: (is the establislmnent of
an Outreach and Promotion service in FDFP by Decree: (ii) the assig -ilent of qualilied staff in adequate
numbers to FDFP's Training Outreach and Promotion service- (iii) the .;ansmittal of the activity program
and a set of performance criteria for the FDFP's Outreach and Promotiorn service; (iv) the signature of
a contract or contracts by FDFP and AGEPE with independent auditors for the auditing of FDFP's and
AGEPE's accounts; (v) adoption by the FDFP's Managemenit Committee of ai operations manual
ensuring the implementation of FDFP's activities and acceptable to the Association; (vi) reception by the
Association of an opinion satisfactory to the Association of auditors acceptable to tihe Association.
confirming that FDFP is and will not be liable for any past. present or tuture liabilities incurred by any
of the Borrower's agencies involved or previouslv involved in vocational training and in particular FNR
and ONFP; (vii, reception by the Association of the FDFP's 1993 fiscal year audit report; (viii) execution
oi- the financing agreement between the Government and FDFP for making available to FDFP the relevant
amounts of the proceeds of the Credit for the implementation of the activities to be carried out by the
latter, and (ix) assignment of qualified staff in adequate numbers to the Observatoire de I'Emploi of
AGEPE.
21.           Environmental Aspects.   The project is not expected to result in significant
environmental impact and has been assigned Category C.
22.           Program  Obiective Categories. Poverty Reduction: The poor in C6te d'lvoire are
characterized by a low level of human capital as measured by their general and vocational
education/training and a limited access to emplovment. The project would permit many bere-ficiaries,
among whom a significantly greater proportion of poor l han in the population as a whole, to acquire labor
market relevant vocational skills which would enhance their employability, productivity, and earnings.
For this reason, the project is part of the Program of Targeted Interventions.
23.           Women in Development. Women represent only 8 percent of formal employment but
make up the large majority of workers in the informal sector. The project, by reaching out and
supporting training of workers in the small and micro-enterprises and informal sector firms, would
provide women with greater opportunity to enhance their human capital, productivity, and earning
capacity.
24.           Project Benefits: The direct project benefits are increased labor skills upgrading and
improved labor productivity from more widely available training opportunities for larger labor force
groups. It is difficult at this time to estimate the number of individual beneficiaries of the project or the
impact of the project on their lives, overall labor productivity, and the economy. This would, however,
be estimated during annual progress reviews, in a mid-term review and various evaluation studies of
project outcomes, conducted by independent analysts. As a proxy, however, at least 50 percent of the
project funds would be expected to be allocated to training needs of informal sector beneficiaries, of
which 75 percent would be for training women entrepreneurs and 25 percent would be allocated to the
small formal sector firms who have not recently embarked on personnel training programs.
25.           Risks: The principal risk of the project is that the demand for and the quality of the
training provided would be insufficient to have a significant impact on the productivity of the labor force.
While there is evidence of unmet demand, expressed by prospective sponsors (training institutions, large
formal sector employers, chambers of commerce and industry, NGOs and women's associations), this
demand and the capacity of the sponsors to effectively mobilize beneficiaries is not fully proven. The



8
project would, therefore, provide for the services of advisors in outreach activities to reinforce FDFP's
capacity to assist sponsors in their functions, Concerning quality, FDFP assesses the credentials of
tiaining providers wvho wish to provide training services. Some 125 are currently on a continuously
updated list ot 'pie-qualitied lirms. FDFP also collects inforination on public sector training providers
and uEes it as a quality control device. While apparently satisfactory at present, the range of specialties
covered is relatively linlited. As demand grows, and as the range of training proposals increases, there
is a r'sk that the FDFP's capacity to verify thic quality of trainers will decrease. This is particularly true
where greater atlenition to the value of training for women is concerned. To mitigate against this risk,
the project will p~ {vide for periodic consultations oni training quality. Tlhis will be snonitored as a regular
part of project i nplenientation.
26.            Recommendationi: I am satisfied that the proposed Cr edit would comply with the Articles
or Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

IMPLENIENTATION ISSUiES
The overall performance of the C6te d'Ivoire is adequate. anad there are no major implementation
issues. Project implementation and disbursements have slowed down, however, owing to lack of counterpart
funds. A number of actions have been taken to address generic implementation issues, some of which are
the result of the first CIR which took place in June 1993. The Government has established a monitoring
committee consisting of members from the Ministry of Finance and key sectoral ministries which would look
into matters concerning procurement and disbursement. As regards procurement, the Direction des Marches
Publics (DMP) of the Ministry of Finance, the national tender board. has prepared a draft documnent
containing administrative rules, procedures and requirements. for the eventual use by task managers to reduce
the time to complete the procurement cycle which, in turn, would allow for speedier project implementation.
A similar exercise was organized by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), the debt agency of the
Ministry of Finance, as regards disbursement procedures.
A three-day procurement seminar was also conducted in June 1993 for about 40 project and DMP
staff in the context of the CIR. This seminar was also used as an opportunity to discuss with DMP the
Bank-'s Standard procurement documents. Similarly, a disbursement seminar was conducted to discuss with
CAA in detail the issue of special accounts which had not been replenished for some time. Following this
seminar, improvements have been made to regularize most of the outstanding special accounts. In the context
of the Labor Force Training Support Project, a procurement training workshop on Bank guidelines and
procedures for the use of consultants was organized in May 1994 to famniliarize FDFP's staff with Bank's
proiect implementation procedures. This training workshop will be financed through a PPF,
