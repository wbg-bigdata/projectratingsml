REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$3.0 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a technical assistance project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Review of the Economic
Situation of Nepal" (Report No. 1180-NEP) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 30, 1976. The principal findings and conclusions of this
report are included below. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income in 1975 was
estimated at $111 per year and the literacy rate at about 14%. Serious
efforts toward development have been underway only since the 1960s. Develop-
ment expenditures have increased rapidly from NRs 232 million in 1964/65 to
NRs 967.2 million in 1974/75. About half of this has been financed with
external assistance, notably from India, the United States and the People's
Republic of China. About 80% has been in the form of grants.
4.        Nepal's economic growth has been slow.   From 1965-67 to 1973-75, the
average annual rate of growth of GDP was only 2.2% in real terms.   During the
same period, population increased at a rate of just over 2%. There was,
therefore, hardly any increase in GDP per capita. Agriculture accounts for
about two-thirds of GDP, 80% of export earnings and about 90% of employment.
Foodgrain production has grown at a lower rate than population since the
mid-1960's. If present trends continue, domestic consumption per capita or
exports of foodgrains will fall. Nepal is currently exporting over 200,000
tons of rice a year, accounting for about 60% of export earnings. Some pro-
gress was achieved in manufacturing, but this still accounts for only 3% of
GDP.
5.        This slow growth largely reflects Nepal's difficult mountainous ter-
rain and limited resource potential, as well as the priority given to major road
development with long gestation characteristics. This priority was probably an
inescapable necessity. When the country began to come out of its isolation in
1951, it had no transportation and hardly any trained people to administer

- 2 -
economic development. At least one generation was needed to build the basic
physical and administrative infrastructure required for successful development.
In that respect, substantial progress has been achieved.
6.        In the past, only 20% of public investments was made in the directly
producing sectors, largely in the Kathmandu Valley, and, to a lesser extent,
the eastern Terai plains. The development of the Kathmandu Valley, where 4%
of Nepal's population lives, has been a success story. New cultivation meth-
ods have been widely adopted and the farming community is enjoying an improved
standard of living. With the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1975/76-1979/80), Nepal has
shifted its priorities toward the productive sectors including the more quickly
yielding area of its very substantial hydroelectric potential. Half of planned
development expenditures is tentatively allocated to agriculture, rural develop-
ment, industry and power. The agricultural objective of the Fifth Plan is
greater balance in regional growth and more equal income distribution. Largely
because of the spillover of large infrastructure projects from the Fourth
Five-Year Plan and absorptive capacity problems, the country may experience
serious difficulties in redirecting its development along this new and very
pertinent course; initially, the Government will, therefore, have to concentrate
its new development emphasis on a limited number of quickly yielding projects.
7.        Nepal is handicapped by its landlocked location in Central Asia.
The country depends on India for most of its requirements of capital goods,
manufactured consumer goods and raw materials. In recent years, when India
experienced raw material shortages of its own, Nepal felt compelled to pro-
tect its development momentum by importing fairly large quantities of cement
and fertilizer from overseas. At the high prices prevailing at the time, and
due to high charges for overseas freight and transit through India, these
imports resulted in a sharp increase of the trade deficit. Until the end of
1974, the trade deficit had been more than offset by remittances and pensions,
interest on external reserves and tourism. Over this period, balance of
payments surpluses amounted to about $10 million a year and foreign exchange
reserves were at the comfortable level of $139 million in November, 1974 (more
than 12 months of imports). However, because of the increase in overseas
imports at high prices and a concurrent increase in the outflow of private
capital, foreign exchange reserves declined to $105 million by September,
1975. Although the reserve level has stabilized since then, satisfactory
balance of payments management will be difficult unless Nepal succeeds in
increasing its foreign earnings and obtaining increased foreign assistance.
8.         The deterioration in the external payments position induced the
authorities to devalue the Nepalese Rupee against the U.S. dollar from
NRs 10.56 to NRs 12.50 in October, 1975. Rates for other foreign currencies
are established daily by the Nepal Rastra (Central) Bank on the basis of the
parity rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies. The parity rate
with the Indian Rupee remains unchanged. This selective devaluation was
addressed to the problems of increasing earnings of convertible foreign ex-
change and reducing the demand for such exchange, encouraging labor-intensive
investments, reducing the diversion of trade through unofficial channels,

restoring the profitability of jute exports and increasing revenues in Hill
areas by enhancing the rupee value of pensions and remittances received mainly
by retired Gurkhas who had served abroad.
9.         This action followed measures in April, 1975, to strengthen domestic
resource mobilization. Consumer subsidies on basic commodities, such as rice
and sugar, which had been growing rapidly, were almost entirely rescinded.
More recently, the authorities have substantially raised electricity and water
charges from previously very low levels. In addition, the interest rate struc-
ture was reformed to increase private savings and rationalize resource alloc-
ation. This reform entailed an increase of the two-year fixed savings deposit
rate from 9-3/4 to 16% per annum. Lending rates of commercial banks were
raised to 15-18% per annum and those of financial institutions to 10-16%.
These rates were introduced when the rate of inflation was about 20% a year.
Fixed deposits have increased markedly since then and the inflation rate has
declined to 8% a year.
10.       It may be possible for development expenditures, including foreign
assistance, during the Fifth Plan (between 1975/76 and 1979/80) to reach about
$500 million (in 1974/75 prices), i.e., about 40% more in real terms than dur-
ing the previous plan (1970/71- 1974/75), but 10% less than the Government's
minimum program and 30% less than the maximum program. The main constraint on
reaching the investment target is not only finance but also inadequate ability
in Nepal to prepare and implement projects. Close consultations between the
Government and foreign donors will, therefore, be needed to determine not only
the right composition of development assistance but also the technical advice
required for building up the domestic ability to prepare projects.
11.       At the same time, the Government will have to continue its efforts
to increase domestic saving. Due to poverty, slow economic growth and the low
degree of monetization of the economy, revenues have remained at a relatively
low proportion of GDP. In the light of these constraints, the 7.3% annual
growth rate of revenues (in real terms) during the last five years gives proof
of a commendable revenue effort. Even if revenues continue to rise at the
same rate, however, budgetary savings are likely to decline gradually as a
proportion of GDP. The reason is the expected sharp increase in recurrent
expenditures in social sectors, especially in education, increased maintenance
and management costs of previous infrastructure investments, and additional
administrative outlays required to strengthen Government services. As a
result, domestic resources are unlikely to finance more than about 40% of
projected public investment in the next five years. Since it would be impru-
dent for Nepal to draw down its foreign exchange reserves to any large extent,
the Kingdom will have to rely largely on foreign financial assistance for the
remainder of the investment program. In view of the scarcity of domestic
resources, it is desirable that foreign financing continues to be in grants
or highly concessional credits and to include part of the local currency
requirements of development projects.
12.       The prospects that aid will be forthcoming in the required amount
appear favorable. As noted in paragraph 3, the bulk of foreign aid has been in



the form of grants. As of December 31, 1975, official foreign debt amounted
to only $120 million, 28% of which were IDA credits. Of the $120 million,
$86 million remained undisbursed. This low utilization is largely due to the
fact that 80% of foreign loans has been contracted since 1970. Consequently,
debt service was about $1.5 million in 1975 or equivalent to about 2% of
exports of goods and services. However, future assistance may increasingly
take the form of loans. Most of them will probably be on concessionary terms,
which is highly desirable in view of Nepal's poverty and limited export pro-
spects. In view of the accelerated development efforts, external public debt
is expected to rise and, based on the trend in recent years, may reach about
$350 million by 1980, of which approximately 50% could be in IDA credits. The
total debt service ratio by 1980 is, however, projected to remain below 10%.
Debt service to the Bank Group alone would be less than 1% of exports of goods
and services.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
13.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million equiva-
lent was made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed by
credits for highways ($2.5 million), tourism ($3.2 million), irrigation ($6
million), a second telecommunications project ($5.5 million), a water supply
and sewerage project ($7.8 million), a settlement project ($6.0 million), a
power project ($26.0 million), a rural development project ($8.0 million), and
a groundwater project ($9.0 million). The proposed credit would bring the
total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to $78.7 million equivalent, net of
cancellations. No Bank loan has been made to Nepal. IFC made its first in-
vestment in Nepal (US$3.2 million) in a hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of June 30,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing IDA projects. It shows certain
delays in the implementation of these projects, particularly during the in-
itial periods. These delays are largely due to Nepal's limited technical and
managerial capabilities. In order to assist Nepal in coping with this con-
straint, considerable technical assistance is being given in the form of in-
puts of staff time in Washington, from our Resident Mission in Kathmandu, and
during frequent missions to Nepal. As a result, improvements in project im-
plementation and the rate of disbursements are being realized. During FY76,
$2.8 million were disbursed, compared to $4.3 million disbursed during the
previous six years. However, there is scope for substantial further im-
provement.
14.       The Bank Group's objectives in Nepal are designed to: (a) place ma-
jor emphasis upon directly producing sectors, particularly agriculture; and
(b) continue assistance for the development of complementary infrastructure,
including feeder roads, communications (particularly between the Hills and the
Terai), and hydroelectric power.
15.       Preparation work is being carried out for a number of projects,
including a third irrigation project, a DFC project, a second water supply and



sewerage project and a feeder roads project. In view of the institutional con-
straints on development and shortage of trained personnel in Nepal, technical
assistance and training would be important components of these projects.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
16.       Nepal's limited absorptive capacity at every stage of the project
cycle is a major constraint on its development. It has restricted Nepal's
ability to make full use of aid available from bilateral and multilateral
sources, as few projects have been available which are adequately prepared for
investment decisions by these agencies. Project selection, in turn, has
sometimes been decided on the basis of available studies or the preferences
of donors, rather than on the basis of development priorities, causing mis-
allocation of some of the limited resources available.
17.       Nepal is trying to raise the currently very low levels of productiv-
ity of agriculture on which the majority of the population depend for their
livelihood. Furthermore, the Government is elaborating a program to diversify
agriculture into high value cash crops, partly for export, and to increase
the range and efficiency of agricultural and other industries. To this end,
there is an immediate need to generate and prepare projects suitable for
external financing and to enhance project preparation capability.
18.       Project preparation units exist in technical ministries.    They were
recently supplemented by the creation of two quasi-government consulting or-
ganizations: the Agricultural Projects Services Center and the Industrial
Services Center - both of which are designed to investigate and prepare pro-
jects within their sectors for comparatively small-scale investments and to
assist government agencies in project preparation. However, Nepal does not
have a sufficient number of trained, experienced personnel to staff these
units adequately while, at the same time, meeting the needs of project exe-
cution to which the Government has, rightly, given highest priority in the
allocation of its most highly qualified staff. Thus, the capacity of the
ministerial units and the two agencies together is inadequate for the task
of formulating projects on the scale the Government considers necessary.
The proposed credit would augment this capacity by providing technical as-
sistance, through these units and agencies, for the preparation of pre-
investment studies.
19.       While bilateral agencies and the UNDP are expected to continue to
provide most of Nepal's requirements for technical assistance, the level of
need is beyond that which can be expected of these agencies over the next
two or three years, particularly because of the financial constraints under
which UNDP will be operating during this period. Thus, the proposed credit is
intended to supplement the technical assistance funds available from UNDP and
other multilateral, as well as bilateral, sources in order to narrow the gap
between these resources and Nepal's technical assistance needs.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       The proposed project would assist the Government in the prepara-
tion of feasibility studies, design and engineering work in order to develop
a pipeline of high priority projects suitable for financing by IDA and other
donors. The proposed project would also assist in the strengthening of in-
stitutions responsible for project preparation and implementation through
the provision of consultants and training. It would be completed by the
middle of 1980.    A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
21.       Funds from the proposed credit would be allocated to specific sub-
projects by mutual agreement between the Government and the Association (Sec-
tion 3.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement (DCA)). Sub-projects have
not been specified in detail with a view to maintaining flexibility in imple-
mentation, but are expected to fall primarily into the agricultural, agro-in-
dustrial and industrial sectors. Investment possibilities include: minor
irrigation, horticulture, livestock, textiles and flour-milling. They would
form part of the pipeline of projects for consideration by the Government
and external agencies through 1981.
Organization and Implementation
22.       Consultants would work directly with and for the technical minis-
tries and other appropriate Government agencies in project preparation.
The Foreign Aid and Program Division of the Ministry of Finance is the
Government's agency for coordinating all foreign aid. Although it is not a
large Division, it has competent, qualified staff. The Division would be
responsible for ensuring effective coordination of the various government
ministries and agencies involved in the implementation of the project (Section
4.01 (b) of draft DCA). The Foreign Aid and Program Division would have
ultimate responsibility for the screening and selection of the studies to be
undertaken. The consultants employed shall be satisfactory to the Association,
and their terms of reference and the final contracts between the Government
and the consultants would be subject to agreement between the Government and
the Association (Section 4.02 of draft DCA). Consultants' terms of reference
would emphasize the importance of training local staff so as to reduce the
need for foreign technical assistance in the long term. It is expected that
most of the technical assistance would be provided by foreign consultants.
However, qualified local consultants may be used either independently or in
collaboration with foreign firms. The Association would also provide assist-
ance to the Government in supervising the work of the consultants.
Project Cost
23.       Although proposed subprojects have not as yet been fully identi-
fied, it is expected that approximately ten studies would be prepared under
the proposed project. Total cost of the studies would amount to about US$4.0
million equivalent, US$2.7 million of which would be in foreign exchange and
US$1.3 million in local currency. For a program of studies of this size, the



- 7 -
Government contribution in counterpart staff to work with the consultants, plus
equipment and facilities, would amount to approximately 25% of total cost
or about US$1.0 million equivalent.
Disbursement
24.       The credit would finance 100 percent of the total costs of consult-
ants, whether foreign or local, and whether hired directly or as sub-con-
tractors, and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for equipment and materials
for sub-projects. Credit funds would also be available for financing the
foreign exchange cost of training programs associated with project preparation
and implementation (Section 2.02 (b) of draft DCA). Equipment and materials
required to carry out sub-projects would be procured on the basis of inter-
national competition under procedures consistent with the World Bank Group
guidelines (Section 3.03 (a) of draft DCA). Equipment and material cost-
ing less than US$10,000 equivalent may be procured through normal Government
procedures, provided that the total cost of such procurement does not exceed
US$100,000 equivalent (Section 3.03 (b) of draft DCA).
Benefits and Risks
25.       The major benefit of the proposed project would be the building up of
a pipeline of projects suitable for financing by the Government and external
agencies. This, in turn, should help Nepal make more effective use of domes-
tic and external resources for the development of its economy. The proposed
project would also assist in enhancing project preparation capabilities of the
technical ministries and associated agencies, and in the long term, reduce
dependence on foreign assistance for these purposes.
26.       Risk in implementation of the project arises mainly from the lengthy
decision making process within the Government which could cause delays in ap-
pointment of consultants. In order to reduce this risk, the Foreign Aid and
Program Division of the Ministry of Finance would be responsible for ensuring
effective coordination of the various Government agencies involved (paragraph
22). Ultimately, the proposed project would not benefit Nepal if the Govern-
ment and external agencies fail to act on the pre-investment studies. Consider-
ing the general shortage of well prepared projects, and taking account of the
prospects for the formation of an aid coordination group for Nepal later this
year, these risks are regarded as slight.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text



of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. Features of special interest include those
referred to in paragraphs 21, 22, and 24 of this Report.
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-
Credit No. 166  - Telecommunications Project US$1.7 million Credit of
November 10, 1969; Effective Date: February 26, 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974 - Revised Closing Date:
September 30, 1976
This was the Association's first project in Nepal. In the early
stages, there was delay in setting up the Nepal Telecommunications Board,
later converted into a corporation (NTC), followed by delays in obtaining
expert assistance with consequent delay in procurement. There have also
been delays in civil engineering work. Satisfactory progress has been made
over the last four years and almost all the facilities to be provided under
this project are now in service, more than two years behind schedule. Very
real progress has been made in developing a satisfactory organization for
the sector and NTC showed its first profit in FY 1974.
Credit No. 223  -   Highway Project US$2.5 million Credit of December 21,
1970; Effective Date: February 3, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975 - Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Initially, project implementation was delayed mainly due to land
acquisition difficulties and a national shortage of cement and fuel. With
a delay of about eighteen months, the last of the five project road bridges
and the remaining two of the five porter suspension bridges are expected to
be opened in 1976. All project road maintenance equipment has been received
and is now part of the Road Department fleet. Equipment workshop construction
has been slow due to contractual difficulties stemming from price escalation;
however, workshop construction should be completed by the end of 1976. Bid
prices, although above appraisal estimates, are within contingencies. Total
project cost is approximately 11% above appraisal estimate. In view of the
effect of general inflation on the benefits, this is not likely to affect
the rate of return. The project is expected to be completed by the end
of 1976.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken. They should
be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Credit No. 291 - Tourism Project US$3.2 million Credit (Net of
Cancellation) of March 22, 1972; Effective Date:
November 9, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1975
Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Due to delays in appointing qualified architectural, engineering,
and project management consultants, and repeated changes in scope proposed
by the sponsors of the sub-projects, the project is two years behind schedule.
Construction of the Yak and Yeti sub-project is underway and is expected to
be completed by January 1977. On the other hand, it was not possible to
reach a firm agreement with the sponsors on an appropriate revision of the
Annapurna sub-project, and $1.0 million of the Credit was cancelled from the
original allocation ($2.88 million) for that sub-project. The remaining
$1.88 million would meet increased costs of the Yak and Yeti sub-project and
finance feasibility studies for further tourism facilities outside the
Kathmandu Valley.
Credit No. 373 - Birgani Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the project was initially delayed by the Govern-
ment's delay in appointing consultants for detailed engineering and con-
struction supervision, slow field surveys, and procurement difficulties.
Contracts to the value of 20% of the total under the project have been
awarded. After a slow start, present progress is satisfactory. Cost-over-
runs are approximately 50% of appraisal estimate. The Project remains viable
in view of increases in agricultural commodity prices, and is expected to
be completed by late 1978.
Credit No. 397 - Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior
management, and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been delays
in procurement and the project is, to date, about 12 to 18 months behind
schedule. Good progress is now being made with the assistance of consultants
and experts provided through the British Overseas Development Ministry and
present estimates allow for completion by December 1979, about 6 months be-
hind schedule.
Credit No. 470 - Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$7.8 million Credit
of May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
Project implementation is proceeding with approximately 20% of the
contracts awarded. Tender documents for the major contracts have been ad-
vertised and bids received. Because of recent price escalations, significant



ANNEX II
Page 4
cost overruns are expected. The Government has requested that we investigate
the possibility of financing remaining cost overruns as part of a second water
supply and sewerage project. Pending determination of major tender prices,
other possibilities being considered are Government financing of the increased
costs or reducing the scope of the project. Implementation of the project is
proceeding satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by June, 1978.
Credit No. 505 - Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14,
1974; Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing
Date: July 15, 1982
Project implementation is more than a year behind schedule due
to delays in signing and making the credit effective; also due to delays
in preparing bidding documents. Supervision has recently been intensified
in order to accelerate project implementation. A short-term action pro-
gram is being prepared by concerned agencies which will set out land clear-
ing and settlement proposals for the 1976/77 dry season. Action has also
been taken to accelerate the winch lorry procurement and training program.
Credit No. 600 - Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project US$26.0 million Credit
of January 9, 1976; Effective Date: May 18, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Consultants (Nippon Koei of Japan) have been appointed for field
investigation, detailed designs, specifications, tender documents, procurement
and supervision of construction. Prequalification of contractors and prepara-
tion of bidding documents for civil works are underway.
Credit No. 617 - Rural Development Project US$8.0 million Credit of
April 30, 1976; Effective Date: July 16, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This credit became effective on July 16, 1976.
Credit No. 654 - Bhairawa-Lumbini Groundwater Project US$9.0 million
Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: November 9, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This credit is not yet effective.
