CEIMPER 1                  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1.1          The Study Background and Objective
This Environmentl Impac Assessment (EIA) and associated Environmenml Management Plan (EMP)
have been produced in the frame of the Project Preparation relevant Eo the Irrigarion Suh-Sector
ProjecL Hoc Mon - North Binh Chanh Sub-Projece funded bv the Italian Government through a
Technial Assistance executed by the lnternational Bank for Reconstrucion and Development (IBRD
or World Bank or Bank).
The objective of the Project Preparation is thaL of up-grading the knowledge on all perinm aspects
related to the planned development of the Hoc Mon - North Binh Chanh Sub-Project for the appraisal
of the IBRD, regarded by the Governmemt of Viemam (GoV) as a possible source of financing
through a Loan expected to be negotiated in current year 1994. Since the regulations preailing within
the Bank stipulate, among others, the-availability of an EIA and EMP as a pre-condition for Loan
appraisal by the IBRD. a Team of Foreign Consultants. familiar with the Bank's procedures and
working in close assocation with a number of Viemamese Expers made available by the difrent
Agencies invoJved, was assigned to carry out tht Project Preparation, which specifically included. in
addition to several other tasks. the EIA and EMP.
Tbese EIA and EMP provide an analysis of the possible negative impacts of the planned Project
works on the physical and human environmenrs of the study area. discuss off-site aspects likl:y to
advesely affect the planmed development and recommend measures to eliminate or mitigate any
undesirable effect.
The EIA was prepared by a Team comprising one Foreign and three Vienamese Expemts. All
concernd instituions in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Long An Province. in whose territory the
Project area is comprised. were approached at each given stage of the study to jointly evaluate the
quality of the available information. identify the potential negative impact and propose adequate
remedial measures.
1.2          Approach and Methodology
The Project was classified as belonging to the World Bank Category A. thus requiring full EIA for
IBRD appraisal.
The EIA developed through:
a.    an initial examination of the environmental issues:
b.    data collection. field surveys and investigations. review of available publications and
papers:
c.    data analysis and processing, visits and meetLias with concerned Agencies.
identification of the potential environmental impact:
d.    identification of protection measures                           -
e.    preparation of the environmental management plan.
The study was carried out in the full respect of the prevailing Vieutamese environmental regulations
of May 9th. 1993. generally found in accordance with the guidelines issued bv the Bank on the same
maters. Consultations and review meetings with the concerned Government Agencies took regularly
place to achieve general consensus on the findings and proposed recommendations.
EIA - Chapter 1                                                                 1-



Tlhe criticai environmenail issues in need of a rirm solucitin nernre mne Prniecr is implemenced were
rirmlv identified. Particular attention was paid to the ENIP. which not onlv contains proposals for Ehe
elimination or mitigation or the negative impacts. but also suggests the organizational and
adminisrrative scenario within which remedial actions should be carried out. The definition of an
Environmental Monicoring Program  during construction and operation is included  in che
Environmental Management Plan.
All environmentl costs were included in the Project economic and financial analysis. carried our as
a separare item of work of the Project Preparation.
1.3          Project Description
The Project Area isee Figure l.1) is located in the territories of Long An Province anu Ho Chi M inh
City. between the Van Co Dong and Saigon Rivers. with gross and net areas of 21.783 and 15.807
ha. respectively. Morphology is fairly flat. with elevations ranging from 0. 15 to 3.50 masl. Although
the elevation range is very narrow. the Project Area is subdivicled into low and up-lands. situated
below and above elevation l.0l masi. respectively. The scope of work for Loan preparation was
established in 16.266 ha of low land only (net area: 12,197 ha). However. the enmire Project area
( low-land and high-lands) has been considered by the EIA/EMP and Feasibilitv Study
The main source of freshwater for the proposed subproject is the Saigon River. regulated since 1985
bv the Dau Tieng Reservoir in its upstream course. In the viciniqy of the proposed subproject. both
Saigon and Van Co Dong rivers are influenced by tidal water level fluctuations. which govern the
water nlow in the Project area under both irgation and drainage conditions. With Tri An reservoir
on the Dong !ai river releasing about 200 m&Js and Dau Tieng releasing about 25 n'/s in the drv
season. salinitv intrusion in the Saigon River has retreated by about 20 km to Phu An. allowing
freshwater to tlow into the upper Project area. Tidal saline flow. however, still intrudes in the lower
Project area through a number of water ways in communication with the sea.
The works proposed for implementation in the low-lands. shown in Figure 1.2. include:
a.    Consruction of thirteen 113) major sluices and nine (9) small weirs;
b.    Rehabilitation of 52.6 km of existing Main Canals and construction of 1.8 km of new
Main Canals. including appurtenant head works ;
C.    Rehabilitation oft 10.1 Ikm of existing Secondarv Canals and construction of 39.8 km
tlf new Secondary Canals, inciuding appurtenant head works:
1.    Rehabilimtion of 193.0 km of existing Tertiary Canals and excavation of 172.1 kIm
of new Tertiary Canals, including appurtenant head works:
e.     Rehabilitaton of 8.9 km of the exisEing West Drainage Canal:
Erection of 42.8 km of dikes for saliniTy and flood control:
g.    Construction of five (5) new drainage pumping stations along An Ha Canal:
h.    On-farm development of 12.197 ha:
Rehabiliation and/or consmtction of infrastrucrures. such as bridges along main
zommunication arteries. car and foot bridges.
it shouid n'e stated before hand that some of the above figures mighc be revised .ince the irrigaaion
iesign. now *ngoing. is compieEed.
A Water Balance Smdv was carried out in the frame of the Project Preparation. The Study assessed
hat the available fresn water resources at the Rach Tra inamke on the Saigon River are sufficient :o
saris v the requirements of the proposed 12.197 ha of irrigation development.

1.4          Project Alternatives
The Holc-Mon North Binh Chanh Project initiated in the late 60's. aiming at improving the socio-
economic. agricultural and environmental conditions of the nriginal swampy area. Pull Project
development has heen. sofar. prevented by un-favourable factors. such as the presence of acidic soils.
saline water intrusion and insufficient fresh-water supply. These negative conmponents are expected
to he eliminated by the Project. hased also on the planned re-habilitation wnrks of Dau rieng
Reservoir.
Nn tither alternative has been considered for the development nf the area.
Ilowever. in the final definition of the Project lay-out. soime alternative design options were
considered. such as:
a.    Urban Development: some areas previously included in the agricultural development
were eventually excluded. on the ground that three urhan resettlement pmgrams are
planned to he implemented therein in the medium-long term (year 2010). These
resettlment sites will definitely benefit frnm the Pmject development;
b.    Disposal or Addty : alternative solutions were studied for the safe and controlled
disposal of the acid effluents in the Project Area and downstream region. including
an alternative freshwater supply system to the Canal C area through the rehabilitation
of an existing canal in the up-lands and the construction nf a separate drainage system
to eliminate acid effluents. The twn snlutions were excludedl on the basis (of technical
and ecnnomic considerations:
In cinclusion. the Project represent. the optimal solution to the physical and envirmnental constraints
aifecting the area. Lnng term environmental benefits will be generated. improving the socio-economic
condition of the ptopulation and environment of the Project Area. tlus achieving the pre-set objective.
The nnn-development nptinn will translate into persistence of pnor water qualilv. much longer perind
for full snil reclamation. under-explnitation of the available water resources and. ultimately. no real
agrricuilural (levelcipment. Tlle non-development optinn will fuirther depress lhe socio-economic and
environmental condition of the entire area. possiblv resulting in migration oif the rural population.
1.5          Fnvironment Affected by the Proiec
I  I l       Prorile or tile Stuldy Area
In addition tn the Prqect Area pmper. the Environmental Study Area (see Figure 1 .3) includes the
catchment of the Saigon River upstream of the Rach Tra intake and the downstream portion or thc
Saigon and Vam Co Dong River. down to their cnnfluences into ilte Dong Nai river. The Study
Area extenids over 6.034 km", located in the Provinces nf Sting Re. Tay Ninh. I ICM City and Long
An. IICMC is the major center. The area shnws a tropical mnnson. climate. with a pronounced rainy
season from May to October and a dry season frnm December to April. Mean annual rainfall in the
upper catchment reaches 2.200 mm. while 1.900 mTn are recorded in H1CMC.' with almost 90%
occurring in the rainy season.
About 92% of the Studv Area lies in the territnry of Vietnam and the remaining 8%. correspondingE
to the upstream portion nf the Dau Tieng watershed, in that Of Camhndia. The ipopulatinn totals
approximately 4.9 millinn people (or 813 penple/km2). with 63% living in the urban area of 11CM
City (22.300 people/kn9) and an additinnal 12% in the surrounding. denselv populated districis.
E;IA - Chapter I                                                                  I

Thc population density of the upper catchment area of the Saigon river reaches 160 peoplelklcm. The
rate of population growth in the study area averages 2.41 ¶6, higher than the national growth rate of
2.1 % for the period 1980-1990. Immigration from rural into uTban areas, especially HCMC. still
continues. In the rural areas. agriculture is by far the most important activity, engaging approximately
60-70 % of the population and contributing for 45 to 50 % of the local economy. In the urban area
of SCM City. only 12% of the labour force is occupied in agriculture. contributing for only 5 % of
the provincial gross product.
Only 16 % of the land is classified as forest land. Agricultural land accounts for about 44 9G of the
total area. while 28 % is grown with a nual crops (paddy) and 16 % with perennial crops (rubber.
banana and others). Unproductive land (rivers, rocks, grassland. shrubland) covers 24% of the area.
other land and special land occupy 6 % and settlements another 6 ¶6. The forest land is mainly
located in the norther portion of the Dau Tieng watershed. in the Districts of Tan Chau. Loc Ninh
and Binh Long. Most of the unproductive land comprises grass land and open land located in the Dau
Tieng watershed. Perennial crops can be encountered on the left side riparian land of the Saigon river
while annual crops are grown on the right side of the same river, in rainred land and irrigated areas
availing of water releases from Dau rieng.
The 2.700 km" of the Dau Tieng catchment lies for 33 ¶6 in the Province of Tay Ninh. 50 % in the
Song Be Province and 17 % in Cambodia. The estimated population amounts to approximately
245.000. wih an average density of 90 peoplek/m2. Population growth and pressure on the land have
steadily increased in the last decades. Only 25 % of the watershed is forested, on the assumption that
the portion in Cambodian territory is forested for about 50 ¶6. The fnrest area in the Vietnam portion
amounts to 435 knt. 290 km' and 145 kmZ of which are situated in the Song Be and Tay Ninh
Provinces. respectively. Some 29 % of the area is devoted to agriculture, while unproductive lands.
mainly degraded forest areas. occupy 31% of the area. Any further timber logging is banned in the
Dau Tieng watershed. Furthermore, the Goverment launched in 1989 a large-scale reforestatimn and
protection program aiming at achieving a reforestation coverage of 70% of the area.
1.52         Environment In the Project Area
Seventy five (75 %) and twenty five (25 %) percent of the Project Area, extending over 217 km;. are
located in the low and up-lands, respectively. About 78 % of that area lies in the territory of HCM
City. Districts of Hoc Mon and Binh Chanh, while the remaining 22 % is situated in the Lnng An
Prnvince. District of Duc Hoa.
the Project Area. comprising seventeen (17) villages and 5 State Farms, is populated by 1281000
people with population density of 587 person/knl. A higher density is prevailing in the up-lands of
Hoc Mon District. It is worth noting that the Prnject Area was previously un-inhabited, but its
average population growth in the last decades was higher than that of HCM City (2%). due to the
relatively high rate of immigration. However, emigration to the urban area has recently occurred.
The present characteristics of the Project Area from the environmental point of view are briefly
presented below.
a. Socio-Economic: About 70% of people in the arei rely on agriculture for a living
howevCr, the labour force of almost all families is also employed in non agricultural sectnrs.
The results of the socio-economic survey on farmer families show that the educational level
of the population- is medium to high, although some cases of illiteracy can still be
encountered. The labour force includes an average of 3.7 potential units per family. 70% of
them employed in agriculture. 30% in other sectors. A substantial part nf the field activities
is carried out by family members, since the average availability of Family labour largely
exceeds the individual farm requirements.
EIA - Chapter I                                                                I - 7



Under-employment of the farmers' family in agriculture is evident, only partially compensated
by complementary activities, such as gardening, orchard, animal husbandry and others. The
revenue from on-farm agricultural activities was estimated in 2.8 million VND/ha.
corresponding to 44 % of the family budget An average per-apita revenue of I million VND
(90 US S) was assessed. Conditions of sanitation and water supply are poor.
b. Soils and Agricullure: Soils affected by acidity amount to roughly 70 % of the area,
subdivided into actual acid sulphate soils (54 %). potential acid sulphate soils (9 %) and
greysoils (7 Z).
Salt intrusion is encountered in about 31 % of the area, but the lands seriously affected do
not exceed 13 %.
Grey soils on old alluvium nccupy 31 % of the Project Area. located for the majority (24 %)
in the up-lands of the Hoc Mon and Binh Chanh Districts. Grey-soils affected by acidity
(about 7 % of total area) exist in the "transition zone" between low and up-land.
Alluvial soils in the Project area are classified in two sub-groups:
- I.- aeric Tropaquepts, covering 4 % of the area;
ii.   tropic Fluvaquents, present in 1.4 % of the area.
About 64 % of the Project area is covered by acid sulphate snils, which are characterized by
a high pyritic (Fe S.) and acidity levels, generated by the exposure of the pyritic layers to
oxygen. The acid sulphate soils are subdivided into:
1.    Actual Acid Sulphate (ASS) covering 53% of the area and differentiated into
slight (15 O). moderate (20 %) and strong (19 %) ASS:
1T.    Potential Acid Sulphate Soils (PASS) occupying 9 76 of the total area and
differentiated into moderate (8 ¶6) and strong (I %) PASS.
Strong and moderate actual sulphate soils. accounting for 39 % of the Project area. have been
partially (75 % of the total area) reclaimed during the past 10 to 15 years by State Farms and
farmers with the raised bed system (UP system)-
A cropping intensity of about 105 ¶6 has been computed for the overall Project area An
intensity of 150 % was assessed for the up-lands. where farmers use groundwater. while that
in the low-lands reaches 92 %. with large areas of raised-bed occupied by perennial crops.
Higher cropping intensities are prevented by water logging, lack of frcshwater and salt
intrusion, affecting large portion of the Project. Approximately 5.300 ha in low-lands and 430
ha in up-lands are provided with a surface irrigation system, which. however. appears largely
incomplete. inadequately operated and poorly maintained. Perennial crops such as banana.
pineapple, sugarcane and eucalyptus are prevailing in the low-land ASS areas. The dominant
rice-based system is practiced by the farmners in the remaining area. Farmers practices and
input application are quite adequate and rather homogeneous thmughout the Project area.
c. Vegetation: Natural vegetation has almost completely disappeared. substituted by new
crops/plantations yielding economic benefits. Fruit and timber trees are planted in the hnme
gardens and along the river and canal banks. roads and paddy field rims. The substitute
vegetation mainly includes annual and perennial crops, Eucalyptus and Acacia forests. Natural
vegetation, such as Nymphaea, Nelumbium. Eleoacharis. Phragmites and wild oryza
acsociations, is still present in a few patches nf waste-land. in and along the water bodies.
I1- 8                                                               EAIA - Chapter I



The area occupied by natural vegetation, however, is of little. if any. significance and no
conservation reserve exist in the vicinity of the Project. Blackish. water-adapted species
(Sonneratia. Bruguiera Achanthus, Cryptocoryne and Cypeus) arc distributed along the
fringes of canals. Three most significative eco-systems are the Nypa Fructicans Wumb and
the Nelumbium Nelumbo Druce (Lotus).
d. Water Quality: Water quality is one of the most important constraints affecting the
development of the area. 1the quality of surface and ground water is influenced by the tidal
regime. saline water intrusion, presence of acid sulphate soils and. to a lesser extent, human
settlement and activity. The waterways of the project form an interconnected canal and creek
systen subj ct to a semi-tidal flucation regime. governed by the Saigon and Van Co Dong
rivers. Water quality and aquatic ecosystem are influenced by the meeting points of flows.
defined as the points in the canals where tidal waves fron two opposite directions meet.
Salinity during the low-flow season (from January to May) is still affecting the lower portion
of the Project area. Acidic enviromnents and high concentrations of Fe, Al and SO, are
evident along the Thay Cai and An Ha canals, with acidity peaks recorded during the wet
season (Ph - < 4). The construction of the An Ha sluice is expected to have a major impact
on the water quality of the Projeat area by favouring the inflow of freshwater.
e. Ground Water Quality: Exploitable ground water resources are available in the up-lands
of HCM City, concentrated in two aquifers. 20 to 40 m and 80 to 120 m helow ground level.
respectively. The superficial aquifer is sensitive to hardness. sulphate. salinity (Binh Chanh
District), iron and acidity (Hoc Mon District). Some organic and microbiologic contamination
is presenL Both aquifers are suitable for potable water, provided that a management program
is effectively implemented.
f. Aquatic Environment ; The tidal lows identify four aquatic crologic zones:
3.   ffeshwater zone. from  Rach Tm to Saigon river, with rather fresh water
environment, slightly acidic and oligosaprobe. showing a good potential fnr
fishery development;
ii.   acidic zone, including Thay Cai. Thai My, Xang, Ngang and A canals.
characterized by high acidity, relatively high contents 'of Fe and Al:'.
indicating a low potential for fishery development, except for species very
resistent to acidity:
iii.   transition zone in An Ha and Xang canals. Ben Luc (downstream portion)
and Vam Co Duong rivers. Water in this zone is acidic during the wet season
and neutral in dry season:
iv.    brackish zone, including Ngang canal. Cho Dem creek up to Can Giunc
creek. characterized by dry season salinity (5 - 10 'I.), low acidity and
sewerage contamnination.
In general. the productivity of zones iii. and iv. is low, due to the unstable environment,
seasonal changes of salinity and acidity. lack of plankton. Seasonal immigration of fish from
the sea takes place in zone iv.

1 .53        Environmentally Sensitive Issues
a. Acid Sulphate Soils: agricultural development of the Pmject Area is mainly associated
with the reclamation of acid sulphate soils. Specific environmental issues may he associated
with the Project implementation in acid sulphate soils, since acid leached during soil
reclamation may cause damage to soils, structures, downstream vegetation. aquatic habitats
and human safety.
b. Pollution: the available information, including a complementary survey on soil and water
quality carried out during Project Preparation, shows that some areas. especially those located
in the up-lands. are sensitive to and affected by pollution, mainly caused by the vicinity of
HCM City urban area. Off-site environmental issues can be identified in uncontrolled solid
waste disposal in the up-lands and uncontrolled wastewater discharge into the Thmn Luong
Creek.
c- Water Resources Qmuaity : surface and groundwater quality in the area is generally poor.
due to the presence of acid sulphate soils. salt water intrusion during dry season, lack of
facilities for treatment of domestic and west, solid waste disposal and uncontrolled wastewater
discharge from outside the Project Area.
d. Aquatic Ecology: aquatic ecology of the Project Area was reviewed. Although nnt
particularly valuable. aquatic ecology represents a natural resource with some economic
value. Water uses include small scale fishery, transportation. domestic uses (bathing.
1aundrying) and aesthetics. The need is evident to preserve and possibly improve the aquatic
ecology and water uses in the Project Area and downstream of it.
e. Human Settlements and Health : A large population lives and works in the Project Area.
making extensive use of the natural resources (soils and agricultural land. vegetation. water
Tesources). Although the environmnt has alredy been affected by human presence and
activity, irreversibly modifying the natural conditions, the need is evidenl to preserve and
enhance the present environmental resnurces to prevent further deterioration and guarantee
acceptable long-term living conditions for the population.
r. Upper Catdhent - the conditions of the upper Saigon river and Dau Tieng watersheds.
although presenting a lower population density than in other areas of Asia. have deteriorated
in the last decades due to population encroaclunent, wars and uncontrolled exploitation of
natural resources, such as forests and wildlife. A correct management of the upper watershed
is, therefore. essential to properly utilize the water resources potential of the area.
1.6          Environmental Issues and Remedial Measures
The EIA considers all significant environmental issues associated with irrigation development projects
along with possible off-site influences which have the potential to adversely affect the project. E.ch
of these issues was evaluated in ternms of its significance for the proposed project, namely critical.
moderate and minor.
I - 10                                                                ETA - Chapter I



1.6.1        CruIcal Issues
a. Conversion or Add Sulphate Solis: It is widely acknowledged that measures influencing
the soil water regime and on-farm water management procedures genemrly represent the main
tool for soil reclamation. Liming and other agronomic practices play a subsidiary role only.
The environnwntal issue translates into an increased acidity and toxicity caused by the
reclamation of acid sulphate soils. the construction on new canals. leaching-out of natural ASS
profiles and possible low6ring of the ground water table due to excavation of drains and
construction of sluice.
In the case of the Hoc Mon - North Binh Chanh Project, however. soil reclamation will not
be carried out under extreme or un-manageable conditions. since 75% of the total
moderate/severe actual ASS (5,000 ha), were reclaimed in the past and critical situations are
evidenced in only 1.300 ha. Furthermore, although dredging is planned to be carried out
under the Project for all existing canals, new excavation is limited to 15 % of secondary and
50 % of the tertary, only. No impact of the planned works on the ground water table is
expected and. finally, a very acidic environment already exists in most of the Project area.
Although it is virtually impossible to avoid generation of acidity and temporary lower water
quality in an acid sulphate soil enviromnent, some strategies have been studied to minimize
the issue, such as:
-     reclamation by stages of strong ASS:
-     use of fireshwater to wash out the acidity and consequent. temporary reduction nf
cropping intensity;
-     monitoring of ground water level to avoid oxidation of the pyridc layers;
-     high standards of construction for canals and embankments.
b. Disposal Or Construction Material: Disposal of dredged and excavated material from
the canal rehabilitation/construction might prove a critical environmental and agronomic issue
in lands where acid sulphate soils are encountered due to the expected high contents of
acidity and toxicity present in that material. The disposal management plan was reviewed and
appropriate remedial measures included, following the practice normally applied in the
country. Part of the disposable material will be re-utilized in the construction of the canal
embankment and part will he transported to disposal areas along the primary and secondary
canals. The combined extent of those areas is preliminary estimated in 214 ha. Measures tn
mitigate the possible negative effects of that practice on the environment. such as construction
of dikes and ditches in and around the disposal area, fair crop compensation for a number of
years to the farmers owning those areas. assistance to the same farmers tn accelerate the soil
recovery therein and monitoring of fertility recovery are included in the nverall disposal
management plan.
c. Drainage and Disposal of Acid Sulphate Soils: Drainage of acid effluent from the Acid
Sulphate Soils of the Project area into the downstream region might affect the water quality
and aquatic environment The negative impact of this issue on the surrounding environment.
however, could be less serious than originally expected. due to:
i.    the aquatic environment in most of the Project area is already affected by acidity:
ii.   the aquatic environment downstream from the Project area is affected by unstable
conditions (seasonal acidity and salinity) impairing the fishery pntential therein:
iii.   drainage of acid water will peak during construction and soil reclamatinn. hut will
steadily decrease thereinafter.
E1 A - Chapter 1                                                               1-l



Strategies for safe and, to a certain extent. controiled discharge of acid waters have heen
studied to minimize the impact on the surrounding environment. Among them:
1.    establishment of a lay-out for the canal net.work minimizing the mixing of freshwater
with acid effluent;
11.   identification of appropriate systeM operation during the wet and dry season tn ensure
safe drainage of acid waters outside the Project area.
The mathematical model for drainage flow shows that the acid effluent will reach the final
destination (Vam Co Dong river) with minimal, if any, accumulation in the canal system.
During the dry season, a temnporary increase of acidity in the downstream canal system will
occur during the flushing periods ; in the wet season, increased acidity is expected in the
Ngang canal and, to a lesser extent, Cho-DemnBen Luc River. A negligible impact, however.
is anticipated on the rather poor aquatic environment of that area.
d. Liquid EMuent Disposal: This envitonmental issue is related to the uncontrotled
wastewater discharge in the Tham Luong Crteek, departing from the external urban and sub-
urban districts of HCM City and entering into the Link Canal at Tan Tao bridge. he E/IA
reviewed the flow characteristics. drainage ara, present situatimn and future plans for
sewerage and drainage of the ham iLuong Creek and associated Ba Hom system. It emerged
that:
i     the Tham Luong water is polluted by domestic and industrial w&stewater discharge
from the urban and sub-urban districts of HCM City;
-.i   some short to medium term pollution hazard for the Project area may result due to
accumulation of toxic elements;
iii.   the system will play an important role in the drainagelsewerage system of the external
suburbs deriving from the planned expansion of HCM City;
iv.   the planning of the sewerage system to improve the water quality from the
environmental point of view is still at master plan level. Low priority is attnbuted to
the sewerage system by the City Authority due to budget constraints.
Considering the above situation. it was decided, in agreement with the City Authority. tn
physically separate the contaminatd and potentially polluting waters of the Tham Luong/Rach
Chua/Ba Hom system from the Hoc Mon - North Binh Chanh water through the construction
of three small sluices at Tan Tao. This measure will protcmt the Project from all the negative
off-site effects caused by the vicinity of a heavy populated and industrialized area.
e. Off-Site Environmental Factors : Other environmental factors having a potential.
negative impact on the Project were identified in :
i     the solid waste disposal in the Hoc Mon and Binh Chanh high-lands. It is estimated
that over 60 % of the HCMC solid waste is disposed in the lloc-Mon and Binh
Chanh high-lands, with organic matter re-utilized by farmers with beneficial effects
for agriculture. The process. however, resulis in hazards to human health.
contamination of the ground water table and accumulation of toxic and inorganic
residues in the soils. An environmental compatible solution to this issue is among the
development prinrities established by fth HCM City Authorities. hut financial
constraints are jeopardizing the implementation of the necessary remedial measures.
1- 12                                                               ETA -Chapter I



It should be mentioned, however, that the review of all environmentl issues affecting
HCM City, including solid waste disposal as a top priority, is scheduled to start in
August 1994 under external assistance. It was, consequently, decided that project
implementation in the up-lands of HCM City should be postponed until completion
of that study.
ii.    future expansion of HCM City suburbs after year 2000 is anticipated by the Master
Plan nn the Urban Development of HCM City, prepared by the City Planning
Institute (CPT) and approved by the Central Government in Hanoi-
Immediate consideration was given to the settlement areas proposed by that Master
Plan, which were not retained for development under the Project. Furthermore. the
EIA reviewed the Master Plan. to ensure that future expansions of 11CM City will not
affect the Project arTe.
1.6.2        Sigmificant Issua
a. Pesticide Use: On-farm pesticide managment in the Project area is rather poor and very
little, if any, extsion activity is carried out to improve practices. The aveage spraying dose
is often less than recommended. but. during pest attack. much higher doses are applied. With
the anticipated rapid agricultural development caused by the pmject works. related
investments and increase of the area grown to up-land crops (vegetables). pest control will
play a crucial role in ensuring that the andcipated benefits are attained by the farmers. To
protect the environment and allow a viable econmdic managemnent. it was agreed that the
implementation of an IPM program for paddy and up-land crops shnuld be included in the
Project scope of worlk
b. Fertilizers Use: Correct use of fertilizers is an important factor in the achievement of the
agricultural potential all throughout the Project area, where soils are poor in phosphates and
relatively poor in nitrogen. This basic concept is clearly understood by the farmers and full
provision of irrigation will likely cause an increase in the use of fertilizers. However. the
increased contents of nutients in water bodies might cause eutrophication of ponds and
canals. thus giving rise to a prolific growth of aquatic plants. including algal blooms.
reducing the contents of dissolved oxygen. The contents of -NO,. in the superficial water
bodies of the Project area is rather low. Some contamination of the superficial ground water
aquifer. 20 to 40 meter deep, is apparent in area intensively cultivated with vegetables. In
conclusion, no major impact is to be expected from the application of the suggested rates of
fertilizers. As a matter of fact, most of the fertilizer, applied at the suggested rate, will be.
utilized by the crops. Nutrients concentration in surface and ground water,-however, will have
to he kept under control.
c. Water-Borne Diseases: A common hazard, typical of water resnurces developments in
tropical countries, is represented by the creation of a favourable habitat for insects
transmitting diseases, such as malaria. Only villages iocated in the Binh Chanh District are
affected by mosquito-borne diseases. The incidence of malaria in Hoc Mon District is, by br.
les-s significant than other gastro-enteric diseases. deriving from the poor sanitation conditions.
No major alteration of the hydrologic regimen will be caused by the Project and, therefore.
no major out-hreak of malaria is expected as a direct Project impact. However it is
recommended that the nocurrence of malaria and other water-borne diseases be kept under
control, in the frame of the environmental monitoring plan.
EIA - Chapter 1                                                                 1 -13



d. Management of Aquatic Ecosystem: Sonme impact on the aquatic ecosystem will he
generated by the change of hydraulic regimen and acid effluent in the Project area and
downstream region. The situation is likely to stabilize in the long term. resulting in better
environment for fishery development. It is recommended that a fishery development progrm
be implemented in the frame of the Project, to assist the concerned fishermen during the
transition period. expected to last 5 to 10 years. In addition to mitigating the possible negative
impact of the Project. although temporary, the program should enhance the potential for
fishery in the Project area, where a remarkable number of farmers has shown interest for such
activity.
e. Other Issues Related to Construcion: Monitoring during construction will he carried
out as part of the environmental component intended to, among others purposes. detect any
unexpected damage to the physical and human envimnment. Funds to off-set unforeseen
damage have been planned. It was suggested that the resistance of cement to the anticipated
acidic environment he tested before final decision is mude regarding the technical
requirements of cement in stuctres located in ASS.
r. Public Consultation : In addition to the property assessment and survey relevant to
- resettlement and land acquisidon, the awareness and perceptions of die beneficiaries an the
Project was investigated in the frame of the socio-economic survey carried out from
December 1993 to January 1994 on a sample of about 300 farmers. Tle survey dealt with
family and labour force composition, education, farm size and owner-ship, land use. crop
development and family income. The results of the survey show that the large majority of the
people interviewed are favourable to the Project and willing to participate and pay for
incremental O & M to support therecovery of operation cosL
g. Management Or Saigon River Watershed: The preservation and management of dt
upper watershed of the Saigon River is considered by the ETA upon request by the IBRD in
relation to the possible involvement of the Bank in the operation and management of the Dau
Tcng Dam and reservoir. The Dau Tieng reservoir is the source of freshwater for the Hoc
Mon North - Binh Chanh Project. A watershed management program was launched by the
Government to enhance forest resources, extensively damaged by past human action.
According to the data collected. yet to be confirmed, the implementation and effectiveness
of that ambitious -management program appears hindered by the limited financial resources
available to the concerned Provinces. A re-orientation and strengthening of the program is
needed, if the targets are to be met within a reasonable time-span.
1.7          Environmental Management Plan
1.7.1        Scope
An overall management plan is being proposed in the frame of the EIA in order to ensure that all
protection measures planned at feasibility and detail design stages will effectively be implemented
during construction and operation. The scope of the managetnent-plan is as follows:
a.    planning of all environment-related programs;
h.    definition of coordination and management responsibilities:
c.    definition of a viable institutional set-up, with the participation of all cnncerned
Gnvernment Agencies:
d.    monitoring, control and fnilow-up actions.

2            INTRODUCTION
2.1          Environmental Impact Asesment
2.1.1        Background
This Envirnmnental Impact Assessment (EIA) and associated Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
have been produced in the frame of the Project Preparation relevant to the Irrigation Sub-Sector
Project, Hoc Mon - North Binh Chanh Sub-Project, funded by the Italian Government through a
Technical Assistance executed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD
or World Bank or Bank).
The objective of the Project Preparation is that of up-grading the knowledge on all pertinent aspects
related to the planned development of the Hoc Mon - North Binh Chanh Sub-Project for the appraisal
of the IBRD. regarded by the Government of Vietnam (GoV) as a possible source of financing
through a Lean expected to be negotiated in current year 1994. Since the regulations prevailing within
the Bank stipulate, among others, the availability of an EIA and EMP as a pre-condition for Loan
appraisal by the IBRD. a Team of Foreign Consultants, familiar with the Bank's procedures and
working in cilse association with a number of Vietnanese Experts made available by the different
Agencis involved. was assigned to carry out the Project Preparation. which specifically included, in
addition to several other tasks, the EiA and EMP.
These EIA and EMP provide an analysis of the possible negativc impacts of the planned Project
works on the physical and human environments of the study area, discuss off-site aspects likely tn
adversely affect the planned development and recommend measures to eliminate or mitigate any
undesirable effect.
The EIA was prepared by a Team cmprsing one Foreign and three Vietnamese Experts. All
concerned institutions in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Long An Province. in whose territory the
Project area is comprised, were approached at each given stage of the study to jointly evaluate the
quality of the available information. identify the potential negative impacts and prnpse adequate
remedial measures.
The EIA was carried out according to the methodology described below and involved detailed surveys
and field trips and visits to the area. A number of meeting and discussions were carried out-with all
involved government agencies: among others, the Environmental Committee of 14CMC, the Institute
of Ecunonmc Research. the Environment Protection Center. the City Planning Institute, the Preventive
Medicine Center. the Forestry Department of Tay Ninh and Song Be. various institutions of the "CM
City and Long An Agricultural Services etc.
The EIA team worked closely with the project team, making the best use of the available information
and ensuring that recommended environmental masures are incorporated in the plan. The main
purpose of the ElA was to ensure that the feasibility and detail design planning give adequate attentinit
to the environmental parameters. not only for project design but also For project construction and
operation, including environmental monitoring.
2.12         Approach and Methodology
The project was belonging to thie World Bank Category A (requiring full EIA) for IBRD appraisal.
The methodology followed for the ETA is the one recnmmended by the main international financing
agencies (TBRD. ADB). to assess the environmental impact of large irrigation schemes.
EIA - Chapter 2                                                                2 - I



Salient references. including previous studies studies in the areas, other Vietnamese references and
other I13RDIADB publications were used.
.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The EIA developed through:
a.    An Initial Environmental Examination of the Pmject, which purpose was to identify the
significant environmental issues, based on available documentation and field.visits: the initial
environmental examination was partecipated by the IBRD pre-appraisal mission.
h.    Data collection, field surveys and investigation in the districts and in the Province; feview or
available publications and papers on the critical and significant environmental issues:
c.    Data analysis and processing, identification and assessment of the potential impact and
environmental constraints affecting the project area; visits and meetings with concerned
Agencies to discuss the studty findings;
d.   Identification of specific environmental proction measures and incorporation thereof into the
project planning, cost estimate of protection measures;
e.   Identification of the enviromental managanent plan, including institutional and organization
setting; review and discussion with the local agencies:
An important aspect of the followed approach is to indicate which of the environmental issue is
critical and need a Firm resolution in order to proceed with the project implementation. For the other
significant issues. furdwr studies may be needed but none of these should jeopardize the project
implementation.
The critical environmcntal issues in need of a firm solution before the Project is impleiented were
rirmly identified. Particular attention was paid to the EMP. which not only contains proposals for the
elimination or mitigation of the negative impacts, but also suggests the organizational and
administrative scenario within which remedial actions shouW be carried out. The definition of an
Envirnnmental Monitoring Pmgram during construction and operation is included in the
Environmental Management Plan.
All environmental costs were included in the Project economic and financial analysis, carried out as
a separate item of work of the Project Preparation.
2.1.3        Magnitude of the Study
Most of the local experts part of the preparation team were involved in the EIAIEMP. to cover
various aspects related to the environment. Therefore the EIA was completed with the collaboration
of a soil specialist. an hydrauliclwaste management engineer (local coordinator), an aquatic biologist,
a forestry(watershed management specialist and an institutionalist for an aggregated assignment nf 4-5
mrm; the EIAIEMP was coordinated by the foreign environmentalist who spent approximately 2 mim
on this activity. Tle present EIA has been carried out in close collaboration with the concerned
divisions of the Survey and Company n.2 and the agencies of the HCM City Agricultural Service.

1.7.2        Institutlonal Strengthening
The environmental protection component will be implemented under the responsibility of the Project
Management Council and its Executive Committee. Main tasks of the environment component are:
a.    planning and management of all environmental protection measures;
b.    definition of environmental standards and their integration in the provincial policy:
c.    evaluation of results of monitoring and follow-up action;
d.    management of funds.
The activity will be supervised by the Environmental Protection Committees of the two provinces,
Representatives of the Provincial Authorities and Ministry of Environment. Science and Technology.
Environmental activities will be mainly carried out by the Provincial Agricultural Services of the
two Provinces through their respective departments, Fishery, Plant Protion. Irrigation Management
Companies, Management Board and Agricultural Extension. An Environmental Impact Assessment
Office (EIAO) shall be set-up to carry out the environmental monitoring.
1.7.3        Environmental Monitoring
The EIAO will be established at the beginning of the Project constructior stage, with the purpose nf
monitoring the program implementation and effectiveness, assessing the program suitability to achieve
the pre-set targets and evaluating the opportunity of policy revision at decision making level. should
the programs require any adjustment.
During the construction period, the monitoring shall focus on the construction activity, including
Contractors' performance in implementing environmental protection measures, disposal management
plan and protection measures, water quality and use, including fishery development, gardening, and
domestic uses as well as effectiveness of the entire environmental program.
Tlhe EIAO's activity will continue after construction is completed. covering all the environmental
issues relevant to nperation. A critical review oF the environmental program. meant to assess cost
effectiveness. to he conducted with yearly frequency, will represent a very imponant component nf
the monitoring exercise. It will also be imperative that the officers in charge of the monitoring
pmgram achieve a complete interface with the local population in order to include the views of the
concerned people in the assessment of the significance and impact of all environmental issues.
Specific monitoring subjeces will he:
a.    fishery prngram:
h.    water resources use for irrigation and other purposes:
c.    impact nn the vegetation and aquatic ecosystem in the Project area and downstream
region:
d.    water quality:
e.    public health in relation to water-borne diseases
f.    off-site environmental factors likely to affect the Project (pollution. solid waste).

1.7.4        Cost of rhe Proposed Environmenlta Proted ion Measures
The cosl of the proposed remedial measures to off-set potential negative environmental impacts is
largely included in tlhe construction and soil management components. separately dealt wiLh. The
additional cost of specific environmental measures during construction amounts to 1.19 million US
S (including 10% contingency) made up by:
a.    compensation to tarmers for the temporary lnss of fertility in disposal areas;
h.    protection measures against unforeseen damages during cnnstruction:
c.    Integrated Pest Management component:
d.    fishery program;
e.    environmental monitoring;
f.    environmental management.
Annual cost auring operation for a period of 5 years after completion of construction was estimated
at 75,000 US S/year, including fishery program, environmental monitoring and environmental
management.
1.5          Conclusions
The EIA for the Hoc Mon - North Binh Chan Project provides an assessment of the possible negative
Project impacLs the human (resettlement excepted) and physical environment of the Study Area.
discusses off-site aspects likely to adverelyaffect the planned development and recommends measures
to eliminate or mitigate any undesirable effect.
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP), including monitoring. was designed to guarantee timely
and effective implementation of the protection measures. Project lay-out was reviewed and cnsts of
specific measures included in the overall budget.
The implementation of the EMP will ensure that no serious environmental prohlems will arise from
the Pmject development in Iow-lands and no off-site environmental factors will prevent returns from
the investment.
Envimnmentally compatible solutions for the HCM City up-lands are planned tn he identified and
implemented hy an ADB Technical Assistance program to control the hazards caused hy solid waste
disposal and liquid effluent in the Mliam Luong Creek.

The above 16.266 ha of Gross Area do not include the three planned resettlements area accounting
for additional 4.265 ha.
The Project area is located in the Long An Province and Ho Chi Minh City territory, between the
Vam Co Dong and Saigon Rivers. with gross and net areas of 21,783 and 15.807 ha, respectively.
The above areas are inclusive of low and high lands. As a matter of fact, the entire Project area (low-
lands and high-lands) have been considered by the EIAIEMP and the Feasibility shtdy.
EIA - Chapter 2                                                                 2 - 3



The Pmrje area is very flat, with elevation ranging from 0.15 to 3.50 masl. Aibout 500 ha in the low-
lands are yearly flnnded for various durations in the period from Septemher to early November.
FinOds are mainly due tn insufficient drainage system. About 128,000 people live in the Project area.
Farm families amount to 19,000 with an average holding of 0.83 ha.
2.2.2        Water Resources
Tne sources of water for the subproject area are the Saigon River and the Vam Co Dong River. The
existing reservoir on the Saigon River at Dau Tieng has a live storage volume of 1.056 millinn
m'lyear and the mean annual inflow from the catchment area of 2.700 km2 in about 1.900 millinn
mWlyear (about 60 m'Js).
In the vicinity of the proposed project. hoth rivers are influenced by tidal water level nuctuatiolvi. The
main source of water for the prposed subproject is the Saigon River. which since 1985 has been
regulated by the Dau rteng Reservoir upstream. Because Dau Tieng's full irrigation potential has not
yet been developed. it has at this time surplus water, some used to over-irrigate the served area while
about 20-25 m3/sec is released from the reservoir in the dry season to repulse salinity intrusion into
the Saigon River.
Prior to the construction of Dau Tieng and Tri An reservoirs, salinity of 4.000 mgil intruded during
low now seahons into the Saignn River to near the takeoff of the Rach Tra canal, the principal
freshwater conveyance canal to the proposed subproject. Since these two reservoirs have been in
operation with Tri An releasing about 200 r'is and Dau Tieng releasing about 25 mlhs in the dry
season, salinity intrusion has retreated about 20 km in the Saigon River to Pliu An. about 8 km
upstrem of the confluence with the Dong Nai . However, salinity intrudes into the subproject from
the saline portion of the Saigon River through the Cho Dem river and also from the Vam Co Dong.
Fresh water supplies to the subproject area depend on dry season flows in the Saigon River. At
present, irrigation demand is limited and dry season releases from Dau Tieng are adequate to meet
the requirements for bnth irrigation and salinity repulsion. especially since completion of Tri An. In
the future, irrigation demands in the suhproject area cumd increase to about 12 m/s (grmss) in the
dry season, and municipal abstractions will also incrse. Although water balances have still to he
rinalised, preliminary investigations suggest that, with the additional dry season releases to the Dong
Nai River provided by Thac Mo, the saline limit will move further downstream. Limited salinity'data
suggest that the direct influence of Dau Tieng releases on salinity in the Saigon River has reduced
significantly since completion of Tri An. It may therefore be possible to reduce the residual fow.
currently targeted for salinity repulsion. downstream of Rach Tra. An additional safety factor is that
improvement of the headworks at Dau Tieng reservoir scheduled to he carried out this year (1994).
which will allow water levels to he maintained near the maximum normal operating level for longer
periods.
This. coupled with the generally abundant inflow to Dau Tieng in relation to irrigation demands at
the present stage of develipment. indicates that if additional dry season supplies in the Saigon River
are required. these could he met by increasing, in the short tcrm. releases frnm Dau rieng.
Fresh water supplies to the subproject area are thercfore not likely to be a constraint on fiuture
devel;sitnent.                                                                    *
2.2.3        Irrigation and Drainage
The two rivers to whichi the subproject area is connected. the Saigon and the Vam Co Dong Rivers.
have slightly different tidal regimes which control the flow in the area. Apparent different amplitudes
and different timing of diurnal tides in the two rivers cause a dominant flow from the Saigon River
intn the Pmjcct area.
2 -4                                                                 ETA - Chapter 2



There are. however, periods during which the flow reverses and saline water intrudes fmm the lower
Saigon and the Vam Co Dong Rivers. The tidal flow regime has been simulated in a mathematical
model by the MWR, applicable to water levels and flows in main and secondary canals.
Recent experience with similar simulation studies in the Mekong Delta shows that tidal irrigation by
gravity is limited to a few hours per day and to land whose elevation is lower than 20 to 30 cm
below tidal levels during these hours. Only low-lying lands not higher than about 0.6 masl can, at
present, be irrigated by gravity: Irrigation of all other land, which represent the vast majority,
requires low-lift pumping. On the other hand, most of the Project area can be drained, albeit more
slowly than the rate of accumulation. Pumped drainage is therefore used to accelerate the rate of
drainage. Tides being the dominant hydraulic driving force in this subproject, capacity requirements
(and shapes) of irrigation and drainage canals and related structures will he governed by the results
of tidal simulation studies.
The area has a network of multi-purpose waterways serving navigation, drainage and irrigation in
approximately 5,300 ha. Thete is however a clear need to increase the drainage capacity as part of
the area is flooded during the rainy season, and to provide effective tidal gated structures in acid-
sulphate soils, to enable maintaining a high water table as required by the proposed soil management
techniques. The irrigation and drainage network is incomplete, and silted up in parts. There are no
sluices to preventsalinity intrusion and permit tidal irrigation and drainage. Most of the control gates
on turnouts are not operable. Tertiaries have no turnouts nor water level control structures and require
clearing, reshaping and rehabilitation. The southwestem part of the subproject area is currently subject
to salinity intrusion during the dry season.
The Hoc Mon - North Binh Chanh system is very uncomplicated from the engineering and structural
point of view. but extrenely sophisticated in terms of operations for both irrigation and drainage. The
proposed water management procedures for soil reclamation and the presence of sluices to control the
salt water intrusion from the South will further contriute to the complexity or the system.
*.2.4        Project Description
Following the policy of the Government of Vietnam in the matter of irrigation and agricultural
development. only canal sy.stems feeding 150 ha or more are eligible to be financed under the future
IBRD Loan. Those commanding less than 150 ha of land will he constructed with Government finds.
The list of all proposed Pmject wnrks. shown in Figure 2/1. includes:
a-    Construction nf thirteen (13) major sluices and nine (9) small weirs
h      Rehabilitation of 52.6 km of existing Main Canals and construction of 1.8 km of new
Main Canals, including appurtenant head works:
c.     Rehabilitation of 2 10.1 km of existing Secondary Canals and construction of 39.8 km
of new Secondary Canals. including appurtenant head works:
d.    Rehabilitation of 193.0 km of existing Tertiary Canals and excavation of 172.1 kin
oF new Tertiary Canals. including appurtenant head works:
e.     Rehabilitation of 8.9 km of the existing West Drainage Canal
f      Erection of 42.8 km of dikes for salinity and flood cornrl:
g.    Construction of five (5) new drainage pumping stations along An Ha Canal
h-    On-farm development of 12.197 ha;
i.    Rehabilitation and/or construction of infrastructures, such as bridges alnng main
communication arteries. car and foot bridges.
ElA - Chapter 2                                                                  2 - 5



It should be stated before hand that some of the above figures might be revised once the irrigation
design, now ongoing, is completed.
The available fresh water resources at the Rach Tra intake an the Saigon River seem sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of the proposed 12,197 ha of irrigation development. Consequently.
implementation of the works does not require a staged development, depending an future scenarins
of water availability, as previously thought.
Strengthening of agricultural support services and institutions, environment and resettlement costs will
cnmplete the scnpe of work of the Loan. The works are planned to he designed and implemented bv
paying special attention to the high levels of salinity, acidity and sulphate, expected to prevail in the
first twn or three years of the Project life. Particular emphasis will have to he given to quality control
during construction. especiaUy for concrete works. Buildings, vehicles and equipment. whose type
and quantity have yet to be firmly defined. are also scheduled to he procured under the Loan to
support the activity of the Irrigation Management Company and other institutionis.
The conclusions of the water balance and salinity studies seem to indicate that the available fresh
-water resources at the Rach Tra intake are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the proposed
12.197 ha of irrigation development. Consequently, implemention of the works does not require a
staged development. depending on future scenarios of water availability, as previously thought.
Wnrks could he carried out simultaneously. Phasing by stages is not dictated by different scenarios
of water availability, but only by the technical requirements descending fmm the proposed soil
management practices.

3            DESCRIPTION OF AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
3.1          The Study Area
In addition to the Project Area proper, the Environmental Study Area includes the catchment of the
Saigon River upstream of Rach Tra intake and the downstream pnrtion of the Saigon and Vam Co
Dong Rivers. dnwn to their confluence in the Dong Nai river mouth. The study area is illustrated
in Figure 311. which is the -Environmental Base Maps for the present study and have been used as
"hackground map" on which the various study findings are portrayed.
The Upper Saigon River Basin is part of the Dong Nai river basin. 2.32 Million km wide catcbment
area. The Study Area extends over 6.034 kmZ and includes the following sub-areas:
(i)       .  Upstream of Rach Tra: it identifies with the catchment area of the Saigon river
upstream of Rach Tra intake. which extend over an area of 4.450 kn';
{ii) -       The Project Area: some 217 km-. of which 162 kmr in the low lands and 55 km2 in
the high lands:
iii)         Downstream  of the Project Area: an area of 1.367 km' located beside and
downstream of the Project Area up down to ihe sea and including HCM City.
The Study area totally lies in the Dong Nai river basin and comprises the Pmvinces of Song Be. Tay
Ninh. IJCM City and Long An. HCMC major center in the study area, situates at the Northern
latitude of 10"21' - I "O8' and at the Eastern longitude of 105'120' - 10702.
The upper part of the Study Area is predominantly hilly. being bounded by the hills of the Binh Long
and Loc Ninh in the est and by Mi Mot hills (Cambndia) in the north. In the intermediate and
downstream portion, the Saigon river hasin comprises both hilly and flat land, the latter is suitable
for irrigated agriculture.
Environmental studies have however focussed on the Project Area. some 217 Km wide gross area.
located in the district of Hoc-Mon and Binh Chanh (lHCMC) and Duc Hoa (Long An Province). The
Project Area is shown in Figure 312. The area downstream of the Project Area up to the sea. have
been studied to a much lss detail and only as far as envirnnmental impact nf drainage waters from
the project are concerned.
The description of the environment affected by the project is carried out accnrding to the following
.squence:
a.     General profile of the Study Area: .(i) Climate and Hydrology. (ii) demographic
profile. (iii) land and natural resources. (iv) Dau Tieng catchment conditions:

3.2          General Profile of the Study Area
3.2.1        Climate and Hydrology
llie study area has a tropical monsoon climate, with a pronnunced rainy season from May to October
and a dry season from December to April when potential evapo-ranspiration exceeds rainfall. Mean
annual rainfall in the upper Dau Tieng watershed is 2.200 mm, in HCMC is about 1,900 mm. with
almost 90% occurring in the rainy season. Mean temperature varies from about 26eC in
December/January to about 29'C in April. The mean monthly minimum temperature is about 21°C
in January. Typhoons are rare in this region.
The study area is the catchment of-the Saigon river, which average discharge at Dau Treng in natural
conditions is about 60 mn1s. The water of the Saigon river is impounded by the Dau rieng Dam.
forming a reservoir of a live storage volume of 1,056 million m'lyear and the mean annual inflow
from the catchment area of 2.700 kme in about 1,900 million m3lyear. Dau Tieng reservoir at present
directly supplies irrigation water to an area of about 44.000 ha. the etumrn flows from nmost of this
area drain into the Vam Co Doug. Main tributary of the Saigon River downstream of the Dau Tieng
dam is the Thi rinh rm. -
Dnwistrean of HCMC. the Saigon River discharges into the Dong Nai River, the mai river or the
area. A dam on the Dong Nai river was completed in 1989 at Tn An. whose reservoir. has a
catchment area of 14.890 km fnr a live storage of 2.640 million nW; the average inflow in Tri An
is 330 m'is. Downstream of Tri An. main tributary of the Dung Nai is the Be river. discharging at
Phunc Hoa 125 ml/s. A new dam on the Be river is under construction in Thac Mo. The Thac MO
reservoir has a catchment area of 2,200 km2 and a live storage of 502 million W'. It is expected tn
increase mean dry season flows in the Be and Dong Nai Rivers by about 50 W/s.
The Vam Co Dong River. laying on the snuth-western portion of the study area. has a catchnent area
at Go Dau of apppmximately 6.000 km2 and an average discharge of 72 nr'/s. with dry season flow
nf 20-40 nr'ls. Downstream nf Go Dau. the Vam Co Dong receives the return flows nf mnost of the
area irrigated by Dau rieng, including-Hoc-Mon North Binh Chanh. The river is highly affected bv
tidal flow which moves up to Blen Ruong-
Prior to the conttructinn of Dau Tieng and Tri An reservoirs. salinity of 4.000 mgll intruded during
lIn flow season into the Saigon River to near the takeoff of the Rach Tra canal. the principal
freshwater conveyance canal to the proposed subproject. Since these two reservoirs have been in
operation with Tri An releasing ahnut 200 ml/s and Dau Tieng releasing about 20 m'/s in the dry
season. salinity intrusion has retrted about 20 km in the Saigon River to Phu An. about 8 km
upstream of the confluence with the Doug Nai . However. salinity intrudes into the subproject from
the saline portion of the Saigon River through the Cho Dem river and also frnm the Vam Co Dnng.
whole salinity level reaches 4.000 mg/l (the maximum salinity tolerated by paddv) during 5 mnonths
of the year (January tn May). and which is connected to the subproject area through the Ben Luc
river. An Ha and Xang canals.
3.2.2        Administrative Prorile and Population
The administrative set-up of the study area is shown in Figure 311. Somnc 92% of the Study Area lies
in the territory of Vietnam, and the remaining 9%. corresponding to the upper portion of the Dau
Tieng watershed. in that of Cambtxlia. In Victnam. some 19% of the study area lies in the Province
nf Tay Ninh. some 42% in the province of Song Be. 19% in H1CM Citv and 12% in Inng An

The demngraphic profile of the Study Area was derived from the data of the municipalities and is
shown in Table 311. The population totals approximately 4.9 Million people (or 813 people/km:).
with 63% living in the urban area of HCM City and an additional 12% in the surrounding densely
populated districts (Hoc Mon. Binh Chanh and Nba Be).
Approximately 720.000 people live in the catchment area of the Saigon river upstream of Rach Tra
intake, at an average density of 160 people/km1r. One million people live in the rural areas of HCM
city and Long An province inside,and downstram the project area, at an average population density
of 7201/kmn and 3.2 million people live in 11CM City urban area, at an average density of 22,300
peoplelkni.
The demographic statistic data show an average population growth rate in the last decade or
approximately 2.4%. The growth rate in Song Be province (3.5%)was higher than in HCM city and
Tay Ninh (2.3% and 1.7% respectively). It is worth noting that the average growth rate of the study
area is higher than the national growth rate of 2.1% for the period 1980-1990. The immigration from
rural areas into sub-urban and urban areas of HCM City, has occurred in the last 4-5 years.
In the rurai areas. agriculture is by far the most importamt activity, engaging approximately 60-70%
of the population and contributing to 45-50% to the local economy. In the urban area of HCM City,
only 12% of the labour force is occupied in agriculture; in the HCM City urban area. 25% of the
population is-occupied in the industrial and construction sector, 30% in the semices (trading, banking,
transpor, administration, public services); the mmaining are under employed, unemployed or
houseworkers. In HCM City, only 5% of theprovincial gross product is produced in agriculture, and
95% in the other economic sectors.
Future development strategies of the rural areas are based on the best and sustainable use of natural
reources and on agro-industrial development strategies, by promoting agro-forestry, rural
industrialization, natural resources based industries and infrastructure facilities.
3.2.3        Laud and Natual Resources
The land classification status has been derived from the land dassification status of the districts and
is shown in Table 312. Only 16% of the lnd is classified as forest land. Agricultural lands accounts
for 44%, of which 28% grown with annual crops (paddy) and 16% with perennial plantations (rubber.
banana. etc.). Unproductive land (rivers, rocks, grassland. shrubland etc.) covers 24% of the-total,
oher land and special land 6% and settlements 6%.
The present land use derived from satellite remote sensing is shown in Figure 313. The renaining
Forest land is mainly located in the northern portion of the Dau rieng watershed in districts of Tan
Chau, Loc Ninh and Binh Long. Most of the unproductive bnd, mainly grass land and open land.
is located in the Dau Tieng watershed and comprises land degraded and/or non forest land.
Agricltural land grown with perennial crops can be encountered in the east portion of the Dau Tieng
watershed and in the Saigon watershed downstream of Dau Tieng and upstream of HCM City.
Annual land includes irrigated and rainted areas; the iigated areas, availing of waters releases from
Dau Tieng or from the Saigon river, are located downstream of the dam, in the Duong Minh Chau.
Cu Chi. Hoc Mon and Ben Cat districts. However large areas in the Hoc Mon. Binh Chanh and Nba
Be and in Long An province are characterized by rainfed agriculture.
Agriculture: Agriculture is performed in almost all the flat land, not utilized by settlemnents. Mnst
important annual crops grown in flat land area are paddy, dry up-land rice, cassava, grnundnut. beans
and vegetables: perennial crops are sugarcane. eucalyptus. fruit tree plantations: the cropping pattern
applied by the farmers largely depends on the availability of irrigation water as follows: if water is
available, triple and double paddy is the common cropping pattern; in ruinfed conditions availing of
groundwater irrigation. one or two paddy crops may be alternated with hean. vegetables and
groundnut In rainfed condition. sugarcane and cassava are the most common crnps.

Perennial crops in the Saigon catchment upstream of the project area are mainly constituted by rubber.
coffee and fruited garden cultivation. For tile first two-three years petiod. farmers intercrnp a
secondary crop (bean, groundnut or upland dry rice) in the perennial tree plantation. The same
intermropping system is performed in tIhe area under reforestation projects.
Full irrigation is performed in the Cnmmnand Area of Dau Tieng reservoir through Dnng canal and
Tay canal. At present. rull irrigation is provided to 29.000 - 30.000 hectares in the Tay Ninl
province. snm1e (If which located in ithe Study area. By continuous irrigation. farmers nay reach hen:
an annual cropping intensity higlher than 200%: therefore double and triple rice crnp system is
performed. Other irrigated areas are located along the Saigon river. in the reach hetween Dain Tieng
dam and Lay Thieu. These Saigon river riparian schemes. are: Von Song Sai of 4.000 ha. Nam Rach
Tra of 2.400 ha and Bac Rach Tra of 5.600 ha.
Almost all lhe land of Song Be province. IICM City downstream of the project area and Long aln is
rainfed. having a cropping intensity equal or lower than 100%: only few areas are double cropped.
most of which availing of grnundwater irrigation.
Forest Resources: The forest coverage of the Saigon watershed decreased steadily from 1945. with
higher rates during the 60's and 70's. l1te forest cowerage of the Vietnam portion of the Dau Tieng
watershed totalled 45% (equal to 121.000 ha) before 1945 and is now reduced to 18%. The most
impmrtant causes bf deforestation were: (i) damages nccurred during the vietnam war. (ii) farmers
shifting cultivation. (iii) excessive timber logging and (iv) soil reclamtion fnr agriculture purposes.
Any rurtlier timber logging is banned in the Saigon watershed. Furthermore the government has
launched in 1989 a large scale reforestation and protection pmject in the Dau Tieng watershed. which
includes two man components: (i) protection of the remaining forest resources and (ii) reforestation
of the non-forest areas. Project target is to reach a coverage rate of 70% inside the watershed (see
Section 5.5.3). Another interesting prnject has been launched inside HCM City. to establish green
cover and prntect the environment in the estuary in Duyen Hai and nther districts. Likewise tlie
previous one. the program seems rather ambitious, since it is expected to reforest/rehabilitate some
90.000 ha in 5 years. So far 3.000 ha and 5.5 million trees have heen planted.
3.3          Dau Tieng Watershed
3.3.1         Administrative Set-tip, Populalion
In 1986 the government. under IBRD support. cnmpleteu the construction or the l)au Tieng dam.
located in the medium reach of the Saigon river. on the border between the Tay Ninh and Song Be
provinces. The catchment area of the Dau Tieng dam is 2.700 kti. The area of the lake crcated bv
the dam. is 200 km' wide and its watershed is appmximately 2.500 km: wide.
The portinn of the watershed in the territory of Vietnani. lies in two different prnvinces and live
districts. Some 33% of the watershed is located in the pmrvince of Tay Ninh. district of Tan Chau
anid Duong Minh Chau: some 50% in the Stng Be provii.ce. districts of Loc Ninh. Binh Lo)ng and
Ben Cat. Tlie remaining 17% of the area is lncated in Cambodia. The administrative set-up of the Dau
Tieng watershed is shown in Figure 3/4.
As shown in Tahle 3/3 the estimated populatinn living in the area amounts to approximately 245.000.
with an average density of 90 people/Knf. ranging between 70 peopnle/Km  in Tan Chau and 150
people/Km2 in Ben Cat District. The population density in the Dau Tieng watershed area is lower
than the other agricultural areas nf the studv area: however high impact nn the natural resources has
occurred in the last decades alsn caused by the population growth and increased population pressure
on the land.

3.3.2        Land Use, Erosion
The morphology nf the Dau Tieng watenrhed is characterized by gently sloping areas surrounded by
hills where main towns are located (Binh Long. Tan Chau. Lac Ninh, Mi Mot). quite a large portion
(200-230 km-). is now occupied by the shallow lake created by Dau Tieng Ham. which average depth
is 30 m. The river profile gradient is approximately 0.2% hetween the river source and the Dau
Tieng confluence. A number of tnbutaries to the main river flow in the lateral valleys; main sub-basin
are: the Tong river in the north-western part and the Xlo and Ca Rai in the North eastern-part. Most
of the watershed area varies between 0% and 15% slope: very small portinns oF the watershed have
steeper slopes
Land use and forest area in the watershed are shown in Table 3/4 and in Figure 3/5: only 25% ..f
the watershed is forested. on the assumption that the portion of the Cambndian territory is forested
by 50%. The ftirest area in the vietnamese portion amounts to 430 km'. 285 km2 and 145 km: .,f
which are situated in the Song Be and Tay Ninh provinces, respectively. Some 29% of the area is
devoted to agriculture. annual and perennial crops; over 31% of the land is un-productive land (non-
forest land). constituted by previously forested land degraded into grassland and shrublanld
Settlements. sprecial land and Dau Tieng reservoir cover the remaining 15% of the area. The land use
of the watershed may he summarized as follows:
Flat-land (agricultural. settlements. other land)     880 km:
Non-forest land                                       730 km:
Dau Treng lake                                        200 km2

In the watershed farmers usually carry out permanent agriculture: however shifting agriculture is
occasionally performed. especially in the degraded non-forest areas. Main crops cultivated are maize.
up-land rice and cassava. The non-forest land  was opened by shifting cultivation. uncnntrolled
grazing. wild fires. all causes nf destruction nf the original vegetatinn and hinlogy. This land is now
vegetated by tree savana and grass land. The bared soil in these areas is not protected. exposed to the
wind and sunshine and rainfall and more sensitive to top-snil erosihon. Open areas are cnvered with
grass and shrubs species which are able to adapt to harsh conditions. The presence nf Saccharwm
.spontaneourn, Phragmices Karka. nmperara cilindrica , Rhynchelvtrum repens. Plzargmiresp.r. and
Cyperus brevifolits have been detecLed. Cloes to villages, farmers fight stream bank and sheet/gullv
erosion covering open land with forage grasses and leguminous.
33.3          Forests and Wildlire
Experience in other watersheds in other Asian countriees shows that unprecedented damagcs have
occurred in the last two decades to forest coverage, due mainly to i) the increased pressure on the
land for agricultural purposes. shifting cultivation and associated burning of forest coverage, and ii)
forest exploitation for timber logging purposes. Damages of the deforestation are evident also in Dau
rieng watershed.
An extensive survey carried out in the frame of the present EIA shows that in the Vietnam pnrtinn
of the watershed. only 43.00 ha of forest are preserved. OF the existing foirest resnurces, 75% is
constituted by secondary wonden forest. the remaining is bamboo forest and reforested areas. The
primary forest ecosystem has virtually disappeared.
Wooden frrest: Originating frnm a primary mixed Dipterocarp forest, tihe secondary forest is
subdivided in:
(a) The poor cvergreen mixed Dipterocarp forest which is characterized by the presence of
scattered trees nf the original forest as Dipterocarpux altus. Diptercarpus dvcrii. The Ionver
under-hush is vegetated with the Xanthiophylum. Gnnamomum iner. and Cratoxylon grown
vigorously. The commercial value of the wood is poor but positive etffect nn snil protectinn
and water resources enhancement are evidenced. Mixed ynung nriginal Diptermcarp forest is
naturally generated in the mixed Dipterocarp.
(h) Semi-decidunus drv forest:
(i) The pure forest nf Dipternrarpius tuberrulars or Dipternrarpyrs oI'Fusifolins:
(ii Tihe mixed semi-deciduous dry forest with the dominant Dipterorarpits ;s

Some 18 villages. 5 in the District of Hoc Mon. 7 of Binh Chanh and 6 of Duc l-loa are marginally
or totally included in the Project Area. Not induded in the village area is the land belonging to the
State Farms. 5 of which are parially or totally included in the Project: Nhi Xuan in the Hoc Mon
district and Le Minh Xuan. Pham Van Hai. Lang Le and An Ha State Farms in the Biinh Chamh area.
The administrative setting of the village part of the project area is shown in Table 316.
The Project Area is inhabited by 128,000 people, with an average density of 590 peopleIkni (see
Table 317). Within die Project Area. the population density is higher in the so called high lands
(elevation more than +2 as.l) dtn in the low lands. Population encroachment in the low lands tonk
place in the last two decades in the area. previously un-inhabited. This is confinned by the nfficial
statistics, which show a higher population gromwh in the HCM City rmral areas. compared to the urban
areas in the period 1980 -1990 (4% compared to 2%). Hmwever a village survey carried out in the
frame of the project preparation shows that the trend has recently somehow reversed and recent
emtration from the rural areas into the urban area of HCM City appears to occur in the last two-
three year.s. The average family size is 5.3 persons.
-The immigration into the Project Area str  in the late 60's, when An Ha canal and Canal A, B and
C were contrcted. In this period a massive soil reclamation action was started by the government
under the overall guidance and management of the State Farms. -The soil reclamation of the area. still
to be completed, however allowed the establishment of a relatively productive agriculture in the area.
previously swampy and prctically not inhabited due to poor sanitation and environmental conditions.
The encroachment of population. following the improvement of environmental conditions. has heen
taking place since then and is expected to increase in the near future. due to the very close locatinn
of the area to RCM City.
3.4.2        Socio-Economic Conditions of the Population
About 70% of the people in the area live of agriculture, ranging firm 40% for the villages Incated
in Hoc Mon. to 90% for the villages in Long An province. However in almost all families, the
labour force in also employed outside the agricultural sector. in the manufacture, small scale
industries. construction and trading inside and outside the prqoect area. The un-employment rate of
the population living in H1CM City rural areas is unofficially estimated around 20%. However the
estimate seam optimistic. since under-employment of the population in the agricultural sector largely
aff~cts the potentialities of the available lahour force and the annual family income.
Socio-economic secondary data were verified by meanus of field visits and interviews. A sample of
300 potential beneficiaries were interviewed and results are summarized herehdeow. by agricultural
sub-area (main canal). The selected sample is representative of the farmers population. corresponding
to 70% of the total population.
The socio-economic survey shows that the population of the project area is generally young, with 41 %
of the total in the age group 0-17 years; 42% in the age group 18-59 years and only 17% in the age
group more than 50 years; the core of the family is formed by the firmer, his wife and two nr more
children; quite often the family also includes other relatives; the average household resulted 6 persons
(Table 318).
The educational level of the population is medium/high, although some illiteracy still occurs in the
rural areas. The inquire shows that 13% of the population over 6 years is illiterate; 39% have
received some primary education (from I to 5 grade). 29% the secondary educatinn (7 to 9 grade)
and only 20% have reached a higher education level. However it is worth to he evidenced that the
new generations show a higher education. as a result of the government endeavor in the educational
sector.

The labour force includes an average of 3.7 potential unit per family. For the family surveyed.
agriculture constitutes the main activity, ahsorbing 70% of the potential labour force. However
almost all families round up their farm revenue by carrying out off-farm activities in other sectors.
which adsorb about 30% of the potential labour force. The main off-farm activities carried out are:
small trade, civil servant, handicraft labour to other farms;
A substantial part of the field activities are carried out by the members of the family since the average
availability of family labour largely exceed the requirements of the farm. In fact, the family labour
spent for farming activities resulted about 70 mdlha, or 1O0 md/farm (average farm 1.3 ha), much
lower than the available labour force of 500 man-day/year (corresponding to approximately 2.5 labour
units) per family. In spite of that. many farmers use hired labour to cover 2040%  of their farm
requirements, to cover the peak labour requirements. Underemployment of the farmer family labour
force in agriculture. is only partially compensated by complementary activity as gardening, orchard.
animal husbandry etc.
The revenue from on-farm agricultural activities. have been estimated by deducting direct csts
(inputs, labour, water) and indirect costs (taxes, rental) from the gross product. as follows (Million
VNDIha of C.A.):
Average for the sample   LOW - lands        igh - lands
. Prnduction costs                             2.30             2.24             3.01
Gross product                                5.45              4.78             8.66
* Indirect Cost                               0.28              0.28             0.28
-  Farmer Revenue                              2.79             2.25             5.37
Assuming an average farm size of 1 ha for the low lands and 0.80 for the high-lands, the Family
Revenue from on-farm activities resulted 2.21 million VNDIfarm and 4.37 million VND/farm for the
low lands and tie high lands respectively. The off-farm revenue fromrn nther activities resulted 3.5
Million VND/family and 2.9 Million VND/family for the low-lands and the high-lands respectively.
The revemne coming from on-farm is contributing by 44% to tihe family budget. The Annual Family
Revenue of 6 Million VND was finally estimated. corresponding to a per-capita Revenue of 1.00
Million VND (90 USD).
Most of the farmers live in houses of their own property. The houses are located outside the service
area, but not far thereof. The houses are generally located alnng the main canal system, possibly laid
in two/three rows: this particular settlement pattern is mainly attributable to the fact that the
transportation system and infrastructures are provided only along the canal and road network. The
houses are generally simple. made by bricks and provided with iron sheet roof. Water supply and
sanitation are largely insufficient.
The quality of the shallow groundwater aquifer (5-7 cm) is very poor, since in the high land the
aquifer is affected by organic and microbiologic contamination and in the low-lands by saline
intmsion. Most of the inhabitants have to buy freshwater delivered to the project area by trucks or
boats. The survey carried out by the project at key informants-village level, shows that no water
supply infrastructure facility exists neither in the rural areas. nor in the village centes. lmproved
water supply has been provided through an UNICEF water supply program. consisting of the drilling
and equipping of family borehole.
Adequate sanitation is alsn very rare. since neither the village centers nor rural areas are provided
with sewage facilities or informed sanitation conditions. The houses are somehow provided with
primitive pits. A sanitation UNICEF program in the area proved less successful than the water supply
program (see Section 5.3.1).

3.4.3        Supernlcial Geology and Soll Aspects
Two main deposits characterize the superficial Geology of the area: (i) the Pleistocene and (ii) the
Holocene deposits:
(i)   The Pleistocene deposits are constituted by sediment of clay and sand:
the clay deposits have heen formed mainly by clay of marine origin and are
characterized by a laver of approximately 10 m thickness: the superficial layer (I X2
m) is composed by clays in light grey, brown and/nr black color: it may have few
spherical concretion and a continuous depth up to 6 m with spotted laterized clays:
the bottom layer is constituted by yellowish and brownish color;
sandy deposits have been transported by the river system and are characterized by a
thickness up to 5 m. The upper part is composed by coarse to fine sand, often mixed
with silt and clay; the bottom layer is constituted by brownish or black sand and
yellowish grey sand.
(ii)   The Holocene deposits have been formed during the Holocene time. therefnre distributed at
-     lower elevation. They are set-up by swampy marine sediments and proluvio swampy
sediments:
the swampy deposits have heen formed 6-10.000 years ago and are characterized by
marine clay containing high pyrite and organic matter (up to 25%); these sediments
are parents material of the acid sulphate soils or the acid sulphate material sub-snils;
deluvio-swampy sediments have been formed 3-6,000 years ago and are characterized
by a composition of coarse to fine texture material: these materials usually have light
brown color and whitish grey color if exposed to air, if in the superficial layers: at
greater depths these materials have blackish grey color. Proiuvin-swampy sediments
are distributed in the transitional region. linking the old alluvium to the acid-sulphate
soils.
Soil Aspects A description of the soil types prevailing in the Project area is given in Table 3.10.
Soils affected by acidity amount to roughly 70 % of the area, subdivided into actual acid sulphate
soil (54 %). potential acid sulphate soils (9 %) and grey-soils (6 %). Salt intrusion is encountered
in about 31 % of the area, but the lands seriously affected do not exceed 13 %.
The soils of the Hoc Mon North Binh Chanh Irrigation Project. can he classified in three main soil
groups. namely: (i) the grey snils. (ii) the alluvial soils and (iii) the acid sulphate snils. The main
characteristics of the soil groups is described herebelnw the lncation of eacb snil group is identified
in the soil map (Figure 3/6).
Grey Soils (Aeric Kandiaquults): grey soil on old alluvium occupy 31 % of the gross area
(6.200 ha), and are mainly located in the high-lands of the Hoc Mon and Binh Chanh
districts. They are characterized by a sandy-clay superficial texture. with 35-38% clay and
more than 50% sands. Accumulatinn of clay ocrs in the B horizon. These soils are
characterized by a low organic matter content (1-3%). low total N and total and available
phosphorus: their CEC is also very low (5-8 meq/100 gr); the pH. among the highest of the
project area, is sub-acid, ranging 4.8-5.5 (Ph in water). Some 1.285 ha. located in the so
callcd 'transition zone- to the low lands, are also affected by acidity. Grey soils do not have
any particular limitation to crop growth. but do not seem suitable for continuous paddy. wet
monsoon paddy followed by up-land crop (subsidiary crop or vegetables) seem a most
appropriate cropping pattern.

Alluvial Soils (Aeric Tropaquepts and Fluvaquents): alluvial soils are classified in twn
sub-groups: (i) the aeric Tropaquepts. and (ii) the tropic Fluvaquents;
(i) The aeric Tropaquepts are relatively young alluvial soils with a physical ripening ranging
within 20-50 cm from soil surface and characterized by yellowish-red mottles in the
superficial horizon and reddish-brown mottles in the B horizon. Some 4% of the area (831
ha) of aeric tropaquepts cover the project area. located in the low-lands. 60% of which
affected by saline intrusioh.
(ii) The tropic Fluvaquents. relatively young alluvial soils with a physical unripening ranging
within 20-50 cm from soil surface and influenced by saline intrusion in the dry season; tropic
fluvaquents occupy 1.4% of the gross area (214 ha). located in the south-eastern portion or
the project area
These soils ar characd by a clay texture. with 50% cly or more and 20-25% of sand
and loam respectively. They are characterized by a medium-high organic matter conint in
the top soils and medium-low in the sub-soils; medium CEC (18-20 meq/gr), phosphorus
ranging 0.05-0.08%. Ph ranging from 5 to 6. These soils resulted the most suitable and
-   productive of the entire project area
cAdd Sulphate Soils: some 63% of the gross project area is coverWd by acid sulphatc soils;
these soils are characterized by a high pyritic (Fe SI) and high acidity genera:ed by the
exposure of the pyritic layer to oxygen. The oxidation of the pyrite generates sulfuric acid
and jarosite. Such soils are characterized by heavy clay texture. with some 50-55% clay
content. 20% Inam and 20-25% sand. Other chemical/physical characteristics depend on the
presence and depth of the sulfidic and sulfuric horizon; the acid sulphate soils of the project
area are distinguished in (i) Actual Acid Sulphate and (ii) Potential Acid Sulphate Soils.
(i) Actual Acid Sulphate Soils (inceptisols): in such soils, some oxidation of the pyritic layer
have already occurred, therefore they are charactrized by low pH and presence of sulfuric
acid. The Actual ASS coer some 53% of the project gross area (10.736 ha). They may
be distinguished into sub-classes according to the depth of the upper boundarv of the sulfuric
horizon;
Pale Sulfic Tropaquepts: old acid sulphate soils, which occupy 14% of the project
area (2,870 ha), are also classified as slightly acid suiphate soils. 50% of which
strongly affected by saline intrusion. Such soils are characterized by a sulfuric
horizon deeper than 100 cm below the soil surface: pyritic layer is at relatively deep
depth and with less acid in the top layer than the young acid sulphate soils, The CEC
in the top soil is ranging 15-20 meqlgr, the content of organic matter is medium (10-
15%); although the pH is still acid, ranging 4.3-5. the actual and potential acidity
is quite low (5-10 meq/100 gr);
Sulfic Tropaquepts: younger acid sulphate soils, they are also classified as moderately
acid sulphate soils, with the upper boundary of the sulfuric horizon within 50-100 cm
from the soil surface. Such soils cover 20% of the project area (4,080 ha); althongh
the jarositic layer. cnntaining sulfuric acid. is deeper than 50 cm, the actual and
potential acidity of such soils is still medium-high, ranging between 5-7 me/lO0 gr
for the actual acidity and 20-30 meq/100 gr for the potential acidity; such acidity is
either generated from the acid and sulfidic sub-stratum andlor from the lateral
infiltration of drained water from the uplands;

Humic Sulfaquepts: young acid sulphate soils. also classified as strongly acid
sulphate soils, with sulfuric horizon above 50 cm. Such soils occupy some i9% of
the project area (3,790 ha), 5% of which strongly affected by saline intrusion. The
jarositic layer, containing sulfuric acid. is between 0 and 50 cm. the actual and
potential acidity of such soils is high, ranging between 10-12 meq/100 gr of actual
acidity and 30-50 meqlO0 gr of potential acidity; such acidity is generated from the
oxidation of the superficial pyritic layer.
.1
(ii) Potential Acid Sulphate Soils: such soils occupy 9% of the project area (1.850 ha) and
are characterized by the presener of not-oxidized pyritic layer. sub-acid and/or neutral Ph.
high salinity, poor bearing capacity and presence of undecomposed organic mattr. they are
distinguished into sub-classes aecording to the depth of the sulfidic matrial:
Sulfic Tropaquepts: moderately potential acid sulphate soils, with sulfuric horizon
deeper than 50 cm. Such soils cover 8% of the project area (1.650 ha), 20% of
which slightly intruded by saline water,
Humic Sulfaquepts: classified as potential strongly acid sulphate soils, with sulfuric
horizon above 50 cm. Such soils are cover only 1% of the project area (200 ha);
these soils are particularly rich in organic matter;
All in all the strong and moderate actual sulphate soils account for 39% of the project area (7,860 ha);
sone 75% of such soils. have already been partially reclaimed with the raised bed system (lip
system), in the last 10-15 years. Conversion of the acid sulphate soils in raised-bed system has been
carried out under the management of the State Farms in Nixuan (Hoc Mon district), Le Minh Xuan.
Pham van Hai and Lang Le State Farms (Binh Chanh district). -In Duc Hoa district, reclamation with
raised beds has heen carried out by farmers under the guidance of the Long An Agricultural Service.
Saline Soils: As mentioned in the above soil classification, large portinns of the low lands are
affected by seasonal saline intrusion, caused by the tidal inflow in the downstream portion during the
dry season. The tidal movement push saline and brackish water through the main irrigation/drainage
canals. The entire lowland area, located at an average elevation 0.4-1 m a.s.l., is subject to tidal
regime. Before the construction of the An Ha sluice at Le Minh Xuan. the saline water was intruding
the project area frnm the following waterways-
from Vam Co Dong River through Xang and Cau An Ha canals saline water was intruding
into the An Ha canal. Ngang canal and canals A. B, and C;
from Vam Co Dong through Ben Luc River and Ngang canal into canals A. B and
C;
from Saigon river, through Can Giuoc and Cho Dem River into Tan Kien and Ba Honm
Creeks. Canal C. A and B:
At a consequence of this tidal regime, some 31% of the soils inside the project area (An Ha canal
area, canal A. canal B and canal C) were affected by seasonal saline intrusion. Some 11% of the
project soils, located in the C canal and Tan Kien creek are strongly affected by seasonal saline
intrusion.
Soil classification for the eight (8) agricultural sub-areas is shown in Table 3112.
EIA - Chapter 3                                                                3 -27



3..4A        Land Use and Agriculture
The Project area was sub-divided in eight agricultural sub-areas. which land use is shown in Table
3112. It may be noted that, out of 21,780 ha of overall project area, some 7% are constituted by
setements. 1.5% is other lands (roads. main canal system) and the remaining 91% or 19,926 ha by
gross agricultural area. Of the gross area some 660 ha are now occupied by the secondary and
tertiary canal system, and 1,260 ha are occupied by other lands (natural drainage, scattered houses
etc.). The overall net agricultural area in the present situation is constituted by 18.007 ha, 77% of
which located in the low-lands. the remaining in the high-lands. Land use for the project area is
shown in Figure 3n.
Thirty two (32) different Land Mapping Units (LMUs) were identified according to the major soil
groups shown in Table 3110. homogeneous in terms of physical properties. flooding depth and
duration, irrigation and drainage conditions. salt intrusion and presence or absence of raised beds.
Furthermore, nineteen (19) Land Use Types (LUTs) were aessed. Seven (7) LUTs are based on rice
(areas showing at least one paddy crop per year was considered), two (2) LUTs include subsidiary
up-land crops only. eight LUTs grow perennial crops, while the two (2) remiining LUTs are based
on acid-resistant crops, such as sedge and lepisonia. In general:
-     perennial crops such as banana, pineapple. sugarcane and eucalyptus are
prevailing in the low land ASS areas under reclamation with the raised-bed
system. In the remaining low lands, the dominant rice-based system is
practiced by the farmers, who usually adjust their cropping patterns to
natural rairrall:
in the up-lands, the land use includes one wet-sihson paddy and one or more
subsidiarylvegetable crops, irrigated by ground water.
The suitabilitv of the different LUTs to each LMU was assessed based on the "present sitation" of
the latter. Four (4) suitability classes (high. modert, marginal suitability and non-suitability) were
adopted. A large number of physical factors likely to affect crops were considered, as applicable:
composition and texture of soils. drainage conditions, contents of organic matter, of nitrogen and
phosphorus. acidity and toxicity levels. salt intusion.
Approximnately 5.300 ha in low lands and 430 ha in high-lands are provided with a surface irrigation
system. generally comprising primary and secondary canal systems and tertiary development, which
however appears largely incomplete. especially in the high-lands. rigpted agriculture is carried out
in the upstream portion of the project area and in the raised bed system. However the absence of an
adequate tertiary and on-farm systems. combined with inadequate operation and maintenance
practices. are presently preventing farmers from fully exploiting the agricultural potential.
All area in the high-lands and most in the low-lands is cultivated by farmers 'state allocated', or
entitled to crop their land for a long term period. Land rental, based on short term contracts
negotiated among the farmers, is common practice in the project area. In the low lands, sone 3,700
ha (equivalent to 23% oF the gross area) belongs to the State Farms. formally government maAaged
organization, which management system has been recently deeply modified. Within the State Farms.
the farmers are entitled to crop on a "state leased" contract basis, with contract length which varies
according to the type of cropping system. The average farm size for the project area is approximately
0.85 ha ranging in most cases between 0.5 and 1.5 ha. The average farm size is smaller in the up-
lands (especially Hoc Mon area - 0.55 ha), than in the low lands (0.90 ha).

The Net Service Area (in the Present Condition) results of 18,007 ha, 13.813 lncated in the low lands
and 4.143 in the high-lands. The assessment of the prcsent cropping system has heen undertaken for
all the agricultural sub-areas included in the Project. namely: An Ha. C link. Canal A&B. C canal.
Crecks. Thay Cai Canal. high-lands in Hoc Mon and high-lands in lBnh Chanh.
An overall cropping intnsity slightly over 105 74 has been calculated for the entire project area.
Valucs in excess of 150 % are recorded in the Hoc-Mon high lands, where farmers use groundwater
to irrigate up-land dry-season croifs and vegetables. In the low-lands, the present cropping intensity
ranges from 70 to 115 %. with large areas of raised-bed occupied by perennial crops. Higher
cropping intensities cannot be achieved due to water logging, lack of freshwater and salt intrusion.
affecting large portion of the project low-lands.
Farmers practices and input application are quite adequate and rather homogeneous throughout the
project area. the level of production and yields in each agricultural sub-area being mainly correlated
with the availability of suitable soils for agriculture. sufficient irrigation and appropriate drainage.
Soil conditions and lack of irrigation are clearly the most important limiting productivity factors.
The quantities of seed utilized for paddy is sufficient, but farmers tend to use their own seed and are
still reluctant to buy certified seeds (including hybrids) because i) is more expensive and ii) they are
doubtFul about its quality. Fertilizer is always applied at sufficient rate for all annual crops, including
vegetables. groundnuts and paddy. Pesticides, insecticide. rodenticide and herbicide are applied by
the large majority of the farmers when necessary. In most of the area the land preparation is carried
out by animal draft and human labour. although the use of tractor is increasing in the project area.
Wet season paddy average yields resulted 2.5-2.7 in the high-land and low-land respectively:
winter/spring paddy 3.5-4 t/ha and sununer autumn paddy 3-3.5 tlha. Groundnuts yields in the
transition and in the high-lands are ranging 2-2.2 tlha in the winter/spring and 1.5-1.8 in the summer-
autumn. Vegetable production is ranging between 5 and 12 tlha.
All in all it may be assessed that, although affected by irrigation, drainage and soil constraints. the
farmers are applying farmers practices and input application according to a rather intensive
agricultural systen.
3.4.5        Vegetation
The area is mainly devoted to agriculture. thus the natural vegetation has almost disappeared. except
for few scattered plots; the local population have planted new crops/plantation which may yield an
economic benefit. The extensive survey carried out in the frame of the project. show the presence of
approximately 46 tree species:
- 13 fruit tree species;
- 4 species for industrial food processing ( Pineapple. Banana. Sugarcane etc.):
- 17 wooden tree species (dominant species: Eucalyptus and Acacia):
- 12 grass and shrub species.
The fruit tree and wooden trees are planted in the home gaidens and along the river and canal banks,
the roads and the paddy field rim: besides having an the economic value. the vegetation cover is
henefitting the physical environment. by protecting the soils. houses and villages from the sunshine.
rainstorm and top soil erosion.

The vegetation coverage of the project area is (i) planted vegetation and (ii) natural vegetation.
(i)   Planted vegetation: it includes mainly rice paddy field, sugarcane areas. pineapple, fruit tree
garden, cashewnut area. forest area (scattered or concentrated tree area); annual crops yield
economic benefits only, while perennial crops and forest plantation can also indirectly benefit
the surrounding environment. The eucalyptus and acacia (somewhere included Melaleuca) are
also planted as belt along the bank of canal and the side of the road to provide green tree
cover and to prevent the 'eroion on the road and canal embankment. in the old settlement
area fruit tree species mixed with woden tree provide a vegetation coverage of 60-70%.
The new settlements have a green tree cover of over 80% and are planted by cashewnut,
eucalyptus and acacia.
(ii)   Natural vegetation: some few batches of natural vegetation remains in the waste land, in and
along the water body as- AImpaea steilaa, Nelwnbium nelumbo, Eloackaris dcis,
Ochrostachys, Phragmires karka and Oryza spontanea associations. While the NynAaea and
Nelaambim associations are growing in fresh water environment, the other associations are
adapted to both water and soil acid environment
Brackish water adapted species includes Sonneraia caseobzria. Brugi era ymwmrr
Aamlui ebraceauss. Cryprworyne cillasa and Cypenrs malaccenais distributed along the
fringe of canal intruded by saline water.
he identified species established in the area contribute to the beauty and aesthetics of the prnject
ara, beside providing economic revenue and enhancing the environment of the project area
SigniFicative eco-systems are:
Nypa Fructicans Wurmb: Nypa palm occurs natrally in two ( Asia & Oceania) of the six
-Mangro distributions of the world. The largest distributed areas is the South East Asia
including Vietnam,where the distribution region is limited to the southern provinces. Nypa
can grow on alluvial soil with different levels of organic matter and hardness along the river
bank and canal within brackish water with the saline concentration ranging widely from 5 -
20 gr/l; at lower concentation of I or 2 grans, growth is still possible. but not luxuriant.
Nypa is well adapted to tidal diurnal or semi-diurnal regime, with fluctuation of less than 3
metes and can stand inundation for 2 or 3 daysimonth.
Nelumbium nelumbo (L.) Druce - Lotus; water stoloniferous plant. latus leaf stalk is 60-70
cm long, dipped into the water, with 20-30 cm diameter leaf blade spreads on the water
surface. The flower appears at the beginning of summer and fruit are harvsted from July
to September. The growing season lasts both summer and autumn. In the project area lotus
is often grown in died river bed where the water flows slowly. Lotus can partially purify the
waters by its trunk and root system growth.
3A.6         Water Quality
Water quality is recognized as one of the most important constraint affecting the agriculturai ni:d
human development of the area. The main factors influencing the quality of surface water insi he
Project Area are the (i) the tidal regime of the Saigon and Vam Co Dong rivers. (ii) saline  :er
intrusion during the dry season. (iii) acid sulphate soils of the area, which constitute the e. mrn
portion of the larger Vam Co Dong - plain of Reeds ASS area, (iv) human settlement and ac - ity
in the project area and in the urban HCM city, discharging to the west into ChD Dem and N_. ing
canal. to the east into Saigon and to the south into Cay Kho and Can Giunc.

Three main rivers supply water to the aquatic environment of the project area and downstream
thereof: the Dong Nai and Sai Gon river on the left hand side, the Vam Co Dong river on die right
side. The project area wateways form an interconnected canal. river and creeks systen, subject to
a semni-tidal fluctuation regime. govened by the Saigon and Vam Co Dong rivers. The mean tidal
fluctuation at Sai Gon river is 1.5 m, ranging at its estuary between 3.5 m to 4.2 m. The tide intrudes
up to Dau Tieng reservoir on Sai Con river and to Tri An waterfall on Dong Nai river.
The water flow in the system is lffected by meeting points of flows which often appear in canals
which receive tidal flows from two opposite direcions. A "meeting point of flows" of two opposite
tidal streams. is characterized by relatively high tidal fluctuation and low water velocity. These
meeting points of flows influence the aquatic enviroment and water quality of the system. However
(1) the meeting points in natural conditions may fluctuate. according to the season. the flows and the
rainfall: (ii) meeting points of flows can be converted due to the change of hydraulic flow. by
engineering works, such as sluices.
Any water nmnagement project taking place upstream, inside and downstrean of the project area,
would cause modification in the flow of the interconnected canal system, thus impact n the water
quality. The main water management projects carried out since the 80' and affecting the water flow
and quality in the project area are (i) the construction of the Dau leng dam and reservoir, in 1986,
(ii) the construction of the Tri An dam and reservoir on the Doug Nai river, in 1988. (iii) the
dredging of the An Ha canal and construction of An Ha sluice in February 1994.
Natni Conditions (before 1986  In the project area, the natural condition occurred before the
construction of Dau rieng and Tri An. In this period, water quality and aquatic environment were
influenced by (i) saline intrusion fmm Saigon and Vim Co Dong tidal flows. (ii) acidity leaching
from the drainage of ASS upstreamn and inside the project area, (iii) presence of meeting points of
flows, afecting the water flow inside the area. In natural conditions meeting points occurred in (see
Figure 3/9):
- Thay Cai (inside the projet area);
- An Ha canal (inside the project area);
* at Tan Buu on the Cho Dein river (downstream of the project area);
* at Lang Le on the Ngang Canal (downstrcam of the project area):
The characteristic of the water quality in the natural conditions in the project area and downstream
canals system for the most significative parameters are as follows:
a.    Salinity: during the dry season.-all waterways inside the project low-lands are largely affected
by salinity during the low-flow season (from January to May). The limit of 4 grIl TDS is
*        commonly considered in Vietnam as the highest saline concentration tolerable by crops
(mainly paddy). In natural conditions the low-lands, entirely subject to tidal fluctuation. were
affected by saline water during the dry season. The mean dry season isohaline of 4 grIl on
the Saigon river was located just downstream of the Rach Tra intake (Figure 3/8). All project
waterways were affected by salinity downstrm of the gtach Tra intake:
Xang and Cau An Ha from Vam Co Dong river:
Ngang Canal. Cho Dem (Ben Luc) river, Can Giuoc river from Saigon and Vam Co
Dong rivers;
In the period before 1986. salinity in An Ha canal ranged between 1.3 g/l and 10 gr/l: in
A. B, and C canal, between 2.8 and 14 gIl- Higher values were recorded in the downstream
area (see Table 3113).

b.    Acidity: The water quality of the area is highly affected by acidity (pH bdween 3 and 4).
caused by the leaching of ASS located upstrean and inside the project area. The acidity is
maximum at Cau Bong, wherm the characteristics of the flao favo its accumulation. To tlhe
east, the aciditygradually decreases in the Rach Tra canal, up .o the Saigon river (pH
between 5 and 6); to the south west, the acidity decreas significantly only downstream of
Cau Xang (An Ra sluice) in Cau An Ha and in Xang canal in the direction of the Vam Co
Dong river (Figure 319). In the south-eastern in Ngang canal the acidity sharply decreses
to the east of the meeting point of Lang Le (Ph beteen 5.5 and 7). In the area the acidity
is maximum at the beginning of the rainy season (June-August), when the acidity accumulated
in the soils by pyrite oxidation during the dry season is leached out into surfa  wers. In
this period the average pH. minimum and maximum tends to identifies towards the higher
values (Figure 3/9). The trend of the water acidity for 6 sations located upstream, inside and
downsteam of the project area is shown in Table 3/14 and in Figure 319.

It is concluded that in natural conditions: (i) the acidity (pH) varies according to the rainfall
and is maximum during the rainy season; (ii) the water quality at the inflow from the Saigon
river intn the Rach Tra is good for irrigation purposes, with average pH higher than 5: (iii)
in the natural conditions the project area is highly affrcted by acidity leached out from the
fields; (iv) the distribution of the acidity within the project area is largely influenced by the
tidal regime and meeting points of flows; (v) in the area downstream canals discharging into
Vam Co Dong to the east, acidity decrease steadily; in the canals discharging to the east,
acidity drops downstreant'of the meeting point of flows at Lang Le.
c.    Toxic Elements (Fe, Al, S0,):  Fe and especially Al concentration show a trend very
similar to the trend of pH to which they are associated (Figure 3/10). In the period 1983-1986
(continuous monitoring for the Lower Dong Nai basin), maximum recorded values of Fe'+
and All' concentration are shown during the rainy season (June-August). The presence oF
high concentration of Al, is due to the high solubility of Aluminum Hydroxide generated by
the oxidation of the pyrite, at pH lower than 4. The presence of relatively high concentration
of Fe?', is due to the oxidation of Fe', which solubility is still high at pH lower than 4.
High corctration of sulfates is also recorded in the period: however the sulfate
concentration varies according to: (i) acidic waters leached from acid sulphate soils and (i})
saline intusion. This explain the high concentration of sulfates also in the downstrean area.
From the above data it emerges that in natural conditions, (i) the trend of F&  and especially
Al3' in the project is similar to pH and varies according to the rainfall; (ii) the water quality
at the inflow from the Saigon river into the Rach Tra is good and do not contain large
concentration of toxic elements; (iii) the project area is highly affected by toxic elements
leached out from the fields; inside the project area, the Cau-Bong and Cau Xang stations
record the highest acidity and toxic elements concentration.
d.    Limpidity: the limpidity is high in the acidic water area (An Ha and Thay Cai), ranging 180-
250 cm (Secdhi method). In the upstream Rach Tra and downstream Cho-Dem and Ngang
canals, the limpidity is low, in the range of 20-30 cm.
Situation after Dau Tieng and Tri An (1989-1992): The impact of these two main water
management project on water quality (salinity and acidity) is assessed as foilows:
Salinity: the maximum salinity isohaline of 4 g/l- NaCI shifted downstream of Lai Thieu by
20 Km (Figure 3/8). The decreased salinity in the vicinity nf the Rach Tra intake is mainly
due to the increased dry season flow in the Dong Nai river, released by the Tri An reservoir.
The positive impact of the Dau Tieng reservoir, discharging some 20-25 m'Is during the dry
season. on the salinity repulsion of the Saigon river is much less significative but still evident
since salinity at Lai Thieu decreases after 1986. Some "spot" measurements inside the project
area in the period 1989-1992. cnnFirms the positive impact of the two projects nn the salinity
inside and downstream nf the project area (see Table 3113).
Acidity: The two projects do not seem to significantly impact nn the acidity of the project
area. PH records at Lai Thieu (Saigon river downstream of the Rach Tra canal intake) show
a similar trend to the previous situation (Figure 3111). As a matter of fact, the Saigon wafer
quality continued to be slightly affected by acid return flows from upstream and inside the
project area. However it seems that the aluminum has decreased tn average concentration in
An Ha canal of 3-6 mgfl in the wet season and 2-5 mg/I in the dry season; iron to 1-2.5 mg/I
throughout the year.

Samr: Instue of Ecomii Resawh
Alter An Ha Sluice (1994): the recently completed dredging of the An Ha canal and consuction
of An Ha sluice (1994), are expected to have a major impact on the water quality inside the project
area. Some positive impact of these works has been recorded from the latest complementary survey
(April 1994):
Salinity: the construction of the An Ha sluice prevents the saline intrusion in the An Ha
canal; the salinity concentation of 0.06 gIl is recorded, with considerable improvement for
the irrigation use (April 1994);
Acidity: significant positive impact is expected on the acidity along An Ha. The construction
of the An Ha sluice will modify the flow in the project area and favor the good quality
freshwater inflow from the Saigon river through the Rach Tra, into An Ha canal. The
improvement of the water quality in the projeat area may be finally assessed during and after
the rainy season 1994. In the meantime, the 1994 April watr quality survey show pH values
higher than the average for April inside in Rach Tra (pH 5.5) and in the upper an Ha (Cau
Bong station - Ph 4.9).
Tne complementary water quality survey, carried out in the frame of the Project Preparation as base-
line of the future water quality monitoring, shows also that in the main canals the dissolved oxygen
(DO) is ranging between 5.8 and 6.8 mg/I in all stations except in Cho Dem (DO 5.4 mg/I); the
nutrient content is low: total N is ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 mg(l; PO-P is 0.001 mg/i and total K
ranging between 1.3 and 1.6 mg/I in all station not affbcted by salt intrusion; water quality sampling
in the secondary canals and farm ditches shows that: in the fields under reclamation (Panviet
plantation), the pH of the water (pH 5 and 4.5 respectively) and toxic-elements concentration are
similar to the water characteristics oF the main An Ha canal; in the secondary canals and farm ditches
not yet under reclamation, water is much more 6cidic (pH 3.8 and 2.7 respectively).            I
b. Ground water Exploitable groundwater resources are available in the up-lands of HCM  city,
concentrated in two aquifers 20 m to 40 m and 80 m to 120 m depth. A third very superficial aquifer
at 5-7 m depth is sometimes exploited by the farmers for irrigation. However groundwater potential
of this superficial aquifer is poor. Water quality characteristics of the first 2040 m aquifer in Hoc
Mon results as follows:

pH average 4.7, ranging 3.4-5.3 according to the locations, with constant values between the
rainy and dry season;
NO; averages 0.9-1 mg/I. ranging between 0 and 4 mg/I. with constant values during both
seasons;
.    NaCa averages 61 mg/I, ranging 17-210 mg/I during the dry season; it averages 41 mg/I,
ranging 17-122 mg/I during the rainy season; S041 averages 2.4 mg/I. ranging 0-7.6 mg/i
during the dry season; it averages 0.8 mg/I, ranging 0-3.5 in the rainy season;
OW quality of the first aquifer (20-40 m) is sensitive sulphate. NaCI. Iron and to organic and
microbiologic contamination,; as shown by the UNTCEF Water quality monitoring and by the samples
collected by the project in the quality survey in particular sensitive areas (April 1994). Generally,
this water proves suitable for drinking, provided a management program and control is duly applied.
In Binh Chanh district, GW resoures to the west of the main highways n.t10 differ from the east
area. In the western portion, intunive salt intrusion prevents the use of the first aquifer for drinking
purposes. In the eastern area both aquifers are acceptable for drinking, although affected by slight
organic contamination (BOD and N0,-N) and Fe. Water quality samples show the following (20-100
m deep):
pH average 5.3, ranging 4.046.9. with constant average values between the rainy and dry
season; however in the rainy season higher variation ranges occur:
NC,- averages 0.7 mg/l, ranging between 0 and 3.5 mg/I, during the dry season; average 0.5
mg/I, ranging 0-2 mg/i during the wet season;
NaCI averages 215 mg/I, ranging 17-1,270 mgfI during the dry season, 211 mg/I. ranging
17-1270 mg/i during the rainy season; SO,?- averages 12.5 mg/I. ranging 0-78 mg/i during
the dry season; 10 mg/I, ranging 0-58 mg/l. in the rainy season;
In general GW quality and characteristics of the aquifer 20.40 m deep are still acceptable for drinking
purposes although sensitive to surface water quality and human activity (agriculture, solid waste
disposal. sewerage); in the Hoc Mon area acid pH and relatively higher nutrient content occurs in the
first aquifer; in Binh Chanh. salinity intrusion affects the first aquifer. especially during the dry
season.
3.4.7        Aquatic Environment In the Project and Downstream Area
Different ecosystems are created by the flow pattem inside the canals and river system. Aquatic
ecology is characterized by environmental factors such as salinity, acidity, biogen, sedimentation and
development of hydrobiont.                            V
Usually meeting points of flows create ecological obstacle which causes differences of environmental
factors. In the meeting point water flow moves slowly, spume appears at the water surface, tidal
fluctuation is limited compared with the adjacent areas. The bottom muddy layer is very thick, 40 -
50 cm. so canals or creeks here are commonly shallow. Salinity may change. The species of
hydrobiont (zooplankton, phytoplankton and fishes) are abundant and often develop with a great
number.
Four ecological zones are identified in the area (Figure 3/9). Their aquatic ecology is described
herebelow.
ETA - Chapter 3                                                               3 - 41



The r,rt zone (freshwater): in Rach Tra to Sai Gon river, sedimentation is brown grey with a layer
of pelogene on the surface. Salinity is low (O - 1'4,, in dry season), pH sub-acid ranges between 4.4 -
6.5; DO is rather high (> I 6 mg/I). The content of biogene (AI+', Fe-, PO,-, NO2, NO,) is low;
water environment rather fresh, it can be considered as oligosaprobe.
Phytoplankton is poor in number, only thirty-seven species have been found consisting of
OdoropJhyta, Cyanophym, and BaciUlariophyta (about 40,00D - 160.000 cellsfm'), of which
Chlorophyta and Bacilariophyta are dominant. Zoopiankton is adapted to fresh water with low
degree of acidity such as Cladocera, Diaphawsoma excisum Sars, Ilyocrypnuhalyi brady, Macrothrix
trireriafir Brady, Copepoda, Microcyclops aricans Sars; other species suitable to estuary envirnnment
with low salinity present in the area are Pseudodiapromuw beieri Brehm, Schmackeria bdubosa Shen
and Tai (copedoda -calanoida). Pseudodiaptomu beiers is the dominant species. Zooplankton in the
region can reach 4.000 - 5,000 mn'.
Zoobenthos comprises various kinds of mnollusca living in fresh water as Corbicula cyrefjformis
Pnme, Corbicula bocouni Mornet, Digoniostoma siamenhe (lea), Sermyla tornatca (ea)etc. Species
which originate in the sea and immigrate into the region consist of Nepthys polybnanchra southern
(Polychacta), Hyale brewpes Barnard (Amphipoda).
Species of economic value are small shrimp like aridiwa nilotica bengalersis (Atyidae),
Macrbrachium rosenbergii (gigant prawn); some kinds of fishes from Sai Gon river like PuemwS
gonionrs, Pangasiuspolyceraodon, Mysa wefu etc. The fishery potential is rather good and family
fishing ponds are common. In the fishing ponds farmers grow Punrius goniotus, CVpri  carpio.
7-dapia nitca, Macrobradcium rosenbergii. Production of fishing ponds is 0.5-1 t1hatyear.
The second znne (adic zone): It consists of Thay Cai, An Ha. Xang, A canals. Typical
characteistics of the water environment in the region: the flows do not circulate much, water
environment is characterized by high acidity (pH 3-4) and relatively low salinity in the dry season (S
< 5EV). low content of biogene (NO2, NO, and PO,' - P); much higher content of Fe and AlW".
The limpidity is very high, 180 - 250 cm. The bottom is covrd by a very contaminated and black
layer of muddy and also by ceratophyllum and myriophyllum. Higher content of NH, is cused by
the dissolution of dead Ceratophyllum and Myriophyllum and organic waste materials.
Phytoplankton comprises thirtythree species adapted to high acidic environmcnt (thousands of cells
per ml). Chlorophyta and conjugatophyceae are dominant. Zooplankton comprises typical species of
acidic environment, such as Bracdiomu qs ddenwas (rotatoria), Macr  rriscrialis, Macroduhi
spinosus. llyocrypts halyi, Latonopsis australis (Cladocera). Microcyclops varicans (Copepoda). The
quantity of these creatures are 400 - 600 Imi. Latonopsis austrafs can be considered as the bio-
indicator for the strong acidic water.
Aquatic life in muddy layer at the bottom is very limited. In rainy season, Ozironomidac appears
within minimum quantities; the only significant species of economic value is Caidna sp (Atyidae)
(a very small shrimp only 15 - 20 nun long), well adapted to acidic environment and the presence of
Ceratophyllum and Myriophyllum. Tliis shrimp has been grown for the last.4-5 years by the farmers.
The development of typically strong acidic-sident species in the region may be established.
Some small fishing ponds are developed by farmers, mainly grown with Pangasius numronemus,
which can yield up to 4 tlhafyear.
The third zone (transition zone):.this zone is located in the canals downstream of the project area..
discharging into Vam Co Dong: Cau An Ha, Xang, Ben Luc canal, Vam Co Dong river. The water
in the region is saline (S: 5 - I 091) and sub-acid (Ph 6-6.6) in the dry season; quite fresh and acid
(pH 4-5) in rainy season. This area is a transitional zone between fresh water and saline water and
between acid and neutral water. The content of biogene (NO;; NOW; NH4,) is limited; the content
of SO;7 is very high.
3 - 42                                                             EIA - Chapter 3



Only 17 kinds of zooplankton have been detected, 88,000 - 2,660,000 cells/in', suitable for acidic
environment, like Desmogonium kwuiavwm, Desmidiwn grevill, Closteiun sp, Euglena sp, Ewwida
sp etc. Some 18 kinds of zooplankton have been detected (1105 - 1840 individuallmn9 like Acarria
clard, Acartiella sinesis (Acartiidae - Copepoda) and Microcyclops vairkns (cyclopidac copepoda).
Aquatic life in the bottom is limited to Sermyla tornateila (Thiaridae), Nephthys polybranchia
(Polyclacta). The quantities of these species are very limited. In general, the productivity is low due
to the very unstable environment, However, the number of plankton increases remarkably in the
breeding season. Fishery is limited in few small fishing ponds. Some Macrobracium rosimbergii is
caught in the Ben Luc area.
The forth zone (brackish zone) Including Ngang canal (from Lang Le meeting point), Cho Dan
creek up to Can Giunc creek. In dry season, the salinity is 5 - 1011m and in rainy season, it decreases
to S < 5O,.. Although located downstream of acid sulphate soils, acidity is rather low (Ph 5.7 - 7)
due to satire intrusion and contamination of HCMC sewage system. For the same reason, DO is low,
as compared with the three above zones, nutrient elements concentration is very high (N: 1.2 - 3
mg/I P 0.07 - 0.2 mg/l: Si 2.7 - 4.8 mgIl). The limpidity is low because of ihe high content of
suspended solids (50 - 140 mg/I).
Only about tS,000 - 340,000 cellslm, of Phytoplankton were detected, of which Bacillariophyta is
dominant. Zooplankton comprises thirty-two species in large quantities (133 to 21.000 inm). In dry
season, the dominant species are Scmancera bubova. Amcarda cloui, Acarniela sien.rir (copepoda).
In rainy season as water is nearly fresh migratibn from the second zone may take place and species
develop as: Lasonopsis ausrafis, Macrothrix triserialis (Cladocera). Microcyclops vancans.
Neodaptonus vsnu (Copepoda) etc. In general, in this region number and kinds of plankton is
changing according to the seasonal flow variation and sewea  flow.
Aquatic life in the bottom of the canal, mainly immigrates into the region fron the sea and adapt to
the conditions. They are Corbkcda leviuseuda, Sernwla tornatella, Nqplthyx polybranchia, Bispira
polymnorpha, MaldMesarsi (Polychacta), Hyale brevipes, Corophiuminterneium (Amphipoda). etc.
In rainy season, the number of these species in Ngang canal from Tan Nhat bridge is very high from
hundreds to thousands of creatures per e. However acid leaches, unstable conditions and pollution
from the city, prevents fishery potential. Fish species in the area are Macrobrahum rosenbergii,
Macrobracium  anchesteri, Mug/i, Pristolwepis fascias, Myvrfnsi etc. 7-lapia and Pangaur
micronemus and Macrobrachium rosenbergii are grown in ponds along the Cho Dem canal with some
success.
3.5          Environmentaly Sensitive Areas and Environmental Issues
3.5.1        Environmentally Sensitive Areas
Acid Sulphate Soils; agricultural development of the area, is mainly associated with the reclamation
of acid sulphate soils; specific environmental issue may be associated with the project implementation
in acid sulphate soils since acid leaches during soil reclamation may cause damages to soils.
structures, downstream  vegetation, aquatic habitats and human safety;
Pollution in the project area; the available information, including a complementary survey on soil
and water quality carried out during Project Preparation shows that some areas, especially those
located in the high-lands are sensitive to and affected by pollution, mainly caused by the vicinity to
urban area. This creates off-site environmental issues which have a potential negative impact on the
project area future development such as uncontrolled solid waste disposal in the high-linds and
uncontrolled waste-water discharge into the Tham Luong Creek (tributary of the Ba Hom river);
ETA - Chapter 3                                                               3 - 43



Surface water and GW inside the project area low-lands are affexted by organic and microbiologic
contamination. mainly due to poor sanitation conditions of the population living there.
integration of rural and urban ares and off-site environmental issues (solid waste and pollution frnm
urban areas) will need to be considered by the EA ; pollution from agriculture and excessive use nf
inputs is not yet evidence;
Water Resources Quality: Surface water and groundwater quality in the area is generally poor due
to: (i) presence of acid sulphate soils. (ii) salt water intrusion during dry season, (iii) lack of facilities
fror water supply, waste water treatment and solid waste disposal, (iv) uncontrolled waste-water
discharge also from outside the project area. Any development project inside the area shall consider
the poor quality of the water resources. Additional freshwater to be supplied by the project is likely
to improve water quality in the area in the long run:
Aquatic Ecology of the project area was reviewed. Although not particularly valuable, aquatic
ecology is a natural resource with some economic value. Waterways uses includes small scale
fisheries, transportation, domestic uses (bathing, laundry etc.) and aesthetic. The need is evident to
preserve and possibly improve the aquatic ecology and water uses inside and especially downsm
of the project area;
iluman settlements and health: A large population lives and works in the Project Area, making best
use of the natural resource still preserved (as soils and agricultural land, vegetatinn, water resources
etc.). Although the environment has already been affected by human presents and activity irreversibly
modifying the natural conditions, the need is evident to preserve and enhance the environment and
the natural resources to prevent further degradation and guarantee acceptable long term living
conditions for the population.
Upper Catchment: the conditions of the Saigon river and Dau Tieng watershed was reviewed.
Lukewise other watershed in Asia, although present a lower populations than in other cases, have
worsened in the last decades due to encroachment of populations, wars and uncontrolled exploitation
of natural resources (fbrest wildlife). A correct management of the upper watershed is essential to
properly utilize the water reswources potential of the area.
35.2          Environmental Issue and their Signiricance
The ETA considers (i) all significant environmental issues associated with irrigation development
projects and (ii) off-site environmental influences which have the potential to adversely affect the
project Each of these issues was evaluated in terms of its significance for the proposed project,
namely: major significance, moderate significance and minor significance.
Based on this analysis, the significant environmental issues expected to results from the project were
ranked in two main categories:
Critical Issues, or issues which  must be resolved prior to proceed with the project
implementation;
COther Significant Issues (not-critical), or issues whose solution does not affect the project
implementation and may he resolved through further studies and investigations.
The presentation. discussion and solution of the critical issues is developed in Chapter 4, of the nther
significant issues in Chapter S.

4.           ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AND PROTECTION MEASURES
FOR CRITICAL ISSUES
4.1          Drainage and Conversion of Acid Sulphate Soils for Agriculture
4.1.1        Constraints In Add Sulphate Soik
Soils limitations differ among potential and actual acid sulphate soils. Chemical constraints in acid
sulphate soiLs may be summarized as follows:
in potential acid sulphate soils. the main constraints to crop development are: acidification
upon drainage, low bearing capacity, tidal influence, salinity intrusion and low pH,
aluminium toxicity, phosphorus deficiency, excess of Fe"'. acidification of surface water.
poor microbiological activity, poor N- mineralization;
in upland crops(non submerged crops, the chemical problems include excess of acidity from
Fe+. Ho and Mnr+, problems associated with the aluminium toxicity (soluble AP'), low
availability of P due to fixation by iron and aluminium, low base status and nutrient
deficiencies, salinity;
in wet-land rice cultivation under flooded/reduced conditions, the acidification process is
partially reversed, with increase of the pH and precipitation of the aluminium (insoluble);
problems are associated with and increased Fe?' and H2S toxicity, CO2 and organic acid
toxicity.
Physical problems arise mainly through the inhibition of root development in acid sulphate layers:
crop suffers from water stress, soil ripening is arrested and field drain may be blocked by iron cide
deposits.
Severe limitations exist for the actual acid sulphate soils, where all above mentioned limitations are
likely to occur. For moderate and slightly acidic soils, the above mentioned chemical and physical
constraints are much less severe and land is suitable for paddy and for some upland crops. Some
soils in the project area are also temporarily affected by salinity, only present for a few months a
year. As a consequence. soils are not saline, but cannot he cropped during the dry season. Soils
physical constraints are also associated with the high content of clay, which limits the growth of up-
land crops.
4.1.2        Description of Land Use Capability and Soil Reclamation Procedures
Land Use Capability The FAO Framework for Land Evaluation (FAO. 1976) was used to amsems
the suitability for crops cultivated in the project area to the previously identified Land Mapping Units
(LMU). Current suitahility of each LMU for agriculture were determined using limiting conditions.
The land suitability ratings (classes and subclasses) for each land mapping unit was derived.
The suitability classification of each land mapping unit was assessed, assuming "with the project
conditions' : rehabilitatinn and expansion of the existing irrigation and drainage system. prevention
of salt intrusion. freshwater availability satisfying the requirements of the entire Project area.

Serious limitations to soil development are expected only in the strong acid sulphate soils arca notyet
developed with raised beds (some 1,300 ha net area), if appropriate acid soil reclamation practices
and techniques are applied to the other areas.
In fact. all raised-bed lands appear highly suitable to banana, sugarcane. pineapple and eucalyptus
growth. They are moderately andlor marginally suitable to up-land crop;s and non-uitable for rice
crops. The portion of low lands now affected by salt intrusion and acidity is expected to become
highly suitable for paddy-based land use with the adoption of improved water management and
agricultural practices. The up-lands are highly suitable* to all land uses, except for triple paddy.
Reclamation Practices: In the project area, reclamation of moderately and strongly acid sulphate
soils, have heen carried out for the last 10-iS years, under the overall management of the state farms:
in the Long An province, farmers guided by the Forestry Department, constructed raised bed system
for eucalyptus growth. The raised beds system has been practiced, to (i) prevent water logging and
allow up-landlpeTennial crops growth also during the wet season floods and (ii) leach out the acidity
by natural rainfall. However the construction of the raised beds generated large amounts of acids.
which is inevitable when raised beds are constructed in strong acid sulphate soils; however the
generation of some acidity might have been avoided with more careful handling of the superficial
pyritic layers. Lack of freshwater, tidal regime and poor operation and maintenance nf the
drainagelirrigation canal system produced stagnant acid water in ditches and slowed down the
reclamation ptocess.
It is widely acknowledged that measures influencing the soil water regime and on-farm water
management procedures. generally represent the main tool for soils reclamation. Liming and other
agronomic practices play a subsidiary role. In practice. the removal of acid and toxins will mainly
be entrusted to the availability of freshwater (rainfall and irfigation) for each type of soil. Tie land
use and crop selection. both during reclamnation period and at full agricultural develnpment. will be
established accordingly.
The management of acid sulphate soils and reclamation procedures to he carried out in the project
area, have been established by considering previous experiences in Vietnam and vary according to
the soils and the water regime. Such practices differ in each type of soil according to the chcmical
characteristies and depth and composition of the upper soil horizon.

a.    Palo Sulphic Tropaquepts (Slightly Adual Acid Sulphate Soils):  Specific reclamation
procedures in this type of soils are associated with water management, which plays a crucial
role in securing crop yields by supplying irrigation during dry season and sufficient water for
drainage to leach out acidity. Additional measures consists in the application of a reasonable
dose oF lime ( 1-2 tonslhalyear), frtilizers especially P and cultivation of suitable varieties.
Natural leaching and flushing of the residual acidity generated during the dry season. will
occur during the wet season paddy. In these soil in dry season no additional volume to leach
out the acidity is requested. other than water for the normal rice growth.
No major problem  is expected in such soils and only some agronomic measures are
recommended to full maintain the soil fertility. With appropriate techniques, subsidiary crops
(vegetables and up-land crops) may be grown by the farmers during the Winter-Spring crop.
b.   Sulphic Tropaquepts Moderately Actual and Potential Acid Sulphate Soils): These soils
also suffer from chemical and physical constraints, but they have lost their acute toxicity
which charactrizes the acid sulphate soils, therfore are suitable fdr paddy cultivationn
Likewise the previous case, reclamation procedures consist mainly in water management and
agronomic practices will play a subsidiary role. Reclamation procedures differ for (i) flat-
paddy a-as and Cii) for areas where raised bed wer constructed 10-15 years ago.
(i) Flat areas: During the wet season acid leaching and flushing will naturally occur during
paddy soil preparation and cultivation; rainfall will provide sufficient water for rice growth
and leachingu acidity is flushed away during low tide and rainfedrirrigation watr is stored
in ditches to maintain water layer during high tide. In the dry season paddy (W/S and S/O
paddy), ftnners apply additional volumes to leach out the acidity between land preparation
and rice planting/transplanting and during the crop cycle; a rate of approximately 2,500 ml/ha
(net water requirement), was assumed for project design purposes, equal to two full changes
of acid water: (i) after land preparation, to leach out the acidity and toxicity previously
accumulated ; (ii) 30-40 days after transplantinglseeding to remove the toxic elements.
especially ferrous iron and hydrogen sulphide, more soluble with reduced conditions, such
double flushing systm, is anticipated for a 3 years period, after which it is estimated that
acidity and toxicity may he lowered down to a reasonable level. During the dry season cmp.
it is very important to keep the groundwater level in the field ditches and above the pyritic
layer, especially in the Potential Acid Sulphate Soils.
(ii) Raised bed: Existing raised beds in the project area will have to be partially
rehabilitated for up-land/perennial crop cultivation. This operation may produce sonme
additional acidity, with detrimental effects on.quality water in the farm ditches and in adjacent
areas. The rehabilitation of the existing raised beds will be performed by careful handling of
top-soil acid layers. The width and height of the beds will he established according to the
depth of the sulfuric and sulfitic layer and to the micro relief of each area.
The following water management and agronomic practices are recommended for cultivation
of perennial crops in raised bed:
during the wet season. major leaching of acidity and toxins will naturally occur: the
effluent waters rich of acids and toxins will be flushed out by natural drainage dufing
low tide periods:
during the dry season, water should be kept in ditches. to prevent further acidification
of acid sulphate sub-soils and allow the sub-irrigation of up-land crops; besides, an
additional water supply of 1.000 m'lha will be provided to change and refresh the
water and wash-out the acidity and toxicity accumulated in the ditches in dry season:
EIA - Chapter 4                                                                    4 -3



c.    Hurnic Sulphaqueptas (Severely Add Sulphate SOIlk): These soils present critical conditions
for agriculture development. Experience show that any kind of reclamation procedure in such
soils is expected to generate some problems, especially in undisturbed soils. The two main
options which were considered to reclaim such soils are i) rice base system and (ii) raised
bed system.
(i) Reclamation with the rice-based system is mainly associated to the leaching of the acidity
with irrigation and/or raitilil; the process is quite long and last more than one cropping
season because leaching can renove soluble acid. but potential acidity on the exchange
complex would mainly be retained by the soil. However reclamation of strong acid sulphate
soils is possible. especially if reclamation practices are concentrated to remove acidity in the
first 20-30 cm top-soil layer and are carried out for some years and possibly also during the
dry season, although it implies higher cost of pumping;
(ii) Reclamation with the raised bed system would inevitably generate large amounts of acid
and take long time, as demonstrated by the raised bed system adopted in the project area
where SASS reclamation has been going on for 10-15 years. For such soils. the same
protection and management measures described above for raised bed, are proposed.
Only approximately 1,300 ha (net area) of severe acid sulphate soils. mainly located in the
An Ha canal (Long An Province) are still in almost natural conditions and are now cultivated
with Lepisonia. It is assumed that once the drainage and irrigation system would be
constructed, farmers will start to reclaim such soils. Reclamation procedures with paddy-
based system are assumed for design purposes. Reclamation procedures considered by the
project design are:
in di -w season: rainfall and irrigalion will provide the addftional water supply tn
leach out the acidiy which will be drained downLstream during low tide. Rainfed and
irrigation water is stored in the field ditches to maintain the appropriate water layer;
shallow drainage system. based on the construction of shallow drains some 30-40 cm
deep, is recommended for rice cultivation in strong ASS: this system has been
practiced by farmers in the Mekong Delta to increase the height of the raised beds to
Ci) avoid the flood and (ji) to leach out the acidity (Nedecn technical report n. IO).
Other experience in the Mekong Delta show that the reclamation of acid soils in the
20 cm is possible, but priority should he given to favour on-field drainage nf the acid
waters, by construction of appropriate on-farm drainage system;
durinz lb fth   seasonn: experience showrs that one ore more acid water flushing at the
time of land preparation allow reasonable conditions for rice growth in SASS: an
additional water supply to leach out the acidity was therefore assumed for design
purposes, estimated for conservative reasons in 750 mm - net water requirement.
sufficient to allow three full water changes during land preparation. This additional
water supply should dissolve and leach out the acidity and aluminum (soluble at pH1
lower than 4); water layer will be replaced after flushing: according to refrrences.
this operation would lower toxicity down and allow rice cultivation; one or two
flushes during rice growth period, when acidity and toxicity have to be lowered down
to a reasonable level. will also he allowed by the above mentinned water gift:
in both KisRon. especially in the dry season, the ground level in tie field ditches shall
be kept above the pyritic layer; groundwater level shall be carefully monitored in
especially Potential Acid Sulpxate Soils:
4-4                                                                    BAE   - Chapter 4



In any case, rice cultivation in severely acid sulphate soils, causes environmental problems.
since pH of 3 for leached water are to be expected throughout the irrigation and drainage
period. To reduce the negative impact on the environment inside and downstream of the
project area and to reduce the financial burden to farmes, is has been assumed that
reclamation of strong acid sulphate soils will be carried out in 3 years. Within each bach.
five years have been assumed for reclamation purposes. Full development potential for farms
located in severely acid sulphate soils, is reached after 7-8 years.
I
4.1.3        Acidity Sources during Soil Reclamation
Negative impact to the environment is caused by reclamation of acid sulphate soils due to increased
acidity and toxicity in the water. This worsening of the water quality is created by (i) the acidity
generated during the construction on new canals, (ii) the acidity leached out during the acid soils
reclamation, (iii) the acidity from natural acid sulphate soils profiles and (iv) the lowering of
groundwater due to drainage excavation and sluice constructions.
a.    Acidity from Excavation of Canals; in case of newly excavated material. the potentially
acidic material can quickly and dramatically generate acidity. In the past. hundreds of
kilometers of canals were excavated in the acid sulphate soils of the Delta region, generating
large amounts of acidity. The strongest acidification of the water in the canals will take place
in the early rainy season, (see Section 3.3.6). Recent studies estimate that about 90 nol acid
will released from I cnm of excavated material (1.5% pyrite content - similar to the pmject
area). This acid will be released over 4-5 years with about 60-70% during the first year and
much lower quantities in the subsequent years (NEDECO. MDMP. 1991. Working paper
no. 10:Soils). Therefore the problem is severest in the first year and decreases thereafter and
becomes manageable after four-five years. It is also reported that the acid material generated
during the oxidation of the pyritic material, will not be washed in one shower, but it will take
some time. therefore lowering the impact on the environment, but prolonging the period fnr
the entire rainy season, as experienced in the project area.
In Hloc Mon North Binh Chanh project rehabilitation and up-grading, new excavation is
limited (see Table 4.2): the construction of the main canals is very limited: only 15% of
secondary canals will be constructed by the project, of which 75% in moderate and strong
acid sulphate soils; higher impact is expected from the construction of almost 50% of the
tertiary system. 60% of which in moderate and strong acid sulphate soils. Some minor
additional impact should be expected by the construction nf the superficial quaternary system
(on-farm), to be built by the farmers to convey the water from the tertiary to their farm;
acidity generatinn is expected to take place mainly in severe acid sulphate soils (superficial
sulphuric horizon).
The secondary canals are 2.0 m deep below soil surface (-1.5 a.s.l). the tertiary system is 1.5
m deep (-4 m a.s.l). The length of new canal excavation for each type of soil and for each
agricultural sub-area is given in Table 4/3.

Acidity is expected also to be generated by the dredging operation to he carried out in the
existing primary, secondary and tertiary system.

b.    Acidity Released by Reclamation Procedures: Acidity is expected to be generated by the
reclamation activities described in Section 4.1.2. As a matter of fact, the removal of the
actual and potential acidity by water leaching and flushing is the most important practice of
the entire reclamation procedure. Should soils be reclaimed following the above described
procedures, constant leaching of acid waters is expected during the snil reclanation period.
Experience in the area shows that the removal of acidity from the oxidation of acid niaterial
from the raised beds may take more than ten years, if these beds are not properly constructed.
Therefore careful construction of raised beds is recommended, especially in strong acid
sulphate soils, in case such prac'ice be implemented in the project area. However given such
long time for land reclamation, alternative techniques have been considered for future
reclamation:
C.    Acidity rrom Natural Acid Sulphate Soils: In addition to the acidity released from the above
mentioned procedures. some acidity is expected from the natural run-off in acid sulphate
soils, wvhich may include the drainage water from the up-lands into the low-lands. This acid.
accumulated by capillary rise, is quite low, because capillary rise process take place in the
first 60 cm only (Truong. 1989) and the heavy soils have a low water conductivity. It is
estimated that the quantities of acid from such source, are negligible as compared to the
acidity released from the other sources.
d.    Lowering or Groundwater Level: The lowering of groundwater table is expected to occur
in the lands now affected by water logging and with insufficient drainage. once drainage
system will he constructed and be fully operated. Large amount of acid from pyrite oxidation
may he generated in the sub-soil. especially in the potential strong acid sulphate soils with
superficial sulphuric layer (humic sulphaquepts). It may take several decades to remove these
acids. Hlowever in the project area such critical conditions affect only 206 ha (gross area).
most of which under reclamation (raised bed system). In the potential moderately acid
sulphate soils (8% of the area) reclamation procedures will have to he carefully implemented.
to reduce as much as possible or avoid the lowering of groundwaler table below the acidic
layer located 50-60 cm below ground level.
Lowering of groundwater level may also he expected in the downstream portion of Hoc Mon
North Binh Chanh project (C canal. A and B canal area), as a consequence of the propn.ed
protection structures to control saline intrusion (automatic gates). The issue does not seem
critical. since (i) it appears that groundwater level in that area is mainly governed by sea
watcr intrusion, (ii) most nf the land have jarositic horizon deeper than I m (palic
sulphaquepts salic). (iii) in the few strong acid sulphate soils. raised bed system is already
established.

4.1.4         Possible Negative Impact on Environment
All activities associated to project construction and reclamation of acid sulphate soils, may affect the
environment, by accumulating acidity in the water bodies inside and downstream of the project area.
The possible harmful effects inside the project area are summarized herebelow:
I
a.    Effects to Wild Flora and Vegetation: inside the project area and in the immediate vicinity
downstream such impact do not seem to be critical, since water quality in the existing main
and secondary irrigation/drainage canal system, is already afrected by acidity and toxicity in
most of the area (see Section 3.4.6); temporary increase of suspended soils may also occur,
but does not seem to be critical to the vegetation and wild flora along the canal system.
b.    Harmful Effects to Flshing Stock; Inside the project area fisheries potential is impaired by
the high acidity in the present situation (see section 3.4.7). A higher impict is expected to be
caused by the project in the aquatic enviroment and fisheries in the downstream area; the
boundaries of the ecological zones are likely to be modified as consequence of the
modification of the water flow and water quality (incresed acidity). The effects on fishery
- are discussed in Section 5.41.
c.    Use of Add Water for Irrigation: Irrigation will be performed during the construction
period and reclamation of acid sulphate soils by utilizing the Saigon river waters, which will
mix with the waters drained from acid sulphate soils, in the well mixed irrigation & drainage
system. Water quality for irrigation will be partially affected.
Water quality in the Saigon river is suitable for irrigation uses:
during the dry season (December to May) water quality is relatively better than in the
rainy season: pH is ranging between 5 and 7.2, average 6.0 (Li Thiew station): Fe,
Al and SO, are in acceptable ranges; water quality data recently collected along the
Saigon river (stations Thu Dau Mot) confirm that water quality in Saigon. especially
during the dry season, is suitable for irrigation:
during the wet season (June-November) pH is ranging between 4 and 7, average 5.5
(Lai Thieu station); Fe and Al concentration is in acceptable ranges.
During the rainy season especially in the first years. water quality in the project area will
be affected (i) by acidity generated during soil reclanation and natural drainage from ASS
and (ii) by the acidity generated by excavation and construction activitiess in acid sulphate
soils. pH in the project area is expected to range between 3 and 3.5-
During the dry season irrigation water quality will be affected by effluent from acid sulphate
soils reclamation (raised beds, moderate and strong acid sulphate soils) estimated according
to the soil reclamation procedures described in Section 4.1.2. The estimated average
discharge of acidic waters from acid sulphate soil washing by agricultural sub-area is
summarized in Table 414. The quality of flushed waters is very likely to he among the worst
recorded in the project area: similar experiences show that pTl of approximately 3 and toxic
elements at high concentration should be expected.

4.1.5        Strategies to Minimise the Noxious E3fect of Soil Redamation and New
Excavation on Environment
It is virtually imppssible to avoid generation of acidity and temporary worsening of water quality in
an acid sulphate soil environment. However some protection measures to minimize the impact on the
environment have been studied and are incorporated in the project planning and Environmental
Management Plan.
(i)   Project Phasing: to minimize the noxious effect of acidity generated by the reclamation
procedures over the water quality of the area, it is recommended to phase out the-
development of sonme agricultural sub-area; it has been decided to delay by 2 years the
implementation of the Thay Cai area and canal A & B;
(ii)   Reclamation by stages in strong acid sulphate soils; reclamation of strong acid sulphate soils
for each agricultural sub-area will be phased over 3 different batches; the phasing of strong
acid sulphate soils is considered to (i) reduce the negative impact of acid water disposal on
the water quality downstream of the project area and to (ii) meet the financial and operation
capabilities of farimers.
(iii)  Flushing of acidity and slow cropping intensity accrual: the flushing and disposal of acid
water is discussed in Section 4.3. Effective flushing/drainage of acidic waters is possible, by
dedicating part of the irrigation water to drain the acidity, at least for the first 3-5 years.
After this period, leaching of acidity and flushing operation may scale down and cropping
intensity may reach full development. In the project area, a slower cropping intensity accrual
will affect especially Canal C and the Tan Luong Creek areas, where fast and sharp C.l.
increase would be possible, thanks to the good soil conditions; it is assumed that the increase
of the cropping intensity in these area, be slower to allow better disposai of the acidic waters
generated during soil reclamation;
(iv)  Monitoring of Groundwater Level: as mentioned above, the construction of the drainage
system and sluices to prevent seasonal salinity intrusion, may lower down groundwater !evel,
thus create oxidation of pyrite; careful monitoring of groundwater static level anti GW
quality will be considered as most effective tool to control this potential environmental and
agronomic problem. Additional and most important measure to prevent lowering of GW, is
associated with correct and appropriate O&M of the system, particularly with the control of
the water level in the main, secondary and tertiary canal system.

(v)   Canal Construdion; to minimize the acidification on canal dredging and excavation, it is
recommended that careful quality control on embankment construction including compaction,
be carried out during the project construction period, by accurate civil work supevision. In
fact, previous studies anticipate that high quality of dikes plays an important role in protecting
the environment: a well constructed, consolidated and tamped dike, will not give opportunity
to rain water, to dissolve the acid which will be generated mainly from its surface.
Additional protection meaAure is the construction, along the secondary canal embankment, of
a ditch to drain out the acidity, allow it to flow back into the canal and avoid its over-spilling
into the fields. Such measures were included in the tender and contract documents for civil
work construction. Whver feasible, it is also recommended that good top soil from
excavation he stored and re-utilized as superficial layer of the dike, to minimize oxidation and
rainfall water infiltration.
4.2          Disposal of Construction Waste
42.1         Prvious Experiences in VIetnamn and In the Project Area
Disposal of dredged and excavated material from the canal rehabilitation and construction might prove
a critical environmental and agronomic issue in lands where acid sulphate soils are encountered. In
both cases the material usually contents large quantities of potential and actual acidity and toxic
elements. In order to find the best technic and economic solution, the present EIA reviewed the
disposal management plan implemented by the responsible govrnment agencies for the dredging
operation recently carried out in the period March-July 1993. along 15.4 km of the An Ha canal.
The dredged material was pumped with a 300 HP pump operated by a boat, into some plots, located
on the right-end side of the canal. The working capacity of the pump is approximately 500 m'lday;
pumped material is 35-50 m'/ml of mud. According to the design depth of the canal, the material
from dredging ranged between 25 and 36 n9Nil (corresponding to 30-50 mi/ml 'of mud), with
minimum dredging in the downstream portion from Nhi Xuan bridge to An Ha sluice. Chemical-
physical analysis of three samples of dredged material (superficial layer only) shows that
the texture of the pumped material is 50% clay, 30-50% silt and 5-10% sand: in
comparison with the agricultural soil of the area, the disposal material contains
higher silt and lower sand ; constraints to the agricultural production may occur with
such soil, if appropriate agronomic practices are not duly implemented;
in two out of three sample, the actual acidity was between 16 and 18 meq/100 gr;
potential acidity 80 and 100 meq/100 gr; pyritic content 3-5%: pH in H20 resulted
2.0 and 3 respectively; in the third sample, actual acidity was 0. potential acidity
limited to 10 meqIl00 gr and pH 6.9.
Approximately 200 farmers' plots were disposed of, along the An Ha canal. Often the material, of
maximum 0.7 m high, exceeded the farmer's plot and over-flooded into other holdings. It has been
verified that farmer approval was asked by the provincial and hamlet authorities to dispose of the plot
prior to dredging operation Likewise compensation was paid to farmers. However this compensation,
which would eventually cover one year crop, seems insufficient, since experience esewhere in the
country shows that it may take three to five- years before tht field may recover its original
productivity.

Some other projects were visited in the delta region, to assess the environmental impact of disposal
material plans in similar conditions. In the Tam Phuong Irrigation Project (Tra Vinh Province), the
superficial newly excavated layer was disposed on the embankment of the main canals, contained in
a dike to prevent acidity to flow into the fields. The deeper layers were dredged by pumping into
plots along the canal embankment. It may be appreciated that in some areas, reclamation of such
soils is successfully carried out, mainly with the raised bed system cropped by sugarcane.

4.2.2         Overall Strategies for Disposal of Excavated Material
The disposal of dredged/excavated material on the canal embankment and along the canal sides is
normal practice in the country. to reduce the transportation costs and to raise low areas for agriculture
and rural housing. The re-utilization of the excavated material, stems from the need to reduce the
transportation/purchase of material from a borrow area and to a disposal area.
In the case of the Hoc Mon North Binh Chanh project, the disposal management plan is conceived
to keep the excavation/dredged costs in a reasonable cost range, guarantee reasonable construction
standards and minimize the harmful effects to the SUrrounding environment. The best newly
excavated and dredged material will be re-utilized for the embankment strengthening. according to
the design requirements. The material in excess, including loose dredged material and stripping, will
be disposed in appropriate disposal areas, duly equipped and protected. The total length of primary.
secondary and tertiary canal system, preliminary embankment and excavation quantities are shown
in Table 4/6.
Material from newly excavated canals: Quantities of new excavations are estimated 1.79 millinn
rn. of which 69% in the tertiary canal system.
Secondary canal (avg depth 2 m or 1.5 a.s.l); some 0.47 million mi will be excavated in the
secondary canal system; only 25% of the new excavation is carried out in severely acid
sulphate soils, 25 % in moderately acid sulphate soils. Some 75% of the material will he re-
utilized for canal embankment, appropriate disposal areas will have to be identified: estimated
volume of 'critical acid sulphate soil" is 0.11 nmillion mi':

Tertiary Canal System (average depth 1.5 m or I a.s.l); the newly excavated material
roughly amounts to 1.25 million m', located for 25 % in acid sulphate soils with acidic layer
between 0 and 50 cm. Some 77% of the material will be re-utilized for canal embankments;
disposal areas will be identified for the remaining material totaling 288,000 m'.
Material rrom dredging: Almost the entire primary canal system, excluding An Ha and 'May Cai,
85% of the secondary system and more than 50% of the tertiary system are to be dredged and re-
shaped under the project Quantities of dredged material are estimated 4.4 million in, 40% of which
in the primary canal system, 37 % in the secondary and only 21 % in the tertiary canal system. The
harmful effect of dredged material to the environment is potentially high, since such material contains
large quantities of acidic material and toxic elements which have deposited over the projec life span.
Measures to protect the environment and minimize the negative effects on human and natural
environment have been considered in the EIAIEMP. Quantities of dredgedlexcavated materials may
be summarized as follows:
Primary Canal System: some 1.8 million nin are likely to be dredged fdr the primary canal
system; according to the design, only 26% of the material will be re-utilized for embankment,
74% will have to be disposed in appropriate disposal area;
- Secondary Canal System; quantities of new dredged material are estimated 1.6 million in'.
most of which located in acid sulphate soils; according to the design. 60% of the material will
be re-utilized for canal embankment;
Tertiary Canal System: quantities of dredged material are estimated only 0.95 million m';
such material will be mainly disposed on the embanknent of the tertiary canal, since a low
carrying capacity of the service road is needed and excavated material is likely to be better
than what dredged from the main and secondary canals. Some 13% of material in excess will
be transported to the disposal area.
-An overall disposal management plan is outlined in the following section, where protection measures
to minimize the negative impact to the human and physical environment are described.
4.2.3        Disposal Management Plan
* rinciples Governing the Disposal Management Plan: Some main principles have been followed
for the final identification of the disposal management plan. Disposal areas shall be identified to
minimize the negative impact on the existing human and physical environment. Disposal plots may
be located preferably in waste land in the proximity of the canals; if such lands are not available,
disposal areas are to be identified along the existing embankinents; should such -land not be available.
because of existing constructions, the material will have to be disposed in the farmers fieldlgarden.
Priority will be given to farmer preference. It is well known that in the area, fanners are willing to
raise the elevation of their gardens to prevent houses, crops and plantation from flooding during the
wet season. In the field survey to be carried out by the agriculural services. farmers willing to raise
their plots will be given priority in the selection process.
Fair compensation for the crops lost will he paid from the provincial govenment and appropriate
protetion measures be carried out during the project life span, for the reclamation of the affected
soils. Based on the above general guidelines, the disposal management plan ror dredgedlexcavated
material was reviewed, to make sure that appropriate protection measures to the environment were
duly considered. The measures relevant to the environmental protection have contsequently been
included in the tender and contract documents.

Description of Dredging/New Excavations:
a.   Main Canals: the dredging and excavation operation in main canals. which bed width varies
from 8 to 25 m. will be carried out with two diffmrent techniques:
(i)  excavation by clamshell or normal excavator:  the material in excess will he
temporarily disposed on the embankment and then transported to the final disposal
area by truck; disposal areas, along the canal will be maximum I km far therenf:
this material rather consistent, with relatively low water content, will be disposed at
an average height of 1 m, ranging 0.8-1.2 m according to the area ind the need of
the affected population: appropriate drainage ofthe disposal area will be provided and
has been included in the design technical specifications.
(ii)  pumping by drug-line or dragger: the material will be directly pumnped from the boat
to the final disposal area, located along the canal system at a distance varying 30-100
m from the canal. In this case, the material is muddy, with a volume approximately
-          150% of the final one; a dike of I m will have to be built along the borders of the
-       disposal area parallel to the embankment, to contain the material and avoid any over-
flooding into neighboring properties; some drainage canals shall also be constructed
to allow the return flow of acidic water back into the river system. A lower height
of the disposal area is estimated, after water drainage and compaction (approximately
0.8 m). It is estimated than these two measures (dike and drainage canals) would
increase the dredging cost by 10%.
Some 110 ha shall be identified for disposal area along the main canal system. It is worth
noting that. while the area along the embankment of C canal is not inhabited, the area along
bnth Canal A and B embankments is rather densely occupied by local dwellers. Potential
disposal areas will have to be identified in the few free plots along the canal embankment
and/or inside farmersr land/garden house.
b.   Secondary and Tertiary Canals: dredging and excavation operation in the secondary and
tertiary canal system. will be executed by mechanic and/or human labour excavation: tiie
material in excess will be temporarily disposed on the embankment and then transported to
the final disposal area by truck:
Some 65 ha along the secondary and 39 ha along the tertiary canal system shall he identified
for disposal area along the secondary canal system. No major impact nn human and phy.sical
environment is expected fmm the disposal areas along the secondary canal system.
Disposal Areas: The material from dredging/excavation not re-utilized for embankment, will be
transported to appropriate disposal areas. The disposal areas have been computed by considering a
co-efficient of 1.25 to translate into compacted embankment the volume of loose dredged material,
according to the local experience. The height of the disposal material after compaction is assumed I
m for all excavated/dredged material, except for the mateial dredged from C Main Canal (pumping).
Disposal areas will be identified by the HCM City and Long an Agricultural Services, in collaboration
with the local authorities: a detail field investigation shall be carried out soon after the completion
of the resettlement survey and the final estimate of quantities.
EIA - Chapter 4                                                                   4 - 13



The Plan of Action for the detailed identification of the disposal areas is as follows:
I .   identification by the Provincial Agricultural Service of the institutional set-up in charge of the
activity according the Govermnent and Vietnam and IBRD guidelines, including:
-     the compensation council at Provincial. Village and Hamlet level;
-     the property assessment team;
2.   final estimate of quantities of material to be dredged and disposed, disposal areas for each
main and secondary canal; quantities shall be provided to the compensation team by the
Hydraulic Design and Survey Company n.2;
3.   Property Assessment Team (PAT) field move to identify suitable disposal plots; in the
survey, appropriate property assessment formats will be filled in and signed for farmers
acceptance: in principle it is understood that the Property Assessment team will include:
the vice-chairman of the village;
a property assessment engineer (provincial agricultural service);
a lepresentative of the Hamlet;
a representative of the Village land manager;
a reprsentative of the Farmers Associations;
In the frame of the Property Assessment, the PAT will (i) identify the crops grown by the
farmers, the plantations and other fixed assets located in the possible disposal area; (ii) collect
some few basic information on the socio-economic situation of the farmers Family.
4.   Establishment of the Compensation System, to be applied by the provincialllocal authority and
delivery of the compensation.
Mitigation Measures: Measures to mitigate the negative effects of the disposal plan on the
environment are identified and included in the overall project planning; the cost of such measures is
also included in the project cosL
Compensation system: fair compensation will have to be paid by the provincial authorities to
farmers, to compensate for the crops lost during reclamation period. It is estimated that the
productivity of the disposal areas will be almost fully recovered after 3 years. with the
implementation of appropriate reclamation techniques; compcnsation will be established after
the cnmpletion of a detail inventory of the type and areas (number of plants) by the PAT
teams. The unit rate applied for the compensation during the dredging operation along the An
Ha canal (1993) was utilized to preliminary estimate the cost of compensation (1,200 VNDIm'
of sugarcane, 30-60.000 VNDIplant of banana);
The construction of a dike to contain the disposal material and of drainage canals to favour
the leaching of the acidity back into the main and secondary canal system are included in the
contract documents (C canal); detail planning of such disposal areas shall be provided by the
Hydraulic Design and Survey Company n.2 andlor by the planning section of the Provincial
Agricultural Service: for all other disposal areas, appropriate drainage will be provided.
A special program for soil reclamation will be carried out by the provincial authority. for soil
reclamation of disposal areas;. all farmers expressing the will to reclaim the area and re-
utilize it for agriculture, will be included in the program; it is believed- that such program
will not be an additional burden to the provincial authority, so far as it is part of the overall
reclamation and management of acid sulphate soils: the program will he implemented by the
two provincial services in the frame of the agricultural development prngram.

Cost of the compensation system to make up for the temporary loss of fertility amount to 0,71 Million
US S. assuming an average compensation of 1,000 US S/halyear for 3 years (Table 417). The other
costs, namely enhancement measures for disposal areas and soil reclamation, have b6en included in
the civil works and agricultural development components respectively.
4.3           Drainage and Disposal or Emuents from Add Sulphate Soils
4.3.1         Hydraulic Folow for Acid Disposal
Drainage of acid effluent from the acid sulphate soils of the project area into the downstream region
presents the potential hazard of affecting the water quality and aquatic environment. During and after
the project implementation, large quantities of acidic mnaterial will be generated, due to oxidation of
pyrites in ASS. Acidity is not'present only in the form of H* ions but also in the form of
exchangeable ions Al orland Fe. all elements easily dissolved into acidic waters; such elements cause
toxicity to aquatic organism and vegeation as well as constraints for domestic water supply.
The water quality in the project area has been affected by acidity for a long time; the situation has
worsened during and after the soil reclamation procedures carried out by the State Farms on acid
sulphate soils. Some acidity control is expected with the appropriate O&M of the newly constructed
An Ha sluice, which impact on the water quality of the system may be finally assessed after the 1994
rainy season.
Although acidity is already characterizing the existing aquatic environment inside the project area and
to a lesser extend in the downstream area, it is advisable to control the acid effluent disposal to
(i) minimize the impact on the water quality for irrigation and the other uses (inside the project) and
(ii) minimize the negative impact on the other beneficial water uses in the downstream area.
An hydraulic model was developed, to simulate the water flow in the project. The water model has
been utilized to simulate the flushing operation to drain acid effluent downstream of the project area.
The most appropriate system lay-out associated with optimum system operation should guarantee a
safe and as far as possible contolled disposal of acid effluent downstream. The system operation and
optimum system lay-out is particularly important for Hoc Mon North Binh Chanh irrigation project.
a "well mixed system", where drainage and irrigation are carried out in the same canal system.

43.2         Strategy ror Addlc Emuents Disposal
The environnuental issue created by the disposal of acid waters from reclamation and construction
activities in ASS is expected to peak during and immediately after the pmject cnnstruction and scale
down to reasonable level after few years.
Similar experence in the Mekong Delta (lam Phuong project) shows that very low pH are remrded
for two-three years, during and'immediately after project construction. However considerable
improvement of the water quality was assessed from the third year after project completion.
Two main cases are identified (i) the wet season (June to November) and (ii) the dry season
(December to May). Strategies for safe and controlled washing of the acidity outside the project area
answers to different priority during the two seasons.
Wet Season: large quantities of acids and toxins are dissolved with the first rains. Inside the project
ara, very low pH are likely to be recorded at the beginning and during the rainy season, especially
in June to August. This consideration stem by the fact that t  ,truction activities affect the
excavation/dredging of some 5 million n' during first three years, part of which in moderate and
strong acid sulphate soils; the dredged and excavated material inside the project area and soil
reclamiation procedures will generate large quantities of dissolved acid. Priority is to guarantee that
adequate and continuous drainage is granted and no accumulation of acidity is generated inside the
project area and downstream thereof. Water beneficial uses downstream of the project area were
reviewed, to guarantee that no significant impairment of the existing situation is generated by the
project.
Dry Season; freshwater supply of good quality is available during the dry season; in the first 5-S
years. available freshwater will be utilized for two purposes (i) irrigation and (ii) soil reclamation.
Appropriate operation of the system shall be applied by the Irrigation Management Company to
- guarantee, on one side the drainage of acid waters produced by the soil reclamation downstream of
the project area and on the other side good water quality for irrigation. As already mentioned in
Section 4.1.4, is has been assumed that cropping intensity accrual will be affected and delayed as
compared to the agricultural potential, to meet the requirements of reclamation procedures. consisting
in additional water supply for acidity leaching and availability of the canal system to flush it
downstream.
In the Project Preparation the strategy for acidic water disposal was conceived by identifying the best
possible combination between (a) system lay out and (b) system operation, to guarantee optimal use
of irrigation and safe acid water disposal downstream.
a)    Lay-out of the Drainage System: die well-mixed system lay-out has been reviewed to
minimize the mixing of the clean freshwater from the Saigon and the acid effluent from field
redamatidn, by identifying preferential routing for acid effluent disposal. Therefore two
drainage canals have been planned and, during reclamation period, shall be mainly utilized
for flushing acid effluent: the West Drainage and the link canal; however some mixing of
acidic water in the An Ha canal will inevitably occur, even with optinal system operation,
due to the effluent of the upper An Ha and Thay Cai draining into Racii Tra and An HTa: the
drainage pattern for acid water, shown in Figure 411 (dry season case), is summarized as
follows:
(i)   the We-st Drainage canal will drain the acid effluent produced in the right-side of An
Ha canal - 1.950 ha (moderately and strong ASS) located in FICM city and Long An:
4 -16                                                                  EIA - Chapter 4



(ii)   the Link and C canal and C sluice will preferably drain the acid waters produced in
the left-side of the An Ha canal and in the Link canal - 2.360 ha (most of which
moderately potential and actual ASS); the high drainage capacitv of C sluice mav
allow the drainage of the acidic water of the upper An Ha. part of the Thav Cai. part
of the A and B canals area not drained by other drainage routing:
(iii)   An Ha - 825 ha of strong and moderate ASS and part of the Tlay Cai -2.696 ha most
of which strong and moderate ASS. will be drained either through Rach Tra back into
Saigon during low tide. or along the An Ha canal and Link canal to C sluice:
(iv)   the A and B canal and sluice will drain in the effluent - 1.560 ha (moderately and
slightly ASS) not drained Utrough the C sluice.
Some of the acid effluent now planned to be flushed through the C sluice. may be drained
through the Tan Tao sluice. located at Tan Tao bridge. The drainage capacity of the sluice
has to be further investigated and was not considered by the hydraulic simulation model of
the flushing operation. This sluice, finally included in the project lay-out, may allow the
partial reduction of the acid effluent through the C sluice into Ngang canal, by diverting part
of the flow into Ba Hom creek and Can Giuoc canal. In wet season (Figure 4/2). the An Ha
sluice will play a more important role in the flshing and will be used for drainage purposes.
b.   System Operation In wet season, priority of the system opertion is the safe drainage of
acid waters ouside the project area, since irrigation requirement are quite low,'at least in the
first years. Downstream of the project area, the final disposal area of acid waters is mainly
the Vain Co Dong river and to a much lesser extent, the Saigon river. In both rivers, the pH
during the wet season is lower than in the dry season. since their water is (i) less affected by
salinity carried by tidal and (ii) receives-the return flow and drainage fromr acid sulphate soils
located in the catchment along the river sides.
In dry season, appropriate operation of the system shall be applied to control the drainage of
acid waters produced by the soil reclamation downstream of the project area, with minimum
impairment of the water quality and quantity for irrigation uses. C.-pping intensity accrual
during the dry season will be affected and delayed as compared to Lfi_ agricultural potential.
to meet the requirenents of reclamation procedures. The system will be operated, at the same
time. for flushing and irrigation: clean water of the An Ha will be alternatively used for
irrigation and flushing in the right and left side of the Am Ha canal: when irrigation is
performed in the West drainage canal area, flushing operation will be performed in the Unk
and C canal and vice-versa.
4.33         Poteltial impact of EMuent in the Project Area and Downstream
The canal system downstrceam of the project area draining the effluent from An Ha and A, B. C and
Tan Kien sluices. is constituted by (see Figure 4/1 and 42):
(i)   Cau An Ha canal - 8 kan, discharging waters of An Ha and West Canal sluices into Vam
Co Dong; average pH in the dry season is 5.7. in the wet season 3.7:
(ii)   Xang canal - 12 lan. discharging waters of the An Ha and West Drainage sluices in Vam Co
Dong: average pH in the dry season is 5.3. in the wet season 3.7;        .
(iii)   Ngang Canal 13 km. discharging 100% of the acid effluent of A. B and C canal sluice:
average pH during the wet season of 5.8. during the dry season of 6.5:
(iv)   Cho Dem - Ben Luc River 20 km. receiving 100% of the Ngang canal waters and discharging
into Vim Co Dong: avenge pH of the wet season 6.2 and dry season 5 (Ben Luc river):
(v)    Can Giunc receiving part of the Cho Demn waters:

AIceording to the flow model, the Vam Co hnng river is the final destination }r ofhe acidic eMfuenl
from the project area: only minimal volumes are discharged into Can Giuoc/Saigon. According to tle
available data, the plT or Vanm Co Dong in tIme wet season (June4ept) In the reach between Ben lI,c
bridge and An Ila bridge, ranges between 3.5 and 4.5 (avg 4.0): in the dry seasonn pi] of 6 or higher
are recorded.
Flushing Operal loit: In tle dry seasonn some freshwater from tlhe Saigon river will he utilizel to
flush eut the acid waters discharged -by farmers in the canals. During tIe flushing perind (2-3 clays)
Farmers do not use the water for irrigatinn; the downstream sluices, usually clnsed during irrigalion
period. are leR opened and freshwater left free to circulate in the secondary and tertiary canals and
dilute the acidic water accumulated. The diluted water is washed out during lnw tide thlroughi tele
downstream sluices. In th .t ieason, the water frnm the Shigon river is left free to circulate in tlie
system and to dilute the acid waters from natural run-off and fields efMuenis. The mixed water is
drained downstream during low tide periods.
To assess the impact of acid eMuent inside and downstream an effbrt has been carried out lo possibly
associate the water pi to the water low simulated by the hydraulic model. Two case studies were
analyzed, (a) the dry season (April tidal regime) - and the (h) wet season (June tidal regime).
Impact during the Dry Season (Figure 4.1): Inside the project during the flushing period, the acid
waters from farmers mixed with the water stored in the canals and the freshlwater coming from the
Saigon river, will temporarily lower the pH from 5 to 4 in both the West Drainage and the C canal:
however the original pil is expected recover its original value in a few days. since Freshwater rrom
Saigon river is continuously supplied to the project area for the flushingl aind irrigation purposes;
inside the area, A and B sluices along the Link canal shiall protect A and 13 canal Rrea from acid
effluent
In the downstream area: during the flushing operations the acid effluent disposed from Ile project area
will temporarily lower the p1l of the canals located downstteam; the phl in An 1la and Xang canal
is expected drop from 5.3 to 4.5; in Ngang and Cho DemlBen Luc river, tihe phi is expected
tempnrarily lower fron 6.5 to 4.5-5 during tde flushing period and tecover its original value in one
or two days. under lidal lonw. No acidity accumulation is expected, sinice net discharge downsircam
allow time drainage of acid water to the final disposal arem;
The impact in the Vam Co Dong (final disposal) appears negligible, since in the river the tidal
movement moves huge volumes of water every day: in the dry season (lie tidal fluctuation moves
some 500-00 Dm'Is, with net discharge of 15-30 nm's to the sea; however even assuming fior
conservative reasons the dilution of acidic efuent in 10-15 km and no inrlowoutfliow nf rreshwater.
no modification of the ptH in the Vam Co Dong is expected.
Impacd duiring the Wet Season (Figure 4.2): Inside time project area the incremental acid drainage
caused by leacihing operations and soil reclamation will mixed with the water stored in the canals.
No significant impact on the aquatic environment in the An lla system is expected, thanks to tile
continuous freshwater supply froTm the Saigon river. However the acid area will tempnrarily expand
into tlie Link and the C canal area during the wet season. The pIt is expected to range between 3.0
and 3.3 for the first 3-4 years, notwithltanding the continuous supply of freshwater from the Saigon
river.
No mainjor significant impact is expected downstream in the "transition zone", Cau An fla and Xang
canal which acidity may increase as compared to tlie present conditions. Quite significant increLse
nr the acidity is instead to lie expected in the Ngang, Cho Dem and Ben Luc river, which pit may
range between 4 and 5 (present range is 5-6); most affected by the acid effuent disponsal will be the
Ngang and Cho Dem canals. HTowever nn acid accumulation is expected. since liolt rivers show nel
disclharge dnwnsIream which allows the drainage of acid water to final dispinsal in Varn Co Dong.

The impact in Vam Co Dong (final disposal) appears to be nil, since in the river is highly affected
by acidity ranging 3.54.5 (average 4) in the reach between Xang canal and Ben ILc river and by
tidal movements. An average discharge of approximately 150 m'ls in this reach, guarantee the safe
evacuation of the acidity to the sea.
In conclusion, the impact nf the acidic effluents produced by soil reclamation and construction
activities has been assessed as follows: (i) the production of acid effluent is temporary, will peak
during the construction and soil reclamation period but will steadily decrease after the first 3-5 years:
improved water quality will be caused by soil reclamation procedures, in the long run: (ii) disposal
of acid effluent will slightly affect the water quality inside the project area and only temporary
expansion of the acidic area is expected; however during the dry season dilution and flushing of acid
waters has been proposed to keep the quality of the water acceptable for irrigatinn uses and during
the wet season an almost continuous flushing is proposed to dilute and flush out the acid rumnff
watem and avoid its accumulation; (iii) more significant impact will be temporary caused to the
downstream area, where increased acidity of aquatic environment will occur especially during the wet
season, in the Ngang, Cho Dem/Ben Luc river; (iv) the Vam Co Dong, final disposal area of the
acidic effluent, will only very locally and marginally be affected by the acid effluent, which will be
fully diluted and safely transported th the sea.
4.4          Liquid EMuent Disposal
44.1         Brief Description of the Present Drinage System or HCMC
Ho Chi Minh is essentially a low laying area, affected bysemi-diumal tide of the China Sea with two
distinct high and low tide. Three main topographical areas are distinguished, (i) area with elevation
0.8 -2 m. (ii) area 2-5 and (iii) area 5-7 in as.l; the majority of the town is located in the 0-2 a.s.l.
therefore subject to tidal fluctuation. Most of the sewer/drainage out-falls are subject to tidal
fluctuation.
According to the official data, the population in the city is approximately 3.2 million people, with
average population density of 22,300 people/klc. At present all domestic and industrial sewerage
of HCM City are discharged into surface water drainage system and ultimately disposed of dirctly
into Saigon river, without any formal treahnent other than local screening and some septic tanks. The
sewerage/drainage system is constituted by 650 km. with average sewer density of 77 m per ha, quite
low density sewer system.
Main sewerageldischarge systems are constituted.by the following:
*     Ben Cat - Thum Luong: 14 km length and 15 m width, with average depth of 1.3 km. the
system drains an area of approximately 90 kn9, located in the North and North West and
including the Tan Binh, Go Vap, Binh Thanh, Binh Chanh and Hoc Mon; the system, -which
will be described in more details in Section 4.4.2, is heavily polluted mainly be industrial
discharge;
*     Nhieu Loc: 9.6 km length. with average depth of 0.3 km, the system drains an area of
approximately 31 klc. located in the South East and including the Binh Thanh,Phu Nhuan.
District 3 and District I of HCM City; the system is mainly polluted by domestic discharge;
*    Thi Nghe - Tan Hoa: 9 km length, with average depth of 1.2 - 4 m, the system drains an area
of approximately 25 km2, located in the center of the City, in the district n. I. 10. 4 and 5:
the system is heavily polluted by domestic and industrial discharge;
ETA - Chapter 4                                                                   4 - 21



Lo Gom - Tau H-u - Kinh Doi: 15-50 m wide, with average depth of 2.5-5 m, the system
drains an area of approximately 65 kmr, located in the Southern portion of the town and
including the Urban District n. 6. 10 and II and Tan Binh District and An Lac and Binh Tri
Doug villages of the Binls Chanh district; the canal system, the most important of HCMC,
receipt a daily discharge of approximatel:' 200,000 m'/day industrial and domestic eMuent
(2 million people), the system is heavily polluted by organic and inorganip anatter.
The daily water-waste discharge from the domestic and industrial settlements is approximately 0.7
million mn. The drainage/sewerage system is old, under-sized and heavily polluted. Construction of
new canals, rehabilitation and improvement of the drainage system is planned by the IICM City
People's Commitee, to prevent floods and improve the pollution contml and environment prntection.
First priority of the HCMC People's Committee is the rehabilitation of the Lo-Gom, Thi Nghe and
Nhieu Loc systems, located in the urban districts of HCMC. A feasibility plan for the rehabilitation
of the Tan Hoa - Lo Gom system have been completed under the overall supervision of the HCMC
Agricultural Service, Environmental Protection Council (EPC) and Mechanical Institute.
General plans for the Ben Cat - Thamn Luong have been put forward, but the rehabilitation of the
system is considered a second priority by the City Authority.
Among the problems affrcting the sewerage and drainage systen of the city, are the construction of
houses on the canal and the growth of vegetables, which decrease the disc harging capacity of the
system. The conditions of the drainage/sewerage system is detrimental to the public health and the
general environenut of the city. The polliution caused by uncontrolled discharge of domestic and
industrial wastewater is a major constraints especially during the dry season, when water in the system
is lower and tidal dilution less effective.
The Master Plan general strategy for the urban development of HCM City after year 2.000, anticipate
major improvements to the combined sewerageldrainage system, with rehabilitation/expansion of the
primary canal system and construction of a separate sewerage system and major sewerage treatment
work at Nha Be, 1.3 million m' per day capacity. Another 0.45 million m' treatment pIant is planned
in the East side of the town, to serve the new city area. (Cat Lai STW).
Strategies forenvironmentprotection consists of careful land-use planning, infrastructuredevelopment
and strict enforcement of pollution laws and regulations. In May 1993. regulations for pollution
control for HCM City were issued by the HCMC Environment Committee. In the regulations the
allowed limits for waste-water discharges into public waters are determined. The Envirmnmental
Committee is determined to enforce such limits to the industrial sector, which will have to carry out
primary and secondary treatment to lower down pollutants to the acceptable limits before discharging
into public waters.
Careful survey of 46 major pollutant industries has been undertaken by the Envimnmental Committee:
the results of the survey, should be used to determine the detail strategy to enforce the regulations
to the industrial sector. In principle it is planned that by 1995, any industrial settlement located
nutside the 12 industrial areas anticipated by the Master Plan, ought to comply with the pre-set
regulations on pollution standards and control. According to the Committee. some 30 industries with
unsatisfactory standards were stopped to produce in 1993.
4.4.2        Tham Luong System Present Situation
The environmental issue concerns the uncontrolled wastewater discharge in Tham Luong creek
entering in the Project area and in its irrigation water - Unk canal- at Tan Tao bridge. Since l1ink
is heavily affected by tidal fluctuation, the pollution generated from the urban and sub-urban district
of HCM City is transported inside the system waterways.

The Tham Luong creek is part of the drainage system of the external urban and suburban districts of
HCM City. On the northern portion, the system is constituted by the Ben Cat Canal, discharging into
the Saigon river; the system continues to the South West with the Than Luong Creek, the Ridh Chua
and the Ba Hom creek to the extrene South (Figure 4/3).
The flow and the catchment area of Than Luong Creek is shown in Figure 4/3 and in Table 4n. The
flow in the Ba Hom-Tham Luong and Ben Cat system is heavily conditioned by:
*    the natural run-off; 30% of the average rainfall (1910 mmlyear), the natural run-off
orthe systemn is estimated some 83.8 million m'/year, equivalent to an annual average
flow of 2.6 mr5s/year. with minimum discharge during the dry season and maximum
during the rainy season;
*    the elevation; most of the systen is located below 2 m a.s. l, therefore subject to tidal
regime, during both wet and dry seasons; only in the reach behveen the village of
Binh Hung Hoa and the Tham Luong bridge on road n. 22, the elevation higher than
2.5 m interrupt the tidal flow during the dry season;
*    semi-permanent dams constructed by the farmers to prevent pollution to enter into
-        their fields in the upper nTches and prevent salt intrusion for kous cultivation in the
lower reaches:
Seven sub-catchments were identified, totalling 153 km'. namely: Ba Honm. PRach Chua. Tham
Luong, Cho Moi. Ben Cat, Hoc Mon and Binh Tri Dong (Figure 4/3). During the dry season, the
high elevation and dams constructed by the farmers separate the system in two well distinguished
reaches: Cho Moi (airport), Ben Cat and Hoc Mon catchments, total 90 kn2. discharging towards
the North-East; Ba Hom, Rach Chua, Tham Luong and Binh Tri Dong discharges to the South-West,
into the project area. In the wet season due to heavy rains and floods. the overall system is in
communication, therefore polluted waters of the northern part of the system may spill over in the
project area. Peculiarities of the catchments part of the reach discharging into the project area is as
follows (Table 418):
(i)    Ba Hom catchment (1), located on the Eastern side of Ba Hom creek. 5.5 kni wide: minor
industrial settlement are present in the area, therefore the waterwaste is constituted by the
domestic discharge of 9,000 people living in the area;
(ii)   Rach Chua catchment (1). located on the Eastern side of the Rach Chua-Ba Hoom creek. 13
km' wide, located in the villages of Tan Tao and Binh Tri Dong; the creek mainly discharges
agricultural drainage and domestic waste water of some 12,500 people living in the area:
(iii)   Tham Luoug catchment (ill), part of the Binh Hung Hoa village and the subdistrict 14. 16.
17 and I8 of the uTban Tan Binh district; the creek collects domestic waste waters of some
60.000 people living in the area and 5 million industrial discharge from major textile. paper
and food processing factories;
(iv)   Binh Tri Dong catclment (VII). located in the western side of the Tham Luong system and
discharging the run-off of the villages of Binh Hung Hoa, Vinb Inc and Tan Tao in the Binh
Cbanh district; this catchment is 36 kn9 wide and collects the agricultural drainage waters
and domestic waste waters of some 24,000 people living in the area
The average net annual discharge towards the project area is estimated 1.4 nm/s, 15-17% of which
constituted by waste water discharged into the system (11% I  by industrial effluent). Such industries
discharge into the creek highly polluted wastewaters. Main polluting elements are an high content
of BODS and COD, detergent. TSS and TDS. heavy metals, sulphur. chlorine demand etc.

Some water quality analysis carried out by the project (April 94), siow that polPution charge is
particularly heavy in the reach upstrwm of the Main Highway n. 1, where the water quality of the
creek is well below the set-up standards for category 11 water resources limits set-up for HCMC
(especially BOD. N, DO). In the other stations located downstream of National Highways, the water
quality slightly improves, thanks to the damns constructed by farmers to prevent saline intrusion and
the dilution effect of the tidal move'ment inside the Ba Hoam and the Rach Chua. The heneficial effects
of the lotus bio-growth on the water quality need to he further investigated.
4.4.3        Future Plns for Tham Luong
The Ben Cat/Tham Luong/Ba Hom system will play an important role in the drainagelsewerage
system of the future external suburbs city expansion, anticipated by the long term Mastjr Plan of
HCMC. In the Master Plan the eastern part of the system would be rehabilitated.in the frame of the
rekabilitation and upgrading of the sewerage and drainage system of HCMC. For the North-Eastern
Ben CatMiam Luong, rehabilitation and upgrading would involve-
the improvement of the discharge capacity of the system, by enlargement of the cross-
section; this would enhance the beneficial effects of the tidal to dilute the waste-
waters and the pollutants in the creek;
the construction of a separate primary sewerage system along the canals; according
to the overall stategy followed by the Master plan, in the old settlemnents the existing
combined sewer system will be utilized with some modification; for the new areas.
a separate system is planned;
The system would evacuate the run-off of the above identified sub-catchments (IV, V. VI), for an
approximate agregate area of 90 km, including the industrial ateas of Ba Queo. to be further
expanded in the next future.
No precise planning is anticipated in the HCM City Master Plan, for the South-Western part nf the
system, now discharging into the Project area. except for the upgrading of the drainage capability and
sewerage system of the heavily populated areas of Tan Binh district (sub-district n. I8, Tan Phu area).
Fruture urban sectlement is anticipated for the catchment area of the West Tham Luong-Ba llom
system. since the Master Plan proposes large scale urban and industfial settlement expansion in the
Binh Chanh-An Lac area (see Section 4.5).
The Ba Hom creek is the natural drainage of the new resettlement area, almig and to the East of the
national highways n. 1. in the stretch from the Tan Kien bridge to Tan Tao. In this area new urban
and industrial settlenents are anticipated by the Master plan that, accoJding to the planners, will he
developed hetween now and year 2010. Major industrial settlements are the (i) An Lac-Binh Chanh
industrial settlements located along the Highway n.l and the (ii) Chang Flu Diner port facility,
located along the Ben Luc canal in proximity of the Can Giuoc river. Expansion of existing human
settlement along the National Highway n. I and Ben Phu Dinh road are also anticipated.
Ba lorm is likely to become the major drainage system of the new urban and industrial resettlement
area. Major sewerage infrastructures are planned to be constructed in the Tan Binh-An Lac area and
in the Binh Dien district. located close to the Ba H-1m estuary.

4.4.4        Proposed Strategy for Llquid Emuent Dispo9nl
The discharge of the Tham Luong is an off-site environmental factor which may have the potential
to adversely affect the project. In fact the wastewater effluent discharged in the Tham Luong - Rach
Chua - Ha Hom system presents some short-medium term pollution hazard to the project.
Accumulation of toxins elements from Lrge and small scale industries and domestic waste waters in
the drainage system is likely to occur, if no remedial measure is implemented in the medium period.
The disposal of the Tham Luong creek waste-waters would have to be further studied in frame of the
overall long term rehabilitation of the HCM City sewerage/drainage system. The final resolution of
this complex environmental issue would imply the immediate implementation of the following
measures:
immediate enforcement of the HCM City regulations; as clearly admitted by the responsible
authorities, the enforcement of the permissible standards for industrial effluent discharges
cannot be carried out immediately. It will take a certain time before each industry will be able
to reconvert its production process to make it environmentally sustainahle andlor implement
major environmental protetion measures to comply with the standards; no financial
assistance and/or fiscal facility is anticipated for such major capital burden:
detail plainning of the new resettlement schemes in all sub-catchments: planning of future
sewerage systemn for the suburbs of HCM City are at Master Plan level: so far feasibility and
detail studies have been caried out for snme drainage/sewerage systus located in the urban
districts: although the overall strategy of the Master Plan is approved by the HCM City
People's Committee, it will take time to finalize technical details and find the financial
resources for its implementation. Only recently. a number of bilateral and multilateral
initiatives have been launched to study and implement rehabilitation of the infrastructure
system.
Given the above picture, it was proposed by the project and approved by the city authorities. to
physically separate the dirty and potentially polluting waters of e Tham Luong/Rach Chua/Ba HRom
system from the irrigation waters. This measure, will protect the investment from the negative off-
site environmental effect caused by the vicinity of the project to a heavy populaled and industrialized
area-
The protection measure will be implemented thrnugh a major modification of the system lay-out.
which includes the construction of two small dams/sluices (i) one the C link canal just upstream of
the Tan Tao bridge (Ba Hom) and (ii) one on the Huong Nong creek, connecting the Ba Honm with
the Tan Kien creek. The small sluices would prevent the salt and polluted waters of the Thain
Lunng/Rach Clua and Ba-Hom system to enter in the project area.
It is concluded that:
Project low-lands: the separation of the Tham luong waters from irrigation waters protects
the project area and transform a potential environmental hazard in a non-issue.
Project high-lands: in the high-lands, canal bridges and or syphons will have to be built to
irrigate the part of the Binb Chanh high-lands, located to the east nf Tham Luong.
However, although becoming a non-issue for the project, the environmental issuc of polluted effluent
in Tham Luong is still to be tackled by the responsible authorities (HCM City Agricultural Service.
City Planning Institute, HCMC Environmental Committee, Department of Public Transportation etc.).
The disposal of the drainage and sewerage system of the area will have to be considered in the
sewerage and pollution control planning of HCMC-
EIA- Chapter 4                                                                    4 - 27



4.5          Off-site Environmental Factors
4.5.1        Udlcground
Other environmental factors that have a potential negative impacts on the project are discussed in this
section. to make sure that none of them jeopardize the investment. Most environmental issues
associated with the Hoc-Mon North Binh Chanh irrigation project. are caused by the close vicinitn
of the project area to the HCM City urban area. The main issues reviewed by the EIA are:
the possible expansion of the HCM City urban area inside the project area:
the solid waste disposal in the Hoc Mon and Binh Clanb high-lands.
The urban territory of HCM City is some 160 km2 wide, subdivided in 12 natural catchments area.
According to un-official esdmate. the population in 1994 would be approximatly 5 million people,
living at an average population density of 31,000 people/ithn New expansion of the. area are
andcipated in the frame of the HCM City Mastr plan, in the North of the tOwn (Thu Duc) and in
saellite towns in the nrual districts.
4.5.2        The Project area in the Future HCMC Expansion
Fumr expansion of HCM City suburbs is included in the Master plan On Urban Development for
HCM City after the year 2000. submitted by the City Planing lnstime of HCM City (CPI) and
approved by the cenWal govment in Hanoi in January. 1993.
In the Master Plan the Saigon river is the main axis of te HCM City urban development. A new
city ceter incorporating business and residental districts would be developed across the river and
on the opposite side of the existing center. A total of twelve (12) industrial estate will be developed.
five (5) of which located in the imer city. four (4) equipped with port faclities and the remaining
three (3) will be destned to 'exportprocessing zones'.
The EIA has reviewed the Mastr plan. to make sure that the futre expansion of the city will not
affet the project area. The Project considered a mater of priority to give immediate consideration
to the proposed resettlement areas, within the Project area. The location. gross area. type of
resettlement, satus of planng and concemed agencies for each resettlement area. have been
identified as follows (Table 4/8):
a.    NMhi Xuan Satllite Town; located in the upper left hand side of the An Ha Canal
(Hoc Mon district). the site is intended for construction of a tOwn for 35-40,000
families (150.000 people). equipped with infastructues. hospital, school ec. The
implementation of the satellite town, whicb is planned to be started in 1994 and
completed by year 2010, is still to be approved by the HCMC People's Commitee:
b.    Cau Xang Satellite Town; the area is located in the An Ha sluice area (Canal A)
in Binh Chanh district, along the international road a. 10. The site is intended for
construction a town for some 30.000 families (120.000 people), equipped with
infrastructures. hospial. school etc. The implementatiot of the satellite town. which
is planned to be started in 1994 and completed by year 2010, has already been
approved by the HCMC and Binh Chanh People's Comnittees and is under detail
planning;

c.     An Lic - Blnh Dien Resettlement Site: located in the south-eastern part nf the
Project area, the site is intended far future urban and industrial development; so far
only 800 ha have been approved by the authorities. for the resettlement of some
30,000 families (120,000 people); the remaining ara is under fast urban growth due
expansion of urban areas. Industrial settlements are also anticipated in the area, since
two (2) of the twelve industrial areas are located in this resettlemcnt site, namely (i)
the An Lac-Binh Chanh industrial area and (ii) the Shang Flu Diner. Likewise the
other sites, full utbanization should take place by year 2010 (see Figure 416).
The City Planning Institute is the responsible agency for uiban planning under the overall authority
of the HCM City People's Cnmmittee. The implementation schedule of such urban development.
depends on the future economic scenario, external assistance etc. According to preliminary estimates.
some 30% of the program may be implemented by year 2000. 70% by 2010.
In Nhi Xuan Resettlement site, located on the upper tighit hand side of the An Ha Canal (Hoc Mon
district), a district resettlement scheme is intended to be developed to alleviate the poverty of 300
households of the Hoc Mon district; the resettlement scheme, to be mainly developed for agriculture.
has already been approved by the HCMC and Hoc Mon People's Committees: responsible planning
authority is the Department of Fixed Cultivation and Settlement.
The final project lay-out considers the urban development anticipated by the Master Plan. The areas
identified by the Master plan for urban development are excluded from the development of the
irription infrastructures. Additional protection measure is the exclusion of the Ba Hom creek from
the irrigation system, on the ground that such creek may constitute the main drainage system of the
new resettlement area (see Section 4.4.3). No major change is expected in the urban planning up to
year 2010, therefore no major impairment of the investTnent in irrigation is to he expected from the
expansion of the city.

4.5.3        Solid Waste Disposal
The safe and appropriate disposal of the solid waste of the HCMC urban area, is an environmental
isusue which affects the Project area, since large quantitie-s of solid waste are disposed, especially in
the high-lands.
It is estimated that the daily production of snlid waste in Ho Chi Minh city is approximately 2.200-
2,500 mtlday, equivalent to 0.8 kglperson/day. The solid waste trend since the 70's is shown in
Table 4110. The trend shows a drop in the solid waste produced per capita in the years 7846.
apparently due to the economic crisis. The daily rate produced by each person is now back to the
highest values.
EIA - Chapter 4                                                                     4-29



Collection and DlNsposal: The whole collection and disposal of solid waste is one of the major
environmental issue affecting the sanitation and safe conditions of tbe citY of HCMC. As admited
bv the responsible agencies. the whole system need drastic rehabilitation and up-grading. from
collection to transporraion. disposal and treatment. The collection of solid waste is carried out by
men of old carts manuallv operated: temporary disposal areas may be seen in the streets and
corners: transpormrtion to final destination is carried out by old truck: no separation of industrial and
toxic waste (hospitls etc.) and minimal treatment and processing is carried out.
The whole solid waste collection and disposal is under the responsibility of the HCM Citv People's
Commitee. Depantment of Public Services and Transportation. The Department is provided with its
own collection system and operates in the urban districts: other companies and services operate under
the overall management of the Department. as the Cong Ngong cooperative and the Service Company.
k is esmated thatmore than 60% of the HCMC solid waste is disposed in the Hoc-Mon and Binh
Cbanb area. All trucks unloading in the region are weighed at the Go Cat statin locaed along the
National Highway n.1. At the station some rough estmate of the solid waste quality is also
performed. Data collected at the Gocat Station in the January and Februarv 1994 show that in the
months some 45.000 mt have been delivered to the sazion, approximately 50% constituted by
organic matter, 50% by inorganic material. Some 40-60% is constitted by organic maeriaL the
remaining being paper-caoons. metals, plastics, glasses etc.

Use at Farm Level: After weighing at Go Cat, more than 95% of the solid wastes are delivered to
the farmers. Recipient farmers are located in the villages of Binh Hung Hoa. Vinh Loc A and B. Tan
Tboi Nhat. Xuan Thoi Thuong, Xuan Thoi Son and Tan Thoi Nhi etc. In the project area. the
material is disposed in the up-land: in the low lands the only disposal area is located in Xuan Thoi
Thuong village. along provincial road n. 9.
The farmers make use of the organic component of the solid waste to fertilize thir crops. afier
manual separation from the other materials (tin, plastic. industrial residual etc.): the average use of
organic matter is approximately 30 mnlha per crop. The addition of organic manure enhance the
fertlirv and productivity of the high-land, especiallv of grey soils characterized by a smndy-clav
superficial texture. low organic matter contem and low CEC (see Secton 3.3.3). The organic matter
impTove the physical structure of the soils. by enhancing the micro and macro porosity. water
retention capacity and soil aeration.

From a field survey, it emerged that cost of transportation to final destination is borne by the farmer
and is ranging between the ,000 to 10,000 VND/mt of total matter, according to the percentage of
organic matter and the local market. Separated inorganic material is then re-cycled and sold by the
farmers to special traders, at approximately 200 VND/Kg.
Environmental Impact: The solid waste disposal system currently carried out in the project high-
lands area, poses the following environmental problems:
hazard to human'health: no preliminary separation of toxic and noxious waste is
performed and handling of solid waste during separation of organic and inorganic
components is carried out by hand: this pose hazard to the health of the farmers
during the separation and field disposal operations;
contamination of groundwater: some contamination of the superficial (5-7 m) and
deeper (2040 m) aquifers were detected in the sample collected by the project in the
vicinity of the solid waste disposal and utilization areas for the following parameters:
BODS, nitrogen and pathogenic organism; no evident contamination from heavy
metals was observed in both aquifers;
inorganic residual: the separation of organic and inorganic material is not well
performed therefore large quantities of inorganic materials cumulate in the fields:
The present process of solid waste disposal in the high-lands still raises questions about the long term
sustainability of the natural resources. Although contamination from heavy metais was not detected.
risks for human health and potential soil and groundwater contaminatinn suggest that prompt action
ought to be taken to protect the human and phy.sical environtnent.
Future Planning and Policy: An environmental compatible solution to this issue is among the
priorities of the local authorities and firm commitment is undertaken to the solution of such issue:
however financial constraints affecting the HChl City budget, jeopardize the implementation of
protection measures.  Amnng the most important measures planned by the HCM City People
Committee are:
- the rehabilitation of the Dano compnst plan. 75.000 mt/year capacity, producing
25,000 mt of organic fertilizer: presently the plant is not working, but feasibility
studies and financing plans are completed for its rehabilitation, including the purchase
of a separator conveyor;
the identification of appropriate disposal areas where controlled land-filling waste
disposal may be carried out: some areas were preliminarily identified in the Nia Be
and Binh Chanh districts; plans to locate such land-filling area in the project area,
were rejected by the HCM City Agricultural Service:
the construction of an incinerator at Binh Hung Hna nf 300 mt/day (100.000
mt/year), is planned for the safe and secure disposal Of toxic and noxious wastes: the
plant should he implemented in 1995 at the latest.
The planning concerning the resolution of the solid waste disposal in HCMC is nnly at Master plan
level. Planning and implementation of enhancement measures in this sector are heavily affected by
budget constraints necessary to improve the system. However an Asian Development Bank (ADB)
te,chnical assistance pmject will he started in August. to review the HCM  City Master Plan
environmental aspects. among which solid waste disposal appears to be the most urgent priority. The
T.A. team will work in close collaboration with the HCM City Environmental Cnmmittee and is
expected to assess the present situation. recommend measures for protecting the environment in the
future, identify and recommend appropriate environmental management plan and related cost estimate
to the implementation of such measures.
EIA - Chapter 4                                                                    4 - 31



Preliminary Recommendations: From the above it may be concluded that (i! the disposal of organic
material in the fields part of the Project Area has beneficial effect to the crops. especially to the
vegetables cropped in the high-land area. (ii) the present solid waste disposal system in the high lands
presents some hazard to the human and physical environment: (iii) the environmental problem is much
less evident in the low-lands where water and soil constraints (acid sulphate soils! do not allow
vegetable cultivation: (iv) notwithstanding the city authorities' strong conmnitnent to solve the
problem with environmentally sustainable solution. budget constraints affect the prompt
implementation of such measures.
Some suggestion and recommendations to solve the problem in the project area. are hereby forwarded
for consideration of the concerned city authorities. It is believed that the disposal in the project area
may be greatly improved with the implementation of the following measures:
separated collecion of toxic and noxious wastes. which would not be disposed in the
project area:
purchase and installation at of a separaton conveyor, to separate the organic from the
inorganic natter prior to disposal to the farm;
identification of an area where land filling of inorganic material not re-cvclable may
* be carried out under strict control and appropriate protection measures:
Some preliminarv quantities of the solid waste to be safely disposed in the project area are estimated
on the basis of the following assumptions: (i) 30 mt/ha of organic mater per crop: (ii) 50% average
content of organic matter: (iii) some 4.000 ha vegetables cropped in the with the project conditions:
a total quantity of approximately 250.000 mt/vear may be safely disposed in the project high-lands.
if protection measures are further studied and implemented.
4.5.4        Beneficial Project Impact on the Environment
In so far as the project is affected by some off-site negative environmenl factors mainly caused by
the close vicinity to the 11CM City urban area, some long-term positive environmental effects are
t be expected to the city itself. In other words the vicinity of the project to the city creates off-side
environmental problems, but also would enhance the long term beneficial environmental effects that
may be expected.
The most important long tern environmental beneficial effect of the project seems to be a better water
quality. It is expected that. once the acidity from excavations and from reclamation procedures is
released. the surface and groundwater qualitv will improve in the area. The freshwater suppiv and
specific reclamation procedures. to be developed under the project will speed-up the water quality
improvement and enable a more sustainible encroachmenc of population and human settlement in the
area.
A better water qualitv will improve the living conditions of the popularion. who is now forced to
purchase freshwater for drinking and domestic purpose. The improvement of the water quality in the
area should produce other "unaccountable benefits". consisting in the other water beneficial uses such
as increase of the fishery stock. the gardening etc.
Additional environmental benefit is the inprovement of the vansportamion system. expected to be
caused by the project. The road transportation network will be enhanced through the costruction of
the road along the C canal and rehabilitation and upgrading of the service roads along the secondary
canal system. Transportation facilities will be provided also through the river system. where specific
protection measures are anticipated to off-set the negative impact created by the project sluices and
bridges to the local boat transportation svstem. An improved transporation network will be beneficial
to the population living in the area.
4- 32                                                                    EIA - Chapter 4



The enhancement of the environmental conditions of an agricultural area so close to the city, may
favour the integration and relationship city-countryside', by improving the socio-economic conditions
of the population living there, still quite depressed. By lowering the socio-economic gap between the
urban and rural population the project may reduce the migration of the rural population to the city.
Instead, better environment may attract the urban population to live in rural areas and may favour the
decentralization and spontaneous or planned 'satellite towns".
4.5S.        Conclusions and Recommendations
The off-side environmental aspects affecting the project, do not seem to critically affect the investment
in irrigation in the low-lands: In the high-lands of Hoc Mon and Binh Chanh, the main unsolved
environmental issue is the safe disposal of solid waste produced in HCM City.
The review of the HCM City environment planning, including solid waste and domestictindustrial
waste-water effluent disposal, will be shortly undertaken by the Environmental Comnmittee under ADB
assistance. It is therefore suggested that expansion into highlands be carried out after careful review
and firm planning of this critical environmental issue.

5.  ENVIRONMENTAL EFECTS AND PROTECTION MEASURES FOR
OTHER SIGNMICANT ISSUES
5.1   Pesticide Use in the Project Area
5.1.1  Pestide Consunption in the Region
'he introduction of intensive agriculture, based on HY-rice varieties and vegetables crops in the
HCM City and Long An Province, have caused an increase need for pest control. Pest control
measures in the Region include development of pest tolerant rice varieties, improvement in land use.
soil treatment etc. However, chemical control. i.g. the use of chenical pesticides, is most conunonly
practised.
Quoting the Mekong Delta project, some 5,615 tons of 77 different chemicals were used in the
Southern provinces of Vietnam in 1990, 37% of which in the Delta Region (source: Plant Protection
Department). This quantity included 4,848 tons of insecticides, 392 tons of fungicides. 372 tons of
herbicides, 4 tons of rodenticide and 5 tons of fumigants. However it seems that the pesticide use
is higher than the official.
The need for chemical pesticides have been increasing year by year. The available statistics of the
Annual Report of Plant Protection Department of HCM City report that:
*    fin Hoc Mon district, that some 68 mt of active ingredient have been used in 1993,
over an area of 14,000 ha, 37%  of which up-land crops, at an the average
consumption rate of 4.8 kg/ha of active ingredient;
*    in Binh Chanh district, some 126 mt of active ingredient were utilized over 25,500
ha, of which 21 % up-land crops, at an average quantity of active ingredient of 4.9
Kg/ha;
Agrochemical use on different crops is not available; however farmers apply pesticides (especially
insecticides) at higher rates to vegetables and upland crops than to paddy.
At present, the main pesticides used belong to the chemical groups of organo-phosphates (parathion
methyl, basudin, DDVP. dimecron, methamidophos, azodrin), carbamates (bassa, furadan, padan.
saturn) and phenoxyacetic acids (2,4-D). Recently, some less toxic (to mammals) chemical
pesticides, e.g. synthetic pyrethroids (decis, cypermethrin) fuji-one, ethofenprox (trebon), buprofezin
(applaud) etc. have been introduced into the southern Vietnam. However. some of these compounds,
particularly pyrethroids, are very toxic to aquatic animals.
Most of the used pesticides are officially permitted by the Goverment as per decision N.208 of July
16, 1991 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry.

Considering the high toxicity and persistence of applied pesticides, the Ministry of Agricuture and
Food Industry has issued a Decision to ban 20 most hazardous pesticides and to restrict the use of
14 pesticides (Tables 511 and 5/2). No use of banned pesticide is detected in the project area.
However some pesticides which use is restricted are commuercialized and used by the farmers.
The long-term environmental impacts of chemical pesticides, their toxicity and ecotoxicity, have been
studied by several overseas scieneists, and reently, by the Environmental Protection Centre. The
toxicity classification of WHO is taken as a references for assessment of possible impacts of pesticides
in Vietnam.
5.1.2 Pesticide use in the Project Area
In Vietnam, the application of pesticides complies with the guidelines of tc Department for Plant
Protection (Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry) and the Vietnam Pesticide Company
(VIPESCO. Ministry of HeaMv Industry). In the project area, field survey shows that farmers do not
strictly follow the guidelines, pesticides management is very low and no or very few extension activity
is carried out to improve pesticide application.
During the field survey the following use of agrochemical for paddy was detected:
in the wet season: 5 dosesJha equivalent to 3.5 Kg/ha of commercial product;
in the winterlspring: 6.5 doses/ha, equivalent to 4 Kg/ha of conmercial product;
in the summer/autimn: 6.5 doses/ha, equivalent to approximately 4 Kg/ha of commercial
product;
A higher use of agrochemical is detected for up-land crops, as follows:
in the winter/spring groundnuts: 13 doses/ha, equivalent to approximately 8 Kg/ha of
conmercial product;
in summer/autumn groundnuts: 7 doses/ha, equivalent to approximately 4 Kg/ha of
commercial product;
in winter/spring vegetables: 37 doses/ha, equivalent to approximately 22 Kglha of
commercial product;
in summerfautumn vegetables: 35 doses/ha, equivalent to approximately 22 Kg/ha of
commercial product;
The use of different commercial and active ingredient was not recorded by the survey; however it
has been assessed that the knowledge of the farmers on pest control is poor; in many cases the
average spraying dose is less than recomnended, but during pest attack, much higher doses are
applied.                                                                           I
The most utilized agrochemical by farmers are the following insecticides: Methylparatbion, Azodrin.
Basudin. Furodan, Sherpa, Bassa, Monitor and Mipcin. Detected quantities and estimated use (in
percentage) of pesticides and agrochemical for each crop, is shown in Table 5/3.

5.1.3  Integrated Pest Management (PM
The fast development of agriculture to be caused by the project and increase of upland crops
(vegetables). tbe appropriate pest control becomes critical tO ensure that the anticipated benefits are
reached by the farmers.
In the countrv, an Intesed Pest Management (IPM) program was launched bv FAO and Ministry
of Agriculmre in 1989. Since 1991. extensive field demonstrations and intensive training courses on
rice 1PM and IPM seminars. farmers participatory research and workshops were organized joindv bv
FAO. IRRI and PPPD and have resulted in significant changes in extension techniques and
farmers'perceprion towards rice pest comtrol and namral enemies.
5 - 4                                                                           EIA - Chapter 5



Under the FAO Regional Program in IPM (FAO, Inter country Program for Integrated Pest Control
in rice in South East Asia), some 7 Training of Trainers (TOT) were carried out in 1992-1993. In
the TOT some 30-35 farmers trainers are trained in growing a healthy crop, preserve the natural
enemies, observe the field and become expert in IPM. Some Farmers Field Schools (FFS) were
organized to transfer the technology to the farmers level. In each FFS, 30 farmers are trained in
IPM. one morning a week for the whole duration of the rice cycle. The program proved successful
and some 148 FFS were organized in 1993, under FAO and local govemment funding. In the year
1993-1994. some 10,000 technicians and farmers are planned to be trained in IPM.
Policy in IPM would include the timely plar Tng, selection of tolerant rice varieties. good crop
management, (fiertilizer, water), application limits for pesticides against thrips. leaffolder and
stemborer, pesticide rates for BPH with application of two only type of insecticides (carbamates,
huprofenzin). In IPM, the farmers are taught to exclude the 20 banned pesticides and gradually
reduce the use of the 14 restricted ones. Additional facilities provided by the FAO sponsored project
are 2 centem for pesticide quality and residual control, one of which located at the national Plant
Production and Protection Department in HCMC.
The continuation of the IPM project will be supported for three more years by the Agricultural
Rehabilitation Project (ARP), IBRD sponsored. The support will be extended to 30 provinces.
including HCM City and Long An.
5.1.4 Protection Measures in the Project Area
The HCMC Plant Protection Department (HCMC Agricultural Service) has participated to the 1PM
project, by sending 2 staff of the Departnent and 2 staff of other organizations to the TOT in 1993.
Some 4 FFS were then organized following the recmmendation of the FAO project. In 1994, some
5 additional staff are likely to participate to the FAOITOT and 20 FFS likely to be organized in the
Province.
The HCMC Plant Protection department (HCMC Agricultural Services) intents to launch FFS in the
project area. The Department has 5 and 6 pernanent staff in the Hoc Mon and Binh Chanh
respectively, not yet trained in IMP. Training of the staff may take place in the first half of the year
and from mid-1994 FFS program on paddy may be launched in the two districts.
The Department recognizes the need to develop IPM pest control especially on vegetables in the Hoc-
Mon and Binh Chanh districts. where some 7.500 ha are estimated to be annually cropped. without
any particular pest management control. Except from some budget to he temporarily made available
by FAO in 1994. the support for IPM is likely to be made available from the resources of the
Agricultural Rehabilitation Program (ARP).
However since the planning of IMP in the project area is not yet firm, some budget is set aside from
the project sources, to support the IMP component as part of the overall environmental management
plan. It is estimated that an FFS on rice cultivation have a cost of 500 USD. assuming (i) the
participation of 30 farmers one a week, for 14 weeks; (ii) some 200 UDS for input purchase: on
vegetables.
A total of 60 FFF on paddy. vegetables and up-land crops (fruit trees and sugarcane) will'be
organized in the period 1995-1997; in addition farmers trained in the FFS will be asked to organize
demonstration plots to show to their neighbours 1PM technology by mean.s of piot visit and discussion.
A total of 200 demonstration plots at cost of 50 USD each are forecasted by the Plant Protection
Department, to cover the entire project area. The total cost of the program. including cost of the
extension to he carried out by the farmers, is shown in Table 5/4 and amounts tn 43.000 USD
(excluding 10% contingencies)

fertilizer use in paddy and other crops is well recognized by the farmers who apply it o almost all
crops. Beside chemical fertilaer. farmers apply animal manure and other organic fertilizers (solid
waste). The main chemical fertilizers used in the region are urea contining 46 % N. super phosphate
(17% P:O). DAP ( 18% N. 46% P20., NPK and Sulphate Ammonium (18% N): KCI is seldom
utilized. but the use of ash from paddy askes is rather widespread.
The fertilizer rates applied by farmers are shown herebelow. per each individual crop:
Paddy: the average nitrogen gift is 70-100 N/ha. but many farmers apply as much as 200 kg
N/ha or even over. In HY rice fields the minimum rates applied are 40-50 kg N/ha in the wet
season and SIA seasons. The average rare of phosphate fertilizer is quite high: in the
seasonal rice. 40 kg P205ha are utilized at the avere in the W/S paddy some 80 Kg P2%
/ha. Phosphate fertizer is most required in acid sulphate soils for HY paddy rice production.
Groundnuts: the average nitrogen rare is around 50 N ke/ba: average raTe of phosphate
fertilizer is quite high since 80 kg P:OJha are utilized at the average. in the W/S and S/A
groundnums: phosphate fertilizer is most required also for groundnuts:
Vegetables: the average nitrogen rate is around 200 N kg/ha. both during the WIS and S/A
crops. provided mainlv by urea: average rate of phosphate fertilizer is 50 kg PO./ha. in the
W/S and S/A vegetables: some K.O rate of approximately 30 Kg/ha is also given tm
vegetbles: large quantities of organic fertilizer are provided bv the farmers.

Suprcane: the average nitrogen rate is around 100-180 N kg/ha; average rate of phosphate
fertilizer is 30-50 kg P20ha; K0 rate of approximately 30-50 Kg/ha is also given to
sugarcane;
it may be concluded that fertilizer is largely utilized by the farmers, who clearly understand the
importance of this production fhator in the achievement of the best development potential. With
provision of irrigation the fertili±r use is likely to increase to fully develop the benefit provided by
irrigation.
5S22 Potenthl Impact of Fertilizer
Nitrogen and phosphorus are the two most important plant nutrients. Both, but especially Nitrogen,
can be transported through run off from the fertilized fields to neighbouring ponds, canals and rivers
and may increase the rate of groundwater nutrient, by percolation.
The enrichment of water bodies by nutrients, especially phosphorus and nitrogen. caues
eutrophication of ponds and canals giving rise to prolific aquatic plant growth including algal blooms.
Consequendy, drssolved oxygen content of the water depletes as plant material decays, which has a
negative impact on aquatic fauna. Most white fish species cannot survive in water containing less
than 30% of oxygen satLration or 2.5 mg 0211 at 250C. FAO standards for DO in cyprinid (carps)
water is more than 5 mg/I, in salmonid waters it is more than 9mg/l. Eutrophication of waters has
the following environmental impacs:
Loss of species diversity, changes of biota;
Plant biomass increases through massive weed growth;
Turbidity increases, drastic decrase of water quality;
Rate of sedimentation incrases.
Eutrophication may occur in stagnant water bodies such as lakes, ponds and reservoirs, and in low-
flow canals where concenations of phosphorus and total nitrogen are usually over 0.15 and 0.1 mg/i,
respectively. WHO's standards for maximum permissible nitate concentration (as N) in drinking
water is 10 mg/I. Phosphates are not health related chemicals. The standards of several countries give
permissible total phosphate concentrations in surface water intended for human consumption of OA -
5.0 mg F2.
Inside the project area, in superficial water bodies, the conbent of NO, - N is rather low as shown by
the complementary water quality survey (April 1994). The NO, - N concentration ranges 0.014 2
mg/I. total N 1-1.2 mgfl (except Cho Dem River); phosphoms concentration (PO. - P) is very low
in all stations in the project area; no eutrophication is expected in the fluent bodies of the project area
which content of dissolved oxygen (DO) is high, ranging 5.8-6.8 (5.2 in the Cho Dem river); only
in water logging areas, some eutrophication may take place.
Some contamination of superficial groundwater aquifer (5-7 meters) is evidenced in the grounwater
quality analysis: in all three wells in highly intensive vegetable cropped area, values of NO; - N
ranging 2-6-2.8 mg/I is detected. Occasionally in particularly highly intensive cultivated ars in the
high-lands (vegetables areas in Hoc Mon) the contamination may reach the groundwater aquifer at
20-40 m, where NO, values between 3 and 4 mg/I have been observed. All in all however the nutrient
concentration in the surface and groundwater is rather low and do not raise particular environmental
impact.

5.23  ReUommen ed Us and Environm Intal Haard
The recommended raes of fertilizer in the "with the project conditions are shovm herebelow. for
the most imporcans crops. No sigificant negative impact is to be expected from the application of
sucb raes. on the ground that most of the fertilizer will be mainly udlized by the crops. However.
mmtrienus concenration. especially in groundwater in the highly intensive agriculmral areas, will have
to be kept under strict monitoring control. Should any adverse impact be detected which may affect
the human or physicl envioment, some mitigation measures may have to be timely implemented.

53    Water B         Diseases
53.1  Present Situation
A common hazard typical of water resurces in trpical countries involve the favourable habiat for
misect transming deases as malaria and schiswosonuasis by mipounded waterslreservoirs. The issue
is of some importance in the Hoc Mon - Binh Chank area, since malaria is endemic in the area
Malaria is a    m cabl fbrile disease cused by infection with parasites of classes Sporooa,
gew Plasmodiwn. The two mn species ar the Plasmodim v     and P. faprwn.. These
pasites are transmitted only through the bite of malaria infected females mosquitoes which breeds
in slow moving water.
Health statistics were gathered from the Hoc Mon and Binh Chanh District Preventive Medicine
Cemer. Parasi-ologic sttistic survey is constantly under-way by the Medicine Prevenive Center at
village level. Only villages located in the project low lands are affected by mosquito-borne diseases.
Data collected at district level in Hoc Mon show that the incidence of malaria is much less
significauive than the other diseases. since morbidity caused by other water-born diseases and food
contamination has moch higher incidence.

On the other hand, in Binh Chanh malaria is the most important cause of morbidity, Schistosomiasis
only does not affect the study area.
Other water-born diseases are caused by the poor sanitation practices of the population and the lack
of safe and secure drinking water supply. There is apparently some contaminatioh of surface water
from human faecal wastes and solid waste disposal. This contamination is enhanced during the flood
period when contaminated waters enter in the superficial groundwater layers (7-10 m). Some
contamination of the first groundwater layer (2040m deep) occasionally occurs.
A Rural Water Supply Program funded by UNICEF was launched in 1987, in HCM City. This
program is intended to provide good and safe drinking water to the rural populations in the area.
Each well, serving approxihately 10 families, is constituted by a borehole equipped with hand pump.
In the project area the wells constructed since 1989 and people served and percentage of overall
population is given in Table 516. No further program is anticipated for 1994, inside the project area.
Material for the wells is provided through UNICEF support, labour by the farmers themselves.
Water quality of the tubeweils is regularly monitored twice a year for cfetmicat and physical
pnmeters. The monitoring shows that most of the wells are utilized directly for drinking purposes;
some 30% of thewells having the iron conet higher than WHO standards (0.3 mg/1), located in acid
sulphate soils do require iron removal facilities; some 11% of the wells are availing water from salted
intruded aquifer, 15% have N and organic contamination and 11% biological contamination, due to
unperfect drilling operation. Inside the project area. wells located in Pham Van Hai, Le Min Xuan,
Tan Tao low lands are salted intruded; some iron higher than the standards is present in almost all
wells located in Hoc Mon and Binh Chan-with peak in the ones located in the low lands; organic
contamination occasionally occurs in the first aquifer.

the project consist in the provision of improved pits and toilet facilities. Farmers, requested to pay
for the material. are trained by the project staff in the comstmction technique. The program is less
successful due to the mentality and traditional costumes of the farmers and the relatively high cost of
material.

5.32 Public Health Monitorng Plan:
No major aleraton of the hydrologic regime will be brought about by thc proeec theefor no major
out-break of malaria is expected as direct impact of the project However it is recommended that the
incidence of malaria should be kept under contmrol. especially in the Binh Chau. area
Any measure will be taken by the Provincial Preventive Medicine Centers; specific measures for
malaria control to be implemented in the area are:
prevention of water logging outside the house: nems during the sleeping time:
vector control measur  as residual srayin of the houses and sheds:
constuion of a specific malaria control and monitoring cenoer:
surveillance mechanism in endemic areas, ftrough entomological survey of malaria vector
breeding grounds.
It has to be noted tha the Project does not have to take over the responsibilfty of other government
agencies. but should only assist them in th monoing exercise on the ground that a favourable and
healthy enviroImet is among its objectives. No cost is attribuable to the projt, ecept for the cost
of- public monitoring, included in the En  l Monitorng program dui  construction and
operation (see Secton 6.4.2).
5.4   Aquatic Eosystem Managemet
5.4.1 Potential mpact of the Project on Aquatic Ecology and Fisheries
In the with the project cdtions, the existng meting point of flows will be moved due to the
change of the hydrologic regime caused by the construction of the automatic gates. As described in
Section 4.3.3, the disposal of acid effluens produced by soil reclmation and canal constnucion will
temporarily expand the acid zone inside the project area, to the C canal area. In tbe downstrcam
area, icreased acidity is expected in all downstream waterways, especially in Ngang, Cho Dem and
Ben LUC river.
No major impact is expectd on the freshrater and acid ecological zone identified upstream and
inside the project area. The reshwaer zone will expand from the Saigon river imo the Rach Tra
canal towards the project area. Inside the project area water flow from Saigon will coribuce co
dilute the increased acidity generated by the projcL In the long run, the first zone will expand inside
the project area, which acidity, Al and SO, will decrease steadily. Some more species of hydrobiont
adapted to freshwater environment will dwelop as Mysus and Tilapia
The changes and boumdaries of the aquatic coystems of the third and forth zone will depend on the
moving out of the Lang Le and Tan Buunmeeting points of flows. However the boundaries of the
transition zone are likely to expand inside the Ngang canals and to a less extent. to the Cho Dem and
Ben Luc river. The economic IMpact of modifications caused bv the project in the aquatic
environment of the area will be limited, since in the present-situaion favourable conditions for
fisheries are prevented by seasonal changes. unstble conditions and pollution. Nevertheless there
will be a re-distrbution of hydrobiont. with temporarily ncrease of acid-resistent fishes and drop of
fishinrg migran  from the sea and adapted to brackish conditions. The influence of water qualiy
changes caused by the project on arificial fishing activity carried out by farmers in fish ponds si

5.4.2  lmpact on Navigation
Pomjec waterways are utilized for tavigraion by the inhabitants of dhe area. Tle EIA has verifged that
no major navigation routing is affected by the project sluices to be constructed along the canal system.
Major routing from and to the Mekong delta is the Cho-em and Den Luc canal, through whicli
agricultural product are transported to the Saigon harbor.
The canal system inside the project area is utilized by the local teideni.s In transport building

5.5   Saigon River Watershed Management
5.5.1  RatInale
The appropriate preservation and management of the upper watershed is considered by the EIA in
relafion to the possible involvement of fte Bank into Dau Tieng reservoir Operation and Management.
Besides, the Dau rTeng reservoir provides freshwater to the Hoc Mon North Binh Chanh project.
The conditions of the Dau Tieng reservoir afects (i) ct optimal exploitation of the available water
resources. and (ii) the smooth operation of the reservoir to irrigate the downstream command area.
Any program toenbance the condition of the watershed it would provide additional job opportunities
to the population of the area and enhance their living conditions.
In the case of the Dau Tieng, the presevation of the remaining forest resources and the reforestation
of opened areas may prevent from any furtber degradation and the physical conditions of the
watershed improved, to provide a better enviomen for the dwellers and for the irrigation projects
in the downstream area. Sedimentation and siltation of the reservoir will be prevented.
5.S.2  Insutional Aspects
The need for improving the land use and forest coverage of the Dau Tieng reservoir was recognized
by the government which has launched a watsbed protecion project in 1989, in the frame of the
National Forest Protection and ManageMent, under the Ministry of Forests. The watershed
management progran will aim at i) preseving ard possibly improving the forest cover of the area
in the 43,000 ha of existing forest and ii) improving erosion control with appropriate anti-erosion
mesures in the 73.b00 ha of "non forested area", wbere erosion prone areas are identified. lbe 10
years project target is to reach the 70% forest coverage in the watershed (forest and plantations). with
the active participation and contbution of the local population.
Tbe Ministry of Forestry in Hanoi is responsible of the overall management and coordination of the
Dau Tieng watershed rehabilitation. At local level the project is managed by the Provincial
Directorate of Forest Protection:
Tay Ninh Province; the Directorate of the Protction Forests is constituted by 80 people.
mainly Forestry Rangers, entrusted with the protection of 40,0W ha of existing forest
resources; in the project area (Dau Tieng watershed), 15 rangers are entrusted with the
pratction of the 14,300 ba existng forest, supported by a 6 forest engineers. specifically
appointed in the frame of the watersbed rehabilitation project:
Song Be: the Directorate of the Protction Fores  comprises 300 staff, mainly Forest
Rangers. eusted with the protection and exploitation of 200.000 ha-of existing forest
resources. in the project area (Dau Tieng watershed), some 70 rangers are engaged to protect
28.000 ha of existing forest; 30 additional staff engaged in the watershed rehabilitation
project

The project cost approved by the central government, was 22 billion VND (5 million USD in 1989),
equivalent to approximately 40-50 USD/ha. Based on the total budget of the project, the two
provinces present and annual workplan and budget to the central Ministry and the State Planning
Committee. for approval: the actions of the two provinces are coordinated under the Ministry.
5.53 Forest Managenent
Presence of forest and associated ground cover trends to hold back water run-off. This not only serves
to reduce floods and erosion but also to increase infiltration into groundwater, thus stabilize flows in
the surface stream by furnishing a steady inputs from the groundwater during the dry season.
Therefore the forests serves to increase the proportion of the total rainfall available for use when
*                  needed: the forest act as storage. Forest coverage is essential in maintaining the integrity and
potentialities of the watershed system. Besides, forests fumish benefits to local communities, refugee
to the wildlife and enhance the aesthetics of the environment.
On one side there is the need to protect valuable forest environment against posaible ecologic damage,
which may occur with slash and burn agriculture, logging activity and encroachment of population
as consequence of population growth. On the other side reforestation action may he undertaken to
restore the coverage highly affected by the anthopic action.
Existing Program: The watershed management program anticipates two main components: (i) forest
protection, (ii) reforestation and tree plantation. The refostation. while preserving the natural
Tesources of the area, will proide livelihood and enhance the earnig capacity of the rural population
living in the area.
(i)    protection forest: all the existing forest in the Dau Tieng reservoir is protection forest: each
forestry ranger is responsible of 5W-800 ha, which are sd-divided in protection units of 50-
100 ha; each unit is entrusted to one or few households living in the area; the household
receive 30-70.000 VND/ha for protection action only and has the right of benefitting of minor
forest products (fuelwood, material for housing etc.);
(ii)   reforestation is carried out in both provinces through farmers participation in cleaning,
planting, weeding; Forest Rangers and engineers supervise the planting operations and
provide technical assistance; the project budget includes 100 USD/ha during planting year and
30 USD spread in the following two years for weeding; almost the entirely financial
resources are utilized to ensure farmers'labour and participation (130 USD/ha); so far only
2,000 ha has been reforested since 1991. in both provinces.
From the preliminary data gathered in the frame of the Hoc Mon project. it is estimated that the
implementation and effectiveness of the project is somehow slowered down by the limited financial
resources made available to the provinces. The program seems very ambitious in consideration of the
available human and financial resources. Some support to re-orient and strengthen the program is
needed, if project targets are to be met in a reasonable tine-span.
Preliminary Proposal The present EIA proposes to explore the possibility of external support to the
government forestry program by strengthening its components:
a. Forest Protection: Protection measures may be considered in the forestry program as follows:
(i)   to support the forstry staff is enforcing the application of laws, policies. programs, rules and
regulations in the domain of forestry and wildlife, in co-ordination with local govemnent
offices;
ETA - Chapter 5                                                                  5 - 13



(ii)   to implement an effective people assisted Forest Fire Protection, based on the establishment
of community fire brigades, ready available for protection action;
(iii)  to carry out a watershed awareness and motivation campaign among the population of the
watershed. for foresL protection and reforestation purposaes;
The forest protection program is extended over the whole Dau Tieng reservoir. Some 50 Fnrest
Guards, including supervisors, plant propagators and extentionists, will be employed by the project,
at an average ratio of 1,000 ha per guard. Two forest stations (one per province) and three or four
additional check points in critical locations, will provide logistic facilities fnr the program in
plantation.
b. Rcforcstation Zn fCm Planti The reforestation action may be finalised to the re-establishment
of part of the original coverage in the 70,000 ha erosion prone areas: according to the watershed
planning, hard wood original species may be selected such as Dipterocarpus sp.:
in alternative woodlots in the proximity of the villages may be established for production purposes:
light wood fast growing species are to be here preferred as Acacia aurficolfobrnim. Acacda manglum.
Eucalypuw camaldadenss, Leucana leucochephala etc.
Set up of efficient and wide-spread forestry nursery program, managed by the Provincial Department
for the production.of seedlings for both agroforestry and forestry purposes, among thc 23 villages of
the watershed;
r   Ag[iculbral and Agrofonrvz  The EIA proposes the gradual replacement of the shifting
agriculture with an improved fairming system based on the following measures:
(i)    The adoption of improved farming methods as plant protection, use of fertilizers, improved
seedlings; to disseminate the knowledge of such practices and follow-up farmers, it may he
proposed to strengthen the extension staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, with employment
of additional extension officers and establishment of nurseries and warehouses at village level:
(ii)    Agroforestry and soil conservation measures, to be especially adopted in the erosion sensitive
areas, in the shifting agriculture areas, by planting fast growing species in agricultural areas
(Eucalyprus, Leucana leucochephala); typical soil conservation measures are (i) "hench
terracing", quite expensive and applicable only for high value crops, (ii) 'strip system
planting", where each strip of farming land is bounded with trees etc.
(iii)  Introduction of cash crops, to integrate the staple food production: this mainly concern the
development of coffee, rubber plantations, black pepper and fruit trees: the establishment of
nurseries under the Ministry of Agriculture, to provide seedlings to the farmers may he
considered:
(iv)   Institutional strengthening with creation of Farmers Associations or Rural communities (n
favour cooperative system. post-harvest crop processing and marketing.
The expected result of the mitigation measures is (i) an improved agricultural system in the typical
flat agricultural areas and in the non-forest area, (ii) the control of erosion in the watershed, and the
subsequent reduction of the siltation of the reservoir and (iii) the preservation and cnnservation of the
existing forest resources and forest coverage of erosion sensitive areas.
5.5.4  Watershed Management Review
It is recommended that, before any investment be considered, the government and any agency
interested to finance, review the initial results and re-orient (if necessary) the Dau Tieng project
components, by:
5 - 14                                                                ETA - Chapter 5



(i)    undertaking a comprehensive inventory of the natural resources of the area, formulating a
short, medium and long termn development program for the protection, replacement and
production of the forested area in the watershed;
(ii)   carrying out a detail study and review of the land use trends in the 73,000 ha of non forest
land where most of the top soil erosion is occurring and of the 88.000 ha agricultural land:
the study would consider the establishment of an improved management and monitoring
control system (G1S, rerdote sensing), to be proposed for the initial bench-mark survey and
for a permanent systematic monitoring;
(iii)  identify existing land use patterns. causes and Impacts of soil erosion in those areas mostly
severely affected and develop an overall strategy for Roil prntection and conservation; develop
a policy for soil conservation and appoint expertise to guide soil pr6tction efforts: ensure that
agricultural and forestry land use pattern take into account the potential effrets on snil
erosion;
(iv)   identify the need and planning of training programs for households in general aspects of the
environment and natural resource manag;ent identify the need of awareness campaign:
review the farmers participation and the rural community involvement in the project and
assess the need for a credit program or financial support for farmers and honseholdis to meet
new soil conservation and management standards:
(v)   re-orient the project scope, if necessary, by considering the recent past experience, the
financial resources available and the conclusion of the above described steady activity.
This mid-term study and evaluation review might better re-orient the human and Financial resources.
to be made available by the government and by the international agency.
* 5.6    Other Aspects Related to Construdion Activity
Un-espected damages may occur to the physical environment and to private ownership, during
construction period. Re-vegetation of temporary roads, temporary borrnw areas and disposal areas
are among the possible un-expected protection measures which will have to he implemented to off-.set
environmental damages.
The environmental monitoring during construction will detect such damages. investigate causes and
consequences. estabilish the compensation entity. The monitoring office will report to the Executive
Board for decision on compensation to he paid to farmers andlor mitigation measures for the physical
environment. A budget of 30.000 USD (excluding contingencies) is set-aside to carry out appropriate
mitigation measures.
The corrosion of acid water environment to civil and mechanic structures has been considered in the
planning and design of civil works. Local experience show that the Class I cement are normally
utilized for civil works in acid sulphate soils irrigation systems, therefore this cernent has,been
considered in the cost estimate. However it has been suggested to execute on-the-side tests to verify
the acid sulphate resistance of Class I cement, as compared to Class V cement (acid sulphate
resistant). It is believed that high standard of constuction and good quality control during construction
supervision should guarantee sufficient resistance to the temporary acidic conditions caused by the soil
reclamatinn procedure. In the tender and contract docu.ments, both construction material options have
been incorporated and a final decision on the most appropriate cement should be taken after resuts
of the on-side tests.
EIA - Chapter 5                                                                 5-15



5.7   Public Consultatlon
In addition to the property assessment and survey relevant to resettlement and land aquisition, the
awareness and perceptions of the beneficaries on the Project scope and objectives was investigated
in the frame of the socio-economic survey. The 6urvey was carried out from December 1993 to
January 1994 by a team of four specialists, who interviewed approximately 300 (armers on family
and labour force composition, education, farm size and ownership, land use, crop develnpment and
family income. The survey wasterformed an a sample of farmers selected randomly in each of the
eight agricultural sub-areas.
In the last section of the questionnaire. the farmers were asked Lheir opinion on the project scnpe and
targets. The survey shows that the large majority of Ihe people interviewed are favnurable to the
Project scope and targets and willing to participate in the construction and operation activities.
According to the survey, some 85% of the farmerns are ready to accept to pay for the incremental
O&M and to partecipate to the operation of the system, provided irrigation water is timely and
sufficiently delivered. Some 90% are willing to partecipate to water user associations and farers
groups. Fanners may participate to the constuction advities by providing un-skilled labour for the
development of tertiary and on-fann development (quaternary canals and on-fatm ditches). During
operation sekcted ftrmers will be involved in the system operation and maintenance by the Irrigation
Management Company and all farmers will partecipate in the system mantenance and pay for O&M
cost recovery.
5 - 16                                                              ETA - Chapter 5



6            ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
6.1          Scope
An overall management plan is proposed to ensure that all protection m^asures planned at the stage
of feasibility and detail design will effectively be implemented during construction and operation.
Scope of the management plan ia: (a) planning of all environmental programs. (b) definition of the
coordination and management of such programs. (c) definition of the institutional set-up and
£                   involvement of concerned governmental agencies and (d) monitoring, contml and follow-up actions.
The Environmental Management Plan connsists of two main components: i) institutional strengthening
and ii) monitoring and evaluation. Both components have been defined cnnsidering the project
institutional framework for construction and operation. Agencies role and responsibility and detailed
work program of environmental actions will be proposed in the Chapter.
Some guidelines and task description of the two components of the overall Environmental
Management Plan, will be given in the following Sections.
6.2          Institutional Strengthening
6.2.1        Hoc Mon North Blnh Chanh Project
The organizational set-up of the project includes tht establishment of a central project policy and
coordination body. reponsible to coordinate and unify all project components, including construction
activities, environmental proection, agricultural and soil development and resettleiment and land
acquisition: according to the various phases of the project. different agencies will be part of this
institution.
The Mantement Council will he the policy making body, responsible to coordinate and harmonize
the interest and aspiration of all involved parties. During construction, the Council will be chaired
by the central government (Ministry of Water Resources), and be partecipated by the provinces
agricultural services the Construction Management Board, the representatives of the districts and of
the IMCs: representative of farmers. Some 14 members are expected to he part nf the Council.
During operation the Council will be narrnwed down to the provinces. the local authorities and
farmers beneficiaries.
An Executive Board will also be created and serve as executing body of the Council. This committee
is meant to be the "core' of the overall environmental planning and management. The Committee
will he lead by a Senior Executive Officer during system construction.
The duties and responsibilities of the Council and the Executive.Board during R) construction and b)
operation are summarized herebelow:
a.   During Consiruction the Council would have to coordinate thle following project
components:
(i)   project construction, including works and procurement ;ontracts management and
follow-up, work supervision, project financing:
ETA - Chapter 6                                                                6- 1



(iii)  environment.-including the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan
and Environmental Monitoring during construction.
(iv)   agricultural development: start up of the agricultural development component
including soil reclamation, extension and research in acid sulphate soils, assistance
for credit, on-farm water management.
It is envisaged that the Management Council consists of (i) Ministry of Watcr Resources. (ii)
the Construction Management Board 302, (iii) the Provincial Agricultural Services. (iv) the
representatives of the districts of tac Mon. Binh Chanh and Duc Hoa. (v) representtives of
farmers beneficiaries.

representative of the Irrigation Management Companies (ICMs), Ciii) the representatives of
the districts of Hoc Mon. Binh Chanh and Duc Hoa. (iv) the representatives of farmers
beneficiaries.
6.2.2        Environmuental Protection
All project environmental activities will be under the genal supervision of the HCM City and Long
An Environmental Protection Committee. the provincial body responsible for environmental
planning and protection. In HCM City, the Committee is the local representative of the Ministry of
Science. Technology and Environment and is also strictly linked to the HCM City Peo.ple's
Committee, since its chairman is the vice-chairman of the People's Committee and most of the lncal
agencies are represented into its Board (Technology Institute. Public Transportation, Agricultural
Services. Health Departnent, Architects etc.). The Committee is locally represented by sub-
committes. at district level.
The Council and itS Executing Board will be responsible for the implementation and management of
all environmental activities, including monitoring.
The Scope of Work and responsibility in environment protection shall include:
a.   the planning and management of all the environmental protection and enhancement measures.
and specific tnvironmental activities includes in the Environmental Management Plan:
h.   the definition of environmental standards: integration of project environmental activities in
the overall policy and regulations of the provicial administration; ensure that admissible
standards are enforced in the project area;
c.    monitoring and evaluation of short-medium and long term effects of the pmject over the
human and physical environment: propose remedial action if necessary, to guarantee the long
term development in the area under its jurisdiction;
d.    management of all funds related to the Environmental activity of the project;
6 - 2                                                               EIA - Chapter 6



An Environmental Impact Awessment OMce shall be set-up under the Executive Board to carry
out the environmental monitoring during construction and operation. All aspect of the environmental
Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan will he monitored hy the office, including
some issues not directly associated tn the project scope, such as public health. watershed management.
off-site environmental factors (solid waste, pollution control etc.). At this regards it has to mentioned
that the Project should not take over the responsibility of other government agencies. but only monitor
a                  the human and physical environment in the area. in recognition that an integrated and coordinated
effort among different agencies W4ould benefit the physical and human environment of the area.
6.3           Environmental Monitoring
6.3.1         Monitoring during Construction
A synthetic description of the most important work tasks of the monitoring during construction, is.
given hereinbelow:
a.    Monitoring of the civil works: a constant control will be carried out over the performances
of the ccmtractor, to guarantee his fulfillment to the contras clauses on environmental
protection measures. This monitoring should be looked at as an essential support to the
supervision of civil worls. focussed on environmental protecion.
b.    Monitoring on disposal areas: it consists in the follow-up of the compensation procedure and
meures for restoring the productivity in the disposal areas: the performances of the sail
impmvement and reclamation will be checked by means of regular visits (say every 6 months)
to all the affected families: this to make sure that after the compensatinn period be expired.
the fertility of the dispomal areas is at least similar to the previous cnnditions;
c.    Monitoring of the downstream aquatic ecology. The monitoring will determine any change
to the aquatic environment and possible negative impact on the farmerlfisheries income. It
shall also identify appmpriate remedial actions including the involvement of affected families
in the fishery program.
The environmental monitoring will: make sure that programs are implemented as planned, verify
the effectiveness of such programs by means of field inspectinns. ensure that plans are suitable to the
attainment of the prefixed targets. suggest modifications at the decision making level. should the
programs require any adjustment.

The cost of the Environmental Monitoring during construction is estimated 152.500 USD (excluding
contingencies) for the 5 years of construction. The cost indudes the recruitment of two monitoring
experts to be fully employed on the project area, one supervisor to be employed at 25% of the time
and mobilisation and logistics expenses.
6.3.2       . Monitoring During Operation
Monitoring during operation con'cerns all the significant environmental issues related to the rpmject
operation and discusses in Chapter 4 and 5. An important aspect of the Environmental Monitoring
Program is the requirement for an annual critical review of the program  to check its cost
effectiveness. The environmental monitoring officers should become the government and
Management Council interface with the local population. for all questions related to envimnment and
environmental impact of the projecL
Besides the completion of the tasks described in the previous paragraph. the environmental monitoring
component will comprise a series of additional work tasks related to the operation phase of the
irrigation scheme operation. The main task list is giwen hereinbelow:
a.    Fishery Management : the monitoring should check the effectiveness of the program and
ensure that adequate financing resources are timely allocated to finance such activity,
programs and workplans are adequate to reach the set up objectives, strategies and programs
are modified according to the new requirements.
h.    Water Management: the monitoring shall deect other water requirements which may arise.
in addition to the primary purpose of irrigation. A suggestion is made in this report that the
ICM. be responsible for the optimal use of water stored and distributed.
c.    Physical Environment In the Project Area : this task will start as soon as the project will
affect the surrounding environment, at the time of construction works and will continue up
to the stabilization of the enviromnental conditions. The modification to the aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystem shall be carefully keptunder control. Regular biological sampling survey
will be carried out (say twice a year). The informations on phytoplankton and zooplankton
communities will provide valuable indications on the existing habitat for fisheris in the
project area
d.    Water Quality Control: systematic water quality control will he carried out to determine
the effects of construction works and reclanation procedures on the-physical and diemical
characteritics of the water. to assess its suitability for beneficial uses in the area and
downstream, in particular fisheries. Periodical water quality monitnring at various stations
will be regularly executed.
The complementary water quality survey (April 1994) was intended to provide base-line
information which may constitute the basis of the future monitoring activity. Four speciRic
water quality monitoring have been started during project preparation.
Water quality in the Main Canal system: any change in the water quality in the
project area and downstream shall be regularly detected ; the most important
parameters (pH. Fe. SO.. Total acidity. LC. TDS) in the water quality statinns will
he regularly measured (twice a month):
Water quality in fields ditches: it shall detect effects of the reclamation procedures
on water quality;
Groundwater quality; it shall determine any organic and innrganic pollution and
contamination, espcially in the solid waste disposal aras:
6 - 4                                                               EIA - Chapter 6



Pollution sensitive areas: Although being a non issue for the project area, the regular
monitoring of wastewater in Tham Luong-Ba HRom may he included: in fac. if
necessary, some diluition of the these waters may be operated through the drainage
system of the project:
e-    Public Health : in collaboration with the Preventive Medicine Center the insect vector horn
diseases incidence . especially malaria out-breack shall be monitored. The monitoring will
ensure that regular epidemiological survey is conducted in the area and protection measures
he strengthened immediately, should the frequency of such diseases increase.
The cost of' the
monitoring is estimated some 27.300 USD per year (excluding contingencies). The monitoring
during operation should staTt as soon as the irrigation scheme operates and is expected to last
for 5 years after completinn of construction activities.
6.4          Enviromnental Management
6.4.1    -  Environmental Management during Constnution
The Council and-its Executive Board, will be responsible for the management of the environmental
activities. However. most of the activities will be carried out by the Provincial Agricultural Service.
which might be integrated with the appointment of representatives of the population, volunteers.
NGOs etc.( see Figure 611)
The Scope of,work of the Environmental Management is:
*    the definition and revision of a general and ainual workplan for protection and enhancement
of the environment in the project area, including budget allocation and managenent of funds
made available to the envimnmenwtal component;
:    follow-up and supervision of the civil works. to make sure that environmental protection
measures in the constractor's contracts are duly fulfilled accnrding to technical specifcations;
specific aspects to be followed-up are:
location of disposal areas and protection measures:
construction andlor rehabilitation of embankments. especially  in secondary and
tertiary canals:
construction of the West Drainage Canal and sluice. which main purpose is to favour
the leaching out of the acidity;
construction of the 3 small-damrsluices on the Link Canal and on the Than Kien creek
to separate the Ba-Hom waters from the Tan Kien system:
bridge and sluices construction. to allow boat navigation nn the canals;
tests at-site. to determine the resistence to corrosion of class I cement:
soil reclamation and agricultural development:
follow-up of specific measures to protect the environment to be included in the project such
as:
disposal areas reclamation and follow-up of families affected by disposal areas to
make sure that adequate compensation is duly paid and reclamation carried out
water management and leaching of acidity inside the project area and downstream:

Capital cost of the Environmental Management and coordination will include the provision of logistic
facilities. Annual costs during the 5 years of construction operations (1995 to 1999) will include the
appointment of a highly experienced executive officer working part-time on the project and one fulil
time staff. Administration and logistics will be provided by the Project The total cost of the
environmental management during construction amounts to 97.900 USD (excluding contingencies).
6.4.2        Environmental Managemffent During Opeation
Responsibilities and organizational set-up for the environmental managemen't during operation will
be similar to the above described during construction. Specific tasks of the Environmental
Management is:
*    following the guidelines of the Board. definition of a medium termn (five years) deeIopment
plan and annual workplan where objectives. strategies and schedule of the environmental
operations are outlined:
*    day to day management and coordination of the environmental programs. for protection and
enhancement of the environment in the project area, including budget allocation and
managemnent of funds made available for the continuation of the environrnental component:
EIA - Chapter 6                                                               6- 7



follow-up of specific mesures to protect the environmenL to be included in the project, such
as:
reclamation of diposal areas and follow-up of the affcted families:
water management and leaching of acidity inside the project area and downstream;
optimal use of the water resource;
fishery development project to restor the fishing potential of the area:
*    management and follow-up of the monitoring system during project construction and
evaluation of the results, including off-site environmental constraints affecting the project
area; 
*  ~keping contacts with the local autorities and provincial enviromnental authorities to ensure
tha accetble environmental standrds are fbilowed in project activities and, vice-versa. too
make sure that fiutre city environmental constraints (sewerage, soild waste ec.) and planning
do not represent a reat for the irrigation project;
Funds for the executon of the protdion meres and the operation and management of the program
will be made available through project funds.
It may be noted that the activity of the Environmental Management will concern two main aspects.
nanely (i) the coordination and management of activities under its direct responsibility and (i) the
participation to the overall development of the area. The latter consists in the coordination with the
local governm t organizations. However it is understood that the Project would in no way encroach
in government and municipal rsponsibilities, but only coordinate their activities.
6.4.3 Envirenmental Activity Schedule
The activities included under the environment component during constuction are shown in Figure
612. Coordination and mmnagement. civil work construction environmental supervision and
enironmental monitoring will be implented dirctly by the Executive Board.
All other activities will be implemented by the various sections of the Provincial Agricultural Service
of HCM City and Long Au. under the management and monitoring of tie Executive Board. The
most important activities are: environmental aspects of the disposal management plan: enionmentl
aspects of soil reclamation, fishery progrmn; water management and "environmental friendly O&M:
integrated pest management. At field level the activity of the two provinces will be unified or at least
coordinated.
The tentative activity schedule shows that most of the acdvities will be carried out during the entire
project construction phase. Environmental actions during operation will start at the end of the
construction period as direct follow-up of the previous programs.
6.5          Environmental Casts
6.5.1        Scope
The environmental component of the project analyzed through this EIA and EMP tend to i) identify
potential adverse impact of the project and define monitoring and mitigation measures to off-set such
adverse impact and ii) identify external factors which have an environmental influence on the project.

* No specific economic analysis is developed, on the ground that almost all protection measures tends
to off-set the negative impact caused by the project, rater Ohn improve the existing environment.
No benefit is therefore claimed. but cost of evironmental actions were accounted for and included
in the economic and financial analysis.
Scope of this chapter is to present the cost to be taken into consideration in the economic analysis of
the project, namely:
a)    capital cost of protection and enhancement measures to off-set the negative impact an the
affeted population/enviromcnt;
b)    the annual environmental cost and benefits during operation.
6..2  Cot Or Envirmnentl Mesures during Construdtion
Capital Cost of Environmental Measures, are the costs that the project must sustain to mitigae. off-set
the negative impact on the affected population and environment. The following costs, evaluated at
market price and including 10% contingencies, are:
i)   Compensation to farmers for the temporary loss of farming land along the canal system.
which amounts to 708.312 USD, to be paid during the S yeas of construction:
it)   Proection measures to off-set damages to the physical and human environment caused during
the construction period, for 33.000 USD. to be spread during 5 yars project construction:
iii)   Cost of IMP program, to profte  the environment from excess of agrochemical. to be carried
out for three years, total 47,000 USD;.
iv)   Proteion and enhancment measures concerned with the restoraion of the fishery potential
in the project and downstream area, starting in year 3 of construction; total cost 135.200
USD.
v)   Cost of the monitoring program to be carried out during 5 years of project construction.
which amounts to a total anount of 167.750 USD;
vi)   Cost of the institutional strengthening and management program to he carried out during 5
years of project construction,-which amounts to 97,900 USD.
The cost estimate of the forestry protection and reafforestation of the Dau Tieng reservoir is not
included in the project costs, since this component is only partially associated with the Hoc Mon
project and mainly related to the rehabilitation of the Dau Tieng dam and reservoir.
Furthermore it has to be mentioned that the cost of the following environmental protection actions is
already included in the civil work component
location and protection measures for appropriate management of disposal areas;
construction andlor rehabilitation of embankments, especially in secondary and
tertiary canals:
