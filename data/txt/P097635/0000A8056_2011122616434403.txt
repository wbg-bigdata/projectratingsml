                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives are to: (a) help the Government strengthen the enabling policy, legal and regulatory frameworks conducive to new investments in the energy
                         sector; and (b) assist the Government to attract qualified private investors to develop lignite mines and build new capacity for lignite thermal power generation,
                         guided by high standards of environmental and social sustainability.

                         LPTAP is assisting the Government of Kosovo (GOK) prepare for a private sector investment into mining and power generation project called Kosova e Re Power Plant (KRPP). This
                         transaction reached a significant milestone with the issuance of the Draft Request for Proposals (RFP) to prequalified bidders in August 2010. The process has since been delayed
                         due to changes of government and contract management issues, but the final RFP is now expected to be issued to prequalified bidders in February 2012. The contract for air quality

                         government to facilitate private sector investment in the energy sector. However, selection of a project sponsor and financial close could not be achieved due to delays for several
                         reasons. Enough prepartory work has been accomplished that would help expedite the process of selection of investor once the new Transaction Advisors start working. If the
