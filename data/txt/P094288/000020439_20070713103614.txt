Description          The proposed Reform Implementation Development Policy
                     Loan (RIDPL) i s in support of the implementationof the Paris
                     I11reformprogrampresentedbythe GovernmentofLebanonto
                     the January 25, 2007 international donor conference and as
                     reflectedinthe InterimStrategyNote for Lebanon(ReportNo.
                     39779-LB).       The Paris I11 reform program comprises
                     comprehensive measures to improve fiscal sustainability,
                     enhance growth, and deepenthe social reforms. The proposed
                     RIDPL supports these objectives with a particularemphasison
                     the energy sector reform, which is a cornerstone ofthe Paris I11
                     reform program. The unreliable energy supply is a major
                     impediment to investment and employment in Lebanon and
                     because ofthe huge energy subsidyburden-equalto US$1per
                     personper day - a severe drain on the Government budget of
                     resources for growth and poverty reduction. In addition,
                     visible movement on such a fundamental area of reform will
                     contribute to the credibility of the Government's overall
                     program and should command broad-based support from key
                     stakeholders. The operation also supports actions inthe areas
                     of businessclimateand social sector reform.
Benefits             The benefits of the proposed operation will be realized over
                     time. Benefits are expected to accrue to the Government
                     budget through reducedsubsidy requirementsto the electricity
                     utility, EdL, thereby freeing up scarce public resources for
                     growthandpoverty reduction. Beneficiarieswill also include
                     industrial and household consumers who will enjoy more
                     reliable electricity supply and reduced reliance on more
                     expensive back-up generation. This, in turn, should lead to
                     positive investment and employment impact from more
                     reliable electricity supply. Reducingimpedimentsto business
                     will enhance Lebanon's competitive position.            Social
                     protection reforms will benefit the poor and vulnerable,
                     particularlyas the economygoes througha difficult adjustment
                     periodoverthe comingyears.
Risks                The main risks under this operation arise from the ongoing
                     Dolitical crisis in Lebanon which could result in a failure to

                   undertake key fiscal and sectoral reforms in a timely fashion.
                   Partly mitigating this risk is the fact that an important part o f
                   the reforms supported under this operation have broad-based
                   support.   In the case of the energy sector, reforms were
                   designed by the former Minister o f Energy and Water, who i s
                   now a member o f the Opposition,             and received full
                   endorsement from the coalition Government at the time (mid-
                   2006).   The reforms are based on the 2002 Electricity Law
                   adopted by a representative Parliament with a strong
                   consensus; they do not require parliamentary approval and can
                   be implemented through Council o f Minister decisions as the
                   highest level. The ongoing early engagement by the Bank in
                   the development and implementation o f a social protection
                   strategy could also help build social consensus around the
                   reform program and provide an additional mitigation
                   instrument. Exposure risks to the Bank beyond the current
                   operation will be controlled through close monitoring o f
                   performance with respect to the Paris I11reform program. As
                   with this operation so also with subsequent operations, the

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.       Lebanon's economic and social challenges are tremendous. Since the mid 1990s,
public debt levels have risen steadily to account for over 178% o f GDP in 2005.
Concurrently, the competitiveness o f its enterprises has dwindled and the lack o f
employment opportunities has ledto substantial poverty and emigration.

2.       Conflict and sectarian politics, weak public institutions, lack o f planning, poor
governance and several unimplementedreform programs, along with frequent changes in
government (accompanied by frequent changes in economic and sectoral policies) have
contributed to the challenges that Lebanon faces.                        These challenges have been
exacerbated by the hostilities that broke out between Lebanon and Israel during July-
August 2006, resultinginserious humanandphysical losses and underminingconfidence
inthe Lebanese economy.'

3.       Recognizing that rebuilding confidence in the economy requires reform measures
in key sectors, the Government of Lebanon was quick to finalize its medium-term
structural reform plans and call for an international donor conference to discuss this
program and provide indications o f support for the medium term. The conference was
heldon January 25,2007 inParis (Paris 111) and the program received the endorsement o f
the international donor community, which pledged US$7.6 billion in support over the
medium-term. The pledged assistance (mostly in the form of soft loans) includes both
budgetary support and project-specific finance.

4.       The Paris I11reform program is comprehensive and spans several areas that are
critical for Lebanon's growth, fiscal and social welfare prospects. Key pillars o f the
program are:       (i)fiscal adjustment to reverse Lebanon's presently unfavorable debt
dynamics and reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio through rationalization o f expenditures,
enhancement o f revenues, and improved efficiency; among the key measures are energy
sector reform and privatization (focusing on selected telecommunications assets and
licenses in the initial phase); (ii)      growth enhancing structural reforms to strengthen the
business environment and the competitiveness o f Lebanon's businesses; and (iii)social
sector reform to strengthen social safety nets to reduce poverty and vulnerability and
increase efficiency and effectiveness o f social spendingincluding inhealth and education.
The program also covers rehabilitation and reconstruction following the hostilities,

'The  direct damage from the hostilities is estimated at US$2.8 billion, with indirect damages accounting for
another US$700-US$SOO million in losses. Following the ceasefire, the World Bank was quick to respond
and carried out an Economic and Social ImpactAssessment (ESIA) in close coordination with other donors.
In addition, a US$70 million Trust Fundwas established to assist the Government address a set of critical
investments and reforms, including technical assistance to reform the power sector.

including through the emergency assistance mobilized before and at the Stockholm
Conference on August 31,2006.

5.       At the Paris I11Conference, the World Bankpledgedits assistanceto Lebanon (up
to US$700 million in IBRD financing) based on satisfactory implementation o f key
reforms under the Government's program. Towards this end, an Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) has been prepared because the underlying context has changed dramatically since
the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board on December 15,
2005.

6.       The I S N is anchored in the Government's medium-term reform program
presented at Paris 111. Despite the current politically charged environment, the reform
momentum has been maintained with the first steps towards implementation o f the
program underway.         Embedded in a forward looking strategy, the I S N outlines a
transitional framework o f technical and financial assistance to contribute to this early
effort. It advances a medium-termpublic expenditure and social reform agenda, with a
particular focus on energy, social protection, and water sector reforms, which are critical
to improve the larger macroeconomic andfiscal outlook over time.

7.       This proposed Reform Implementation Development Policy Loan (RZDPL) i s
integral to the support strategy described inthe ISN. While the RIDPL i s anchored inthe
medium term agenda o f the Paris I11reform program, it has a particular focus on the
energy sector reforms that are likely to be critical to the achievement o f medium-term
macro-fiscal targets set out in the program. The energy sector suffers from years o f
overall poor governance, weak management and administration, highinefficiencies inthe
power infrastructure ranging from power plants to the transmission and distribution
networks and reliance on costly imported fuel for power generation despite long-standing
plans to introduce natural gas.2 The result is unreliable electricity supply, very low
consumer confidence in the electric utility, Electricit6 du Liban (EdL), inadequate cost-
recovery and considerable dependence on budgetarysubsidies as highlightedabove.

8.       The Government is well aware o f the need to turn the sector around. In2002, an
Electricity Law (Law 462) was passed which lays out the restructuring intentions o f the
power sector. The Electricity Law calls for: the creation o f a regulatory authority; the
unbundlingof all or part ofthe sector; the incorporation under commercial law ofthe new
entities; and ultimately the privatization o f up to 40% o f the shares. It i s challenging but
all the more urgent to implement the Electricity Law successfully in Lebanon today and
underthe growing subsidiesto the sector.

9.       Through implementation o f reforms to improve governance and service reliability
and reduce the cost o f production o f electricity, the subsidy requirements could be
reduced from their current very highlevels, amounting to about US$1per person per day

or about 20% o f annual Government revenues and about 3.3% o f GDP (before debt
service) in 2006.3 The proposed RIDPL supports a set o f actions required to kick start
these reforms as a complementary initial step in the implementation o f the full Paris I11
reform program.         This in turn sends a strong signal to the Lebanese public and
international stakeholders that a credible structural adjustment and fiscal adjustment
program i s underway which should help maintain the reform momentum under current
difficult economic, political and security circumstances.                 The fiscal and structural
adjustment measures, in the energy sector and beyond, are anticipated to be broadened
and deepened as the reform program is phased-inover the medium-term.

                                11.       COUNTRY CONTEXT

A.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS INLEBANON4

10.      Inrecent years, Lebanon's economy has been substantially affected by external
events. Between2001 and 2004, the average growth rate reached 4%. In2005, economic
performance deteriorated inthe wake o f the assassination o f former Prime Minister Rafiq
Hariri. 2006 was shaping upto produce the highestgrowthrate ina decade due inpartto
the regional boom stoked by the rise in the price o f oil which have favored demand for
Lebanon's goods and services and induced transfers and capital inflows fi-om the Gulf
countries. Had this performance continued, real GDP growth would have been about 6
percent for the full calendar year. Instead, real GDP growth was flat in 2006 with lost
output from the hostilities reaching about US$1.3 billi~n.~

11.      The hostilities eliminated the good fiscal outcome o f the first six months o f 2006,
though subsequent international support helped contain the negative effects o f the
hostilities and political tensions on foreign reserves. Following a primary surplus over
the preceding five years, the primaryfiscal balance (excluding grants) reversed to a deficit
of 1.3 percent o f GDP; and the overall deficit widened to 14.6 percent o f GDP. Despite
higher budgetarygrants (2.9 percent of GDP) thanthe estimated direct budgetaryimpact
o f the hostilities (about 1 percent o f GDP), the overall fiscal deterioration in2006 reflects
the combined effects o f increase in interest payments and primary expenditures and
decline inrevenues. Although the hostilities playedan important role inboostingprimary
expenditures, persistent deficits runby public agencies (most notably EdL to which total
budgetary transfers rose by 65% in 2006) also played a role. With the increase in the
fiscal deficit and the collapse ineconomic growth, gross public debt remainedhigh at 178
percent o f GDP in2006 against earlier (pre-hostilities) expectations o f a decline. A large
injection o f Saudi (US$1billion) andKuwaiti (US$500 million) deposits duringand after
the hostilities largely contained any adverse effects of the hostilities on gross reserves.
However, with the rise in political tensions since late 2006, gross reserves gradually

  Extensive destructionof physical capital and disruption of trade, tourism, markets, and supply channels
duringthe hostilities hammeredall sectors ofthe economy, from agriculture and industryto services.


                                                   8

declined from their end-2006 level o f US$10.2 billion to about US$9.6 billion by end-
May 2007.

12.      The fiscal indicators available so far in 2007 indicate relatively strong revenue
collection performance during the first four months o f the year (9 percent increase
inclusive o f grants) over the same period in2006, when fiscal performance was similarly
strong. However, the increase in expendituresduringthe same period (23 percent) more
than compensated for this improvement, leading to a lower primary surplus (US$330
million) compared to the same period in2006 (US$5 14 million). Increasing debt service
payments (17 percent) andprimary expenditures (27 percent) continue to be the drivers of
the rising expenditures, with about 78 percent o f the increase inthe latter accounted by
transfers to the Electricite duLiban(EdL) alone.6

13.      The ongoing political stalemate and more recently the eruption o f the security
crisis7 dampens the confidence boosting impact o f the comprehensive economic reform
program and the generous Paris I11financial package that marked the beginningo f 2007.
Currently, the political situation in Lebanon i s tense, with the Opposition block calling
for greater representation inthe Government, and the Speaker o f the House declining to
convene the Parliament. Six Cabinet Ministers resigned inNovember 2006 and the anti-
Government demonstrations infront o f Government headquarters have paralyzed parts o f
Beirut for months. Talks are underway, including through international mediation, to
seek a solutionthat satisfies the political parties. Presidential election i s scheduled for the
Fall o f 2007.

B.       MACROECONOMIC               OUTLOOK AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY~


14.      Lebanon's macro economic outlook i s presented in the I S N for Lebanon. The
macro economic and fiscal analysis inthe I S Nbuilds on the Government's medium-term
reform program and i s aligned with the assessment undertaken as part o f the IMF's
recently approved EmergencyPost Conflict Arrangement (EPCA) Loan (see more under
section IV, B).

15.      The short-term outlook presented in the I S N takes into account the current
political impasse inLebanon and i s conservative. During 2007, real GDP i s expected to
grow by only 1percent and key sustainability indicators, such as the primary balance and
the debt ratio, will not improve by much (see Table 1). These considerations are
consistent with the Government's implementation plan whereby most o f the reform

payments to the Algerian and Kuwaitioil companieswhich started supplyingEdL with fuel oil and gas-oil
inSeptember2005, withthe paymentsfor all purchases(oldandnew) startinginthe summer of2006.
7 Security tensions recently increased with eruption o f a security crisis in a Palestinian refugee camp,
subsequent explosions in Beirut, and an assassination o f a prominent member of Parliament.This led the
Lebanesearmy to take action against armed militants inthe camp, which has been continuingat the time o f
writingofthe RIDPL.

17.      Structural reforms that would improve the business environment, competition, the
entry and operation o f SMEs and service delivery would upgrade, to some degree, the
long-term growth potential o f the Lebanese economy. Many of these reforms (including
telecom privatization and energy sector reform) are considered urgent by private sector

  The agenda for 2007 includes a commitment to contain the deficit and initiate important structural
reforms, including steps toward privatization o f the two mobile businesses and energy sector reforms,
preparation for tax policy reforms in 2008, increase in gasoline excise revenues, and budget management
reforms.

  Notes: The main assumptions for Table 2 include, on the revenue side, an annual increase in demand
  reflecting a combination o f GDP growth and income elasticity as well as increased demand from EdL's
  network - as o f 2010        - as EdL's service quality improves and the need for back-up generation is reduced.
  On the expenditure side, it has been assumed that the cost o f oil remains constant at US$64/barrel (marked
  up by 3% to reflect Lebanon's specific contractualterms with fie1 suppliers; i.e., USS65.9harrel). The cost
  for gas-oil and fiel-oil has been calculated using standard conversion factors o f 9.3 and 4.7, respectively.
  Other expenses (power purchase, wages, O&M and other administrative costs are assumed to increase by
  2% per year, reflecting international inflation for the power purchases and overall efforts to contain the
  other expenses). A filldescription o f the assumptions is included inAnnex 4. The subsidy figure excludes
  debt service and capital costs.

  19.       Inadditionto the measures includedinthe Government'scurrent reformprogram,
  three additionalmeasures are under considerationby the Governmentbut have not been
  fully quantifiedas of yet. These three measurescomprise (i)fuel conversion(from gas-
  oil to LiquefiedNatural Gas, LNG) at the second combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)

magnitude o fthese additional measures (see Box.3 and Annex 4 for the details).

20.       The reduction in the subsidy requirement (before debt service and capital
investment)would have a positive impact on the sector's drain on government resources,
by reducingthe deficit o fthe sector to 1.5% o f GDP by 2012 (from 3.3% in2006). Table
3 shows the impact on GDP should reforms fail to be implemented.

capitalcosts.

21.      The social protection reforms will benefit the poor and vulnerable in Lebanon,
particularly as the economy goes through a difficult adjustment period over the period
ahead, and contribute to fiscal improvement in the medium term. These reforms are
comprehensive ranging from expanding social insurance (pensions and health insurance)
by reforming the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) to strengthening the reach of
social safety nets and public health services. At the center o f the social safety net reform
i s the creation o f a targeting mechanism for social assistance which will strengthen the
poverty and vulnerability focus o f the social safety net programs. Both some o f the poor


                                                   14

and the middle class will also benefit from the social insurance reforms through the
introduction o f a pension system and more efficient and effective health insurance. The
NSSF reforms will also gradually eliminate Government's implicit liabilities (e.g. from
83 percent o f GDPto 52 percent o f GDP already in2015).

22.     The macroeconomic assessment presented above allows no further space for
slippages in implementation o f the reform program over the medium-term. It assumes
that ongoing technical assistance and capacity building efforts along with initial reform
measures planned this year would pave the way for sustained implementation o f reforms
from 2008 onwards. Delays or lack o f progress in the implementation o f the reform
program would be very costly for Lebanon. As shown in Table 1, even with significant
fiscal adjustment, large donor financing, and fairly positive growth response in the
medium term, debt will remain high (135 percent o f GDP in 2010) and require strong
continued effort to be brought to sustainable levels.     Should there be a weak policy
response or postponement o f reforms more generally; the debt-to-GDP level could reach
over 200% o f GDP over the medium-termaccording to the debt sustainability analysis
undertakenas part o f the Bank's ESIA. This would inevitably further expose the country
to a risk o f financial disruption.

                 111.     THE GOVERNMENT'SREFORMPROGRAM

23.     The main objective of the Government's reform program is to stimulate growth,
create employment, reduce poverty and maintain social and political stability.         The
program i s an integrated package covering three main pillars described below. Annex 1
providesa Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) from the Government and a report on the
implementation progress o fthe reforms so far.

A.      Fiscal Adiustment and Structural Reforms

24.     Revenue Management is an important element o f this pillar and encompasses both
improved revenue administration and enhanced collection through greater automation,
unification o f tax procedures, implementationo f a General Income Tax (GIT), increases
in VAT and interest tax rates, and adjustment o f the gasoline excise rate back to pre-
capping levels, and improved revenue collection from public properties.

25.     Prior to the partial privatization of the electricity sector, the Government
envisages a Privatization Program, focusing on the sale o f the mobile licenses and the
partial sale o f Liban Telecom (the fixed line operator, which will also include an
additional and third mobile license to operate in Lebanon). The proceeds from these
transactions are expected to be significant and are very important for Lebanon's fiscal and
debt sustainability. Includedunder the program is also preparation o fthe privatization o f
other sectors such water and wastewater, ports as well as potentially the existing but non-
operational oil refineries.




                                            15

26.     Further fiscal consolidation is expected through measures related to Primaw
Expenditures, notably public wages, which will be contained through closing o f various
funds and automation of administrative procedures to reduce the need for man-power in
addition to an overall review and identification o f existing excess staffing in the public
sector.

27.     The primary expenditure measures respond to a most challenging issue in
Lebanon today, namely, the need for expenditure containment through reform qf the
Enerav Sector which is a highpriority given the sector's substantial claim on budgetary
resources. The reforms will support the corporatization o f a restructuredEdL, a reduction
intechnical losses and illegal consumption of electricity, introduction of natural gas for
power generation and the completion o f on-going high priority investments as well as
attracting the private sector to undertake new investmentrequirementsto allow for better
service provision. These measures are envisaged to lead to a sustained reduction in the
budgetary contributions made by the Government to the electricity utility over time,
thereby contributing to fiscal adjustment.       Eventually - and as service improves -
electricity tariffs will also need to be revisedto better reflect the cost o f service provision.

28.     In addition, a Public Investment Program with increased share of foreign
financing (target 45% o f total investments) will be adopted.           Reforms will also be
implementedwith regardto Expnditure Management. The reforms will focus on a new
and improved Budget System Law with increased coverage in the budget, including
coverage o f foreign-financed investments, a medium term expenditure framework,
limitation o f budget carry-overs in current expenditures and more disciplined treasury
advances and a single account for the Treasury to improvecash management.

B.      Growth EnhancingStructural Reforms

29.     Underthis pillar, the Government will implementmeasuresaimed at (i)            improved
governance through auditing o f public finances and enterprises, new procurement laws
and regulation, renewedrole o f the Courts o f Accounts to ensure budget spendingalong
budgetary allocations, and better controls to monitor operations in the public sector; (ii)
strengthened capital markets and debt management through introduction o f laws,
establishment o f a Capital Market Commission and specialized Financial Court and
introduction o f new instruments to further market liquidity; and (iii)      improved business
environment through membershipinthe World Trade Organization (WTO), streamlining
o f procedures to establish and manage businesses including simplified import/export
administrative procedures, facilitated trade, enhanced access to credit, and improved
competitiveness and governance o f firms..

C.      Social Sector Reforms

30.     The aim o f the social sector reforms is to strengthen social safety nets to reduce
poverty and vulnerability, increase efficiency and effectiveness o f social spending,
enhance delivery of social programs, reform health and education sectors andthe pension



                                               16

system. Key to strengtheningthe poverty focus o f Social Safetv Nets is the introduction
o f an appropriate targeting mechanism. Reducing duplication between ministries i s also
on top o f the agenda as i s revising service standards for contracts with non-public
providers,   In Education, the Government will strengthen planning and policy to
rationalize the operating budgets o f the sector while targeting the specific problems o f
drop-outs and enrollment among the poor. Inthe Health sector, service will be improved
through better targeting and increasing availability o f vouchers for eligible patients while
introducing evaluationtechniques to ensure increased efficiency of spendingand service.

31.     Another key reform that the Government is introducing under this pillar i s
Pension Reform aiming at introduction o f a fully-funded defined contribution pension
system to replace the current End-of-Service-Indemnity(EOSI) program and stop the
accumulation o f unfunded liabilities. The past two consecutive governments have been
in agreement with this reform and technical discussions on a draft law reforming the
EOSI and introducing a fully-funded defined contributions pension system has been
completed by a specialized parliamentary committee. Implementationo f the new system
would focus on the drafting o f necessary regulations (e.g. treatment o f annuities,
survivorship pensions, and disability pensions; governance o f the new Social Security
InvestmentAuthority).

         IV.     BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

A.      LINKTO CAS/ISN


32.     The latest CAS was approved by the Board o f Directors on December 15 2005,
covering the 2006-2009 period. The CAS focused on three pillars: (i)         governance for
economic management and growth support; (ii)    the development ofhumancapital andthe
mitigation o f the poverty effects o f transition; and (iii)resource and environmental
management. An Interim Strategy has become necessary because o f the hostilities inthe
summer o f 2006, and the domestic political impasse that has prevailed since November,
2006 which have fundamentally changed the underlying economic and political context,
rendering certain CAS assumptions, projections and triggers for Bank assistance
untenable.

33.     The InterimStrategy provides a framework for the continuation o f the Bank's role
as a development partner for Lebanon as it moves forward from its current difficult
economic circumstances. The period covered by the Interim Strategy (12-15 months) i s
short inappreciation o f the uncertain economic and political situation inLebanon andthe
forthcoming elections in the Fall. Embedded in a forward looking strategy around the
same three pillars that characterized the last full CAS, the Interim Strategy sets a
transitional framework of technical and financial assistance to contribute to the
Government's efforts to establish reform momentum. It advances a medium-termpublic
expenditure and social reform agenda, with a particular focus on energy, social
protection, and water sector reforms. It i s widely understood in Lebanon that upfront
quick reform action in these areas and supporting international assistance are essential



                                           17

for: (i)contributing to fiscal sustainability in the medium term; (ii)supporting the
Government's growth and social reform agenda; and (iii)       catalyzing donors to implement
their Paris I11pledgesto achieve highimpact reforms that would put Lebanonon a track
to macroeconomic stability and growth.

B.       COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS


34.      The IMF approved an Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) program for
SDR50.75 million (US$77 million) on April 9, 2007. The EPCA has been disbursed
against a set o f fiscal and structural policy reforms to be undertaken during2007 aimedat
protecting financial stability and containing the budget deficit during this transition year
andinitiating structural reforms that are critical to the success o fthe medium-termreform
program. Monitorable actions under the EPCA package involve actions in the areas o f
tax reforms, budgetarymanagement improvement, telecom privatization, and preparation
o f audits o fthe National Social Security Fundandthe power sector. The Government has
indicatedthat upon successful completion o f the EPCA, it intends to seek further support
for its program through a stand-by arrangementfrom the Fund.

35.      In the wake of the hostilities, IFC directed its support to the recovery of the
private sector. At the Paris I11conference, IFC pledgedUS$250-275 million to this for a
program o f investment and technical assistance. A series o f credit lines and risk sharing
facilities with local banks for US$200 million will support small and medium enterprises
in their recovery.      Additionally, IFC has expanded its Trade Finance program and
continues to be active in both real sector and services sector investments. Advisory
services to the Government also form a vital component o f IFC's assistance. The IFC has
been asked to provide advisory support to solicit an IndependentPower Producer (IPP)
andpossibly other steps inthe privatization o f some existingpower plants. Finally, FIAS
and IFC have been assisting with design and implementation o f administrative reform,
and a number o f initiatives are underway to increase accessto finance.

36.      The donor community has been generous in supporting the reconstruction and
recovery o f Lebanon, pledgingUS$7.6 billion at the Paris I11conference inJanuary 2007.
The spectrum o f donors extends from Europe to the USA and many generous Middle
Eastern donors. Highincome countries from the Gulf Cooperation Council (UnitedArab
Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia) have been particularly instrumental in
supporting the social sector inthe areas o f emergency relief and reconstruction; currently
the Bank participates very actively in energy and social protection reform. Meanwhile,
USAID, EIB, and many regional donors (AFESD, KFAED, IsDB), remain major
contributors inthe areas o f governance, economic reform and growth.

37.      Support to the power sector has beenequally diverse, with the major players being
AFD, EC, EIB and AFSED. The AFD and the Bank have been inclose cooperation in
the preparation o f the Bank's emergency response under the LebanonTrust Fundfacility.
AFD is contributing to the cost o f the technical assistance under the Emergency Power
Sector Reform Capacity Reinforcement Project and has been instrumental in securing


                                                18

grant financing for the Master Plan, for which consultant engagement is a condition under
the proposed RIDPL. The EC and EIB have both expressed support to the reform of the
energy sector; in particular EIB has earmarked funds for advancing the PPP agenda
through technical assistance and guarantee instruments.          The Government is also
discussing with the Saudi Fund, Kuwait Fund and the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Developmenttheir possible involvement inthe energy sector.

38.     The Government continues to coordinate with donors to arrange for the most
suitable allocation o f their pledged funds with an emphasis on raising additional budget
support for reforms, or making sure that funds for physical investmentsare aligned with
the Government's reform agenda andexpenditure framework.

C.      RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS


39.     The portfolio of projects active before the hostilities includes activities in the
urban, transport, water, education, cultural heritage and social protection sectors. A Trust
Fund for Lebanon, established with US$70 million from IBRD surplus in September
2006, is supporting municipal reconstruction in some o f the worst affected communities
and assisting inthe rehabilitationo fwater networksinthe WesternBeka'a. Additionally,
technical assistance vital to the reform program i s beingprovided inthe water, energy and
social protection sectors.

40.     At present, the main social protection operation is the Community Development
Project (CDP), which was recently restructured. It seeks to improve the living conditions
and economic status o f disadvantaged communities in Lebanon.              An Institutional
Development Grant (IDF) supports the development o f HIV/AIDS monitoring systems
and public health programs. Additionally, a Rapid Social Assessment was undertaken
post-hostilities to identifynewpockets o fvulnerability.

41.     In the energy sector, a TFL grant of US$5 million has been allocated to a
Technical Assistance (TA) project, namely "Emergency Power Sector Reform Capacity
Reinforcement Project", to initiate reforms and restructuring o f the electricity sector.
More specifically, the project supports: (i)the Ministry o f Energy and Water (MEOW) to
address key sector policy issues and high priority cost reduction projects (such as better
management o fthe distribution network and fuel supply and procurement); (ii) Higher
                                                                                 the
Council o f Privatization (HCP) to corporatize EdL; and (iii) itself to improve its
                                                                  EdL
operations and financial performance.

42.     While it is evident that current Bank support is small relative to the needs of
Lebanon, the analytic and advisory services constitute an integral and catalytic parts o f
overall donor support, which is predicated on reforms, particularly in the energy and
social protection sectors.

D.    LESSONSLEARNED

43.   There are several important lessons learned from attempting policy reforms and
implementingoperations infragile anduncertainpolicy environments. These lessons are
drawn from the previous Lebanon CAS and the Bank's broader experience with policy-
based operations.

   rn Fully appreciating thepolitical complexities and thepolitical economy dfficulties
      of the decision-making environment in Lebanon. The system o f governance in
      Lebanon poses non-trivial challenges to implementing policy reforms in the
      country. Any attempt at policy reforms must be done with a true appreciation o f
      the impliedpolitical complexities for designand implementation.

   rn Engaging in lending operations when a credible and broad-based policy
      commitment isfully ascertained. The implementationtrack record o fthe portfolio
      inLebanonindicates the strong needto secure upfront political commitment prior
      to engaging in a new lendingoperation, including getting buy-infrom members o f
      Parliament early on in the preparation. The power sector program i s anchored in
      Law 462 passed by Parliament in 2002 and the reform plan proposed by the
      former Minister o fEnergyand Water inJuly 2006.

   rn Supporting the reform program through appropriate instruments, e.g. budget
      assistance rather than investment has more impact in facilitating Lebanons
      reform program at this stage. In this context, given the weak management
      capacity o fthe electricity sector, it would not be conducive to focus on large scale
      infrastructure projects investments until the management of the sector i s
      improved. Additionally, budget support assistance provides the convening power
      for the Government to address key sector bottlenecks.

   rn The Bank's experience with DPLs in other j?agile/post-conflict states indicates
      that in states that show slow improvements due to afragile political environment
      policy-based lending can provide a much needed sense of policy direction,
      allowing governments to look beyond immediate problems and begin addressing
      key structural development constraints. This "continuity in policy at a time of
      change" is applicable for the prevailing conditions o f Lebanon.

   rn It is important to keep an eye on short-term Jiscal trends, but a deep
      understanding of      structural    and institutional constraints to       long-term
      development should also be developed.

   rn Speed and long-term engagement are needed in post conflict situations. The
      speed o f the Bank's response in the aftermath o f the hostilities, effective field
      presence and detailed knowledge o f country circumstances were especially
      important to enable strong dialogue and provide valued support on the ground to



                                             20

         respond to priority needs emerging from the hostilities and to guide wider Bank
         engagement.

E.       ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS


44.      The analytical underpinningso f the proposed operation are covered by multiple
 studies conducted in recent years. Among them are a Sources of Growth Study, an
Investment Climate Assessment, a Public Expenditure Review, and a Financial
Accountability Assessment. There is a also a substantial body o fanalytical work on social
 sectors covering the areas o f social insurance (health financinghnsurance and pension
reform), social safety nets and public health. The gist o f these studies i s captured in the
Economic and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) report that was undertaken following the
 summer-2006 hostilities.      The ESIA covered sixteen sectors in three broad areas
 (infrastructure,  social, and economic) assessing the macroeconomic and sector
 development challenges, the complexities added by the physical, economic and social
impact o f the hostilities and outlining sector reform priorities. The Government's reform
program was informed inpart bythe findings and recommendations o fthe ESIA. Finally,
 a portion o f the Trust Fundfor Lebanon (TFL) has been directed for advisory assistance
for reinvigorating the private sector and for capacity building and/or implementation
 support activities in energy and social protection sectors, which provides analytical
feedback inthese areas.

45.      Concerning the energy sector, the most recent analysis is covered in the ESIA
which includes a chapter on electricity, informing the Government's reform program in
the sector and providing recommendations in the short- and medium-term. The key
 strategic points are (i) major efforts are needed to improve governance; (ii)        improved
 commercial operation o f EdL requires immediate change in its legal status through
 corporatization to remove staffing and managerial problems but also to reduce the day to
 day political interference; (iii)
                                 all efforts should be put towards accessing natural gas; and
 (iv) the significant investment needs of the sector can only be economic and efficient if
there i s better management and skills at EdL and there i s proper sector strategy and
planning.

46.      Furthermore, in 2004, the World Bank carried out a Hydrocarbon Strategy
 Study." The objective o f the study was to evaluate the best market structure for the
supply and transport of natural gas inLebanon. While the report clearly evaluated very
positively the introduction o f natural gas to Lebanon in terms o f foreign exchange, trade
balance, financial viability o f the electricity sector as well as on the environment, it
stressed as a first priority the need to restructure EdL and to put it under private
management (and ultimately ownership) to enable the conversion o f fuel in the sector.
Without a restructured EdL, the potential achievements o f fuel conversion will be
significantly undermineddue to current lack o f capacity, incentives and skills.

47.     Around the same time, BNP Paribas prepared a privatization strategy.I2 Intheir
presentation they stated that they believed that investors would be willing to consider
purchasing generation and distribution assets inLebanonprovided certain elements are in
place: (i)  guarantees covering regulatory and public entities' payment risk; (ii) lessthe
attractive distribution areas (North, South and BekaaValley) be eliminated from the sales
offer; (iii)non strategic investors, including local, be involved; (iv) protection against the
currency devaluation risk by means o f a pass through o f such risk to consumers via an
appropriate tariff formula be agreed to; and (v) the investor i s provided an adequate
period o f exclusivity in generation and supply. Inthe absence o f these elements, Paribas
believedthat investors/operators would probably not be willing to purchase assets and the
Government would need to consider alternatives such as concessions, O&M or
management contracts.

48.     As part of the privatization work, National Economic Research Associates
(NERA) undertook a reviewo ftariffs. Their findingswere that before privatization some
actions should be envisaged, such as increasing revenues either by raising the average
level o f tariffs or by reducing non-technical losses; removing cross subsidies (major
cross-subsidies are between low voltage and high voltage customers and between
concessions and everyone else); some tariff adjustments would be required to achieve
cost recovery on privatization. Since the study was completed, the gap between cost and
revenues has widened considerably, along with an even greater deteriorationinthe supply
o f electricity due to increased theft and reduced routine maintenance o f equipment. As
such, tariff restructuring and increase i s a key requirement to improve the financial
viability o f the sector over time, but remains socially and politically unfeasible in
Lebanon today. Hence, revenue enhancement will have to come, in the shorter term,
from loss reduction, lower cost generation o f electricity through fuel conversion and fiom
improvements inbilling and collection.

49.     The Bank has also undertakenwork on the cost o f environmental degradation in
Lebanon (in2000). Expressed in GDP per year, the cost was estimated between 2.8% to
4.0%, with a mean estimate o f close to US$565 million per year, or 3.4% o f GDP. The
second largest impact after water was reported to derive from air pollution (1.1%). This
includes the impact o f fuel used at power stations (such as Zouk and Jieh). A specific
study on the cost of environmental degradation being carried out at present and relates to
the July 2006 hostilities. This review will focus mainly on the impact o f the oil spill,
ruble removal, water quality and forest fires.

50.     The Bank is currently preparing an energy sector PER. The PER is reviewingthe
expenditures o f the electricity sector; and i s assessing the cost-benefit o f expenditures in
relation to their contribution to a reduction in the claim on Government resources. The
PER is also reviewingthe operating expenditures of the sector, with a view to provide
recommendations for how to contain the expenditures.

                         V.      THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

A.      OPERATIONDESCRIPTION


51.     The proposed operation is the Bank's response to the Paris I11reform program.
As described in the sections above, Paris I11covers several important reforms aimed at
getting Lebanon back on track in terms o f macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability,
underpinnedby social reforms that will enable the implementationo f economic and fiscal
reforms.   The key reforms in the Government's program cover (i) enhancing
                                                                         growth
reforms which will be achieved through reform and privatization o f state-owned
enterprises (energy, telecommunications), and an improvement in the overall business
environment enabling more businesses to establish at lower transaction costs; (ii)   fiscal
reforms which will be achieved through tax policy adjustments, and savings from a
reduction in the subsidy transfers to EdL as a result o f implemented energy reforms and
increase in the efficiency o f expenditures; and (iii)social sector reforms to increase the
efficiency o f social service provision through consolidation o f institutions and better
targeted utilization o f resources and ensure those most vulnerable and impacted by the
overall reform program are protected. The third area i s critical to mitigate and therefore
enable the implementation o fthe growth enhancing and fiscal reforms.

52.     The overall development objective o fthe RIDPL program is to support a select set
o f reforms under the Government's program where (i)strong consensus exists; (ii)       the
Bank has deep knowledge and has assumed a very active role; and (iii)            reform i s
sufficiently advanced to justify development policy lending. To this end, the RIDPL
focuses on the areas that are at the center o f the Government's reform program: (i)
energy sector reform; (ii)modernization o f the business environment; and (iii)      social
protection reform.     As such, the operation will support, as condition for Board
presentation, a distinct set o f reforms in the energy sector, business environment, social
safety nets and social insurance. Two public financial management measures are also
conditions for Board presentation (see Annex 2 for presentation o f key actions in matrix
form).

53.     These key areas are consistent with the Governance, Economic Management, and
Growth Support as well as the Developing Human Capital and Mitigating the Poverty
Effects o f Transition pillars o f the ISN. The RIDPL i s a single tranche operation. The
ISNenvisages a second RIDPL, subject to satisfaction of conditions for this, which will
provide continuity in the Bank's assistance for broadening and deepening the
Government's reform program. The single tranche DPL approach under the ISN allows
for quick implementation o f some initial reforms, while providing both the Bank and the
Government with flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances with respect to the next
phase.

54.     Although initial reform steps are modest, they will be advanced inthe short term
through the technical and financial assistance envisaged both by the Bank and other


                                             23

donors. The proposed combination o f reforms will, inturn, increase the chances for the
Government's comprehensive reform program to gain momentum and be phased-in over
time. It is highly unlikely that the wide-ranging, deep structural reforms of the type that
Lebanon needs to undertake can be implemented without first reversingthe fiscal drain
and service decline in energy sector, reducing impedimentsto business and adequately
addressing the currently underdeveloped social protection agenda.

B.      POLICY AREAS


Reform of the Energy Sector

55.     This RIDPL puts a particular emphasis on initiating administrative reform of the
state-owned enterprise EdL (focusing on improving its capacity and accountability) and
highpriority actions (lower costs, better service) that will contribute to fiscal adjustment
inLebanonandpave the way for deepeningthe reforms over time. This is complemented
bykey public financial management measures (see Section C for details).

56.     The Government's reform program in the energy sector has as the ultimate
objectives to achieve service reliability, cost reduction and relieving the Government
budget o f a massive drain o f resources that could be much better allocated elsewhere.
The Government also aims at reducing the role o f the public sector to ensure improved
conditions for economic growth. The reform steps center on administrative reform o f the
state-owned enterprise EdL and undertaking o f high priority investments to reduce cost
and improve service.      The administrative reform will focus on corporatizing and
unbundlingEdL (generation, transmission and distribution) and ultimately privatizing it.
The priority investmentswill first and foremost be on access to natural gas to replace the
much costlier gas-oil used in about 50% of the current production capacity. This will
initially be by piped natural gas from Egypt to the Beddawi power plant but the
Government i s also investigatingthe option o f liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the Zahrani
power plant.     Furthermore, on-going investments to improve load flow in the
transmission segment will be completed, and upgrading and rehabilitation, including
piloting o f new remote meters in the distribution segment to address non-payment and
technical losses in the network, will be implemented. The Government is investigating
alternatives to privatize the management o f power distribution and has retained
consulting services to manage the tendering process. To the extent possible, financing
will be sought from private sources. Private participation is also being considered to
finance and construct new power generation to address shortage in capacity, and to
improve management o fcurrent facilities.

57.     The Government, through the Higher Council for Privatization, i s also about to
enter into an agreement with the IFC to issue a tender process to attract independent
power producers (IPPs) to invest in the generation o f 450 MW in the Beddawi complex
and possibly acquire the existing Beddawi power plant.




                                            24

 58.     The reform program has been designed based on the achievement of reforms
 undertakenin the last twelve months which include: (i)       appointment o f Auditors for the
 2001 accounts of EdL; (ii) o f contract for the establishment o fthe National Control
                               award
 Center (NCC) which will allow for better dispatch o f electricity; (iii)      award of contract to
 preparetender for private sector participation in distribution (network O&M, billing and
 collection, and installation o f meters); (iv) award o f contract for private operation and
 maintenance o f the most recently installed power plants (Beddawi and Zahrani); and (v)
 Parliament approval o f amendmentto the Electricity Law to allow for IPPs.

 59.     The Government's strategy for the sector i s captured inthe Letter o fDevelopment
 Policy attached inAnnex 1.

 Electricitvtariffs

 60.     As mentioned above in section IV, E, a very important measure for sector
 improvement and successful implementation o f a private sector-led reform effort, i s the
 restructuring, and ultimately adjustment, o f the electricity tariff. The overall average
 tariff for 2006, based on billed energy, was about US$ cents 9.4 kWh. From a cost
 recovery perspective, the overall average tariff i s low as i s it i s set to cover a fuel price o f
 US$25/barrelwith the current cost per barrelaround US$60/barrel.

 61.     Therefore, it i s evident that the tariff needs to be revised to better reflect cost
 (particularly fuel costs). However, also the tariff structure needs to be revised. The
 tranches o f tariffs for the residential consumers are too wide, andthe invertedblock tariff
+should really peak at about 300 kWh, as i s the case inmost countries, instead o f 500 kWh
 as is the case inLebanon where consumers with a consumption o f electricity inexcess o f
 300 kWh may actually not qualify as economically vulnerable. Furthermore, the peak
 tariff for industryactually encourages self generationand thereby reduces EdL's revenue
 base (this i s important since these are generally paying customers). Finally, the tariff to
 existingdistribution concessions should also be reviewedas it appears too generous..

 62.     Under the EmergencyPower Sector Reform Capacity Reinforcement Project, the
 NERA tariff study will be updated (this is included as part of the terms o f reference for
 the TA consulting assignment to the MOEW). This work will help guide future tariff
 adjustments, which will be considered in tandem with service improvements and a
 reduction in the interruption of supply. Worldwide experience shows that any tariff
 increase when service i s weak and bill collection poor to begin with usually results in a
 further deterioration inpayments andanincrease intheft.

 EnergyActions SupportedUnder the RIDPL


 63.     The proposed energy reform actions are deemed as the most critical at this stage
 and follow the recently taken reforms to achieve the underlying goals o f the
 Government's energy sector strategy articulated above.               The actions cover sector
 governance, restructuring and cost reduction, and will contribute- over time - to reduced


                                               25

Government subsidy requirements. The operation has been designed based on the
Government's reform program as presented to Paris I11 and as presented in the
Government's Letter o f Development Policy attached in Annex 1 and seals the critical
steps needed to achieve the objectives o f the energy reform program. The reforms also
reflect the current political context in Lebanon where changes in the composition o f
Government, and in the relations between President, Government, and Parliament, may
occur inthe short-term.

The followinPr actions are conditions for Boardpresentationthat have beenmet:

     Establishment o f an Interministerial Power Sector Reform Committee chaired by the
     Prime Minister to enhance capacity, governance and accountability for the
     implementation o freforms.
     Contracts awarded for the three advisory teams to restructure EdL including
     transforming its legal status, enhance capacity to manage the reform process in the
     MOEW and support turnaround o f EdL through injection o f capacity and expertise in
     the utility.
     Audit of 2001 accounts of EdL completed and auditors retained for 2002-2006 to
     allow for availability o freliable financial information on the sector13.
     Consultants employed to advise on installationo f meters and awarding o f distribution
     service contracts to the private sector.
     Consultant engaged for preparation o f a Master Plan for the electricity sector to
     accelerate decision-making and funding allocation to least-cost investments that
     improve quality and cost o f supply.
     Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) or equivalent signed for an import contract
     for natural gas (piped or LNG) to diversify the fuel type used to achieve reduction in
     electricity generation costs and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean
     Development Mechanism.
     Appointment o f an advisor to launch the implementation o f a modem internal audit
     function at the MOF.
     Publishing, on the MOF website, a highlevel summary o f the PFM action plan aimed
     at strengthening the PFM system and monitoringprogress.

64.      It is recognized that the proposed operation supports what appear to be very
modest reforms due to their institutional nature. However, it needs to be notedthat inthe
context o f Lebanon, the reforms are not modest, and more importantly, they represent the
required sequential steps in the Government's reform program for the sector, e.g., the
necessary governance steps requiredto restructure and reform the sector and accelerate
cost reduction measures through better planning and securing o f alternative fuel sources,
e.g., natural gas. Any follow-on operation(s) would see the restructuringprocess through
to completion andintroduce private sector participation into the sector.




l3The audit of2002-2006 is expectedto be completedby January, 2008.

65.    The operation's conditionality is listed as part o f the Bank assisted reform
program inthe Matrix attached inAnnex 2.

Modernizationof the BusinessClimate

66.    Modernization o f the business climate is o f critical importance to achieve the
Government's economic growth goals. The reforms focus on reducing the impediments
to business that drive up the cost o f doing business locally and act as a barrier for a
modern services-driven economy.

67.     The reform process addresses three key areas (i)reduced transaction costs for
establishing businesses; (ii)better internet and telecom services; and (iii) of labor
                                                                          reform
and social security regulations to generate growth and employment.

68.     To reduce the transaction costs for establishing businesses, the Government, in
cooperation with the IFC,has prepared a two-pronged strategy and implementation plan.
The first prong envisages a major improvement in the business start-up complexity
(measured by procedures, time, and cost) in the short term through streamlining o f
processes and procedures that do not require legislative changes.            The overall
improvement in the complexity o f business-start-ups under the first prong reforms i s
estimated to be around 45 percent compared to current levels. The short-term measures
are now being finalized for implementation, which i s expected to start no later than
September2007, under a Memorandum o fUnderstandingbetweenLibanPost, Ministryo f
Justice, Ministry o f Economy and Trade, Ministry o f Finance, Commercial Registries,
National Social Security Fund, and the Prime Minister's office.             These initial
improvements will be strengthened through reforms (covering initial capital requirements
and further streamlining of processes and procedures) under the second prong o f the
strategy, requiring modifications to the commercial law, and therefore to be implemented
in the medium-term. The overall improvement in the complexity of business-start-ups
under the second prong reforms is estimated to be around 85 percent compared to current
levels.

69.     The telecommunications sector, currently operated as a Government-run
monopoly, acts as a serious barrier to modernizing the economy with poor service inboth
mobile phone and internet services.         This structure impedes the development o f
Information Technology and the creative services sectors, as well as e-commerce, where
Lebanon should have considerable strength.           The Government's reform program
envisages a regulatory system that provides competitive incentives to develop a new
information technology-based industry and telecom privatization, the latter also
contributing to fiscal adjustment through debt reduction.

70.     Important reforms have already beenachieved or are close to being achieved. The
Board o f the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA) i s already inplace and its budget for




                                             27

2007 approved.l4 All telecommunications regulatory functions are planned to be
transferred to the TRA by the last quarter o f 2007.         In addition, the corporatization
process o f Liban Telecom and the privatization o f mobile telecommunications are
expected to be launched by end-September 2007, with a view to close transactions in
early 2008.     To this end, submission o f legislation to Parliament by end-June i s a
monitorable action under the IMF's EPCA. Finally, the Ministryo f Telecommunications
launchedbroadband services inthe Beirut area inMay 2007.

71.     Reform o f Lebanon's rigid labor and social security regulations.              Outdated
regulations and systems depress employment and make Lebanese businesses less
competitive. Analysis conducted by the World Bank prior to the hostilities indicatedthat
inabsenceo fthese restrictions, formal sector firms would, onaverage, employ 15percent
more workers. The Government's ongoing efforts, with assistance from the Bank, to
strengthensocial safety nets and reform the pension system would help in lessening the
rigidities o f the labor market, while providing support to the unemployed (by removing
this burden from businesses) and protectionto the vulnerable elderly (see below section
on Social Protection Reform for the reform progress to be supportedwhich will support
this areao fimproving the overall business environment.

BusinessEnvironmentAction Sumortedbv the RIDPL

The following action is a condition for Boardpresentation which has beenmet:


0   Creation o f the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) and appointment o f
    its Board.

Social ProtectionReform

72.     The social sector inLebanon has several shortcomings which result ininefficient
spending in the sector as well as inadequate ability to serve as an effective protection
mechanism.       The shortcomings are particularly prominent in the areas of:             health
insurance, pension systems and health and education services. Given its exposure to
shocks, Lebanon should have much stronger and expanded risk mitigating (insurance)
and risk coping (assistance) mechanisms including health insurance, a pension system,
and a well-targeted cash assistance program. Unique to the region, Lebanon does not
have a pension system for private workers (what exists inan End-of-Service-Indemnity).
While it has a health insurance system, it i s fragmented, costly and formally reaches only
50% o f the population. Formal safety nets are small, scattered, and not targeted to the
poor and vulnerable.     The country relies on its strong confessional-based network o f
social services which play the role o f a safety net (NGOs, welfare organizations,
remittances, etc.) but which are susceptible to economic or political shocks themselves.



l4 The TRA has issued three regulations to date including guidelines on Significant Market Power,
InterconnectionandConsumer Affairs.


                                              28

73.      The Government fully recognizes the problems in the social sectors, and its
reform is a key pillar under the Paris I11reform program. Leading up to Paris 111, several
important steps had beentaken to initiate the reforms, these include: (i) development o f a
Social Action Plan (SAP) in May/June 2006 as well as individual sector strategies; (ii)
creation o f an Inter-Ministerial Committee for Social Policy (IMC-SP);           and (iii)
completion o f technical discussions on a draft pension law by a specialized parliamentary
committee representing the different political sides. The draft law, once approved by
Parliament, will provide Lebanonwith a fully-fundeddefined contribution scheme.

74.      At the request of the Government, the World Bank has assumed a leadingrole in
the designandimplementation ofthe social protectionreform program. These efforts are
supported by an allocation o f funds from the TFL and it i s anticipated that the proposed
second DPL envisaged under the I S N includes Bank support for deeper social reforms.
Duringthe supervision of the proposed RIDPL, reform progress will be monitoredinthe
following key areas:

(i) Reform of the NSSF to improve its financial sustainability, contain the
accumulation o f unfundedliabilities and reduce government transfers. The NSSF today
has unfunded liabilities that could amount to 15 percent o f GDP. One o f the main
objectives i s to restore the financial balance o f the NSSF and reduce the demands for
fiscal support by reforming its health and family allowances branches including
redefining the package o f health services, changing financing mechanisms, and
redesigningcontracting, payment and utilization review systems in order to control costs
and improve the quality o f services. Over the short term, the key measure i s to control
hospitalization costs. For the family allowances branch, the goal i s to target benefits to
middle and low-income families.         Finally, the reform program also includes the
implementation o f the new DC-FF pension system and to refinance its unfunded
liabilities. The new pension system will improve the fiscal position o f the government
(by reducing implicit liabilities) and contribute to reduce the tax-wedge, thus facilitating
employment creation inthe formal sector. The new pension system also has the potential
to support financial sector development, provide alternative sources o f financing to the
corporate sector and thus contribute to productivity and economic growth.

(ii) Reformofsocialsafetynetstostrengthentheirpovertyfocus, buildinstitutional
capacity in the Ministry o f Social Affairs (MOSA), and improve social service delivery
arrangements o f MOSA. Strengtheningthe poverty focus o f the safety net programs will
be achieved through the introduction o f indicator based targeting, or proxy-means testing
(PMT) targeting mechanism. The PMT mechanism will allow social assistance to be
allocated to the vulnerable and poor segments o f the population to smooth income, and
will include compensating those affected by possible public service price changes,
education benefits for the poor, and health subsidiesto those inneed. Implementationo f
the PMT mechanism will take 18-24 months but work has begun on developing the
targeting formula. By September 2007, the formula i s expected to have Government
approval and implementation can commence. At the same time, MOSA's mandate and



                                             29

responsibilities will be redefinedto identify areas o f duplication betweenMOSA, M O H
and MEHE with a view to reduce any duplication and therefore inefficiencies and
wasteful spending. A time-bound action plan reducing duplication between the three
social ministries would be approved by the Social IMC. Finally, with respect to service
delivery through NGOs,these will be rearranged to include service standards, competitive
bidding, and results-based contracting.     MOSA has already developed new service
standards and criteria for the Care Program (largest social program). A Ministerial decree
would be issuedputtingthe new standards ineffect.

(iii) ReformoftheservicesoftheMinistryofHealth(MoH)toimproveefficiencyand
enable M o H to focus its attention on developing healthpolicy and playing its stewardship
role.   Reforms in the short-term will include the implementation o f an enhanced
electronic claims system; the preparation and use o f thirty admission protocols for
expensive procedures and the enforcement o f an administrative cap on the monthly
ceiling amounts for contracts with private hospitals. The enhanced electronic claims
processing system will allow for the implementation o f comprehensive utilization review
procedures to better monitor and control inappropriate health service utilization. Along
with this system, the admission protocols are needed to ensure the appropriateness o f
inpatient coverage, as opposed to referringpatients for outpatient services. The ex ante
application o f caps will help prevent overruns o f the monthly ceiling budgets on the
contracts with private hospitals. With these efficiency-improving measures, the Ministry
o f Health will also work to re-align its budget in coordination with the Ministry o f
Finance towards enhanced spending on public health and primary healthcare services.
This will include defining a public-private strategy that identifies the services to be
directed to public versus private hospitals.

(iv)    Implementation o f the recently completed education sector strategy to enable
Lebanon to capitalize on its most vibrant resource (human) when utilized efficiently and
effectively. Through support from the World Bank, reforms o f the education sector will
continue and will include education finance, re-organization o f the management o f the
public education system (specifically the Ministry o f Education and Higher Education),
and implementation o f a nationally agreed upon education sector strategy to achieve
better outcomes fiom the significant level o f spendingalready taking place.

Social Protection Action SuDDorted bv the FUDPL

The following actions are conditions for Boardpresentation which have beenmet:


0   Establishment o f an Inter-Ministerial Committee for Social Policy (IMCSP) supported
    by a functioning Technical Secretariat.
0   Technical discussions on a draft law reformingthe end-of-service indemnity and
    introducing the newfully-fundeddefined-contributions pension system completed by
    a specialized parliamentary committee.

                      VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

75.     The distributional impacts o f specific policies supported by the proposed
operation are expected to be modest. Indeed actions taken to date that the operation
supports would if anything improve the welfare of the population through more
employment generation through the improved business climate, better targeting o f social
services and improved service reliability from the grid connected electricity network
which in turn would lead to reduced reliance on more costly self-generation (reported to
be about twice the cost for residentialconsumers).

76.     The overall Paris I11 reform program, o f which the proposed operation is
supporting a sub-set, comprises a series o f reform measures which could have significant
distributional impact on consumers in Lebanon, ranging from the (i)       impact tax policy
reforms, including lifting o f the cap on the gasoline excise rate; (ii)     privatization o f
utilityservices, includinginthe first instance telecommunications and later electricity and
water; and (iii)  the curtailing o f expenditures through, inter alia, public wages through
closing of various funds and greater automation o f administrative procedures (which in
itself, on the other hand, may generate more jobs through an increase in business
establishments).

77.     The Bank plans to cany out a Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA)
starting in September, 2007 to assess the social and poverty impacts o f the key Paris I11
reform agenda, including the areas where the Bank has assumed leadership (business
environment, energy and social). Since the proposed operation has been redesigned as a
single-tranche operation focused mainly on institutional actions, it has not been deemed
requiredfor this first stage.

78.     As reforms deepen, the PSIA will review the distributional impacts o f potential
electricity pricing adjustments, social impacts o f labor retrenchment and include
stakeholder consultations. It is important to note, however, that any future price changes
may not impact the most vulnerable consumers since there i s a significant opportunity to
better target the subsidies and to restructure the tariff blocks with the current block
system being over-generous. On social retrenchment, the average age of staff inEdL i s
59 so many will naturally retire inthe next few years Secondly, as part o fthe Emergency
TA project under the LTF, the advisory support to restructure EdL includes design o f
retrenchment and severance pay schemes.

79.     The Bank's on-going support to the social sectors, as well as any future DPLs
including social sector support, will also review whether measures are needed from a
social perspective to enable successful restructuring o f EdL and to protect vulnerable
consumers from the impacts o f price adjustments. However, it i s important to keep in
mindthat there is a staffing need inEdL so ifanything there will be hiring of new skills,
expertise and talent to underpinthe needfor improved performance. The advisory service
under the Emergency TA project to assist with the restructuring of EdL includes in the


                                             31

scope o f work o f the consultants design o f EdL organizational structure and staffing
needs as a corporatized entity under commercial operation. The net staffing situation o f
EdL will therefore be better known once the consultants have delivered this part of the
work.   There have been extensive consultations throughout, including as part o f the
passing o f Law 462 which had unanimous support inParliament. Furthermore, duringthe
preparation o f the proposed DPL, consultation has continued with different political
groups. Broader consultations will take place as part o fthe PSIA.

80.     The social protection reforms, initiated under the proposed operation, and which
will be implementedover the next 12-15 months are expected to have immediate welfare
impact among the disadvantaged.       For instance, scaling up the Rights and Access
Program for the Disabled and focusing it on the poor disabled population will improve
welfare o f its beneficiaries. Service standards and accreditation o f service providers
within the MOSA Care Program should ensure better quality services.               Overall, an
effective public safety net which i s non-confessional based, a functioning public health
system, and expanded social insurance coverage can contribute to building social
cohesion. With weak and ineffective public institutions and support, the poor have hadto
rely on their respective confessional organizations for income support and other services.
An effective poverty alleviation program with the benefits coming from the state will
send a clear message that the Lebanese state is capable o f fulfilling its core functions, one
o f which i s supporting the poor. Furthermore, the social reforms will play a key role in
mitigating some o fthe macro-critical reforms.




                                            32

B.      ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT


81.     The operation, which is supporting specific reforms in business environment,
social protection and insurance as well as the energy sector, i s not likely to have any
significant effects on the environment, natural resources or forests. The reforms in the
business environment and social protectiodinsurance are o f administrative and
institutional nature, as are most of the reforms inthe energy sector. The actions to date
are examples o fthis and are based on existing infrastructure.

82.     In the energy sector, however, future reforms related to the overall reform
program will have impacts - positive15 through the increased use of natural gas over gas-
oil and, eventually also possibly, fuel-oil, but also potentially such that need proper
mitigation measures (e.g., infrastructure development arising from the introduction o f
natural gas to additional power plants beyond the Beddawi plant for which infrastructure
already exists and converting the Master Plan - which will include due consideration to
undertakinga sectoral environmentalassessment - and other administrative reforms taken
to date to implemented physical projects). The following mechanisms have therefore
been identified to monitor the potential environmental impact aspects o f the energy
sector:


0   The Bank will liaise closely with the Government to ensure that the Master Plan for
    the expansion o f the electricity sector will in general be aligned with the World
    B W M Fpolicy paper on "Clean Energy and Development: Towards an Investment
    Framework". The Program will therefore ensure that Lebanon's Master Plan takes
    the same global perspective covering three interlocking complementary issues: (i)
    investment requirements meeting modern energy needs for developing countries
    while providing attention to efficiency and local environmental considerations; (ii)
    additional steps needed inthe energy sector to address climate change mitigation; and
    (iii)the impactofclimatechangeandtheneedto adequately adapttochangesin
    climate and weather variability. It will also contain specific recommendations to
    reduce emissions o f local (PM, SOX, etc) and global (C02) air pollutants through
    adequate selection o f fuel and generation technologies;


0   Within the context of the on-going Emergency Power Sector Reform Capacity
    Reinforcement Project, feasibility assessments will be carried out for alternative gas
    solutions to access natural gas (pipelines andor LNGterminal) as well as completing
    transactions for natural gas supply. Procedures for evaluating the alternatives based
    on specific socio-economic criteria, including the economic, financial, energy
    security, environmental aspects will also be developed. Close attention i s given, in
    the scope ofthis emergency TA project andthe affiliated advisory services to EdL, to
    identifying and minimizing the adverse impacts o f the energy policies relative to an



l5These reformsare part o f Lebanon's commitmentto the Kyoto Protocol and designedto qualify under the
CleanDevelopmentMechanism.


                                                33

        energy strategy, review o f tariff structures and the overall restructuring of the sector;
        and


     0  On the institutional and legal framework, the capacity o f the Ministryo f Environment
        has substantially improved in the area of environmental management, and the
        environmental legislation applicable to the energy sector includes a Framework Law
        for Environmental Protection that has been enacted in 2002 (Law # 444). The Law
        requires the preparation o f an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for each
        project that i s likely to adversely affect the environment. An EIA decree has been
        preparedby the Ministry o f Environment, with assistance from the World Bank, but
        has not been enacted yet. However EIA procedures are already applied for major
        projects on the basis o f environmental guidelines that have been adopted through
        ministerial decisions. Law # 690 o f 2005, relative to the organization and mandate o f
        the Ministry of Environment, established the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
        Environment for approving or rejecting EIAs.
e
     0  Renewable energy has not been seriously addressed as an energy supply option,
        although Lebanon enjoys substantial solar, hydro and wind resources. With annual
        solar intensity around 1850-2000 KWh/m2, the utilization o f solar energy provides a
        suitable, clean, reliable, and cost-competitive energy source for many applications.
        One such application i s the domestic solar water heater, which still has relatively low
        usage inLebanon and i s currently being pursuedby private firms and by the Lebanese
        Center for Energy Conservation, which i s located at the Ministry o f Energy and
        Water.   The potential o f wind energy i s still untapped and the Government has
        recently contracted an international firm to prepare a wind atlas for the country to
        enable realistic assessment o f wind power contribution to the Lebanese electricity
        needs. Hydro power has beenutilized for many years and the potential for harnessing
        additional hydro resources i s promising though not fully assessed. Agence Franqaise
        du DCveloppement (AFD) has recently appointed a consultant to examine the
        potential o f installing additional hydro power plants in Lebanon.          Finally, the
        Government i s committed to reduce its green house gas emissions in line with the
        Kyoto Protocol that it has ratified inNovember 2006, and to encourage power sector
        projects that serve sustainable development in the environmental, economic and
        social sectors underthe Clean Development Mechanism.

     83.    The World Bank has also recently approved an Institutional Development Fund
     (IDF) to support the Ministries o f Justice and Environment in the enforcement o f
     environmental regulations. This 3 years program, that i s implementedinpartnershipwith
     UNDP, aims at improving the proper enforcement o f environmental regulations in
     Lebanon.

     C.     FIDUCIARY ASPECTS




                                                  34

84.      The Public Financial Management (PFM) system in Lebanon is in a transition
phase and the Government o f Lebanon continues to be committed to reformingthe PFM
system. Significant progresshastaken place inthe PFMsystem over the last few years.

85.      The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA16), which was
completed inMay 2005, concluded that the overall risk assessment o f the PFM system in
Lebanon i s significant. This overall risk assessmenttakes into account the recent reforms
to the PFM system, including the (i)          computerization o f the budget reporting system; (ii)
consolidation o f all treasury operations at the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) with plans to
move towards the use o f a Single Treasury Account, (iii)generation o f periodical
statistical reports; and (iv) issuance o f payments to public sector employees through
transfers to bank accounts to increase the control aspects o f the payment process.

86.      The CFAA report includes recommendations to decrease the overall fiduciary risk
from significant to moderate. The recommendations include: (i)              increasing the coverage
o f the budget to reflect capital investment financed by donors and extra budgetary
en ti tie^'^; (ii)establishing a modern internal audit function initially within the MOF; and
(iii)reformingtheCourtofAccountsthroughmakingitindependentoftheGovernment
with a focus on expressing an opinion on the fairness o f the Government's annual
financial statements and introducing performance audit functions to its operations, and
moving gradually from the current cash basis accounting system to the one using the
accrual principles.

87.      To implement the outstanding reform measures to the PFM system, the M O F has
appointed a Reform Team dedicatedto the monitoring o f the implementation o f the PFM
reform agenda. The team's assignment started after the Paris I11Donor Conference with
focus on the 2008 budget preparation process and better coordination o f the activities o f
the various agencies aimed at improving the budget allocation. This is being conducted
under a medium-term expenditure framework that provides ceilings on spending by
agencies. In accordance with the Government's reform program presented to the Donor
Conference, the revised budget preparation process initiated the introduction o f a "top
down" approach to budget preparation, extended the budget coverage to includetreasury
transfers and foreign financed capital projects'*.             Indeed, the 2008 budget circular
incorporated the medium term fiscal framework prepared by the Ministryo f Finance to
serve as a guideline for spendingagencies inpreparingtheir budget proposals, with strict
instructions to cut down spending and respect the global budget ceiling set for 2008.
Also the budget circular introduced the reforms planned by the Government for budget
preparation during the coming period, and the prerequisite actions to be taken by



l6Jointly carriedout bythe World Bankandthe IMFin2004 andfinalized inMay2005
  This is currently under implementationbasedon a draft Lawandthe BudgetCircular 2008 account for
these reforms.
l8To increasethe budgettransparency, andas perthe CFAA report recommendations,MOF included in
the 2006 budget, the transfersto the Electricitedu Liban(EdL) by creatinga newseparatebudget line.

spending agencies.          The Reform Team i s also in charge o f reforming cash flow
management.

88.      The recently signed EPCA with the IMF gives strong weight to the PFM reform
agenda through identifying three PFM reform outputs to be achieved by September
200719. Implementingthese reforms will lead to a comprehensive budgetthat includes all
capital projects, an improved control environment andmore transparent entities operating
outside o fthe Government.

89.      Inaddition to the PFM actions included inthe EPCA agreement, the MOF is in
process o f (i)   appointing an advisor with mandate to implement a modem internal audit
function at the MOF level, and (ii)      publishingthe overall PFMreform agendainthe MOF
web site. These two actions constitute PFMrelated conditions for the proposedDPL. The
first action i s already underway to be implemented (possibly through an internal
reassignment in the MOF) and the second only involves uploading an already existing
action plan. As a result, MoF's commitment to rapid and successful implementation o f
the PFM reform agenda will be made public. Periodic reports on achievement will be
shared as the reform agenda progresses and planned actions are implemented.20 In
practical terms, reporting on the progress o f the PFM actions supported under this
operation, means keeping an up-to-date web page that allows for the public to be
informed o f progress. The report posted on the web-site will be presentedinthe format
covering the short, medium and long term.

90.      The reforms are supported by a detailed time bound action plan, presentedat the
Paris I11conference. This planwill be usedas the benchmark for monitoring progress o f
the reforms that will lead to stronger financial accountability and better transparency in
the use o f public funds. Progress inthese areas could lead to a reduced fiduciary risk to
"moderate" level inthe horizon o f2008-2009.

D.       DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITINGARRANGEMENTS


91.      The amount will be disbursed in one tranche comprising the full amount o f the
loan, against satisfactory completion of the agreed upon actions and declared
effectiveness o fthe Loan.

92.      The loan disbursement would follow the standardBank procedures for DPLs. The
Borrower has a treasury account (number 36) usedto finance general budget expenditures
at the Central Bank o f Lebanon (BDL). The proposed operation's loan amount would be
disbursed into this treasury account.          The Government has determined that the net
proceeds from the Loan will be utilized for the replacement or refinancing o f existing

E.      RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION

93.     The ISN includes a comprehensive description o f the risks and mitigation
measures for the proposed transition assistance strategy to Lebanon. The specific risks
outlined below for the proposed operation should be read and considered inclose reading
withthose inthe ISN.

(i). Asdescribedinthisdocument,amajorriskisthatthereformprogramisslowto
implement or slips altogether. This would be very costly for Lebanon and could result in
a further deterioration o fthe debt to GDP ratio (reaching over 200% according to the debt
sustainability analysis undertaken as part o f the ESIA). This could result in waning
external support and expose Lebanonto the risk o f financial disruption.

(ii).Arelatedriskto(i) isthebroaderriskrelatedtoLebanon'screditworthiness
                              above
as the outlook in Lebanon i s susceptible to deep macroeconomic and financial risks due
to the large size o f the fiscal imbalance and the spiraling public debt dynamics. Lebanon
has beenable to finance itself so far by issuingbonds which have been absorbed in large
part by the Lebanese banking sector. Lebanon's continued solvency is therefore highly
dependent on investors' and domestic banks' capacity and willingness to continue to
finance fiscal deficits and hold the debt, and hence on depositors' and investors'
confidence inthe sustainability o fthis financing scheme.

(iii) The most pressing risk associated to the proposed operation is continued
Government commitment/momentum to the implementation o f the energy sector reforms
and the durability of the political consensus on the reforms themselves. The risk is that
commitment and momentum will disappear once reforms start to affect vested interests or
to impose costs on different communities unequally. This risk i s to some extent mitigated
by the willingness expressed by all parties to maintain the consensus on energy sector

'' Inaccordancewith Law476, datedDecember 12,2002 andpublishedinthe Official Gazetteno. 67
datedDecember 14,2002.


                                             37

reforms which led to the adoption o f Law 462 with the support o f all major political
groups, but significant risk remains that consensus andor momentum for implementation
collapses.

(iv)    There is also significant risk to EdL's already stressed capacity to operate from the
impact o f the restructuring and the diversion o f the already stretched staff. This risk i s
somewhat mitigated by the injection o f expertise under the Emergency Power Sector
Reform Capacity Reinforcement Project, but risk will remain - and will need to be
properly managed - that scarce experienced EdL staff are diverted from ensuring
continued operationo fthe power systemto designing and implementing the restructuring
activities.

(v)     Finally, there i s the risk o f continued political stalemate inLebanon and the recent
deterioration in the security situation.        The latter is closely related to the overall
increasing instability insecurity across the region.

F.      SUPERVISION

94.     The Ministry o f Finance (MOF) will be the primary entity responsible for overall
implementation o f the proposed operation and for reporting progress and coordinating
actions among other concerned agencies (including the Inter-Ministerial Reform
Committee). The overall status o f the Government's program will be monitored during
supervision, including taking any corrective actions to ensure the reforms program stays
on track. Three annual supervision missions are anticipated.            This operation will be

                                               Preface

In April 2UU5, Lebanon reclaimed its democracy arid independencethrough a popular uprising
Mggered by the assassination of lare prime Minister Rafic Sarin. The infernational commmiot
ral!zed in support of Lebanon and, OTI the occasion of the Core Group meenng in New York in
September ZUUS, vowed to sipport the new government and help Lebanon reduce its debt to
sustainablehe?sso it can achievegrowth, eqiap,andpolitical stabzlity.

Follow$ng that meeting the Governmentprepared a comprehmiw refom program that was to be
presented to a Donors Confeeme in Beirut with a requestfor international support to complement
the signijcant domestzcefort that was envisagedin thrsprogram. Following extensive comultatiom
with domestic and mternational stakeholders, the government was on the verge of adopting this
program whenLebanon onceagaincame under a massmeIsraeli attack

The direct and indzmct costs of the July 2006 war far exceed the capacity of arty middle-income
counq to bear; let alonea c o m e that has been saddled with a very largepublic debtand a country
that hadjust comeout of a mqor setbackassociated 3vith theassassinationofPnme Minister Hann,
which has left deep scars on the economic and polincal Iana!wape. As a result> the burden of
Lebanon`spublic debt-laigely a l q a q of the 1975-92 war and its ajhmath-has become even
hmier.

while the July war and its dsvastattng consequences have shijted the government's short ?em
attenRon to immediate major relref eforts and reconstructzonneeds, the gmwnntent remaniaf;Ny
committed to pursue economic re$oms, although some changes to the hmetable and to the m e of
adjlistmenntare needed. lhesechangesare necessary to t a h intoaccount theimpct of the war on the
macroeconomic smiatzon, and to spread the btirden of refom over time so as to give the sufenng
populationa breathrngspacefollowng thzsyear's tragic events.

By theendof 2006, Lebanon'sdebt wdl be around US4Q.5billion, or about 180%of GDP. Despite
its resiliency. Lebanon cannot shoirtder this pnce on its own. The re-phasing of some measures
necesntated by thelatest ismeii war imllfad to achrew growth, eqfiip>and debtmtamabilih, m the
absence of sizeable external support, Failure to achieve these objectrves could well jeopardize
Lebanon's broader goals of politzcal and social stabilipa and the styengthening of its democraq.
Lebanon is therefore hopejii that on the occasion of the "Intmational Conference for Support to
Lebanon': the internationalcommunity w d invwr inLebanon'sfuture and democracy.

TheLebanesepeople aredeterminedto burid a strong state: a state which can reclaim theposihon of
Lebanon   lls a haven of moderationwhere individual initiative nnd potenrial canbefuljlled. In o w
part of the world, Lebanon represents indeed a unique phenomenon of diversrt;v, multi-
confessiomalzsm, democracy, andReedom of e.rpression. We will strive to presenie and keep these
ideals alive, but ourfiends' help is critical. We strong& believe that what happens in Lebanon d l
have repercwsions that transcendLebanon's borders andfai- exceedLebanon$ size. Our success zn
strengtheningour democracyand building a shong economy is in theinterest of all.

                                           1. BACKGROUND

5.       In mid-1970s. Lebanon was a democratic uppermiddle income country prosperhg as a
regional service center on tlie crorsrods between Etmpe and the Middle East. Lebanon barely had
any debt, reflectingpnldent economic mrtnagenient md an economy that was driven mainly by a
dynamic private sector and suppofied by a small size puiblic sector. But Lebanon was also at the
crossroads of international potitics and regional conflicts, which have contributed to the outbreak of
the war in 1975. Seventeen years o f i n t d strife caused massive destmction. Thr UN estimated
damage to physical assets at US%ZSbillion, equivalent to about six to seven times the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in1990.

6.       Prior to &e outbreak of the c i d war in 1975, Lebanon had a liberal,. opefl, and dynamic
economy ledby a donkant andvibrant private sector. The fift~enyears of hostihhes. however, hada
debilitating effect on the private sector which stxuggkd to regain its previous role a5 an engine for
growth in providing employment and basic services. Given this fact, and the enormous need for
&ysical reconstnlction coupled with an inabiliy to raise sufficient revenues, the public sector

resortedto boimwing to reverse the impact ofhostilitiesandprovide the basic platformfor the piivate
sector to regain its previous role. This led to a change inthe basic nature of the kbntlese economy
that saw a rise inthe role andthe size o fthe public sector.

7.        In the early 199Os, the government undertook the task of reconstmction of public
iufrastructwe, andof investing insocial peace. including incoipomting the war militia, wd providing
for resettlement and social assi&ince to the displace& Also, the govment had to deal with &e
social consequences of the continued Israeli occupation of the South notwithstanding the recmring
Israeli aggressions that necessitatedadditionaloutlays for reconstruction andspecial allocations to&e
Council of the South. With an eroded revenue base and limited access to extmial financing, the
government d i e dk a v i l y onborrowingdomestically to f i c e sharply risingbudget deficits. Given
the mag&tude of desbuctbn, the g o v m e n t had to provide all basic services including edticlitbn.
heaith, waterz and electricity. While there was significant international support for rcconstniction,
p r k i l y inthe form of coiicessiaual loans, 0 ~ e 1 dmore than two-tllirds of all capital expenditures
duringthe 1990swere undedbymarket borrowkg at highinterestrates. Totalpublic sector interest
paymentswere double the size o fcapitalexpenditures duringthe 1990s.

8.        By 2000, when south Lebanon was liberated, except for Shebaa fanus, essential
rrconstruction was substaddly completed. and real per capita income had more than doubled from
the 1990 level, but still stood a quarter below its pre-war level. However, with ballooning interest
paynients(absorbing over three-quarters o frevenues), the ovaall &cal deficit reachednearly25% of
GDP in2000. Gross public debt, which a decade earlier stood at about US32 billion, had p w nto
US$2S billion,equivalent to 150% ofGDP, andthe economy was stagnating.

9.        Against the backpound of a vicious cycle of risingfiscal deficits and debt and a stagnating
economy, the government o f late Prime Mnister Hariri &at came bask to office in late 2000
developed an economic reform program, fm which it sought e x t d support in the context of the
Paris IIMeeting in2002. On that occasioq the internationalcommunity provided WS$2.4 billion in
direct financial support @on-project financing)'. This. combined with a financial contribution &.om
Lebanon's f m c i a l sector (Banque du Liban and colnmercial banks2), a d the effects that the
extrtnaf support had had on confidence in financial markets, resulted in a significant decline in
interest rates.

10.      The financial package helped ;nprovt substantidy the scr~ctutrof the public debt and
sharply reducedits cost. As result, inkrest payments on the debt fell sharply from 17% of GDPin
                               R
2002 io about 10%of GDP in2005. In2004, xnacmeconomic performce exceeded all expectation
with real growthreaching more t b i 7%. the overall budget deficit decliningto less than 8% o f GDP
(&om 25% in ZOOO), and the prinmy budget suxpius improving to 2.3% of GDP. The fiscal
adjwtment benefited considerably h m the introduction o f a Value Added Tax (VAT) in 2002.
However, political squabbling prevented the fidl implememtionof the: st~ucturalconzpwfilts of the
propnq mainly privatization. aad hence the fidl benefias of Paris IIcould not be realized. As a
consequence, by end-2004, the level ofgross public debt reached 165%o f GDPand 175%of GDPby
ad-2005.

                       A. The ReformProgram Prior to the Israeli July War

13.      The Siniora government prepared a comprehensive reform program tbt was about to be
adopted before the July war. At that h e , Lebanon's prospects were looking good. Signs of an
excellent tourist season were vesy strong-flights         to B e k t for the summer were oves booked-
foreign direct investment was onthe rise, lwge private capital inflows had increased liquidityinthe
banking sector and helped the central bank build a comfortable intcmationalrcsemes position, and
some early s i p Of a possible "brain dr&"reversalwere onthehorizon.

14.      Although the main elements of the refom programwere pnrt of the government's statwent
to par%mentitlJuly 2005, the Uovnnment decided to first seek broad national consensus on this
programbefore holdingthe Beirut Conference. This was inorder to ensure o;vnership of the refom
propain andtherefore its implementation, and to avoid the situation that had arisen after the Paris LI
Meeting when the govument was mable to implement the full m g e o f reforms (namely
privatization). Given the nature, the nlag&ude and the scope o f the refoim measuses of the actious
that iwse envisaged, more time than had originally been anticipated was needed to complete the
consensusbuildingprocess, which was also complicated by soine political tensions early inthe year.
Theprocesswas seacling its f dstages when thewar took place hiJuly 2006.

1.4.     Tlie ineditnu-tenn s c d o under the pse-war programenvimged an avemge redGDP growth
o f about 5%. strong fiscal adjustment with an inqmv-ementinthe primarysaylus by about 6%points
of GDP &ring the years 2006-10,                  and privatkatiori going forward,          partb&irly    the
telecouutlunications sector. Yet. it showed that without external support, the debt to GDPratio would
decline from 175% at end-2005 to about 135% by 2010. But with interest payments Sei11absorbkg
about 50% o f government revenues. Thk level of debt would not be sustainable over the long sun. It
was therefore hoped that with sufficient external support inthe fonn ofgrants andconcessional loans,
and a financial contribution from the domestic fuancial sector, the ratio of debt to GDP could be
brought donrnto a levelthat couldbe sustainedinthe longrun.

16.      The current governmenthas embarkedon a seiies o f s e f m since it took office inJuly 2005.
These included gro\vth, privatization, public finance and debt management and fimncid and capital
market r e f m measures. The pwth-enhancing structural refoims have coveird competition
regulation,c o i w e r protection, S M E s q p x ? , intellectualproperty rights and trade facilitation. The
govemmeut has proceeded steadily with privatization, after appointing a Secretary General for the

                                 B. The Impact ofthe JulyIsraeli\Vat-

17.      Attacks by land, sea aud&resulted intm&c loss ofhumanlife. large-scale displacementand
massive damage to privateandpublic idrastructwe, and a complete dislocation of the economy. The
blockade that continued for a month &er the cessation o f hostilities fkrther & e p e d the negative
impact on the economy. By the time of cessation of hostilities, nearly 1,200 people had died as a
dkect result of the attacks, of which nearly one-third were children, and about 4,400 were injured.
About aquarterofkbanon's populationwas displacedh i n gthe war, aridabout 500,000 peoplesaw
their hauses &strayed or damaged'.           There were additional deaths and dozens o f injured by
unexploded ordinances (UXOs) afier the war ended as          R consequence of the estimated 1.2 nillion
cluster bombs that were fired intoLebanon during the h l days o f hostilities`.       Manyprofessionals
andentrepreneurs left the counhy, amongthempersonsthat hadretumedto Lebanon after the endo f
the 1975-1992 war, andabout 30,000, many of themyouth, lost employment.

18.      The economic impact of the conflict i s substantial inthe short term andis likely to constrain
Lebanon well beyond2006given the time it will take for the ecmomy to recover fromthis sigtuFrcant
setback. Based on assessments can-ied          out by independent consultants retaked by the hime
Minister's office, the total diwct cost of early recovery and reconstruction i s now estimated at
aroundUS$2.8 billion. The cost of reconstructionincludcr the cost of rebiiildhig andrepairingprivate
andpublic infiastnicture, replacing lost assets, andcompensatingfor private homing, whichis byfar
the largest component o f the losses.

19.      Tbe indirect impact of the war is much more significant. Real GDP growth, which was
estimatedat 5-6% during the fvst halfof 2006, (wcordbg to INSEE'. the growthduringthe frrrthalf
o f the year might have been even higher hi7%), is likely to end the year at a negative 5%, This
representsa loss in outpat andincomefor 2006 inthe order of USS2.2 billion (at 2005 prices). The
Ioss inoutpnt iuthe niedlumterm (as compnsed to the level5 that were envisaged) is z1 niultiple o fthis
amount.

20.      The k a c t o fthe July war onthe fiscal situation i s severe. Due to the strong performance o f
the first halfof 2006, the primary silrplus was expected at 3% o f GDP for 2006, but is now expected
to shift to a deficit of 0.4% of GDP6(US390 million) der four consecutive years o f surpluses. The
overallfiscal deficit could reach 14% of GDP due to a revenue loss of around US$lSO million (the
magnitude ofthe loss wouldhavebeenmuchmore severe hadthe US8537 nlillionof grants7notbeen
received). and to about U S 7 4 0 million increase in conflict-related expenditures .(infltides
expenditures financed by grants that have been pledged). On this ba5ii. total gross public debt i s
expected to reach WS840.5 billion by the end of 2006-eqUiVnlent to 180% of estimated post war
2006CtDP'.

Indeed, 65% of the public debt outstanding prior to the July 2006 war matures dining 2007-10, in
addition to most of the new borrowingduring and subsequent to the July 2006 Israeli war in the
remainder of 2006. Close to WS$16 billiono f the debt outstandingas of mid-2006 matures in2007
and 2005 alone. As a consequenceo fthe war, andwith the prospect of larger financing needs of the
povenunent spreads on Lebanese foreigi wrency debt have risen. This will hther aggravate the
future fiscal situation as a direct consequenceofthe war.

 C. The Cost of the JnlyIsraeli War andInternational Supportfor Reco17ery& Reconstiwtiou

Uifrrtst~~~cture, housing con~pasations,that are to be covered by the CentralGovernment budget
                and
i s now estimatedat about USSl.75 billion. This excludes the private sector's and NGO's contribution
to the reconstruction efforts, the compensationfor destroyedprivateproperties other thanhousingand
the financingpropax that aimfor revivingprivatesector activity.

23.      The international co&iy        reactedquickly and generouslyto support Lebanon. Inaddition
tothe depositso fUS$ 1billionb mSaudiArabia andUS$500 millionfromKuwaitwithBdLto help
maintain coilfidcnce and monetary stability, &e international community pledged generously to
support reconstruction and relief efforts. On August 31, 2006, the Swedish government hosted a
Conferenc~for Lebnn0n"sEarly Recovery in Stockholm. At that Conference, Lebanon received
indications of support amoxmtiap to about US$QOOmillion for Humatlitwian assistance needs and
early recovery efforts. 'This financial supportprolided the conditions for the returnof the qia~tero f

lowest possible cost, whereby checks are issued in hvor of the beneficiaries as det&ied         by the
concerned government agencies and after a thomugh audit couducted by an independent consulting
engineel.ingfirm.

26.        Inorder to inp-ove aidcoordinationandharruonization,andthe allocation o fdonor support
to priority projects and progmns, the government is putting in place a unified systm o f data
collection and reporting. A Drveiopnient Assistance Database is being established at the F'rinie
Minister OEce (PMO), with supp0t.t: from UNDP, while the Miuistry o f Finance (Mol?) is

established B donor coordinationsecretariat to siipport impfernentation andmaintenanceof the system.

27.        InView of the substantial damage inflicted on the privatesector {mainly apicultwx and
tourism), the government will provide some financial assistance as well as nipport through loan

Evcnwiththe implementationofthe government'sreformp r o mincludingprivatization andstrong
fiscal adjustment, fiscal deficits would, without external supportt far exceed the fiscal deficits that
were envisaged inthe pre-war reform scenario. Not only has the public debt to GDP rntio risen, but
Lebanonnowalso faces higher fiscal deficits. The cumulativeincrementalfiscal deficit for the pmod
2006-10 is estimated at US$5.9billion, inclusive of the cost of recovrry and reconstnrction'     . The
inipact is mitigated somewhat by the pledgedgrants andloans for reconstruction, but incretnwtalnet

the need for external support to achieve a sustaitlabh debt scenario ltas now risen hrther, and the

social and political u r n s t .On the expcsnditue side, following the Israeli war, it has become very
difficult to reduce the ratio of current expenditures to GDP in the short term given the increase in
security and socia1expenditures aimed at ensuringthe deIivety of basic public semices inall rqions
mid at compensating the war injureda d fhilies ofdeceased.

31.      Similarly. unfavorable ruarket conditions. andor lower asset value, will delay the
privatization plans (sale of assets) for some h e , althoughthe sale o f the two mobile licensesshould
proceedshortly. Also, the preparatory process of restructuring and eoipomtbtion and establishing

32.      On&e other hand, social sectorreforms andstrengthening social safety nets becomea critical
element of a strategy aimed at ensuring the prevalence of the State over dl the Lebaneseterritory. to
the benefit ofall denominational grroups. A comprehensive approach to recovery andreconstruction is
aneqrrally Inyortmt element ofthis strategy. Public sectorreforms are keyto improvingthe business

34.     Lebmon has Wen short of achieving its full potetitial because o f political tensions,

resources, well-educated workforce, h g e Diaspora, well developed banking sector, and am-active
climate andgeogmphy, Lebanonshouldbe able to achieve better economic performance anda higher
standardofliving.

35.     The overriding objective of the refompmgrani is to stirnulate pwth, Create employnient,
reduce poverty, and niaintiiin social andpolitical stability. More specifically, the aim o f the reform
progsam is to raise the real p w t h rate to at least 44% over the next five years, improve social
indicators, and reduce regional inequalities. Since the tllain source of economic vulnerability in
Lebanon i s related to the large public debt, placing this debt on a downward trajectory towards

(discussed below) are all imporZant for grou&, other elements of the structural reform and growth-

related to c ~ m p t i o n )the
                              ~ business en%-ironnient,  trade liberalization, capital nmkets development,
anddebt management.

Governance

38.        Oood govaance is a prerequisite for investnlent and growth. Aeknowledpiup; &at
governance shoidd begin with the public service, the OEce of the Minister of State for
Adnlinismtive Reform (OMSAR) has preparedan a e s t r a t i v e reform strategy that foeuses on the
core functions of a modernstate. The strategy articulates several objectives that cut across all parts o f
govcmruent andaim at creating a transparent. accountable andeffective public administration. These
objectives aim to: (i)     develop andestablish modemmanagementcapacity inkey administrations such
as the central control andoversight agencies; (ii) the size andcost of the public adutiuismtion
                                                       reduce
through streamlining its overall organizational structurt and hctions; (iii)           mohuize legislation
especially that regated to pubtic procurenlent and accounting; and (iv) promote a citlzen-oriented
administration through simplification of procedures and advancing e-Governnient. Many of these
measureshave started a while ago andwill continue overthe mediumterm.

39.        Inview ofitsstatedobjectiveof_geateraccountability andbettergovanisice, the government
approved and sent to parliament a draft iaw aimed at hiringan i n t m i o u a l and reputable fitm(s) to
audit public b c e s andpublic entaprises over the last fiftccnyears (1930-2005). It is expected t h t
the selection o f the frrm(s) will take place after the adoption o f this law by parliammt andwork will
begin w r i after. Since the risk of comption is perceived to be prevalent mainly in large
f i s t m c t u r e projectsaudpublic procurement more generally. the governmentintends to expedite &e
coznpktion o f the new procurement law with the related decrees and implmentation tools to be
effectively deployedbymid-2007. This law will provide for a more efficient use ofpublic &ids        while

law dates back to the early 1960s. Ona parallel andrelated track, establishkg a regulatory body for
maintaining, monitoring andupdatingthe public pmcwwnent system will also be on the agenda. In
addition, the role of the Court o f Accortnts as an ex-post agency will be rer.lvtdto emwe that all
budgetary spending is in accordance with budgetary allocations. Fighting corruption also izquires
ernpowering state watchdog institutions to take punitive actions and enforcing conflict-0f-interest
                                                                                                '
regulatiorti against saiior public offcials.

40.      The government intends to addxess governanceissues at the agency levelina pragmatic way.
Given the difficulties in resolving these issues all at once. a few pilot agencies will br selected for
close scrutiny. A successful reformin one public agency with early tangible results would stren,&en
the constituency for reform, and pro.ri& useful l e v a to sway public and official opinion. Inthis
regard, the govenunent haf decided to start with two important ministries, the ministry o f public
works and the ministry of finance. T o intsnal control units will be estabiished to monitor the
operationsofthe various departments inthe two ministries to ensure that they follow best practice in
sewice delivery andto deal with corruptionmcidents. Theseunits shouldbe opemtionalby end-2007.
TlGs pilot progmncouldbe extmded to otherpublic entities in2008-10.

41.      More generally, the goverumentwill conhue to streandhe aud automate work procedures to
reduce the citizen interface with public sector employees and reduce the risk o f comyition. Several
initiatives have already beexi taken iU this regard at the Ievel o f the ministry of finance where
informationandprocedures have beenautomated for s o w departmentssuch as the cadastre, custom
and taxation. The reforni of budget preparation and implenxntatioq and the elimination of all
nuisance taxes will help fight corruption. These initiatiyes will be extended to other ministries and
public agenciesover &e next few years.

42.      n e recent decision by the govenuuent to have transparent. merit-based, and proper
proceduresfur public sector recnhnent is avery important step inisolatingrecmitmcnt &ompolitical
and conf~sionalconsiderations. \ W e the equal confessiod distribution of top public sector
positim, as determined by the constitution, cannot be changed at this time, every effort will be made
to hire the most qualified and to do away with the practice o f assigning specific positions to specific
confessionsas Io- as the power s h k g arrangement is respected Inthis regard, the role o f the Civil
Service Board will be &iced        and proper and trmsparent assessment mechi3nisms will be put in
p h cto improve selection.

Financial&tor     Reform andDebt Mallagement

43.      The government plans to address the lung-standing iswe of underdeveloped capital markets
as part of a broader strategy to rnodcmize the non-bank financial sector and stimulate investment and
p~vth.   Apart from its ,wd-enhmcing        effects, capital markets development wo~ddhelp diversify
risk and increase financial resilience in the face o f shocks. The role o f the stock market is also
instrumental inthe coming periodas it will facilitate the corporatizition and privatization&ye.   help
attract long-term financing mainly &om the region--especially at             o f high oil pices--and
provide the private sector with working capital. Similarly. the development of a secondary marketfor
fixed-income instruments shouldcmihibute to fmncial deepening.

44.      Several measurer have already been taken to enhance the functioning of Beirut Stock

and regulatory reforms is to improve competitiveness and reduce the cost of doing business in
Lebanon. A numberof these laws fulfill the government's commitments as part of its ruembesshipin
the World Trade Usgmimtion, which is expected bythe end of2007. Utherinitiatives are part of the

inclildc (i)    ratifying a mottern competition law and removing state protection including exclusive
agency rights, which would reducemonopolypower and prices by 2007: (ii)             adopting ane-cornmerce

50.       To encourage the recovery of the private sector in the &mth of the Israeli war, the
government i s undertaking a series of specific measures and incentives at the tax, regulatory,
finaucing, andp m o t i o d levels. The gouemuenthas laid out a comprehensiveplanfor recovery of
the prii;ste sector that is based on three mainp i h : (a) a basket of tax incentives developed by the

                                        3, Social Sector Reforms

52.     The economic reform progam would be incomplete ifnot accompanied by a comprehensive
social sefonu program. As a result, the g o v m e n t has developed a social action planas an integral
part of its fiscal and economic refom program. Social sectof r e f o m is beneficid fos promoting
sustainableand equitable development andcombating poverty, andhence achieving the govemenf's
commitment to the "Millcnnluni Development Goals". Such reform is csucial for long-term
sustainablecconornic pth.The mainobjectives o fthe social action planare to: (i)alleviate povaty
andinrprovethe quality ofeducationandhealth indicators: (ii) the efficiency ofpublic social
                                                                improve
spending aid keep it at an appropriate and sustainable level: and (iii) regional dispm4ties in

development indicators thougha properdistribution of investment and other resourcesandencoupage
investment and othmjob-creating activities inthe more deprivedareas.

53.     Social indicators are not c o n m e m t e with the level of spending, which is comparable to
that indeveloped countries. In2004. social spending (public andprivate) amounted to 21% o f GDP
(excluding pension). In2005, public spading on social services accounted for appmxbnately 42% of
p&ny expenditurest 27% of total expenditwe and 8% o fGDP. Despite this relatively high rocd
spending (on healthand education). indicatorsranaiatm&isfactosy.     Inthe educationsector, the drop
out andrepetitionrateswe relatively high, hovekg around 22% and23%, respectively. Inthe health
sector, infant and maternal mortality were 18.6 per thousand and 88 per one hmdred thousand
(Paphn. 20041, respectively.

54.     The iticidence of poverty in Lebanon might appear limited and controllable, since although
25% ofthe population Eves inrelative hardship. only4% live inexireme hardship(Living Conditions
Index, 2004). However, there are large regional disparities inpoverty incidence and intensity inthe
country. Available statistics show that pesipherd regions suffkr fim high rates of exwerne poverty
(reaching 11%inNo& and So& Lebanon, cotupwed to 1% inBeirut and some regions of Monnt
Lebanon). Data also reveal that densely popdated urban areas, such as t h Northernand Southem
                                                                              ~
Suburbs ofBeinat, Tripoli, SJda andBaalbeck. havethe largest concentrations of the poor.

55.     Living conditions improved cousiderably between 1995 and 2004 (Compasative Living
Conditions Index), with a decrease inthe percentage o f the deprived population &om 34% in 1995 to
24.5% in2004. This progsessi s attributable to iruprc~vements the social.

56.     The governmentis committed io ituprovkg bo& the efficiency andthe targeting of its social
sector expmditures and had already started to address thir, issue ina comprehensive mannerprior to
the July 2006 war. Steps were initiatedto reinforce the role of the Ministryof Social A f f a k (MOM)
insocialpolicy makingand development. The war ha5 slightly delayed the iniplementation of the
reform agenda and has si@cantly            exacerbated income-poverty, increased social needs, and.
expanded the incidence of poverty and tdnerability to otiier pups. Beside3 the loss of rife and
human capital (injuries,      disabilities, adverse schmling effects and ellliption).         increased
unempIoyrnent has contributed to an increase in poverty andtwlnerability. Although the Israeli war
has affected all regions and all population groups, the poor andculnerable remain mow suceptible
andlesscapable ofcopingwiththe adverseimpactofthe war.

Also, gradual measures to rationalize sector expenditure will be implemented following the
conipletionof school mappingand ateacherrationalization study. Thesereformswillbeunderpinned

specific swirlintefventians

63.        The government intends to reduce poverty by inrprOt-ing a number of existing p r o p n s and
introducingiiew propunswithinthe framework oftheMuistryof SocialAffairs. The most important
programs are cash transfers to poor senior citizens, fanale-headed poor households, and disabled
poor. Beneficiaries of these programs will be identified bawd on transparent eligibility criteria
establishedaccording to povertytargeting imps.

64.        The government will ako work on reducing regional disparities through promoting local
d e v e l o p m ~as an efficient tool for balanced regiond development and poveriy reduction. This
inctudes increasing capacitiesof the Social Development CentersofMoSA andcreatingcoordination
and synergy among key local development actors (e.g. MoSA, Economic and Social Fund for
Dewlopmeat, Community Development P r o p m e , UNDP, international donors and organizations,
and active NGOs).

65.        The govmnent will develop programs to improve education indicators, particularly to
reduce student drop-out andrepetitionratesinpublic schools inpoor regions. These programs aim at
reducingthe burdenofthe education cost onthe poor householdsintargetedareas throughsubsidies
to sciiooi related expenses (books, stationery, transportationand sdiool feeding), on condition that
these students remain in school until the end o f the conpilsoty educational stage {age 14). The
pylinistry of Education will also establish remediation centers to help poor students and provide
technical training invarious sp+cializrd disciplines. Poor households will be also exempted either
pastially   01fully, ofpublic school registration fees.

66.       The goveinmat k also committed to improving health indicators. The Ministry o f Public
Health will introduce a number o f health programs, such as increasing the number of vouchers
provided to poor pregnant women for clinic visits before and after giving birth. In addition, needy
patients will be totally exempted fiwm hospitalization fees and a ~ouchersystem will be established
for poor patients with chrotiic diseases. The ministry of public health will also cooperate with the
ministry o f education to erJlance the school healthpi.o-pn~,by raising the number o f MDvisits to
schools andexpanding the pvpmito basic education.

                                          C. PensionReform

67.       The reform ofthe p i o nsystem inLebanoni s apriority becauseof its social, economic, and
&d impact. The social aspectofpensionreformrelatesto equity considerationsmdto the needto
protect the pooror those who do nothave the meansto save sufficiently for retirement. The fiscal cost
ofthe pensionschemes inLebanonisvery highbyregionaland intenmtionalstandards andislikelyto
increase sharply ova the medium and long term if not addressed m.The private sector end-of-
service indemnity scheme does not provide adequate income protectionduringold age yet imposes a
h e a y burdenon employasanddocs not facilitate switching betweenjobs. As a result, itreduces the
incentive for hiring and k t r o d ~ ~ more
                                        ~ t s rigidity in the labor market with negative impact on
employment and growth.

68.       The twopublic sector defined benefit schemes, the civil midmilitarysystems, impose a heavy
burdenonthe budget(2.5% of GDP in2004) with an implicit debt of close to 60%of GDP (defined
as the present value of the pcmionpromisesfor currttlt retirees and current contributors). The private
sector system, which is managed by the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) while h c i a l l y
viable for another 15 years or so, couldhavemajorcontingent liabilities onthe budget.

69.       With technical assistance from the World Bank. the governmentwill ovahauithe pcnsion
system and to this end it is preparing a draft law to be submitted to parliament. The objective o f the
refoim is to integrate the three systems into one modern fully-funded defined contribution (PF-DC)

70.     Fiscal adjnstment i s essential to put debt on a doumvard trend. The govenment will
undestake strong and sustained fiscal adjustment efforts b e g k i n g in2007 (implementation of some
refom nieastves is expected during2007) to gradualiy improve the primarybalance, from a deficit o f
nearly 1%o f ODPin2006to a surplusof 8% ofGDPin2010 so as to reverse the debt dymnics and
phcr the debt-to-CDP ratio ona dournward path. Fiscal adjustmeat has to be shsed equitably to be
sustauied and every effort will be made to minimize the impact of fiscal adjustment on the poorer
segment of the population. It will =quire both stmip expditure and IZV~UC measuses and an
improvement inthe budgetpreparation.

ExpenditureMeasuivs

71.     The government has generally followed a tight expenditure policy in recent years aud will
c o n h e to ratioriaalizccumnt spending. Cusrcntexpendituses. excluding interest payments, at 17.8%
ofGDP(in2005) are not highby international standards andthus there is notmuchroomfor cutting
them further beyondthe pressing need to reduce waste and increaseefftxtivenas andprodiurrivity of
spending. The government fully re+ognizes that irnprokkgpublic manapen: is crucial to enhance
efficiency ofandreduce waste inpublic expenditures. Addressing these issues upfiont is impoitmt to
ixnpsove the businessenvironment and foster p;vth. The key areas for expenditurercforul include
ratiodizing non-interest expenditures, containing the wage bill, and refomkg public sector
efitqiises, especially

Prirnnrj,I.xysndiri;rres

72.     The govcmnrtlt intends to rationalize cutfenf expenditures through various measures and
refoims including(i)     reviewingthe salary andbenefit s~ructuseinsome public entities inparticular,
and the sahries o f cutrent andprevious mmbess of parhnent as well as mhisters. inadditionto
allocations to the Presidency of the Republic and the Presidency o f the Council of Ministers; (ii)
reducing to a minimum official travel expenses and revisiting travel allocations: (iii)        saving OII
transportation d o w a n c s through extendingthe working hours inthepnblic sector Erointhe 32 hours
a week to at least 36 hours by mid-2007: (iv) reducing waste related to gasohe consumption and
comnunication costs inthe public sector: and (v) closing the Fwd for the Displaced and the Council
o f the South-which are expected to W i their intended mission by 2008. While the financial
impact of these measures could be limited to about 0.2% of GDP, their impact on the overall
efficiency ofgovnnment opeiatim should not be tltlderwtimatcd.

73.     The govenment will contain the wage bill in the medium tam through limited hiring and
productivity increase and through automation and promotion o f e- government. allowing the size o f
the public srctos to shrink by attsition. However, with respect to military and security staff, there will
be an incrcase in the short run to meet security needs and to honor Lebanon's obligations in the
context of the UNresolution 1701. Over the next fiveyem, 20 %ofpublic sector employees would
retire (and 45% in the next 10 yeruu) providing a good opportunity to rejuvenate &e public sector
while at the same time reducing its size and enhancing its efficiency without having to force any
employee out- Replacing only partially those who are retiring in the next five yea= would lead to
knportmtsavings. Itis expectedthat the wagebillto GDPwouldbereducedby2.0% by2011.

74.     Inthis context, overstaffinginvasiousinkhies andinsomepublic entities thatarenolonger

have an abundance o f teachers, reflecting a mal-distribution o f schools among regions. Excess
employees in the public sector in general will be ideniified {lOOS-ZOOS) though a civil servant
census. and tdl be put under the Civil Service Board with possible reallocation to other nriniStries
after undergoingpropatraining to improvetheir capabilities.

75.       As regards public investment (capital expenditures), other than recovery and reconstmtion
outlays, Government plans to mkitain the same level o f capital expenditures to GDP. while

76.       The level o f the July war-related capital expenditures needs to be increasedto account for the
reconstruction process. Intandem, the efficiency of capital expendihwes needs to be improved, to
support the gover~ment'sobjectives o f grow& erhwce social conditions, and minimize regional
disparities.

Publie InirsstmentProwarn

77.        The government intends to have an adequatelevelof capital expenditures to maintaincx&ing
infrastmctures and prevent its rapid deterioration and to invest in much needed new investment
project,s. The government aims to keep capital expendihires, excluding war-related spending, in the
mdumtermat about 2.7% of UDP. However, the share of foreign-financed krvestmen$sshould be
increasedto an average of 45% duringthe period 2009-2011 (fromthe current 38 percent share). In
addition, as part of the govemmenfs ot.emll strategy, the private sector will play a greeter role in
inftastructure investments andinthe provision ofpublic services throughvarious amngenxnts andin
partnershipwith the public sector. Wierezcs&e public investment programduringthe 1990sfocused
heavily on rebuilding the country's physical infrastructure, in particular trmspoxt, power and
telecommunications, the fiiture p r o m excluding the ixwnsmictionprogram resulting fnnn the
JulybAugwt2006-war. will putgreateremphasis onprovidingbasicpublic services.

78.        The total loans that are likely to be llsed over the next thee years are estimated at about
USS880 million out of US$2.12 billion representing the total amount o f iuidisbursed concessional
loans. Theseloans stand for an averageof 80%of the cost ofthe pmjects to which they are &oat&,
whereas the remainingpart is to be fuzanccdby the treasury. The availabje loans will be allocated to
several projects related to public services and infrastructure, as well as to socio-econoruic and
productive sector pjects covering all Lebatiese regions. These- projects are at diffcxnt stages of
implementation: s m e are being implemtlltedbut not yet completed, while others are still at the
beginnkgofthe implementationprocess.

79.        A host of factors have playeda role inthe low levelof utilization of foreign loans inrecent
years. Impfernentation difficulties and fiscal constraints were exacerbated by the unsettled political
eiiVfi.onment. Expropi-iation delays and sharkages of local counterpart funds slowed down project
implementation. Moreover, &lays inpwlimtaiy ratification of signed loans contributed to delays
inproject start-ups. Asthegenericaidsystemicproblemsarenowbeingaddressed,therateofproject

8I. The need for public investment inphysical infiwdructure will decline after colnpletiozi o f the
recoilstruction, axid with tlx privatization envisaged in the government's refom program. %e
govenmxnt will seek a geater privaterectorrole iusectors suchas telecomunications, power, roads
and urban development in the context of public-private partnerships. Witthin the overall financial
constraints of the macroeconomic program, the foctls of the public investment propmi will
increasingly be on sectors where ~~g              needs are significant, such as water and wastewater, the
envisoment andrunrldevelopment.

82.       The govermnent is currently reviewing the entire programo f ongoingpmjects andprograms,
with a view to deciding whether, given the reconstruction needs, iruplementation constraints and
current priorities, the scope of ongoiag projects and progruns should be seduced projects that have
barely started shouId be continued, andeel&          loan agreements which havebeen signed should be
either cancelled or renegotiated. The government will consult with lenders anddonors on the steps to
be taken as a result of this se\-iew and, incase of cmceliations, lenders anddonors dlbe asked to
consider reallocatingfiuids withinthe same sector for activities that have a higher priority [including
to cover recovery and reconstruction e x p d i k e s that have no dtemative funding), or provide new
financing for hi& priority newprojects withinthe mediumterm capital expmdturrs progani,

83.       The scope for initiating new projects with budget hi&will be limited. given tlie fiscal and
debt constmints. Mew, _generallys d . investmentsthat ensm that benefits frompast investnientsare
fiilly realized will have a high priority. For most new projects, the govtrntnent will seek foreign
project loans or, wherever feasible, pa&ner&ips      withtheprivate sector. The selectionofnewprojects
andprogramwilltake intoaccount the needor anequitable regionalbahce, as well as the needto
fillfill basic needs and reduce poverty. Inthis regard, &e gaverntnent will place top priority to
selecting those projects that generate economic activity and new jobs inthe outlying regions. Upon
completion o f this review, the govsnunwt will. by the md of the first quarter of 2007. adopt a

                                   k

85.        The govenunent will look into the possibility of adopting a fiwal accountnbility law t h t
wouldset targets for some importantmcrotconomic v&ables, particularly the level ofbudget deficit
or public debt. Constrainingthe ability of the goverumentto ~OITOW. for exnmyle, would force it to
undertake the necessaryreformmeasures instead of resortingto moxz indebtedness. Sucha law would
oblige fizttre govemnlents and p a r ~ a n i a hto adhere to the set targets and ensure fiscal discipline in
the future.

Reform of thePmwr Sactor

86.        The reform of the power sector is the most important expenditure masure. Also, electricity
bkng a major input element to the local ecommy, ixnprokg service quality would contribute to
economic grow?h in Lebanon. Lowcrlng the budgetary support to EdL would pave the way or
achievingfiscal sustninability. stimulating economic activity, and reducing the need to raise the tax
burdeninthe fiitwc.

87.        EdLhasbeenbesetbymajorgovemance problems, resultinginsipnificmit technical andnm-
technical losses (estimated at 15% and 20%, respectively) and abou 6% loss          011collectiolia total

fuel  SOUICCS   or bold measures this year, budgetary support to EdL reachedabout US$1 billionin
2006, or about 20% of fiscal revenues and 3.5% of GDP, a real hemorrhage for public finances.
overall, total outlays towards the power sector includingthe smicc of the debt incurred amount to
more thw a quarter of the total public debt. Reducing losses and strengthening sector capacity to
encourage privnte sector involvement will k achieved though a set of short and medium-temi
actions. The governmentrecognizesthat there are no quick fixes for E&. but savings of about 3% of
GDP could be realized over the next five years based on various measures (Box 4) while awaiting
ECLLprivatizatioii (See below).

RevenueMeasures

90.      Inview of the sizeable adjustment neededandthe relatively limited scope for ftuther cut in
prlmzuy public spending, the above expdim-e meiasurrswill not be sufficient to mise the primary
surplus to a level that i s couunensuratewid1the objective of reducing the ratio of debt-to-GDP over
the mediumterm Hence, suious revenue-dancing measures would need to accompany or even
precede some expenditure cuts, given the difficullty inrationalidng public expenditures inthe short
tmn.

91.      Much b s been done iU the past few yews to improve the tax structure and collecCim, as
shown in the sharp increase in the tax revenue. A number of other stnrckml measures aimed at
modernizingthe revenue achninistration towards a fimction based structure with strongheadquarters,

a anique "Tax Procedure Code'' which is presently wider final revisionanddiscusoioii hiparliment,
an importantstep for the introduction o fthe GlobalIncome Tax (GIT)in 2008.

92.      Any change intax policy intlie context of the pfeseut refomprogram shouldbe ptided by
the needto minimize distortions and enhance equity and h e s s inthe distribution o f the tax burden,
taking into account tlie broad objectives of this program. In this spirit. the govetnnient plans to
implement a number o f revenue-enhancing measures that would attempt to shift the tax hden to
thosethat are inthc high-incomebrackets.

93.      The tax on intexst income will be raised from 5% to 7% beginningin2008, The fact that
inkrest received constitutes an inrportant share of taxable income of those inhigh income brackets
reinfomes the argument for this taxation. This tax increase could gmerate about 0.5% of GDP in
revenue, asSuluing a 10% rate o f growth of deposits over the medium tmi (a realistic estimate
judgingbyrecenttrends), a 72%doilarization rate, andrehtivelystable interest ratesover the media
term.

94.      The introductionof the value added tax (VAT) inearly 2002 was a nlajor siuzcess, generating
5.1% of GDPhrevenuehi2005. The LebaueseVAT law exempt5bask food staples and s o d items
such as education and lie&       smices. medicine, books, andpublic transpart, which d    e the bulls o f
low-hicome household consumption o f goods and Eervices (it is estimated that about GO% of their
consumption is exempt from the VAT). Inthis regar4the VAT couldbe seen as a progressive tax on
illcome spent due to the fact that the goods andsen-ices exempted &om the VAT represent arelatively
smalfer porti5n of spending by hi&--iticome households.

95.      Inthislight, thegovument planstoraisetheVATratefrom10%to 12%in2008andfrom
12%to 15% in2010. Oyer the medkmitam, a 15% VAT will generate additional reveme of at least
2% ofGDP. All this will bringtlie total contributionofthe VAT to the budget to about 7.5% o f GDP
by2010.Forimprovedcollection. the govmimtfurther seekstoadopt mo~~tlVAT filingfor large
                                                                                   i l y
coprations as of 2007.

96.      The contribution of the gasoline excise tax to the budget declinedfromLL800billionin2003
to about U360 billion in2005 and has almost become nilfor the periodMay-August of 2006 (total
collection o f car gasoline excises for 2006 is not projected to exceed LL 250 billion) due to the
cappingof the retail price at tlie May 2004 level, which ha5 created additional economic distortions
and eroded the gasoline excise revenue base. This decision was introduced temporarily on the
assutirption that oil prices w o d d go back down in the near fiitur.e. m e excise tax will be adjusted
g r a d d y beginning in 2007 untilit reachesitspre-cap rate by2011. At the sametime, the cap willbe
liftedto allowa fullpass-through ofintamtionalprices to domestic retailprices.

97.      As part o f tlie overall tax reform, the govunment dreplace the scheduler income tax by a
global income tax (GIT) by ZOOS without any chauges in the tax rates. This will aggregate the
taxpayer's somes of income, introducingmore equality intax burden.This measure will not impose
my new burden on low-income pmple but will intmhxe a fairer distribution of &e tax burden.
Together with die ixnpmvement in the overall tax administration and compliance, the redsetion in
administrative complexities, and the ilnification of exemptions, the GIT is expected to improve tax
revenue. 1% estimated that the introduction o fthe GIT will generate about 1%o f ODP of additional

compared to developed countries (1.45% o f GDP for OECD).

98.      The property tax administration has started the process of updahig and bidding a
comprehensive database on built properties to be achieved through a synchronization o f idonnation
systems between property tax database and Cadastre as a first step. and municipalities at a second
stage.

99.      Inthiscontext, thereisapressingneedto settlethelong-standingissueofseashoreviolations
throughtlie adoption of the appropriate draft law. which wa5 recently approved by the cabinet. It is
expectedthat at leastLL 135billionwill be collcctcd in&e form of penalties in2007. Inaddition, the
govemment will beginto collect sent on these "leased' properties beginning in3007 estimated at LL

critically dependent on seducing the level o f public debt, so as to bshg about lower interest fates to
encousageprivate investment, snd to accommodateadequate levek o f social expenditures andpublic

103.     The legal fnunewosk for privatizationhad already been established in late 2000 with the
adoption o f a ffamavork privatization law (Law 228) that formed the basis for developing sector-
specific l a w to underpin privatization operations in various sectot3.       The Higher Council for
privatization (HCP) was establishedinthe OEce o f the Psime Minister in2001 andtwo sectoral laws
iwre enacted in 2002 to form and privatize a fixed h e telecommunications company and to
copmtize, rmbuadle and ptivatize the po\l;er        sector. Apart &om transport. these two sect013
represent by far the largest componentso fpublic hfka.stn~cturtrintermsof assets. Bothlaws provide
for the establishment of regulatory bodies for the scspective sectors.           As mentioned above.
pivathtion didnot go aheadduritig 2003-05 because o fpolitical constraints.

104.     Preparation for primtizatiw and liberalization intelecmmiunications has beenrestwed after
the war. The key coniponeiits of the telecom privatization plan are: (i)        the establishment o f a
regulatory authority andappointment o fits board by the f m t qtrafter of 2007; {ii) enactment o f a
                                                                                     the

The HCP is finalizing contracts with reputable international &ms to assist with the privatization of
the mobile sector andhasretained anothcr one tohelpcorpomtize LibanTelecom.

105.    The privatization of the niobik sector companies will be undertaken in a transpasent ruannrr
thougha public offering that ensures the uidest possible stockholder base. Other than reducing the
total debt sto& tiis opesationwill play a majorrole indevelopingthe Beirut Stock Exchange, fueling
growth andjob creation, andprovidingmobile telephony sm$ces more efficiently.

and the increased demand orpower corzsurupticm, it is imperative for the private andnot the public

107.    As inthe case of teleconmtinications, lcgislatlon adopted in 2002 (Law 462) provides the
legal fparucwork for privatization of the sector. The law envisages the cxation of a regulatory
authoiity, and the separatiou. of genemtion. transmission and distribution activities. inanticipation of
the creation of one or ]nose public corpomtions responsible for genesation and distribution.
Transkssion would&a public function.

108.    Privatizationof the sector re?naiusthe government's objective for themedium term, but inthe
short nm, the focus will be on strengthening sector capacity andreducing losses, with insolvement of
the Pr;vatc sector where feasible.

andthe Beirut Airport,goverrrmcnt &ends to proceedwithprivatization thmughconcessionsaswell.

110.    As for sectoR other than piiblic inhstructure, the national airline, Middle East Airlines
{MEA), was restmcmedin2001. The restiucturing, which invokedmajor layoffs, hascontributedto
MEA achkvkg an operating profit in 2005, despite the rise ui fuel prices. For 2006, losses are
envisaged as a result of the war. Nevertheless, when market conditions are deemed to be adequatep
BdI, plans to divest its shares inMEA, as well as its shares inthe INTRA Investment Company
(financial institution), which is a major shareholderinthe Cztsino de Liban. Findy,the Government-
onned~efinefies,whichhave not been operative since the 1975-90 war, would be offered for sale to
private investors interested in establishing refinery andlor oil storage capacity or in any form o f
cooperationwiththe private sector.

111.    Intenmofearly impact onpublic debt (in2007 and2008), onlythe plannedprivatization in
the telecomtuunicatioas sector should representfairly si_@ficwt amounts. By law, proceeds &omall
pivatizationefforts are to be applied topublic debtreduction.

112.     MaintainingmacroeconOfniCstability through a proper monetary md exchange rate poficy is
a prcscquisite for stimulating private sector investment and grow& and for maintaining social
stability. Inthe past few years, the central bauk (B&) has played a muchgreater role than a typical
ccntrd bank w d d under n o m 1circUrartances. But circumstances were not normal by any meam.
The difficult politicalandsecuritysituation which manifesteditself mainly inhigher dollarization and
inpressur-es in the fmip exchange rnarket requiredthe central bank to resort to vasious (and
sometimes imtypid) f i c i a i and long-term monetmy instrtwits to maintain such stabiiity and
avoid a financial crisis. This was very muchinevidence following the msassination ofPrimeMinister
Hariri and during the JulyjAugust was. The BdL issued dollar denominated CDs to banks and
lengthenedtheruatuuityofdeposits, tohelpstabilize a difficult situiation.

113.     Withthc onset o feconoinic reform andthe expectedsapport ofthe iflttmsltiodcommunity.
the central bank will focus its attention on its mainmandate o f inairitairingprice stability using only
short-tmi monetruy instmnients. At the same time, BdLk policy dependence will be strenghied
mainly through improving the fiscal situation and not resorting to any direct borrowing fiom the
central bad. In an env%onment of renewed confidence and good coordination with fiscal policy.
there is a scope for reducing interest rate spreads. 2%      could be accomplished without necessarily
cmt.ing muchpressure onreserves giventhe stability of the depositbase, which hasproved to be less
sensitive to changes inforeign interest rates. Inthe absence of fircal tightening andreform, however,
the ability afthe centralbankto infliience interest rates is limitedgiventhat capitalis fullymobile and
theexchangerateis fmd.

114.     A potential reduction in interest rates-stastkg with a redtEtion in the margin on clollas
deposits-should boost the demand for credit by the private sector and channel excess liquidity
towasd psoductive uses and help the development of capital markets {see above). As the level of
international resemes is appsoaching an adequate lev& the need for the cmntxal bant to absorb
liquiditywill diminishandsowillthe cost ofstei-ilization.

116.     The policy of stable exchange rate has served Lebanon well and is critical to maintaining
price stability and confidence. While competitiveness is not a concern at this h e . shuctwal refonus
of the kindincluded iUthe economic reform propam will &me              competitiveness. FUrrrrrrre. to

stability is notjeopardized.

122.     Reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 145%i s a major accomplihcnt 'buma debt ratio of such
magnitude remains too high by my siandard and cannot be sustained o m the long term leaving
Lebanon vulnerable to systemic faiiure. While there i s no universal agreement on what constitutes a
sustainabledebt position, b ma practical point of view, it is the level at which the gmmnment can
satisfy its 'budgetconstraintwithout having to resort to dsastic measures or experience difficulties in
5ei-vickg debt inthe &%we, givenreasonableexpectations about futwe fird effort.

123.     Fromthe operational point ofview, public debt inLebanonis deenledsustainableifthe debt-
to-GDP ratio declines noticeably over h e . Assumingan average real growth of 4%. rt real k t m s t
rate of 6% and a reduction in the debt to-GDP ratio by about 15% on account of privatization
proceeds. Lebaionhas then to maintain a Pr;maryswplus of 3.540% of GDP to k~epthe debt-to-
GDP ratio coilstant over the. But given the high level of debt and the susceptibility of this debt to
exogmous shocks, the objsctive is to rrduce the debt ratio over time by achieving higher primary

surplus and/or by external financial support. While the adjustment inthe primary surplus planned for
2006-2011is substantial (10% of GDP), overthe next 15years Lebanoncannot realistically sustainan
average KImasy s q l u s of more than 3.54% o f GDP [or abaut 24.5% over the period 2010-20)
since colupressing expenditures and raising additional revenues would become extremely difficult to
maintaininview of&e country's needs, altowingonly a slight decline inthe debt tatio.

124.     Invkw of the highlevel of debt and the ensuingvulnerability with its social and political
repercussions, intamtional support would be crucial for Lebanon to secure a continuous and
paccptibkreduction inthe debt-to-GDP ratio over the longnm,Sigrdicant external support inthe
form o f grants andhighly concessional loans would substitute part o f the new marketborrowingwith
a sipificant impact on debt dynamics especially if this qprt is froatkraded. %le          grants would
have the greatest impact on the debt stock, highly concessional loans would affect the debt ratio
through a reduction indebt service. At the Paris 11meeting, the international c0rrrmUn;ty extended
long-term concessional loans at an interest rate that was about halfthe rate at which Lebanon could
borrow at that time. To receive the s m e degree of concessionafity granted underParis E, under &e
pnscntcircumstance, Lebanonhopes to receivelarge grants inN b s t d i i l amounts andinaddition to
concessiod loans at an interest rate in the range of 34% [close to donors' cost of fund) and a
maturityperiodofat least 15y e m with agraceperiodof 5 years.

125,     Withoiit international support, the debt-to-GDP ratio u4l likely revert back to an
unsustainable path especially inthe face o f any exogenous shock d e s s &her fiscal adjustments are
taken. Howcvrr, fuither cuts in spending or more increases intaxes would not be possible without
stifling economic activity or provoking social and political unrest. which wodd negate fully the
benefits ofrefclfm.

126.     More impOrtently, international financial support will help create the right environment for
refom audcontribute si@cantly        to increasing growthandredwinginterest rates, which inturnwill
have a greater impact on debt. For every one percent increase inthe growth rate, &e debt-to-GDP
ratio would decline by about 1.5% a year. Sitllilarly, a reduction in the real interest rate by one
percentagepoint would have a similar impact on the debt ratio. A combination of both would likely
reducethe debt ratioconsiderably to sustniuablclevels over the next 10-15years.

127.     The government plans to place dl financial contributions in a special account at the central
bank earmarked exclusively for debt remice and principal repayments. Any fiiture pr;uatY fiscal
surpluses wodd also accme to this account. This account will also be used for privatization proceeds
for the exclusive p w p s eof debt reduction.

                             C. Implementationof the reformpi-ogrsrn

128.     Given the breadth of the reforni program aud the need for timely implemmfation aver the
ncxt five years, a committee represcntitig the nVnistry o f finance, the irriiishy of economy, and the
centralbank will be establishedto ensure propermonitoring of various measures of the program. This
c o m & e c willprepare a detailedtimetable for Emplmentationandwork closely with other ruinistries
such as social affairs, hedth, education and labor to ensire that all actions on the social front are
being impletueuted on a timely basis. The committee will report directly to the pihe minister, who
will follow up with ministries and agencies not abiding by the agreed h e h e under the program
wMe keepingthe Council ofMinisters fully informed ofany d~velopnient.~.

political stability. andm ~ ithe country to a prmperousera following 30 years ofcivil strife, Ismeli

T h i s war increasedthe b d e n of public debt and required even more drastic fiscal adjustments than
envisaged before the war. Without significant external support, Lebanori would again enter into a
vicious cycle of rising debt, high interest rates, depressedprivate investment andgrowththat remains
wellbelow itspotential. Siichtrend, ifnotreversed, could easily leadto economic, social andpolitical
instability.

 132.    Assuming no advem developmetits occur and p v i d e d the government delivers on all its
reform measures, the dornestic effort dllead io significant reductions in the haidget &fiats and

donewill notbesufficient to reversethe debt dynamics. AI1things beingequal, the debt-to-GDP ratio
will remainat best at about 145% o f GDP and the debt service will still eat up about 50% o f total
revenue-a     very highlevel of debt by internationalstandards that could not be sustained inthe long
term. Generathglarger priuWysurplusesover the longtern1would notbe possible without upsating

                               REPUBLIC OF LEBANON
                 LebanonEconomicReformProgram:A Status Update


                                      I.OVERVIEW

Lebanon's economy suffers the effects o f a long period o f political and security volatility.
Following a promising period o f economic growth and political reforms institutedby the
Government during Q1 and Q2, 2006, the country was subjected to huge human and
economic losses following the July 2006 war on Lebanon.

Lebanon retains enormous economic potential, but faces huge challenges. Notable
economic reforms have been accomplished ina short period o f time and under extremely
difficult circumstances. Nevertheless, in the immediate future, Lebanon faces daunting
challenges, including restoring security, enhancing political and social stability,
broadening the revenue base, stepping-up reconstruction and developing an effective
social safety net.

Against a background o f sustained political crises and security threats, the Government
strategy consisted of: (i)an intensive political and security track to resolve the political
crisis and restore internal stability; (ii)a reconstruction and recovery track aimed at
securing the necessary funds and accelerating the reconstruction process following the
July 2006 war and the Nahr Al-Bared crisis; (iii)  an economic reform track to initiate the
implementation o f key reforms incritical sectors, namely, the Social and Power sectors.

The Government succeeded in formulating an ambitious economic reform program
through a consultative process and took bold steps to begin the implementation of
structural economic and social reforms aimed at putting the country on a high growth
path. Steps to institutionalize the program's implementation process through improved
coordinationand accountability structures have been instated.

Against a background o f decreasing revenues, increasing expenditures, low investment
confidence and a tourist season injeopardy, the Bank's involvement was instrumental in
mobilizing substantial donor funding and financial aid inthe form o f grants and soft loans
at the International Conference for Support o f Lebanon (Paris 111). An Economic and
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was prepared inpartnershipwith the World Bank. This
participatory and inclusive exercise contributedto the creation o f new reform momentum
inthe country andinformedthe Government's economic reformprogram.

Duringthe Paris I11Conference, the Government o fLebanonhas committedto implement
a wide ranging reform plan, with the aim to meet the fiscal requirements for long term
economic and social sustainability. To date, the Government has established a process



                                            81

that ensures strong government ownership o f the reform program, shared responsibility
among government institutions, as well as inclusiveness, accountability and sustainability
o freforms.

The Government has set an ambitious socio-economic reform plan consisting o f more
than 300 initiatives grouped into 50 programs. Ithas prioritizedthese initiatives basedon
their socio-economic impact, legislative requirements, and ease of securing budget. As a
result, it has identified 116 short-term initiatives that could be implementedby end o f
November 2007. These are split as 40 social initiatives, 39 economic initiatives, and 37
infrastructure and privatization initiatives. To date 64 initiatives have been launched with
41 expected to be launched inQ3 2007. The following note presents the status o fprogress
made on key initiatives undertaken and plannedfor 2007 (Kindly refer to Annex Ifor a
summary o fprogress made on the short term initiatives).


                11. GR PCO STRUCTURE AND PROGRESSTO-DATE

The Government o f Lebanon has set up an overall structure to conduct and supervise the
implementation o f the reform program. This structure envisages a GovernmentReform
Program Coordination Office (GR PCO) based at the Office of the President of the
Council o f Ministers. The GR PCO has the responsibility for the overall coordination o f
the implementation o fParis I11socio-economic reform program.

Inter-Ministerial Committees(IMCs)

The GR PCO liaises with, and supports the work o f three Inter-MinisterialCommittees
(IMCs) chaired bythe President ofthe Council onMinisters:
    0   Social Inter-Ministerial Committee
    0   Economic & Fiscal Inter-Ministerial Committee
    0   Privatization& Infrastructure Inter-Ministerial Committee

These three IMCs include Ministers and Heads of Public Sector Entities that are directly
involved inthe implementation o fParis I11reform initiatives.

The Social IMC includes the Ministers o f Social Affairs, Health, Education, Labor, in
additionto the Director General o fthe National Social Security Fund(NSSF).

The Economic & Fiscal IMC includes the Ministers o f Finance, Economy & Trade, as
well as the Minister o f State for Administrative Reform, and the Central Bank Governor.
The Infrastructure & Privatization IMC includes the Ministers o f Telecommunications,
Energy & Water, Transportation, in addition to the Secretary General o f the Higher
Council for Privatization (HCP) and the President o f the Council for Development and
Reconstruction (CDR).




                                              82

In addition, the IMCs can engage external constituents to seek formal input on specific
policy areas, such as private sector or civil society associations, or Public-Private
Partnerships. These external constituents will act as consultative entities to IMCs.

The three IMCs organized their first round o f meetings from May 15thto 17th,2007 and
appointed their Secretaries which would provide administrative support. They have
started the process of allocating Paris I11 reform initiatives to "Natural Owners",
endorsing, and determiningresources requirements(technical assistance and financial).
These IMCs will meet on a monthly basis to resolve issues escalated from line Ministries
and Public Sector Entities, withthe second round o f meetingsplannedfor July 5thand 6th,
2007. The IMCs will also re-calibrate and re-prioritize sector initiatives, as necessary, and
oversee coordination and integration within ongoing Government activities. Finally, they
will report progress to Council ofMinisters and escalateany unresolved issue.


Natural OwnersandM&S Units

Each "Natural Owner" has assigned a Monitoring and Support Unit (M&S) to
develop its Paris I11reform plans into Program Charters and detailed workplans, with the
technical assistance o f the GR PCO. The "Natural Owners" will report progress monthly
to their respective IMCs, and will liaise closely with the GR PCO through the M&SUnit.
They will also establish program monitoring mechanisms to manage implementation of
their initiatives. This reporting includes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that assess
the efficiency, impact and sustainability o f the reform initiatives. Moreover, "Natural
Owners" will determine Technical Assistance requirements with the support o f their
M&S Unit and the GR PCO, and they will assign resources to implement Paris I11
initiatives. Finally, they will manage, conflicts around inter-dependencies with other
"Natural Owners", resolve issues within their own authority and escalate unresolved
issues to the GR PCO and the IMC.


Ministerial and Cross-MinisterialImplementation Teams

Ministerial and Cross-MinisterialTeams will be established to implement the reform
initiatives. These teams will seek external advisory and capacity-building support as
needed, and manage contracted external parties scope and deliverables. They will report
progress, through the M&S Unit, to "Natural Owners" and IMCs in accordance with
established mechanisms. They will raise issues and risks to the M&S Unit, and liaise with
the GRPCO ondiscrete technical matters.


                           111.SOCIAL REFORMPROGRAM

The Paris I11social reformprogram includes around 41% o fthe total numbero finitiatives
committed during the International Donors Conference. This program will be



                                             83

implemented by the Ministry o f Social Affairs (MoSA), Ministry o f Health (MoH),
Ministry o f Education and Higher Education (MEHE), Ministry of Labor (MOL),and the
National Social Security Fund (NSSF). Each "Natural Owner" has developed initiatives
to improve and promotethe performance o fthe social sector.




                                         84

SocialAffairs

The Ministry o f Social Affairs (MoSA) is focusing on the short term on three work
streams:
        Enhancement of the management of the social sector through elimination o f
        duplication in service delivery and program implementation among the Ministries
        o f Social Affairs, Education and Public Health, through increasing coordination in
        the implementation o f local development projects, as well as formulating a social
        strategy to act as framework for all social related actions and interventions;
        Reform and restructuring of the Ministry of Social Affairs by reviewing the
        mandate and programs o f MoSA, revisiting the organizational structure, and
        implementingprocess re-engineeringand automationo fMoSA;
    0   Establishment of a targeting mechanism (proxy means testing) as a first step
        towards the implementationof a number of social Safety Nets aimed at assisting
        the very poor and vulnerable population.


The Ministry of Social Affairs is working towards enhancing the management of the
socialsector through thefollowing concretemeasures.

Firstly, formulation of a comprehensive social strategy is underway. An advisory
boardwas created to provide guidance and technical support inthe elaboration o f a social
strategy. The board i s led by MoSA and will provide a strategy framework by end o f July
2007, to be later developed into a comprehensive social strategy.

Secondly, eliminating duplication in service delivery between ministries in order to
identify all duplicated or overlapped programs and services in each ministry (MoSA,
MoH, and MEHE) includingbudget, administrative structure, beneficiaries; etc. has been
launched. In June 2007, a staff member was assigned from each concerned ministry to
follow-up with the Social IMC on the overlap inthe provision o f social services between
ministries. Identification of duplicated programs and services is underway and a draft
report i s expected inJuly 2007. Bilateral meetings will then be organized betweensocial
ministries and recommendations will be prepared for efficient roles of each duplicated
program inthe third quarter o f 2007. Building on recommendations, a time bound action
plan for the duplication o f services will be prepared. It i s expected that the Social I M C
will approve a time based action plan that eliminates duplication between MoSA, M O H
andMEHEby September2007.

MoSA is addressing the coordination of local development projects. An expert was
subcontracted to map existing local development projects to provide a solid base for
identifying overlaps and gaps intheir implementation. The expert is expected to submit a
final draft o fmapping before end o f July 2007.

MoSA has already achieved some progress in the reform of certain programs (Care
and Local Development). The Ministry has formulated improved procedures for the



                                             85

implementationo f local developmentprojects inpartnership with concerned stakeholders.
In addition, it developed a new system and a set of eligibility criteria o f NGOs and
welfare institutions wishingto be subcontracted by MoSA. Both items are expected to be
finalized and approved by the Ministerbefore December 2007.


Preparations for the Implementation of social safe@ nets are underway. Within the
context o f Social Protection DPL, an activity has been launched to establish a targeting
mechanismfor strengtheningpovertyandvulnerabilityfocus of the social safety net
programs.To date, processing and analysis of the 2004 multi-purpose household survey
are underway. Furthermore, preparations for developing a roadmap for implementation of
a newtargetingmechanism have beenprogressing. It i s expected that the Social I M C will
have issued a decree introducing targeting mechanisms with a roadmap for its
implementationby September 2007.


Health

The Ministry o f Health (MoH) i s developing a reform program, in alignment with the
World Bank's Social Protection Development Policy Loan. Inthe short term, the Ministry
o f Healthi s focusing on the following work streams:
    0   Upgrading o fprimary healthcare (PHC) services;
    0   Targeted interventions for maternal and child mortality reduction;
    0   Implementationand institutionalization o f public hospital accreditation program;
    0   Development o f common health insurance standards, procedures and functions;
    0   Enhancement o fpublic health functions andprograms;
    0   Undertaking pharmaceutical reform through updating the re-pricing o f all drugs
        registeredbetween2000 and2006


The M o H is implementing a reform program, within the context o f the planned Social
Protection Loan, to upgrade primary healthcare services. The initiative aims to
revitalize primary healthcare through the implementation o f a five year action planbased
on a recently developed primary healthcare strategy for the country. The proposed action
will focus on improving the effectiveness and quality o f primary healthcare services
provided by the network service providers currently being overseen and supported by the
Ministry o f Health. As a first step, this program will be carried out through (i)defining
catchment areas for 120 centers, and linking the primary healthcare centers with referral
public hospitals in each catchment area as part o f a new district health management
system (ii)  developing a health card system (iii) expanding IT infrastructure o f 120
                                                   and
catchment areas. This activity i s expected to be launched in Q4 2007, contingent on the
availability o ffunds.

Inparallel, the development and implementationof PHC accreditationprogramhas
commenced in June 2007, funded by the Italian Cooperation and Development i s


                                             86

expected to be finalized in December 2007. Expected outputs are: quality assurance
performance indicators and accreditation standards. This will followed by an
implementationphase.


The roll-out of the targeted interventionsprogram for maternal and child mortality
reduction is to be launched contingent on the availability o f funding. Then, the
successful pilot project o f Wadi Khalid (Akkar) i s planned to be rolled out, in
collaboration with public hospitals in 10 areas: Akkar, Tripoli, Denniyeh, Baalbeck,
Hermel, Rachaya, Hasbaya, Marjeyoun, Bint-Jbeil, and Nabatiyeh with the support o f
UNICEF. This activity i s expected to be launchedinQ1 2008.


M o H i s implementingand institutionalizinga public hospitalaccreditationprogram,
incollaborationwiththe Ecole Superieure des Affaires (ESA).The contract was signedin
May 2007, i s pending approval o f the court o f accounts and i s funded from the Ministry
o f Health's 2007 budget. Experts o f the French Health Authority (HAS) are expected to
be mobilized in Q3 2007, to undertake the following : (i)conducting training on
accreditation to 25 public hospitals, (ii)establishing a short list o f "accredited"
certification companies, (iii)   updating and upgrading accreditation standards and (iv)
conducting a survey to public hospitals. The expected timeline for completion i s Q4
2008, eighteenmonths following commencement.

M o H i s developingcommon health insurance standards, procedures and functions.
Short-term initiatives activities include (i)  completing the pilot testing o f the visa billing
system, and (ii)updating the National Health Accounts (NHA) to make health
expenditure data available for appropriate and targeted health policies. Completing the
pilot testing o fthe visa billing system i s currentlyunderway by the Ministry o fHealth and
expected to be completed in October 2007. Furthermore, the Ministry o f Health i s
currently working on developing National Health Account matrices for 2004 and 2005
and preparations are underway to institutionalize the collection and extraction o f data at
each public fund for 2006 and 2007. Subsequently, a WHO expert will be mobilized for
installingthe appropriate software and template.

On the other hand, the re-commissioningof the work on the standardizationo f codes,
forms, and payment methods, and the integration o f the Health ManagementInformation
System (HMIS) across funds has commenced within the context o f the Social Protection
Development Loan. A consultant funded by the World Bank i s currently conducting
situational analysis to redefine common business procedures and advise on utilization
control mechanisms for both M O H and NSSFmainly relating to contracting with private
providers and integration and upgrade of health management information system and
insuring an effective utilization review. The proposal is expected to be finalized in July
2007, to be followed by an implementationplan.




                                               87

The reform effort to fully develop and operationalize the National Expanded Program
on Immunization (EIP) will be initiated by the Ministry o f Health with close support
from UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The envisaged 5 year
reform effort will build on existing support provided by UNICEF and WHO in order to
scale up current activities towards a fully institutionalized national EPI program. The
M O H and UNICEF have agreed on a one year work plan focused on strengthening
routine and supplementary immunization services with five different components:
program management,         service  delivery, communication,      capacity-building,     and
monitoring and evaluationThis activity i s expected to be launched in 4 3 2007,
contingent on the agreement between M O H and M O F to finance this activity under a
separate program budget.

Another critical aspect o f a health system - a core public health function o f the state - i s
integrated disease surveillance and response. The Ministry o f Public Health in
Lebanon has made great improvements over recent years in working towards the
establishment o f such a system. The Ministry o f Health has submitted a workplan to the
World Bank within the context o f Social Protection Development Loan to : (i)           build
capacity o f M O H on communicable diseases surveillance, (ii) up an institutional
                                                                 setting
mechanism for electronically networking focusing on diseases reporting, information
sharing and use o f GIs, (iii)develop a national reference laboratory at Beirut Rafic Hariri
Governmental Hospital to conduct biological tests required for notifiable communicable
diseases. This activity i s expected to be launched in Q3 2007, contingent on the
availability o f funding.

M o H i s undertaking pharmaceutical reform, by re-pricing all drugs registered from
2000 to 2006. The activity has been progressing with the completion o f repricing all
drugs registered after the year 2001 inDecember 2006. The expected date for repricing all
drugs registered betweenyear 1996 and 2000 inJuly 2007. For products registeredbefore
the year 1995, documents will have to be submitted before July 2008.


Education

The educational sector is undergoing significant strategic changes, in line with a 3-year
reform program undertaken by the Ministryo f Education and Higher Education (MEHE).
Several initiatives have been ongoing for several months, with some streams showing
significant progress. The short term programs include:
    0   Consolidation o f policy, planning and resource allocation;
    0   Improvement o f efficiency, effectiveness and competence level of the teaching
        workforce;
    0   Enhancement quality o f education;
    0   Enhance strategic management of educational facilities through consolidation o f
        small unviable schools




                                            88

A number of initiatives are currently underway to consolidatepolicy, planning and
resource allocation.

Education Sector Strategy was completed in April 2007. The document was approved
by MEHE stakeholders, submitted to the Council o f Ministers for endorsement and
expected to be finalized by September 2007. The strategy aims at providing (i)     education
on the basis o f equal opportunity (ii)quality education that contributes to building a
knowledge society (iii)  education that contributes to social integration (iv) education that
contributes to economic development (v) governance o f education.

Implementation o f the 3 year strategy will be launched inthe third quarter o f 2007, with
MEHE planning to integrate and implement policy, planning, and Information
Management functions at MEHE.

A comprehensive study on "Rationalizing the Financing of the General and
Vocational Education System in Lebanon" was completed in April 2007. The study
identified and documented all monetary and non-monetary resource flows within the
public and private sectors in Lebanon. This permitted the assessment o f efficiency and
equity o f the current distribution o f resources across schools, sectors, regions and socio-
economic cohorts inadditionto the public managemento f resources. An important output
o f the study was the development o f a financial model for estimating required
expenditures for education policies. This model is providing guidance for high-level
decision makers through development o f framework and methods necessary for
evaluating policy options that improve the efficiency and equity ofresource allocation.

To provide continuity o f measures and methods over time and facilitate monitoring
policies and benchmarking results, additional steps are currently undertaken to support
the reform process. A technical assignment was launched to integrate the methods and
strategies into an ongoing Financial Planning and Decision Making Function at the
Ministry o f Education and Higher Education. This phase will commence inJuly 2007 as
the consultant to undertakethis activity will be mobilized then.

MEHE has started the process o f developing and disseminating model performance-
based budget for 2008-2009 incoordination with the Ministry of Finance. A committee
was established at MEHE to be the core counterpart in preparing the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework and is expected to prepare the ingredient lists and relevant
costs for all required activities and functions based on priorities extracted from the
education sector strategy, by November 2007. This will permitthe analysis o f the relative
efficiency o fpolicy alternatives inproducing educational outcomes.




                                              89

MEHE is implementingEducationManagement Information Systems (EMIS) at the
Ministry,and School InformationSystems (SIS) at schools. A school information system
(SIS) should be installed in 1500 schools and EMIS contract should be signed by
September 2007.

An organizational audit was completed, examining the mandate, structure, efficiency,
staffing and decision making process at MEHE. A Joint Committee chaired by the
Director General (DG) o f Higher Education and comprised o f representative from
OMSAR, the Civil Service Bureau, the Directorate o f Vocational Education, the
Minister's Advisors and the DG o f Education was established by a Ministerial Decree in
order to provide recommendations on developing a revised organizational structure and
was based on results from MEHE's Organizational Audit. The Joint committee submitted
a draft o f the Restructuring Action Plan and Monitoring for restructuring assignment in
May 2007.
 A firm was selected and will commence by end of June 2007 on developing a revised
organizational structure that will detail the functionality of all MEHE units, develop
position descriptions, revise relevant decrees and regulations and formulate and deliver
professional development activities.


MEHE has also embarked on improving the efficiency, effectiveness and competence
level of the teaching workforce through the leadership and instructor development
programs.

First phase o f Leadership Development was completed with 121 school principals
completing a professional development program designed to improve leadership,
motivational and management skills,        together with improved understanding of
international trends in competency based contextualized learning (October 2006). Each
candidate prepared and i s implementing a school development plan for hisher school.
303 candidates who are currently enrolled in the second phase o f the program are
implementing the self guided modules and practicum phase which is expected to be
completed in October 2007. Progress towards institutionalizing the Leadership Program
within MEHE and the Lebanese University is ongoing to maintain sustainability and
development o f the leadership training program for school principals. Inthis respect, the
Lebanese University is to be mandated, through the Faculty o f Education, to provide in-
service professional development for School Principals.

With regards to instructor development, 15 regional resource centers have been
established throughout Lebanon for in-service training. 270 have been selected and
trained to become Master Trainers. 24 candidates are being trained by NGOs to provide
support to students with special needs. Since 2004, 11000teachers have received training
through the Instructors Continuous Program.


Enhancing the assessment of academic achievement has been progressing. MEHE
teams have developed Evaluation Kits to provide a basis for the assessment o f student


                                           90

learning. Over 1000kits have beenprepared and validated. An Exam Generation System
has been developed, and consultants have been recruited to develop a Question Bank
System, and Examination Management System which are expected to be ready by
November 2007.

I n order to enhance strategic management of educationalfacilities, criteria for school
consolidation (# o f students, studentkeacher ratios, constructed area, distance...) have
beenset and a total o f 20 primarynonviable will be consolidated as soon as MEHEreach
an agreement with respective Parliament memberson consolidation.

Labor

The main initiatives o f the Ministry o f Labor (MOL)revolve around streamlining laws
and regulations to facilitate access to skills and increase employer flexibility MOLis
considering to:
     0   Streamline work permit procedures for skilled foreign workers and executives,
        and simplify duplicative pre-approval of Ministryo f Labor;
     0  Revise labor laws to facilitate employment of temporary and seasonal workers,
        and youth labor;
     0  Review procedures for termination of employment agreements to allow simple
        notification, andconsider removing MOLapproval and investigation.

These initiatives, expected to start inJuly 2007, depend on the availability o f funding.


Social Security

The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is developing a reform program in
coordination with the World Bank, and part o f the Social Protection Development Policy
Loan. Reform initiatives revolve around rationalizing and expanding the coverage o f
social insurance system, strengthening NSSF governance and administration, improving
NSSFfinancial sustainability, and strengthening income protectionpolicies.

Most of these initiatives are expected to be formulated by September 2007, in close
consultation betweenthe NSSFandthe World Bank.


                IV. ECONOMICAND FISCAL REFORMPROGRAM

The Paris I11 economic reform program includes around 35% of the total number o f
initiatives committed during the International Donors Conference. This program will be
implementedby the Ministryo f Finance (MoF), Ministryo fEconomy & Trade (MoET),
the Central Bank (BDL), and the Office o f the Minister of State for Administrative
Reform (OMSAR). Each "Natural Owner" has developed a series o fshort-term initiatives
to reformthe economic and fiscal sectors.



                                             91

Finance

Inadditionto its responsibility inthe negotiation andimplementationofthe ParisI11
pledges, most especiallythe currently-under-negotiation US$ 1.47billion inbudgetary
support loans and grants, and its donor coordination role, the Ministry of Finance has
developedan ambitious reformprogram for the 2007-2009 period. Inthe short-term, MoF
initiativeswill focus on:
         0  Rationalizing expenditures;
         0  Enhancinggovernmentrevenues;
         0  Undertaking budget and financial reform;
         0  Undertaking revenue managementandtax administrative reform toward a
            function-based structure;
         0  Strengtheningdebtmanagement;
         0  Reforming capital markets

The Ministry of Finance is working towards the rationalization of expenditures which
has included the following three concrete measures in the first six months of 2007.
Firstly, expenditureson travel and communication have been restricted as communicated
inthe 2008 budget circular which was issued inMay 2007. Second, a decree was issued
inthe second quarter of 2007 to pay the "Council of the South" and the "Fund for the
Displaced" the first LL 100 billion out of their dues needed for closing the funds (decree
# 292 dated 27/04/2007). To date, 35% of this LL 100 billion have been paid in total.
Third, to contain the wage bill in the mediumterm, a hiring freeze was put in effect as
issued in the 2008 Budget Circular, stipulating the need for a Council of Ministers'
decision for any urgent hiringneed.

In addition, the Ministry of Finance has embarked on enhancing revenue collection.
Despite the currently existing political situation, total revenues have increasedby around
9 percent for the first four months of 2007 when compared against 2006. More
specifically, on the short term revenue enhancement front, since the beginning of 2007,
the Treasury's share of Casino du Liban revenues has been expanded from 30% to 40%.
Revenues from Casino du Liban have increased by 38% in the January to May period
2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Also as part of a revenue enhancing and
administrative reform, the built property tax database has been linked to the Cadastre's
database since January lSt,   2007. The update of the database is an ongoing process.
Comparative figures indicate that as a result, revenues of property tax during the first five
months of 2007 have increased by 36% compared to the same period of 2006. Another
major revenue collection enhancement policy planned for by MoF is to lift the cap on
domestic car gasoline prices to align domestic prices with international prices and to
gradually increase the excise rate to reach the pre-cap rate starting with the excise rate
floor at LL 300 per liter for 2007. The uncapping mechanism has beenproposed and an
internal study on the distributional impact of the uncapping has been completed. A
Council of Ministers decision remains to be adopted in this regard. A study on the



                                             92

possibleneeds and ways to subsidize the most affected income groups is requiredprior to
the uncapping.

A number of initiatives are being implementedby MoF in its bid to implement a full
fledged public financial management reform by undertakingbudget and financial
reform. For the first time, actual steps for adopting a top-down budgetary process has
been taken, by includingthe medium-termexpenditure framework as part of the budget
circular for 2008 May 20th, 2007, a process that is expected to continue until 2011. For
budget year 2008, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework will constitute a general
guideline for the spending agencies, in order not to exceed the proposed global budget
envelope. MoF i s preparing for a second step in this process, that will be concluded in
March 2008, to prepare a medium term expenditure framework with a budget ceiling for
each Ministry, and to be discussed in the Cabinet by then. The new budget preparation
techniques were presented to around 200 high level representatives from spending
agencies in a workshop inMay 2007. As part of a series of plannedongoing workshops,
two have beenheldinthe secondquarter of 2007 with MoF officials to discuss the reform
plan and to seek the participation from different working groups. On another front, in
preparation for the MTEF incoordination with spending agencies and inpreparation for
the introduction of performance-basedbudgeting, the Ministry of Education was chosen
to serve as a pilot (June 2007). A core unit has been formed at the Ministry of Education
for this purpose and a team from this Ministry was sent on a study tour to Morocco, to get
acquainted with the Morrocan experience in this context. In addition, MoF has prepared
and submitted to Cabinet a draft 2007 budget law consistent with the targeted primary
balance of the central government including HRC spending and CDR foreign-finance
expenditures.

In terms of improving revenue-management and administrative reform, an
administrative reform towards a function-based structure that has been initiated is the
reorganization of the regional tax offices along function-based operations. The Council of
Ministers had signed a restructuring decree in this regard. By the end of 2007, it is
expected that clarifying instructions for the newly established departments, such as
prerogatives, in the regional tax offices are issued and that the follow-up collection
function is moved from the Treasury to tax offices. In addition, the restructuring decree
approved the organizational structure of satellite offices. As such, it i s expected that
taxpayer services are established in satellite offices gradually starting with the most
important sub-regions interms of fiscal coverage (by end-2007).

On the tax administration front and modernizing legislation, the MoF has introduced the
Tax Procedure Code that unifies and harmonizes various tax procedures. The TPC draft
law has been finalized, was approved by the Council of Ministers, and i s presentlybeing
negotiated at Parliamentary Committees. The development of implementation decrees is
expected to be completed by end-2007. In addition, an internal version of the Global
Income Tax draft law to replace the current schedular income tax system has been
finalized. The draft law is currently undergoing final stakeholder consultations before
submission of the Council o f Ministers, which is expected to take place in 43 of 2007.


                                             93

The preparation o f related regulations andprocedures is expected to be completed by the
endo f2007.

Interms o fimproving the delivery of services and administrativereform, the introduction
of electronic registration o f taxpayers has been initiated. Registration forms and
documents have been finalized, the necessary decrees and decisions were issued (in
2006), and systems and procedures have been developed. By the end o f 2007, it i s
expected that the systems and procedures are finalized, that the registration team within
tax roll are trained, the necessary equipment i s installed, and that a communication
campaign and registrationprocess are launched. Inaddition, progresshas beenachieved
to put inplace a new audit strategy based on risk selection criteria, new audit techniques
and procedures, and the development o f an audit manual. Central audit and compliance
teams were formed in March 2007. The following month, the annual audit budget plan
and program was prepared. Progressive implementation has been in place in four pilot
sites (Beirut, Mount Lebanon, Value Added Tax department, Large Taxpayer's Office).
The development o f a procedure manual, o f scoring system and criteria and other
deliverables is expected by end-2007. Inaddition, a 24/7 call center to provide around the
clock serves for all taxpayer inquires was launched inMay 2007, reflecting the focus on
client-oriented services by improving communication with clients. As a testament to the
efforts of the Ministryo f Finance's innovation and reform inthis area, MOF was awarded
the prestigious UnitedNations Public Service Award in2007 for the category "Improving
the Delivery o f Services" for Taxpayer Services.

To strengthen debt management, the Ministry o f Finance has initiated a number o f
reform measures. Inthis regard, one draft law to establish an integrated debt management
unit at MOF and to create a "Higher Council for Debt Management" to formalize and
enhance coordination betweenMOF andBDL awaits parliamentary approval. On another
front, in order to improve debt reporting and transparency, MOF has already issued an
internal debt report and expects to regularly publish quarterly debt publications by end-
2007. Preparations for developing a formal debt management strategy have been
completed with the circulation o f a quarterly internal financing strategy report prepared
since May 2006. MoF has also initiated the development o f secondary market liquidity in
LL by introducing five-year treasury bills (in Q1 2006); an instrument aimed at
organizing and lowering the frequency o f market auctions. The study o f introducing
further longer maturity TBs is an ongoing process and is highly dependant upon the
prevailing political environment.

In contributing to the improvement of the business environment, the Ministry of
Finance has provided tax incentives for enterprises affected duringthe war as undertaken
inthe second halfof2006. The installment ofdues for VAT andDASS for Q2 2006, the
exemption o f penalties, and the extension o f filing deadlines were implemented.
Following up on these measures, it i s expected that development procedures to verify the
declared damage and to reconstitute lost tax records as well as to increase the period
allowed for loss carried forward is expected by end-2007. Inaddition, the loan-guarantee
agency Kafalat, raised the ceiling o f guaranteed loans to LL 600 million in mid-2006.



                                            94

Kafalat which covers the industry, agriculture, tourism, traditional crafts and high
technology sectors also made provisions for small and medium enterprises affected by the
war. With BDL, three options for damaged SMEs were developed by Kafalat and
administered on a case by case basis: rescheduling o f the loan, granting an additional
grace period, and re-injecting funds to purchase damaged equipmentlmachinery. Another
measure to improve the business environment through capital market reform, has been
the drafting ofa draft capital marketslaw which awaits parliamentary approval.

AnIMFmission, concluded onMay 28,2007, helddiscussions for the 2007 Article N
consultation and reviewedperformance under the EPCA program. The mission mainly
concluded that 2007 continues to be a difficult transition year, Lebanoni s on target under
the EPCA program, andthe authorities have managed skilfully the financial and fiscal
pressuresfrom the July 2006 war with Israel.

Economy and Trade

MinistryofEconomyandTrade (MoET) hasdevelopedareformprogram along 4 axes:
    0   Encourage investment;
    0   Promote and strengthen Intellectual Property;
    0   Furtherfacilitate trade andenhancetrade competitiveness;
    0   Enact laws to improve the business environment.

Inthe short-term, MoET is encouraging investment by taking measures to streamline
business registration & licensing, and eliminate minimum capital requirements. The
current business registrationprocess i s complex, lengthyand time consuming. Inaddition
it is a costly process involving multiple payments at every step. The Government, in
cooperation with the IFC and key stakeholders i s engaged to streamline business
registration and licensing. Its aim i s to reduce the time it takes to obtain a business
license, to reduce the cost o f opening and closing a business, as well as to facilitate the
process to ensure more transparency and efficiency. For this purpose, MoET has
completed the mapping o f Business Registration Procedures, undertaken a study on
streamlining administrative barriers to investment in coordination with the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), and issued recommendations about new and
improved business registrationprocedures as presented ina workshop 22 June 2007. The
design o f an action plan to implement the study findings i s under discussion and has not
yet formally begun.

 Inorder to achieve a simpler, transparent, fast andreasonablypricedregistrationprocess,
a number o f initiatives are beingplannedfor 2007. Short term implementation initiatives
that do not require parliamentary approval are expected to be accomplished by the end o f
Q3 2007. These measures include the consolidation of all fees upfront, the
standardization o f forms and applications, the creation o f a user guide detailing required
steps for registration, and the finalization o f a Memorandum o f Understanding with
LibanPost to allow for one package consisting o f one application, one payment and one
contact point in the process. The Ministry of Justice, Ministry o f Economy and Trade,



                                             95

Ministry of Finance, Commercial Registries, National Social Security Fund, and the
Prime Minister's office are engaged in this measure. Longer term initiatives in the
pipeline require legal changes. By the end of 2007, a matrix identifying all laws to be
amended shouldbe completed.

Another initiative to encourage investment has been the successful establishment of 4
Business Development Centers (BDCs) by MoET in 2006-2007 in Beirut, Saida, Tripoli
and Zahle. By September 2007, MoET will engage in extensive training program for
BDC managers on incubation and working with companies. It will also propose an
accreditationsystemto BDCs for business councilors.

MoET is promoting and strengthening Intellectual Property (IP). MoET drafted
amendments to the Copyright Law, and sent it to concerned ministries for review and
feedback on April 20th, 2007. The Ministry also drafted the new Trademark Law, andhad
sent it to the Council of Ministers in March 2006. The Council of Ministers in turn,
forwarded the Trademarkdraft Law to the relevant Ministries for review. MoET received
the feedback end of April 2007. Also, MoET is strengthening the capabilities of the
Intellectual Property Protection Office (IPPO) in the fields of IP enforcement and
development of human resources. This activity requires Technical Assistance to
undertake IP training and develop job description for IP inspectors. The expected
timeframe for the IPPOproject extends untilQ4 of2008.

To further facilitate trade and enhance trade competitiveness,MoET has activated
the existing National Committee on Trade and Transport Facilitation. However, it
requires technical assistance to draft athree-year masterplan.

Finally, MoET i s working on improvingthe business environment,by preparing Laws
on Standards, on Technical Regulation & Conformity Assessment, and Competition.
Technical assistance is needed to finalize the drafting of some of these Laws. The draft
Laws on Standards and draft Law on Technical Regulation and Conformity Assessment
await Ministry of Industry signatures before being sent to the Council o f Ministers. The
competition Law i s expectedto be finalized by experts inmidJuly 2007. Implementation
of the Protection of National Production Law, issued by Parliament in 4 4 2006, i s
expectedto beginby end-2007.

Administrative Reform

The Office ofthe Ministerof State for Administrative Reform(OMSAR)is modernizing
the procurement code to help bring procedures to international standards. To-date, the
draft law for public procurement and the draft law for the reorganizationof the public
procurement administration were finalized. Following approval of the Economic Inter-
Ministerial Committee (IMC), these draft laws will be submitted to the Council of
Ministers for endorsement.

OMSAR is also addressing corruption in the administration.To this end, it is inthe
process of identifying candidate ministries to be subjected to the anti-corruptionproject
and is developing Terms of Reference (TOR) for the consultancy firm. By September
2007, TOR for the consultancy firm will be ready and candidate ministries identified.
However launchingthe biddingprocess is subjectto the availability of funds which have
not yet beenidentified.

OMSAR is developing modalities for outsourcing tasks carried out by the public
sector. By September 2007, OMSAR will identify, in coordination with concerned
Ministries, the tasks to be outsourced to the private sector. OMSAR will develop the
TORs and scope of work for the consultancy firm which will analyze findings and
identify priority activities, and propose a mechanism to such outsourcing based on
international bestpractices.

In addition, OMSAR is preparing an action plan for the implementation of the e-
Government strategy. OMSAR i s currently in the process of developing TORs for
consultants to review and update the e-government strategy and develop a high level
national action plan, and update the e-readinessassessment.By September 2007, TORs
will be completed. However, the launch of the bidding process will be subject to
availability of funds. Projects are being implemented depending on the availability of
incomingfunds. An e-procurementdevelopmentproject funded by a mini-granthas been
initiatedwith results expectedinmid-2008.

Finally, OMSAR is implementing a training program for the Ministry of Health
(MoH), particularly in Information Technology. By September 2007, the preliminary
assessment of MoHtrainingneeds will be completedandthe preparationof TOR kicked-
off.




      V. INFRASTRUCTUREAND PRIVATIZATIONREFORMPROGRAM




                                           97

The Paris I11Infrastructure and Privatization reform program includes around 24% o f the
total number o f initiatives committed during the International Donors Conference. In
order to oversee the implementationof this program, an Infrastructure and Privatization
Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) has been established. The program will be
implemented by the Ministry o f Telecommunications (MOT), Telecommunications
Regulatory Authority (TRA), Ministry o f Energy and Water (MoEW), Council for
Development and Reconstruction (CDR), Electricite` du Liban (EDL) and the Higher
Council for Privatization (HCP). Each "Natural Owner" has developed a series of short-
term initiatives to improve public infrastructure and service levels, as well as progress on
privatization efforts.

Telecommunications

The telecommunications sector reform planentails three major programs:
    0   Establishment o f the Telecommunications RegulatoryAuthority (TRA) to regulate
        the telecommunications sector inorder to achieve a competitive market delivering
        state-of-the-art services at affordable prices to the broadest spectrum o f the
        Lebanese population;
    0   Corporatization o f Liban Telecom (LT) in order to prepare the ground for
        privatization, hence implementing an important phase o f the Telecom Law
        enacted inJuly 2002;
    0   Privatization of mobile telecommunications in order to improve service quality,
        offer a broader variety of services, alleviate public debt and budgetary deficit, and
        open access to best practice management and operations for the Lebanese mobile
        telecommunications sector.

To-date, the TRA has been established, decrees defining its organizational and financial
structures issued, its Board appointed, and its budget drafted and sent to the Ministryof
Telecommunications and the Ministry o f Finance for approval. Moreover, the TRA
regulatory functions have been defined, and it has signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with HCP on allocation o f regulatory responsibilities in June 2007.
(Please refer to Annex IIfor TR4 Progress as of June 281h).By the fourth quarter o f
2007, all telecommunications regulatory functions would be transferred from the Ministry
of Telecommunications to TRAYincluding radio frequency allocation. TRA has issued
three regulations for consultation:      Significant Market Power (SMP) Guidelines,
Interconnection Guidelines, and Consumer Affairs Guidelines. The deadline to receive
comments on all regulations i s August 10,2007.

As part o f the corporatization process of Liban Telecom, the Council o f Ministers
issued a decree to establish Liban Telecom inJanuary 2005 as a merger o f Ogero and two
divisions o f MOT.An international consultant was appointed inNovember 2006 to assist
inthe establishment ofLT, and a steeringcommittee has been designated to oversee the
implementation, pending the appointment o f a board o f directors for LT. The legal due
diligence is underway, and a statistics company, human resource consultant and




                                             98

independent auditor have been retained to complete all the necessary groundwork.
Finally, MOTlaunched broadband services inthe Beirut area inMay 2007.

Finally, the privatization of mobile telecommunications through the issuance of two
mobile licenses i s expected to be launched by mid-September2007. Transaction advisors,
along with a technical consultant and a financial auditor, were officially appointed inJune
2007. Legal due diligence has been completed for one mobile operator, and i s being
completed for the other. The transaction designi s currently beingfinalized.

Power Sector

The Power Sector reform planfirst consists o fthree pillars:
    0   Strengtheningsector policy-making capacity ;
    0   Enhancing the operational efficiency of Electricite Du Liban (EDL) to supply
        electric energy that i s socially, economically and environmentally sustainable;
    0   Corporatizationandprivatization o f EDL

Inorder to strengthen sector policy-making capacity, consultants have beenselectedto
provide technical assistance to the Ministry o f Energy and Water (MoEW). At the
operational planning level, Electricite' de France (EdF) has been hired to develop a
Master Plan for the Power Sector, includinga Public InvestmentPlan (PIP) for generation
and transmission, and will start inJuly 2007.

To enhance the operational efficiency of Electricite Du Liban, a consultancy team has
been selected to perform operational, financial, accounting, legal and contract
management activities at EDL. Moreover, the government i s working on reinforcing the
capacity o f the EDL finance department, and a financial auditor was appointed to audit
2002-2006 EDL financial statements. In addition,         the operation and maintenance of
Zahrani and Beddawi plants has been subcontracted to a private company, and another
private company has been contracted to supervise these operation and maintenance
activities. Finally, a contract was signedwith Egypt inApril 2007, committing the supply
o fNatural Gas to the Beddawi plant starting the second quarter o f 2008. The Government
o f Lebanon i s also examining the provision o f the Zahrani power plant with Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) through a floating storage and re-gasification unit. Finally, a contract
was signed and work has started since July 2006 for the establishment o f a National
Control Center (NCC) to audit grid performance and enable electricity import from
neighboring countries.

Inorder to corporatize and privatize EDL,consultants have been selected to assist the
government o f Lebanon in power sector restructuring. In addition, the government o f
Lebanon i s working to establish a power sector regulatory agency. In June 2007, a
contract was signed between the Lebanese government and the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) to appoint IFC as an advisor in the transaction to license Independent
Power Producers (IPPs) in Lebanon. An IPP Working Group has been formed, and the
process should be fully launched by the fourth quarter o f 2007. Finally, an international


                                               99

consultancy has beenappointed inNovember 2006, and i s performing the groundwork for
the tenderingo flicenses to private companies to install andoperate meters.


                                    VI. CONCLUSION

The Paris I11reform program is a key priority to the Government o fLebanon. Progress of
reforms, including monitoring and evaluation, are currently carried out by the GR PCO
andthe three IMCs chaired byH.E.the President o fthe Council o fMinisters.

To assist inthis effort, program charters and detailed workplans have been developed for
these reforms, along with critical milestones and deliverables. The Government realizes
that the implementation o f the whole reform program would require time. Nevertheless,
the short-term initiatives identifiedinthis document are expected to yield tangible impact
by end o f 2007. Some of these short-term projects would require funding or technical
assistance.

The Government of Lebanonexpresses its full commitment to the implementation o f the
Paris I11reform program. The Government, hence, highly appreciates the World Bank's
support to the proposed program, and looks forward to a sustained partnership with the
Bank to develop social, economic and infrastructure sectors inLebanon.

TRA is working with the Higher Council for Privatization (HCP) and the Ministry o f
Telecommunications (MOT) to ensure the success of the licensing/privatization of the
two incumbentmobile networks, inline with the Government of Lebanon's commitments
inthe context of the Paris I11donor conference. TRA is taking the lead inpreparing the
licenses, the auction rules (in consultation with HCP), and the relevant regulations, while
HCP and MOT are working on preparing the expectedtransfer of mobile network assets.
The mobile licensing/privatization will be carried out in a transparent, competitive
auction. It is the first step inthe liberalization ofthe mobile telecommunications market.

         ANNEX 3-BACKGROUND TO THE LEBANESEELECTRICITY SECTOR


1. SECTOR STRUCTURE

The primarylegal framework for Lebanon's electricity sector is currently articulated inDecree Law
6919 (14/12/2001), which mainly spells out the role o f Electricit6 du Liban (EdL), the national
electricity utility, andLaw 462 (02/09/2002), which defines the roles o f the Government, the various
entities in the sector, and that o f the private sector, as well as the structure o f the sector, and the
principles o fprivate sector involvement.

The Council of Ministers and the Ministry of Energy & Water

Key decisions on Lebanon's strategic energy issues are made at the Council o f Ministers level, but
uponsubmission of proposals on specific projects or electricity sector draft laws and decrees by the
Minister o f Energy and Water (MOEW).            The latter is responsible for the petroleum sector,
electricity and water sectors and i s organized around three main Directorate Generals (namely,
Exploitation, Hydraulic and Electricity Resources as well as Petroleum).

The MOEW is primarily responsible for the formulation of energy sector policy, regulation, sector
development planning, and electricity and petroleum product price determination. Pricing i s also
subject to approval by the Council o fMinisters. The MOEW has also beenmandated to import fuel
oil and diesel onbehalf o f EdL.

Lebanon Oil Installations

Lebanon Oil Installations (LOI), a state-owned company, imports gas oil and fuel oil that i s sold to
local distributors. After 1987, in addition to the LOI, private companies were also allowed to
import petroleum products (for example Wardieh Holding Inc., Total Liban, Coral Oil Company,
etc.).   LO1 i s also in charge o f the construction, management, operation and maintenance o f
petroleum product installations. It works as a commercial entity and controls storage facilities,
research laboratories and two refineries (Beddawi and Zahrani). These two refineries, however,
ceased operation in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and are now used only as import terminals and
storage facilities for refinedoil products.

LO1 owns the Lebanese share o f the Syria-Lebanon gas pipeline (GASYLE), up to Homs in Syria
and the adjacent land. LO1also built a natural gas station at its Tripoli branch, inorder to receive
the gasthat would come from Syria andeventually supplythe Beddawipower plant.

Diesel for transportation i s imported directly by distributors. MOEW issues licenses for import and
sale o f gasoline and other petroleumproducts.

The LPG market is dominated by a private monopoly. The Government is responsible for LPG
marketregulationbycontrolling purchasesthrough a quota systemandLPGpricing.

Prime Minister's OfJice


                                                  134

Given the gravity of the power sector in Lebanon, its dramatic impact on the country's economy,
people's basic needs, and Government's budget, and given the urgency to reverse the negative trend
o f the sector, the Prime Minister's Office i s directly involved inensuringthat the Government sector
reform program be quickly finalized, endorsed, and, more importantly implemented. To ensure
close oversight o f the reforms and the key associated decisions, the Prime Minister chairs an Inter-
Ministerial Reform Committee for the sector which meets regularly.

Ministry of Finance

Given the substantial fiscal burden o f the energy sector on Lebanon's budget, and the regular and
need for the Government to subsidize, through means o f transfers, the national utility, the Ministry
o f Finance also monitors the finances and applies strict oversight on the sector. As a key member o f
the high-level inter-ministerial committee on energy, it has been ensuring that prompt and subsidy
reducing reform measuresare prioritized underthe reform program.

Electricite` du Liban

EdL is a state-owned electricity utility created in 1964. It currently holds a monopoly on electricity
generation, transmission and distribution, with the exception o f three private concessions operating
inhydro-generation andarrangements withfour private concessions onthe distribution side.

EdL is expected to participate in the formulation o f the electricity sector policy and the design of
electricity projects. Its official mandate calls for protecting national priorities and the environment,
meetingregionaldevelopment goals, promoting competition and safe-guarding consumer interests.
EdL's daily operational decisions are made by its management, while more strategic decisions are
made by a seven-member Board o f Directors, appointed, along with the Director General, by the
Council o f Ministers.      EdL counts 2,300 staff today, far below what a utility operating a
comparative system should count. Furthermore, with its personnel having an average age o f 57
years, EdLhas been experiencing a steady decrease instaff, due for retirement. Unfortunately, EdL,
as all state-owned enterprises in Lebanon, i s currently under a national hiring fkeeze, making it
particularly challenging to replace and strengthenan already-weak work force, as it can only rely on
limitedcontracting to fillpart o fits wideninghumanresource gap.

Councilfor Reconstruction and Development

Over the past 17years, the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), which had initially
been set up to replace the Ministry o f Planning to streamline and speed up the approval and
financing o f reconstruction projects, plays a key role in the planning and financing o f electricity
infrastructure projects.

2. MAINCHALLENGES AND ISSUES

The sector faces several challenges, among them:

Reliance on importedfuel for power generation


                                                    135

Enjoyingvery little natural resources o f its own, Lebanon is obliged to import most o f its energy to
meet its electricity needs, only marginally complemented by in-country hydro-generation and
biomass production. Petroleum products constitute 96% o f the primary energy imported and coal
the remaining4%.

Lebanon's total installed capacity i s estimated at about 2,243 Megawatt (MW) with thermal
generation providing the bulk o f the electricity supply (close to 90%) and the remaining balance
contributed by hydro-plants. Around 120 MW o f capacity i s ensured though imports. The main
issue in the generation o f power i s the reliance on gas-oil in the absence o f natural gas in the two
combined-cycle plants which account for about 50% o f installed capacity. This comes at a cost o f
approximately US$700/ton instead o f US$350/ton. Recent estimates show that substantial savings
could be realized, should there be a switch to natural gas. Indeed, at today's oil prices, annual
savings from fuel switchingcould reach close to US$400 million.24.

More generally, all of the power plants suffer from shortage in spare parts, lack o f maintenance,
unskilledoperators, and investmentfor modernization.

Lebanon's hydro potential consists of three hydro stations operated by state-owned local offices,
namelyKadisha, Bared, and Litani, andtwo stations operated by concessions, namelyNahr Ibrahim
and Safa. The total hydro capacity i s about 280 MW and supplied over 1,000 GWh to the grid in
2005, though seasonal productionvaries greatly dependingon rainfalls.

Since 1995, a small portion o f Lebanon's electricity supply has also been met through electricity
imports from Syria through the 66 kV lines in the Center-East and a 220 kV line in the North o f
Lebanon. The total import capacity i s equivalent to around 120 MW.

A Demand-SupplyGap

Today, recorded electricity supply i s insufficient to meet demand. Since the end o f the 1975-1990
civil war, EdLhas operated at full capacity with no reserve margin(international standard i s 10%to
15%). Power cuts have beenendemic with several commercial and industrialconsumers reporting
200 cuts per year. The power suppliedby EdLreflected inhistorical statistics therefore only reflects
EDL'scapacity to supply electricity, andnot the actual demand.

The average load factor o f the Lebanese system was 46% in 2006, with a load factor o f 40% for
residential consumers and 50% for industries. The corresponding peak demand for EdL in 2006
was 1,984 MW andthe total system peak demand i s estimated as 2,316 MW, including 332 MW o f
self-generation in the same year. However, the capacity of self-generator may be higher, as the
proposed estimate i s based on the assumption that the load factor o f self-generators i s the same as
for E&. The recent Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) indicated that industries use their self-
generation capacity during the peak hours (four hours daily) due to relatively better price, and rely
on EdLfor the remainder o f the day.

The extent o f self-generation is difficult to evaluate and is not recorded. However, recent studies
and investigations provide a basis for estimating the demand served through self-generation.

plant by mid2009.

                                                     136

According to the 2004 study prepared by Chubu Electric Power Company, as part of the
Hydrocarbon Strategy Study, about 80% of industrial users and 75% of commercial buildings have
their own self-generation capacity. The ICA indicated that 100% of large and medium-sized
entrepreneurs surveyed declared they have their own generators. As they do not rely exclusively on
their own generators to meet their needs, but call on EdL during the low tariff period, it i s estimated
that large and medium industries with high voltage connections rely for about 40% of the time on
fuel oil fired self-generation, and 60% of the time on EdL. For low voltage consumers, the estimate
i s that small diesel generators meet about 10% of their demand. The resulting estimate i s that -
overall - self-generationmeets about 20% ofthe demand.

Poor networkperformance

The transmission network i s fraught with problems. The main 220kV backbone grid i s not yet fully
completed, nor is the long-planned national load control center in place (although a contract has
been awarded for this). Major investments are also required in the medium- and low-voltage
transmission and distribution systems as well as inmetering to reduce transmission and distribution
losses. But EdL's worsening deficiency in managerial and technical capacity, as well as poor
planning and execution of funding have long delayedimplementation of investment programs.

Technical losses are estimated at about 15%, while another 17.8% loss i s explained by illegal
connections. The billing information system is reported to be outdated and poorly maintained
resulting inhigh degree of errors and inaccuracy in monitoring billing and collections performance
(see below).

A substantial share of the electricity demandmet by EDL is not billed

The widening gap between generationand billing was further aggravated in 2006 due to the impact
ofthe July 2006 hostilities.

 ource: EDL Billing &Production data

Unbilledelectricity is not recorded and can, therefore, only be estimated as the difference between
recorded generated electricity and billed electricity, minus the technical losses. Assuming that
generation and import data are accurate, overall losses in2005 were evaluated at 3,372 GWh (33%
o f generated electricity). According to EdL, technical losses represent 15% o f electricity produced
or 22% o f electricity billed, and by difference, power thefts represent 17.8% o f generated electricity
(27% o f electricity billed).

Electricity tar@ are high by regional standards but too low to cover cost

Lebanon's electricity tariff level i s highby regional standards. The overall average tariff for 2006,
based on billed energy, i s LL 1 4 l k W h(US$cents 9.4 kwh).Compared to electricity prices inthe
region, the Lebanese tariff level falls in the upper bracket. Indeed, average tariff in Morocco (9),
Jordan (7), Tunisia (4.6), or Egypt (2.8) i s equal or belowLebanon's average tariff.

Inthe region, Lebanonpresents more similarities with countries largelydepending on imported fuel
for power generation, such as Morocco and Jordan, and the Lebanese tariff level i s comparable to
these countries. The fuel import structure o f the comparable countries, however, i s rather different.
InMorocco, power generation is dependenton imported coal, HFO, and to a lesser extent, on gas,
but not diesel, while Jordan does not import any diesel fuel. In contrast, Lebanon is in a unique
situation for a non-landlocked country to depend on diesel for half o f its fuel (1.10 million tons of
diesel against 1.O milliontons o f HFO in2006), with a considerable cost penalty.

According to the sector regulation, the EdL tariff i s set and approved by MOEW, based on EdL's
recommendation. Inpractice, however, it has been set by the Council o f Minister. The tariff i s not
based on the cost o f supply, and does not reflect the system's long run marginal cost. The 2006
tariff structure is summarizedbelow.

Opportunities exist to improve the tariff structure.      The residential tariff subsidizes the lower
tranches o f consumption, but the tranches are wide and the invertedblock tariff should peak at about
300 kWh, as is the case inmost countries, instead o f the 500 kWhthresholds at present; consumers
with a consumptiono felectricity inexcess of 300 kWhmay not qualify as economically vulnerable.

The tariff for highand medium-voltage supply to the concessions and few other customers seems to
allow for an excessive distribution margin or high voltage discount, typically in the range o f US$
cents 1.5 to 2 kWh, with a considerable loss o f revenue for EdL. .

The poor tariff structure encourages self-generation in industry. The average tariff in industry is
US$ cents 10kWh on average (US$cents 20kWh at peak hours) and the peak tariff for industry i s
below the cost o f self generation using HFO, which encourages industries to operate their own
generator and to reduce their recourse to EdL. The existing tariff structure therefore makes it
financially attractive for large and medium size industriesto shift to self-generation duringpeak and
intermediate demand. For large residential consumers, once they have purchased a generator to
protect against power supply un-reliability, the cost o frunningtheir generator i s competitive against
the EdL tariff.

EdL's management systems are outdatedand inefficient

Accounting and financial reporting systems are not functioning adequately and do not easily allow
for the annual closing o f EdL's accounts and their auditing. The consumer management system i s
not reliable while the humanresources management system i s also inefficient.

The serious technical deficiencies in the sector are closely related to the poor governance o f the
sector and the lack o f implementation o f much needed reforms o f EdL. Indeed, a major problem is
the legal status of EdL as a non-commercial "EtablissementPubZic", which puts EdL's staff under
the status o f civil servants, with an inadequate pay scale to retain competent managers and technical
staff and career management rules incompatible with the operation o f a utility. EdL's staff i s about
57 years old on average and EdL i s currently losing around 150 staff per year to retirementout o f its
2,300 current employees. This is further aggravated by the lack o f a long term investment plan to
orient investment decisions based on economic and technical criteria and to ensure that investment
decisions are made in a timely manner. Finally, the vicious circle o f lack of financing due to the
socio-political difficulty to charge cost reflective tariffs, leading to lack o f investment and poor
service, which in turn encourages power thefts and poor payment discipline, results in a widening
financial gap. This gap i s made that much more vulnerable to changes in international oil prices as

General

1) Demand: the annual growth rate of electricity demand to the grid as been assumed as follows, reflecting
an increasing consumption from the network as service improves and the need for backup generation is
reduced:

Deinand Increase       2007      2008     2009      2010       2011      2012     2013   2014   2015

This rate reflects the aggregated growth rate of electricity demand to the grid from all classes of customers
(high-voltage, low-voltage, government, concessions, etc.), based on the base case growth rate of Lebanon's
GDP (source: IMF) and the income elasticity of each class of customers (source: Chubu report), as shown
below:

    Equivalentto Private Concesssionsand Kadisha under EDL customerclassification

The electricity demand used for the base year (2006) was calculated as EDL's billed electricity reported for
2006, majored by electricity thefts (17.8%) and decreased by the estimated level of self-generation by class of
customers.

2) Fuel Prices: all fuel prices were kept constant, using US$ 65.9/bbl as reference (US$64/bbl plus 3% to
reflect Lebanon's specific contractual terms with oil suppliers). US$64/bbl is based on the IMF's forecast
price for crude oil (and also the 2006 average price of a barrel of crude oil recorded by the World Bank for
Dubai, Brent i3 WTI).

2.I.Diesel price.

Diesel was priced at US$ 613.06/ton, based on the above price of crude oil per barrel and an aggregated
conversion ratio of 9.3, calculated as detailed below.

2.I.I.For Convertina Crude Oil price Der barrel to Gasoil (Diesel)DriceDer ton

    (a) Conversion of Crude Oil price Der barrel to Diesel Drice Der barrel

         The conversion was calculated as follows: Crude Oil price/bbl X 1.24 = Diesel pricelbbl with 1.24
         being the average price difference between these two fuel types in 2006 on the Mediterranean oil
         market.

    (b) Conversionof Diesel mice Der barrel to Diesel urice Der ton

         The conversion was calculated as follows: Diesel price/bbl X 7.52 = Diesel pricelton

         With 7.52 being the fixed unit conversion factor for Diesel.


                                                           141

    (c) The resultina aaareaated conversion factor

        An aggregated factor of 9.3 reflecting the two consecutive conversions described above was
        obtained as follows:

        Crude Oil pricelbbl X 1.24X 7.52 = Crude Oil pricelbbl X 9.3 = Diesel price/ton

2.2.Heavy Fuel Oil I% Sulfur Content (HFO I%)

Heavy fuel oil 1% was priced at US$ 3ll/ton, based on the above price of crude oil per barrel and an
aggregated conversion ratio of 4.72, calculated as detailed below.

2.2.1.For Convertina Crude Oil Drice Der barrel to Heavv Fuel Oil 1% (HF0 I%) mice Der ton

    (d) Conversion of Crude Oil Drice Der barrel to HFO 1% mice Der barrel

         The conversion was calculated as follows: Crude Oil price/bbl X 0.71 = HFO 1% price/bbl with 0.71
         being the average price difference between these two fuel types in 2006 on the Mediterranean oil
         market.

    (e) Conversion of HFO 1% Drice Der barrel to HFO 1% mice Der ton

         The conversion was calculated as follows: HFO 1% price/bbl X 6.67 = HFO 1% pricelton

         With 6.67 being the fixed unit conversion factor for HFO 1%

    (9 The resultina aaareaatedconversion factor

         An aggregated factor of 4.72 reflecting the two consecutive conversions described above was
         obtained as follows:

         Crude Oil price/bblX 0.71 X 6.67 = Crude Oil price/bbl X 4.72 = HFO 1% price/ton

Note:The fact that the price of HFO 1% is inferior to the Crude Oil price is mainly driven by a market where
more refined, environmentally-friendly and energy efficient fuels (such as Diesel for example) are in higher
demand than heavier fuels, which are in excess supply on the market. As a result, the cost of crude oil is
more than recovered by refining companies by the sale price of refined fuels, allowing them to sell heavier
fuels at lower price than the Crude Oil price.

2.3. Natural Gas

Natural gas was priced at 5.65$/mmbtu (piped to the plant) and Il$/mmbtu (LNG to plant). Details of the
calculation described below.

3) Total Fuel Costs: fuel cost projections from 2007 on have been calculated as the total volume (in tons) of
HFO 1% and Diesel reportedly consumed in 2006 by EDL (inflated to reflect the annual rate of demand
growth above), multiplied by the respectivefuel prices per ton.

I)Improved billing: calculatesthe savings derived from improvements in billingthrough the incremental
implementation of 3 theft reduction programs, as proposed by CRA, reducing annual theft by 6.7% in 2008 up
to 60% by 2012. This is equivalent to bringing EDL's 2007 theft level (as % of total supplied electricity) from
18% to 8% by 2012. The calculation of billing has also factored the annual growth in demand.

Actions Impactina Expenses

1) Fuel Conversion of Beddawi to Gas: calculates the savings from switching the Beddawi plant supply
from diesel to Egyptian piped natural gas as of July 1, 2008.

The unit price of piped gas (US$ 5.65/mmbtu) was calculated based on an agreed unit price of US$
5.00/mmbtu under the recent agreement with Egypt and an additional US$ 0.65/mmbtu for transit through
Syria.

The annual savings from the fuel conversion at Beddawi plant are calculated as the annual reduction in fuel
cost.

2) Transmission and Distribution Network Optimization: the reduction in technical losses, derived from a
more efficient electricity dispatch in the electric grid and the associated improved distribution of flows and
loads among sub-stations and network lines, and the improvements to the distribution from private
management which is under tender by the recruited consulting firm CRA, leads to reduced volume of energy
required to meet a given demand.           Therefore, the savings from the optimization of EDL's system
management and its associated drop in technical losses from 15% in 2006 to 10% by 2012 were calculated
as the share of total fuel cost that could be reduced annually.

3) Power Purchase: this is the cost of purchasing power from small local private producers (mostly hydro)
and from Syria (120 MW), using 2006 levels as a baseline and assuming an annual average cost growth rate
of 2%.

4) Wages: this is the total cost of EDL's wages, assuming IO%, 10% and 8% increases in wage costs over
2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively,due to the corporatization and restaffing of EDL.

5) O&M: this is the cost of works and services as well as transports, using 2006 as a baseline and assuming
an annual average cost growth rate of 2%.

6) Other: these expenses cover Board expenses, various taxes, and general O&M expenses, using 2006 as
a baseline and assuming an annual average cost growth rate of 2%.

Summary of Assumptions for the Additional Measures

1) Fuel Conversion of Zahrani to LNG: the potential additional savings obtained from switching the Zahrani
plant supply from diesel to LNG as of January 1, 2010, were estimated as detailed below.

The unit price of LNG (US$ Illmbtu) was based on the LNG price the Lebanese Government expected to
get in any future negotiated contract for LNG supply.

The annual savings from the fuel conversion at Zahrani plant are calculated as the annual reduction in fuel
cost, in the same way as itwas the case of Beddawi, but decreased by:

    LNG Terminal investment cost, estimated at US160 million, based on international experience, and
    amortized over 15 years. The international experience refers to Italy, Pakistan, and California, where
    larger floating facilities were used for an average investment cost of US$150 million. Investment cost
    includes a floating storage and re-gasification unit (FSRU);
    An operating costs calculated as 3.3% of the total investment cost, based on international experience;
0   US$ 1.30/mbtu for transport costs.

2) Fuel Monitoring: the potential additional savings derived from a stricter fuel chain monitoring (of both
heavy fuel oil and diesel) were estimated based on a 5% annual improvement in EDL's overall fuel
consumption, minus an estimated US$ 1 million/year for surveillance costs, based on international
experience.

3) Revision of Heavy Fuel Oil specs: the potential additional savings derived from switching heavy fuel oil
(HFO) standard from 1% to 3.5% sulfur content were calculated assuming a 4% annual HFO cost saving,
less the annual cost of environmental mitigation measures through Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD)
investments (estimated at US$ 40 million). EDL is currently supplied with the 1% sulfur content HFO from the
Black Sea market (the only available market) while its choice for supply of 3.5% sulfur content HFO is much
wider and, therefore, prices are likely to be more competitive. The 4% cost saving is derived from
international experience.
