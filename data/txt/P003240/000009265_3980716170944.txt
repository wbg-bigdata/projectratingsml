IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Economic Recovery and
Investment Promotion (ERIP) adjustment operation for which a credit of SDR 90 million
(US$140 million equivalent) was approved on July 11, 1995 and made effective on September 6,
1995. The credit was closed on December 31, 1997, compared with the original closing date of
December 31, 1996. The first tranche, released upon effectiveness, was fully disbursed by
August 1995; the second tranche was released on August 22, 1997 and the credit was fully
disbursed. The project was not co-financed.
This report was prepared by Emile B. Sawaya and Lucy Fye, Private Sector Finance
(AFTP1) of the Africa Region and David Greene (consultant). It was reviewed by Phyllis
Pomerantz, Country Director (AFC02), and Ataman Aksoy, Manager (AFTM1),
Macroeconomics 1.
Preparation of this ICR started during the Bank's final supervision and completion
mission of February/March 1998. It was based on materials in the program file, including the
Memorandum of the President (MOP), Development Credit Agreement (DCA), supervision
reports, progress reviews and monitoring reports by the Borrower. The Borrower contributed to
the preparation of the ICR by supplying the views reflected in the final mission's aide-memoire,
preparing its own evaluation of the Program, and commenting on the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    The objective of the Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion (ERIP) Credit was to
support the Government's stabilization and economic reform effort. Specifically, ERIP supported
continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies designed to stabilize the economy;
increasing the supply of long-term capital and improving its allocation; establishing a new
national basic pension scheme; and strengthening the mining sector, by privatizing the parastatal
mining company, and improving the sector's legal, fiscal and institutional frameworks. The
objectives of the project were, to a large extent, achieved and its impact on economic
performance has been positive. Substantial progress has been made toward macroeconomic
stabilization, albeit not smoothly and not without fiscal relapses. Inflation has been reduced by
improving fiscal performance, while protecting budgetary allocations for vital social services. A
Value Added Tax (VAT) system has been successfully launched. Government's support for
private investment has been reoriented: the government's financial institutions are no longer
providing directly long term finance to private enterprises. A new apex institution is mobilizing
concessionary funds for on-lending to private investors through commercial channels. The
Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) has suspended its lending activities and is concentrating on
loan collections, but vigilance will be required to ensure that it does not resume lending, that its
staffing and expenses are consistent with its reduced functions, and that all loan collections (net
of expenses) are transferred to the Treasury. Legislation establishing a new national basic
pension system has been enacted, but several critical issues remain to be resolved, including
contribution rates, benefit levels and transitional arrangements for present members of Zambia
National Provident Fund (ZNPF). Also measures have been taken to regulate private pension
funds and insurance companies. Finally, the stage has been set for rapid, environmentally sound
development of the mining sector by efforts to privatize Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), and the establishment of a supportive legal and institutional framework for private
investment in mining.
2.    This has been accomplished despite a generally less than favorable external environment,
including poor weather, a volatile world copper market and sharp declines in copper prices, and
the hiatus in bilateral balance-of-payments support.  Sustainability of the Government's
economic reform program, and, indeed, future economic progress will depend critically, however
on ensuring that sufficient and timely balance-of-payments support is available for the
implementation of the macroeconomic program. This will require continued Government
commitment to the economic reform process and the stabilization program. It requires, above
all, the expeditious conclusion of the privatization of ZCCM, which is essential for ensuring the
rapid rehabilitation of the mining sector and for providing a clear signal to investors of Zambia's



commitment to private enterprise. It also requires addressing the concerns of donors about
governance issues, including economic governance issues.
3.    The economy responded positively to the Government's program supported by the ERIP
credit, as evidenced by lower inflation, increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1996 and
1997, rising private investment, expanding nontraditional exports, and increased interest of
international mining enterprises in exploring Zambia's mineral resources. The Government and
other stakeholders have indicated that they consider the performance of the Bank in the design
and supervision of the ERIP operation to have been satisfactory. On the whole, the performance
of the Government in implementing the ERIP Program was satisfactory. Although the release of
the Second Tranche was delayed about a year because it took longer than expected to prepare the
legislation and institutional arrangements needed to regulate and supervise insurance companies
and pension fund management companies, and to complete the restructuring of DBZ, these tasks
were eventually completed satisfactorily. The first phase of privatizing ZCCM, whose objective
was to prepare the ZCCM Privatization Plan and seek the requisite approvals proceeded
smoothly, and in accordance with an ambitious timetable. The process also proceeded well until
the bid opening and evaluation stage of the second phase, whose objective was to actually
privatize the company. In March 1997, changes were made in negotiating leadership, strategy
and tactics, as well as in the objectives of the sales process to place more emphasis upon the cash
up-front component of the deal. This led to delays and many of the negotiations encountered
problems. The delays and the problems facing the negotiators were most serious for the package
that includes the Nchanga and Nkana mining divisions, ZCCM's largest and most profitable.
4.    The lessons of the ERIP project are: (1) Timing of reform is critical. For example, an
effort to push the privatization of ZCCM in 1991-92, would probably have been unsuccessful, as
the Government was not yet committed to such a course. Moreover, once Government
commitment is in place, the pace of reform must allow for building consensus among
stakeholders. (2) Recovery of the economy after stabilization can take longer than expected, but
should not be a reason for despair. The Zambian case illustrates that stabilization, coupled with
vigorous structural adjustment will ultimately produce positive results. (3) Availability of
technical assistance funds can facilitate acquisition of critical technical expertise, if task
managers and government have flexibility in'allocating these funds to problem areas as they
arise. (4) Adjustment programs are easier to implement and supervise as well as more effective,
if they have fewer, but more critical conditions, fewer tranches and shorter disbursement profiles.
(5) Continuity of task management is beneficial, as is having the manager of the adjustment
operation also responsible for related technical assistance projects.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.    The ERIP operation built on the achievements of the preceding operations, while also
targeting areas where progress had not, so far, been adequate. The key elements of the ERIP
Reform Program were: (1) execution of the macroeconomic program consistent with the
objectives of stabilization, while strengthening the system of taxation by introducing the VAT,
and protecting fiscal expenditures on critical social programs; (2) reorienting the role of
Government in the financial sector in support of private investment by ending direct state lending
for private investment, mobilizing term foreign exchange resources through a new apex
institution, and ensuring the financial health of contractual saving institutions -- insurance
companies and pension funds; (3) establishing a new national pension system; and (4) improving
the legal, fiscal, environmental and institutional framework for the mining sector, strengthening
the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development (MMMD), and adopting a plan for the
privatization of ZCCM.
B. Achievement of Objectives
2.    The Macroeconomic Program. Zambia made significant progress towards economic
stabilization during the period of implementation of the ERIP Program (July 1995 to December
1997). Along the way, there were problems of budgetary management, but these were
adequately addressed, and fiscal performance improved from year to year. The Government's
cash deficits have been relatively small (there was a surplus equivalent to 0.7% of GDP in 1995,
and deficits of 2.5% in 1996 and 1.8% in 1997), domestic arrears were reduced, and there was
virtually no net domestic financing of the budget during 1995-1997 taken as a whole.
3.    The combination of relative fiscal balance and tight monetary policy led to a deceleration
of inflation, although this task was at times complicated and slowed down by the fiscal relapses.
As measured by the CPI (end of period), inflation declined from 48% in 1995 to 18% in 1997.
Moderating inflation had a favorable impact on interest rates: commercial bank rates fell from
52% at end-1995 to 24% at end-1997, and the treasury bill rate fell from 42% at the end of 1995
to 13% at the end of 1997. Exchange rates remained fairly stable, with the market rate
depreciating only 9% relative to the dollar in 1997, compared to a depreciation of almost 30%
the previous year. There was, however, an acceleration in the rate of depreciation of the kwacha



2
in early 1998 because of the shortfall in ZCCM's foreign exchange earnings--due to declining
production and low copper prices--and the continued hiatus in balance of payments support.
4.    The IMF Board approved the midterm review of the first annual ESAF program under the
three-year SAF/ESAF arrangement in February 1997, allowing the 1996 Paris Club Agreement
to go into effect formally. Discussions with the IMF staff on the second-year ESAF were
concluded in December 1997. Presentation of the second-year ESAF to the IMF Board was put
on hold until after the May 1998 Consultative Group Meeting because of uncertainties in external
financing. It has now been further delayed pending clarification of the potential fiscal impact of
delays in privatizing the bulk of ZCCM.
5.    As agreed under the ERIP Program, the Value Added Tax was implemented, on schedule,
in July 1995. The Revenue Authority did an outstanding job introducing and gaining acceptance
for the VAT. Collections on internal transactions (the VAT is also applied to imports) increased
from K 108 billion in 1995 to K 184 billion in 1997. Total VAT collections in 1997, including
the tax on imports, were about K 300 billion, providing almost a quarter of total tax revenues.
6.    The Bank and the Government first agreed on minimum targets for social sector spending
under the first ESAC, approved in 1994. Under ERIP the objective was to maintain the share of
social sector spending. Actual budget outlays for the social sectors in 1995 were at or above the
levels specified in the ERIP Letter of Development Policy. The share of total social sector
spending in non-debt service budget releases was 35% (compared to the minimum target of
33%), and the share of non-personnel spending in these sectors was 25% (compared to the
minimum target of 24%). Similar targets for social sector spending in 1996 under the ESAC II
Program were fulfilled.
7.    Strengthening the Financial Sector The Government is no longer playing the role of
direct provider of term finance to private enterprises. The financially distressed Eximbank and
Lima Bank have been closed and are being wound up. The ERIP Program also called for the
Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) to cease direct lending and to be restructured into an apex
institution responsible for mobilizing and on-lending concessionary finance through commercial
banks, and for its loan portfolio to be transferred to a separate collection agency. Transferring
DBZ's portfolio to a collection agency proved to be legally problematic, and creating a new apex
institution was not accepted by parliament. Instead, the objectives were accomplished by having
DBZ's Board of Directors suspend lending operations and order the DBZ management to
concentrate on the collection of non-performing loans. A new apex institution, Zambia
Enterprise Finance Ltd., has been established under the Companies Act to mobilize
concessionary external financing to be on-lent by commercial banks to the private sector. DBZ,
however, has not been wound up and vigilance will be required to ensure that it does not resume
lending operations, that its staffing and expenses are consistent with its reduced functions, and
that all loan collections (net of expenses) are transferred to the Treasury.
8.    Parliament has enacted legislation to establish clear, enforceable regulatory frameworks
for insurance companies and pension funds. Under this legislation, which was drafted in
consultation with the industry, all insurance companies and brokers and pension fund managers



3
will be licensed. A regulatory agency, the Registrar of Pensions and Insurance, has been
established in the Ministry of Finance. A well-qualified Registrar and Deputy Registrar for
Pension Funds have been appointed and other staff are being recruited, the process of
consultation with the industry is underway and drafti ng of regulations will begin soon.
9.    Establishing a National Pension Scheme. Legislation has been passed to establish a
National Pension Scheme and to transform the existing Zambia National Provident Fund (ZNPF)
into the agency responsible for operating it. The ILO is in the process of drafting proposals for
transforming ZNPF into the administrative agency. In the meantime, several critical issues
remain to be resolved, including contribution rates, benefit levels and transitional arrangements
for present members of ZNPF.
10.   Privatizing ZCCM and Promoting Private Investment in Mining. The privatization
of ZCCM, per se, was not a part of the policy agenda of the MMD Government when it took
office in late 1991. Rather, the new Government hoped that the efficiency and profitability of
ZCCM could be improved and that investments in new mining projects could be carried out as
joint ventures with private international companies. It was not until 1993-94, when ZCCM ran
into severe difficulties maintaining its production levels and efforts to improve its efficiency had
failed, that it was recognized that there was no alternative to privatization. In the January 1995
Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance announced that ZCCM would be privatized within two
years.
11.   A plan for the privatization of ZCCM was prepared by ZPA with the assistance of
investment banking and legal advisors financed under the IDA ERIP Technical Assistance
(ERIPTA) Credit. The plan, which called for dividing ZCCM's assets into packages for sale, was
approved by the Boards of Directors of ZCCM and the Zambia Privatization Agency and by the
Cabinet and issued in May 1996. This fulfilled the specific condition for the release of the
Second Tranche of the ERIP Credit, and set the stage for beginning the implementation phase of
the ZCCM Privatization Plan.
12.   Although the ultimate objective of the ERIP program was the actual privatization of
ZCCM, this was not made a condition of the ERIP Credit in order to keep the playing field level
for ZCCM and the Government vis-a-vis potential buyers. The first phase of privatizing ZCCM,
with the objective of preparing the ZCCM Privatization Plan and seeking the requisite approvals
proceeded smoothly, and in accordance with what was at the time considered by most
stakeholders to be an ambitious timetable. The process also proceeded well in the early stages of
the second phase, when the objective was to actually privatize the company. Interested investors
were pre-qualified and asked to submit bids. By the target date of February 28, 1997, bids were
received for all the packages that were put out for competitive bidding. This was a very good
response, and a good testimony to the attractiveness of the new mining policies in Zambia, and to
the efforts of ZPA and the Advisors in marketing the ZCCM assets. At that time, ZPA and the
advisors continued to aim to complete the process by the end of Junle 1997. Many of the
stakeholders thought that was possible, and those that did not felt that slippages would be minor.



4
13.   There was a change in the leadership of the ZCCM negotiating team in March 1997. As a
consequence, there was a change in the negotiating strategy and tactics, as well as in the
objectives of the sales process, which placed more emphasis upon the cash up-front component
of the deal. Delays began to occur and many of the negotiations encountered problems.
Agreements to sell the Power Division and the Luanshya-Baluba, Kansanshi, and Chibuluma
mines were reached late in the third quarter of CY1997, several months later than planned. The
delays and the problems facing the negotiators were most serious for the package that includes
the Nchanga and Nkana mining divisions, ZCCM's largest and most profitable. As of the date of
this Implementation Completion Report (ICR), there still is no agreement between
Govemment/ZCCM and private sector buyers of these assets.
14.   Government is continuing its efforts to privatize ZCCM and aims to complete the process
in the third quarter of CY1998. This implies, in addition to a successful conclusion to the
negotiations for the sale of the Nchanga and Nkana mining divisions, the successful conclusion
to the sale of the Konkola mining division, including the Konkola Deep Mining Project, and the
sale of the remaining assets of the Mufulira division. It also implies the sale of Ndola Lirne
Company, the last major subsidiary of ZCCM for which bids have been received and are now
being evaluated.
15.   With respect to the mining sector, several measures have been taken to improve the legal
framework and the institutional support for mining investors. The Government adopted a new
Mining Sector Policy Statement in December 1995, the objective of which was to "ensure a self-
sustaining mineral-based industry, and encourage private investment in exploration and
development...." Also, a new Mining and Minerals Act was passed. It guarantees security of
title, unrestricted access to foreign exchange, companies' right to market products, and freedom
of commercial operation. It also provides for international arbitration of disputes. A new mining
fiscal regime was also put in place by amending relevant sections of the Income Tax Act, the
Customs and Excise Act and the Investment Act. The new fiscal regime concentrates taxation on
profits, rather than output and is non discretionary, and internationally competitive.
16.   Under the new mining environmental regulations, impact assessments will be required for
all new projects, and mining areas will have to be rehabilitated after decommissioning. All
licensees will be required to provide baseline studies, environmental engineering studies, an
environmental management plan, and a plan for rehabilitation after decommissioning.
17.   Progress has been made in strengthening the Ministry of Mines and Minerals
Development (MMMD). The mining title system is working well and new geological data bases
and maps are being prepared. MMMD has begun to implement recommendations of the studies
on institutional improvements, including the establishment of regional mine offices to assist
medium and small mining companies and gemstone miners.

C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
18.   Zambia's ability to carry out the macroeconomic stabilization program that is central to
the reform program has been made difficult by the limited room for maneuver that the country
has because of its continued heavy reliance on copper exports, its high debt service burden and
the key role played by international assistance and debt relief. Continued poor performance of
ZCCM and the volatility of the international copper market has made budgetary and balance of
payments management difficult. Copper still accounted for 56% of Zambia's exports in 1997
(copper and cobalt together accounted for 83%). The production of copper by ZCCM fell from
403,000 tons in 1993 to 307,000 tons in 1995, before stabilizing at an average of about 315,000
tons in 1996-97. The effects of production problems have been compounded by the volatility of
the international copper market. The price of copper fell from 133 cents per pound in December
1995 to about 80 cents in December 1997 and Zambia's gross copper receipts declined from
US$851 million in 1995 to US$613 million in 1997.
19.   The suspension of balance of payments support by bilateral donors in 1996 largely
because of their concern about governance issues has further complicated the tasks of budgetary
and balance of payments management. Balance of payments support from sources other than the
World Bank, which totaled US$ 133 million in 1995, amounted to only US$ 9 million in 1997.
20.   Past ICRs for adjustment operations in Zambia have noted that the technical and
administrative capacity of the Zambian Government is quite limited. This seems to have been
less of a problem in the case of the ERIP operation because: (1) the Government has gained
experience and confidence through implementation of past programs; (2) ERIP implementation
was supported by Bank-financed technical assistance in key areas; and (3) while the tasks to be
accomplished were complex, there were fewer of them and they were more clearly focused.
D. Project Sustainability
21.   The Government appears to be committed to continue making progress on the overall
economic reform program and that enhances the prospects for sustainability. Privatization is a
good example of how progress on implementation affects economic performance and impacts
sustainability. The progress on the privatization of non-mining companies by ZPA, which was
not included in the ERIP program, reflects the Government's commitment and has elicited a
good response from investors and is starting to show good results in terms of investment and
economic growth. During 1995-97, 152 companies were privatized, bringing the total number of
units privatized to 224 out of ZPA's working portfolio of 330.  Moreover, the Minister of
Finance in the 1998 Budget Speech announced that ZPA would begin work on the privatization
of the large parastatals, not yet part of its portfolio, including ZAMTEL, and other parastatals in
the hydrocarbon, transport and commercial banking sectors. However, the slowdown in the
privatization of ZCCM, which was a major focus of ERIP, poses serious risks to the economy's
recovery and the program's sustainability.



6
22.   Sustainability of the reform program will be enhanced if the government continues to
take the necessary measures to ensure the continuation of the economic recovery. Improved
economic conditions will, in turn, increase the political and social acceptability of the reform
effort and reinforce the positive impact of the Government's commitment to stabilization and
structural reform. Nonetheless, sustainability depends critically on the expeditious completion
of the ZCCM privatization. ZCCM's financial situation is precarious. Further delay could affect
its operations and its relations with its creditors. Completion of the sale would allow the
payment of the company's domestic arrears and provide a boost to the economy. Inflows of
foreign exchange resulting from the sales proceeds would provide some relief for Zambia's
presently critical foreign exchange reserve position. New owners taking control rapidly would
accelerate the process of improving efficiency and increasing output, which is in the company's
and the country's interests as well. Finally, the completion of the ZCCM privatization would
provide a strong positive signal to other potential investors in mining as well as other sectors.
23.   There are other factors influencing the programs sustaintability.  Unless sufficient
balance-of-payments support is available for the implementation of the macroeconomic program
over the next two years, the stabilization program could unravel. Ensuring that this does not
happen will require addressing the concerns of bilateral donors on governance matters, including
the Bank's concerns about economic governance issues. The Consultative Group meeting held
in Paris in May 1998 clarified that donor support will be forthcoming if further progress is made
on governance issues. Govemment has stated that it is fully committed to the strengthening of
governance in Zambia and is preparing a medium term program to strengthen the capacity of
institutions that promote and enhance good governance. Government is planning to request
donor support for its governance program.
E. Bank Performance
24.   Bank performance in preparing and supervising the project was satisfactory. The project
was better focused and structured than its predecessor PIRCs (Credits 2405-ZA and 2523-ZA),
had fewer tranches (two rather than three) and fewer, more specific and high priority conditions
for tranche release. Nevertheless, the tasks of macroeconomic stabilization, privatizing ZCCM,
liquidating government banks, establishing a regulatory framework for pension funds and
insurance companies, and establishing a new social security system, were undoubtedly the
maximum the Government could handle in the two years the ERIP was planned to cover. Some
elements of prior adjustment operations were, therefore, not included in the ERIP. For example,
because progress on the privatization of companies other than ZCCM, seemed assured, it was not
necessary to make this part of the ERIP program. On the other hand, the complex issue of civil
service reform, was not included in ERIP in order not to overload the agenda. In retrospect, the
reform agenda under ERIP could have been even more focused, with fence areas and related
conditionality.
25.  IDA's Technical Assistance credits played a vital role in ZCCM's privatization and
improving the legal and institutional framework for private sector mining. Funds from the earlier
Mining Sector Technical Assistance Credit (Cr. 2269-ZA) supported the development of the new
mining code and fiscal regimne, and the parallel ERIPTA Credit (Cr. 2875-ZA), including its



7
US$2 million project preparation facility advance funded the hiring of the legal and financial
advisors, whose role in the ZCCM privatization was indispensable. Use of the samne staff to
supervise the two TA credits and ERIP ensured close complementary of the operations.
26.   Supervision of the project was good. Supervision missions were frequent, especially
during the earlier stages of implementation. Bank staff provided timely and useful advice to the
Government and their role was appreciated. Discussions with the Government and other
stakeholders indicated that they also considered that the Bank had done a good job in preparing
and supervising the project.
F. Borrower Performance
27.   There were two problematic areas in project implementation. Release of the Second
Tranche of the Credit was delayed by about a year because it took longer than originally
expected to prepare the required legislation and to put in place the required institutional
arrangements for the regulatory regime for insurance and pension fund management companies.
Nevertheless, legislation was enacted and the agency responsible for supervision has gotten off to
a fast start, to some extent making up for lost time.
28.   Restructuring the DBZ was delayed because the requisite legislation was not approved by
the Zambian Parliament. The Government, however, showed ingenuity and determination in
achieving DBZ restructuring, and the intent of the agreement between the Government and IDA,
namely, to discontinue DBZ's retail lending activities, to focus greater effort on the collection of
DBZ's loan portfolio, and to establish an apex institution which would allow Zambia to mobilize
concessional funds for on-lending through commercial banks, was achieved.
29.   Once a decision was made to privatize ZCCM, the process proceeded as smoothly and as
quickly as possible until the bid opening stage, but began to encounter difficulties and delays
after that. Because of its popular image as Zambia's "crown jewel," the Government newly
elected in late 1991 had to consider every reasonable alternative to privatization, in order to
avoid accusations of giving the company away to foreign interests. However, once it was
obvious that the company was not capable of self-reform, the decision to privatize it was
inevitable and politically acceptable. Many tasks had to be undertaken. Experienced, high
quality international investment and legal advisors had to be recruited (in part to give the sale
political and business credibility) to prepare a privatization plan. Following the plan's approval,
documentation to solicit bids had to be prepared, data centers to enable due diligence had to be
established, the capacities of interested investors had to be reviewed to select those who
qualified, requests for bids had to be issued, bids needed to be reviewed and evaluated and finally
deals had to be negotiated and sales concluded.
30.   Both the Bank and the Government may have underestimated the complexity and the
time required to implement the ZCCM Privatization plan, particularly after the change in the
leadership of the negotiating team and the adjustmnent of the objectives and strategy of the sales
process (paras. 10-14). However, if the current plans to complete the privatization in the third
quarter of CY1998 materialize, then this transaction would not be unduly slow by international



8
standards. This transaction was comparable in size and complexity to the privatization of British
Coal, which took four years to complete. Moreover, complex issues relating to retrenchment of
labor, handling of ZCCM's accumulated arrears, liability for past environmental damage,
ownership of staff housing, and provision of social infrastructure and municipal services had to
be resolved. The fact that the Government was not the sole shareholder meant that the rights of
the other shareholders had to be considered and protected and that proved to be time consuming.

G. Assessment of Outcome
31.   Though not fully accomplished as yet, by end of 1997, it was apparent that progress on
stabilization and the liberalization of the Zambian economy was beginning to have positive
effects on economic performance. After declining by 2.3% in 1995, real GDP increased by 6.4%
in 1996 and, despite a decline in agricultural output due to relatively poor weather, by 3.5% in
1997. Growth in 1997 was broad based, with all sectors other than agriculture and financial
services expanding. Manufacturing value added grew by 6.9% compared to 2.6% the previous
year. Mining value-added grew by 2.4%. However, GDP per capita in 1997 was still about 13%
below its level in 1991. Gross domestic savings increased from 7.7% of GDP in 1995 to 9.1% in
1997 and gross fixed capital formation rose from 13.8% of GDP to 15% over the same period.
The private sector accounted for almost all of the increase in investment.
32.   The new mining policies had already had a positive impact. For example, the operations
of the Bwana Mukubwa mine, which had ceased in 1984, were reactivated in 1997 under private
ownership. There has been an upsurge in new private exploration since the passage of the new
Mining Act. The number of prospecting licenses in force has risen from two to about twenty,
and an estimated US$100 million has been spent on exploration over the past three years.
33.   The shift towards a pro-export orientation in policy is helping to make the export sector a
more dynamic and significant feature of Zambia's economy. The value of non-traditional
products increased in 1997 by 26%, reaching a record level of over US$300 million. These
exports now account for 28 % of the total and include an expanding range of agricultural, non-
metal mining, agro-industrial and engineering products.

34.   The economic reform program, with the support of ERIP and its predecessor and
successor adjustment operations seems to be having a positive effect on poverty. According to a
Government study based on the Priority Survey in 1991 and the Living Conditions Monitoring



10
Surveys in 1993 and 1996, the incidence of poverty, which had increased from 69.7% of the total
population in 1991 to 73.8% in 1993, declined to 69.2% in 1996. Extreme poverty (consumption
insufficient to meet basic daily food intake) which rose from 58.2% in 1991 to 60.6% in 1993,
declined to 53.2% in 1996. As evident in Table 2, the country's social indicators show some
deterioration since 1991, but probably less than might have been expected given the decline in
per capita income. This suggests that preserving government outlays for social services may
have had a positive effect, but the situation is still precarious and any emerging positive trends
may reverse if the reform program is not sustained.
I. Key Lessons Learned
35.   Successful implementation of the ERIP program provides some useful lessons.
(1) Timing of reforn is critical. For example, an effort to push the privatization of
ZCCM in 1991-92, would probably have been unsuccessful, as the Government was not yet
committed to such a course. Moreover, once Government commitment is in place, the pace of
reform must allow for building consensus among stakeholders.
(2) Recovery of the economy after stabilization can take longer than expected, but should
not be a reason for despair. The Zambian case illustrates that stabilization, coupled with
vigorous structural adjustment will ultimately produce positive results, provided the efforts can
be sustained.
(3) Availability of technical assistance funds can facilitate acquisition of critical
technical expertise, if task managers and government have flexibility in allocating these funds to
problem areas as they arise.
(4) Adjustment programs are easier to implement and supervise as well as more effective,
if they have fewer, but more critical conditions, fewer tranches and shorter disbursement profiles.
(5) Continuity of task management is beneficial, as is having the manager of the
adjustment operation also responsible for related technical assistance projects.

ZAMBIA: ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INVESTMENT PROMOTION (ERIP)
CREDIT
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION MISSION
AIDE MEMOIRE
I.   Introduction
1.    A World Bank mission consisting of Messrs. Emile B. Sawaya, (Principal Private Sector
Development Specialist and Task Team Leader- AFTP1), John E. Strongman (Mining Advisor -
IENIM) and David G. Greene (Consultant) visited Lusaka from February 23 to March 3, 1998 to
begin the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the ERIP (Credit No.
2764-ZA). Specifically, the mission reviewed with the Government and other stakeholders: (1)
the performance of the Government and that of the other agencies involved in the
implementation of the ERIP Reform Program; (2) the performance of the Bank in assisting
implementation of the Program; (3) the lessons to be drawn from the implementation of the ERIP
Reform Program; (4) plans for the future operation of the institutions covered by the Program, if
applicable; and (5) the Government's contribution to the ICR In order to do this, the mission
held discussions with key agencies in the public sector, private enterprises and interested
members of the donor community. The mission's conclusions and recommendations, presented
below, will be confirmed by the Bank after the mission's return to headquarters. The mission
wishes to thank the Government for its cooperation and for the generous provision of time and
effort.
II.   Summary Evaluation
2.    The key elements of the ERIP Reform  Program  were: (1) execution of the
macroeconomic program consistent with the objectives of stabilization, while strengthening the
system of taxation by introducing the VAT, and protecting fiscal expenditures on critical social
programs; (2) reorienting the role of Government in the financial sector in support of private
investment by ending state direct lending for private investment, mobilizing term foreign
exchange resources and ensuring the financial health of contractual saving institutions --
insurance companies and pension funds; (3) establishing a new national pension system; and, (4)
improving the legal, fiscal and environmental framework for the mining sector, strengthening the
Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development, and adopting a plan for the privatization of
ZCCM.
3.    The mission concludes that the objectives of the project were achieved and the impact on
economic performnance has been positive.  Substantial progress has been made toward
macroeconomic stabilization: inflation has been reduced by improving fiscal performance, while
protecting Government's support to vital social services; Government's support to private



investment is reoriented and concessionary funds are being mobilized; a national basic pension
system is being established; and the stage has been set for rapid, environmentally sound
development of the mining sector by privatizing ZCCM, and establishing a supportive legal and
institutional framework. This has been accomplished despite a generally less than favorable
external environment, which, among others things, was affected by drought, volatile world
copper market and sharp declines in copper prices, and the cessation of bilateral balance-of-
payments support.
4.    The economy has responded positively, as evidenced by lower inflation, increased GDP,
rising private investment and expanding nontraditional exports. On the whole, the performance
of the Government in implementing the ERIP Program was satisfactory. Although the release of
the Second Tranche was delayed about a year because it took longer than expected to prepare
legislation and to put in place the institutional arrangements to regulate and supervise insurance
companies and pension fund management companies, and to complete the restructuring of DBZ,
these tasks were eventually completed satisfactorily. The Government and other stakeholders
have indicated that they consider performance of the Bank in the design and supervision of the
ERIP operation to have been satisfactory.
5.    Despite the progress that has been made, sustainability of the Government's economic
reform program, and, indeed, future economic progress will depend critically on ensuring that
sufficient concessionary balance-of-payments support is available for the implementation of the
macroeconomic program. This will require: (a) addressing concerns of bilateral donors about
"governance" issues; and (b) continued Government commitment to the reform process and
stabilization. It requires, in addition, the expeditious conclusion of the privatization of ZCCM.
This is critical to ensure rapid rehabilitation of the mining sector and to provide a clear signal to
investors of Zambia's commitment to private enterprise. A determined effort is therefore
required to complete negotiations for the sale of the last remaining package, ACo.
III.  Implementation of the ERIP Reform Program
A.   The Macroeconomic Program
6.    The Government is committed to ensuring that macroeconomic policy and performance
are consistent with the objectives of ERIP. The review by IDA staff has concluded that the
progress being made in the implementation of the ERIP Program is satisfactory and that the
macroeconomic policy objectives of the Program are being met.
7.    Zambia has made significant progress toward economic stabilization during the period of
implementation of the ERIP Program (July 1995 to December 1997). Problems of budgetary
management, which had persisted, as evidenced by chronic difficulties in meeting fiscal targets
in the first quarter of each year, are now being addressed. Each year the Treasury has managed
to tighten fiscal controls and improve revenue performance to meet its targets. Fiscal
performance has improved from year to year. The Government's cash deficits were relatively



small (a surplus equivalent to 0.7% of GDP in 1995, and deficits of 2.5% in 1996 and 1.8% in
1997). In addition, domestic arrears have been reduced and relatively little domestic financing
has been required. In fact, there was virtually no net domestic financing of the budget for 1995-
1997, taken as a whole.
8.    The combination of relative fiscal balance and tight monetary policy has led to a
deceleration of inflation. As measured by the CPI (end of period), inflation declined from 48%
in 1995 to 18% in 1997. Moderating inflation has also had a favorable impact on interest rates:
the official bank rate fell from 52% at end-1995 to 24% at end-1997, and the treasury bill rate fell
from 42% at the end of 1995 to 13% percent at the end of 1997. Exchange rates remained fairly
stable, with the market rate depreciating only 9% relative to the dollar in 1997, compared to a
depreciation of almost 30% the previous year.
9.    The IMF Board approved the midterm review of the first annual ESAF program under the
three-year SAF/ESAF arrangement in February 1997, allowing the 1996 Paris Club Agreement
to formally go into effect. Negotiations for the second-year ESAF have been concluded and its
presentation to the IMF Board is awaiting evidence that the external financing gap is covered.
10.   As agreed under the ERIP Program, the Value Added Tax was implemented, on schedule,
in July 1995. The Revenue Authority has done an outstanding job introducing and gaining
acceptance for the VAT. The VAT has been very successful, as evidenced by the fact that
domestic VAT collections (VAT is also applied to imports) increased from K 108 billion in 1995
to K 184 billion in 1997 Total VAT collections in 1997, including the tax on imports, were
about K 300 billion, providing almost a quarter of total tax revenues. Collections of the VAT
were estimated by the Revenue Authority to be 75% greater than those that the taxes it replaced
would have yielded. The introduction of the VAT also improved the tariff system as it resulted
in the elimination of the 5% import surcharge, or "uplift factor."
11.   The Government has also met its obligation under the ERIP to protect expenditures on
vital social services. Spending in the social sectors in 1995 has been at or above the levels
specified in the Letter of Development Policy. The share of total social sector spending in non-
debt service budget releases was 35% (compared to the minimum target of 33%), and the share
of non-personnel spending in these sectors was 25% (compared to the minimum target of 24%).
Similar targets for social sector spending in 1996 were agreed under the ESAC II Program and
fulfilled.



B.   Strengthening the Financial Sector
12. As agreed under the ERIP Program, the Government has virtually eliminated its role of
direct term financier of private sector development. Under the project, it was agreed that
Eximbank and Lima Bank would either be privatized or liquidated. As the financial status of
these two institutions made their sale impossible, they were closed and are being wound up. The
ERIP Program also provided for the Development Bank of Zambia to get out of the business of
direct lending. It called for DBZ to be restructured into an apex institution responsible for
mobilizing and on-lending concessionary finance to commercial banks, and for DBZ's loan
portfolio to be transferred to a separate collection agency. Transferring DBZ's portfolio to a
collection agency was legally problematic, necessitating the restriction of the DBZ to a collection
function, and creating a new apex institution, which proved to be unacceptable to parliament.
The objectives were therefore accomplished by having DBZ's board order its management to
suspend lending operations and concentrate on the collection of its non-performing loans. A new
apex institution, Zambia Enterprise Finance Ltd., has been established under the Companies Act
to mobilize concessionary external financing to be on-lent by commercial banks to the private
sector. The Managing Director of DBZ indicated that the institution was engaging in a limited
amount of short term lending. This is inconsistent with the Board's decision, continues to place
the full burden of servicing DBZ's borrowings on the Treasury, and is contrary to the objectives
of ERIP. The Government should ensure that the staff and expenses of DBZ are reduced to a
level consistent with its more limited functions and that any surplus it generates from collections
be returned to the Treasury immediately.
13.   Strengthening the contractual savings institutions--pension funds and insurance
companies--was another important element of the ERIP Program. New Acts have been enacted
by Parliament to establish clear, enforceable regulatory framneworks for insurance companies and
pension funds. Until the passage of the new acts, the regulation of insurance companies and
pension funds was limited and inspection infrequent--not consistent with the needs of a
liberalizing economy. The new legislation was drafted in consultation with the industry. Under
the legislation, all insurance companies and brokers will have to be licensed, as will all pension
fund managers. A single regulatory agency, the Pensions and Insurance Authority, has been
established in the Ministry of Finance. The decision to establish a single agency, rather than
separate agencies for pensions and insurance seems sensible, in view of the fact that six of the
country's eight insurance companies are also in the pension business. The Registrar is very well
qualified, as is the recently appointed Deputy Registrar for pension funds. A process of
consultation with industry executives is underway and drafting of regulations will begin soon.
C.   Establishing a National Pension Scheme
14.   Legislation has been passed to establish a National Pension Scheme and to transform the
existing Zambia National Provident Fund (ZNPF) into the agency responsible for operating the
new scheme. The ILO is in the process of drafting proposals for transforming ZNPF into the
administrative agency.  In the meantime, several critical issues remain to be resolved:
contribution rates and benefit levels and transitional arrangements for present members of ZNPF.
In deciding on contribution and benefit levels under the new scheme, it should be remembered



that the intention of the program is to provide minimum protective benefits at the lowest rates
possible, thus leaving headroom for employer-based pension plans.
D.   Restructuring Mining and Promoting Private Sector Mining Investment
15.   The ERIP Program supported the formulation of a legal, regulatory and institutional
framework for the mining industry to promote growth of the sector and to encourage private
sector development of mineral resources. Consistent with these objectives, the Government
adopted a new Mining Sector Policy Statement in December 1995. The objective of which is to
"ensure self-sustaining mineral-based industry and encourage private investment in exploration
and development. . . ." This would be achieved by putting in place a privatization plan for
ZCCM and promoting private sector investment.
16.   A new Mining and Minerals Act was passed, which guarantees security of title,
unrestricted access to foreign exchange, companies' right to market products, and freedom of
commercial operation. It also provides for international arbitration of disputes.
17.   A new mining fiscal regime, including relevant amendments to the Income Tax Act, the
Customs and Excise Act and the Investment Act have been approved by Parliament. The new
fiscal regime concentrates on the taxation of profits, rather than output, and is also non
discretionary, and internationally competitive.
18.   Under the new environmental regulations, impact assessments will be required for all
new projects, and existing mining areas will have to be rehabilitated. All licensees will be
required to have baseline studies, environmental engineering studies, an environmental
management plan, and a plan for rehabilitation after decommissioning
19.   Progress has been made in strengthening the Ministry of Mineral and Mining
Development (MMMD). The new Mining Environmental Regulations will ensure that new
investments are socially and environmentally sustainable. The mining title system is working
well and new geological data bases and maps are being prepared. MMMD has begun to
implement recommendations of the studies, including establishment of regional mine offices to
assist medium and small companies, including gemstone miners.
20.        The new policies have already had a positive impact. For example, the operations
of the Bwana Mkubwa mine, which ceased operations in 1984, were reactivated in 1997 under
private ownership. There has been an upsurge in private exploration since the passage of the new
Mining Act. The number of prospecting licenses in force has risen from two to about twenty,
and an estimated US$100 million has been spent on exploration in the last three years. Almost
half the country is now covered by international mining companies carrying out exploration and
prospecting work. New owners/investors are bringing strong financial, managerial and technical
capacity to the sector.
21.   A plan for the privatization of ZCCM was prepared by ZPA with the assistance of
investment banking and legal advisors (N. M. Rothschild and Clifford Chance, respectively).



The plan, which calls for the sale of ZCCM's assets in packages, was approved by the Boards of
Directors of ZCCM and ZPA and by the Cabinet and issued in May 1996. This was a major
objective of the ERIP operation and fulfilled a condition for the release of the Second Tranche of
the Credit. Approval of this plan marked the beginning of the implementation phase of the
privatization of ZCCM. But the ultimate objective of the operation was the actual privatization
of the company. The completion of the ZCCM privatization, originally targeted for June 30,
1997 is now expected in March 1998.
22.   ZPA/ZCCM entered into direct negotiations with a consortium of Anglo American and
Falconbridge of Canada for the Konkola Deep project and with Avmin, Ltd., a South African
mining company for Konkola North. Negotiations on the latter have been completed and
negotiations on Konkola Deep are ongoing, with the conclusion likely in the second quarter of
1998. In September 1996, ZPA issued an international invitation to bid on nine packages. In
response 42 prospective investors carried out their due diligence. Bids were submitted by 27
investors and opened in February 1997. Since then, five asset packages were privatized and
handed over to their new owners: including awarding the concession for Konkola North, and the
sale of Kansanshi Mine (Cyprus Amax), Luanshya/Baluba Mines (Binani Group, a metals
trading company), Chibuluma Mine (a consortium led by Metorex, a medium South African
mining company), and the Power Division.
23.   The major uncompleted transaction is the sale of Package A, together with the G and L
packages--now consisting of Nkana and Nchanga Divisions (accounting for 55% of ZCCM's
output), the Chambishi CobaltlAcid Plant, the Chingola Refractory Ore Dumps, and some
subsidiaries. This is the subject of negotiations with the Kafue Consortium, consisting of Avmin
Ltd. of South Africa, Phelps Dodge of the US, Noranda Exploration of Canada, and UK
Commonwealth Development Corporation. These negotiations have proven to be complex and
lengthy, but the sale is now expected to be completed by the end of March 1998.
24.   Despite a delay of approximately three quarters of a year resulting from a change in the
leadership of the Government's negotiating team and in its strategy, the time required up until
now for the implementation of the ZCCM privatization has not been excessive. All parties
underestimated the complexity of the ZCCM privatization. ZCCM privatization is comparable in
size and complexity to that of British Coal, the privatization of which took four years. ZCCM's
sale will involve outlays of approximately a US$1 billion, including cash payments, assumption
of some of ZCCM's outstanding term debt, and contractual commitments for investments over
the next five years. Since the Government is not the sole shareholder of ZCCM (Anglo
American owns 27.3%, and other Zambian and international private investors the balance), its
listing on the Lusaka, London and New York Stock exchanges, requires that the rights of the
other shareholders be protected, thus requiring additional time in preparation and notification.
Moreover, there are complex issues relating to retrenchment of labor, handling of ZCCM's
accumulated arrears, liability for past environmental damage, ownership of staff and worker
housing, and provision of social infrastructure and municipal services that are requiring time to
be adequately resolved.



25.  It is in Zambia's strong interest that the privatization process be concluded rapidly, and
the sale of the A, G and L packages to the Kafue consortium be finalized. ZCCM's flnancial
situation is precarious. Further delay could affect its operations and its relations with its
creditors. The company's performance has deteriorated to the point where it threatens to
undermine both Zambia's economic recovery and the privatization of the company. Completion
of the sale would allow the payment of the Company's domestic arrears and provide a boost to
the economy. Inflows of foreign exchange resulting from up front payments would provide
some relief for Zambia's presently critical foreign exchange reserve position. Allowing new
owners to take control rapidly will accelerate the process of improving efficiency and increasing
output, which is in the companies' interest as well. Finally, the completion of negotiations will
provide a strong positive signal to other potential investors in mining as well as other sectors.
E.   Impact of the ERIP Program
26.   The stabilization and liberalization of the Zambia economy is beginning to show positive
results. After declining by 2.3% in 1995, real GDP increased by 6.4% in 1996 and, despite a
decline in agricultural output due to relatively poor weather, by 3.5% in 1997. Growth was broad
based, with all sectors other than agriculture and financial services expanding. Manufacturing
value-added grew by 7.4% compared to 5.5% the previous year. Mining value-added grew by
2.4%. Gross domestic savings have increased from 7.7% of GDP in 1995 to 9.5% in 1997 and
gross fixed capital formation has risen from 13.8% of GDP to 14.7% over the same period. The
private sector accounted for almost all of the increase in investment.
27.   The shift towards a pro-export orientation in policy is helping to make Zambia's export
sector a more dynamic and significant feature of Zambia's economy. The value of non-traditional
products increased in 1997 by an impressive 26%, reaching a record level of over US$300
million. These exports now account for 28 % of the total and include an expanding range of
agricultural, non-metal mining, agro-industrial and engineering products.
28.   The economic reform program, with the support of ERIP and its predecessor and
successor adjustment operations seems, at last, to be having a positive effect on poverty.
According to a Government study based on the Priority Survey in 1991 and the Living
Conditions Monitoring Surveys in 1993 and 1996, the incidence of poverty, which had increased
from 69.7% of the total population in 1991 to 73.8% in 1993, declined to 69.2% in 1996.
Extreme poverty (consumption insufficient to meet basic daily food intake) which rose from
58.2% in 1991 to 60.6% in 1993, declined to 53.2% in 1996.

STATUS OF ZAMBIA'S ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAMME
COMPLETION REPORT FOR THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INVESTMENT
PROMOTION PROJECT (ERIP)
1    By the end of 1997 Government had completed the Economic Recovery and Export
Promotion (ERIP) Project. This project - for which IDA provided the equivalent of US $140
million in two tranches - had been intended to facilitate the implementation of Zambia's
Economic Reform Programme (ERP) in the 1995-1997 period. The ERP was designed to
address poverty in Zambia through promoting private sector-led and export-oriented economic
growth and by improving the delivery of vitally-needed social services. The IDA funds were
used to strengthen the foreign exchange reserve position of the Bank of Zambia and helped with
the smooth financing of imports, the payment of external debt service obligations and, more
generally, with the implementation of the Government's programmes for economic and social
development.
2.    Government believes that the objectives of the ERIP project were achieved, despite a
sharp decline in copper production and prices and the near-cessation of bilateral balance-of
payments support. More could have been achieved - including in poverty reduction - if during
the 1995-1997 period copper production had not stagnated at 300,000 tonnes annually.
Nonetheless, some evidence has become available which indicates that the ERIP project has
begun to have a positive effect on poverty.
3.    The record of achievement can best be summarised as follows.
- macro-economic stability is being achieved: inflation dropped to 18.6 percent in 1997, down
from 46 percent in 1995; interest rates fell by more than one-half since mid-1995 and are
currently at about 20 percent, and in 1997 the Kwacha stabilised under free exchange market
conditions; for the second year running, Government realised a domestic fiscal surplus of over I
percent of GDP in 1997 which compares with a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 1995;
- the growth momentum of the economy has been restored: after a decline of 2.3 percent
in 1995, Zambia went on a positive growth path which reached 6.4 percent in 1996, indicating
that the private sector has been responding positively to the Government's adjustment policies, in
1997, a growth rate of 3.5 percent was realised, despite excessive rainfall in the beginning of
1997;
- Government policies to stimulate and build partnerships with the private sector have made the
private sector the engine of economic growth in Zambia, private investment now accounts for
some 10 percent of GDP, up from 5.5 percent in 1991 and from 7-9 percent in 1995;
- significant benefits of privatisation are being realised in the wake of robust progress



with the privatisation programme; by end-February 1998, 212 parastatal companies had been
privatised out of ZPA's working portfolio of 326 companies; these privatisations are having a
favourable impact on production, employment, incomes and export earnings.
- after several years of preparation, the privatisation of ZCCM is close to completion, which, in
combination with new investment in Konkola North and Konkola Deep, will inject fresh capital,
new technology and private management into the copper and cobalt sector,
- Zambia's foreign trade and exchange systems have been liberalised; these reforms have helped
to attract foreign private investment into agriculture, mining, tourism and industry,
- exports of non-traditional products have continued to increase at double-digit growth rates,
from US $ 202 million in 1995 to US $329 million in 1997. These exports now account for 28
percent of Zambia's exports as compared to 17 percent in 1995-1
- to facilitate progress with poverty reduction, the share of social sector expenditures in the
Budget was raised from 33.6 percent in 1995 to 34-6 percent in 19971
- a turn-around has begun in the provision of health services, reflecting the
implementation of Health Sector Programme, nine out of ten babies are now born to mothers
who receive ante-natal care from a doctor, a nurse or midwife, and child vaccination coverage
has become much more widespread in Zambia: nearly four out of five children aged 12 to 2' )
months have received BCG, measles and three doses of each DPT and polio vaccinations.' as a
result, infant mortality has stabilised- and,
- while the severity and incidence of poverty in Zambia remains high, national
poverty in Zambia is on the decline., having risen from 70 percent of the population in 1991 to
74 percent in 199' ), the incidence poverty has since declined to 69 percent in 1996. and in the
1993-1996 period extreme poverty fell from 61 to 53 percent-
4.    However, Government is not satisfied with these achievements. Much more could have
been accomplished if during the 1995-1996 period Zambia had not been required to devote a
staggering 10 percent of its Gross Domestic Product to the service of its external debt (this
percentage dropped to 5 percent in 1997 reflecting welcome action by Paris Club creditors and
the IMF ) and if external assistance had not declined by 30 percent in the 1995-1997 period from
US $544 million in 1995 to US $388 million in 1997.

5.   If Zambia's heavy debt burden would have been lighter and if more external assistance
had been available,
- more progress could have been made with reducing poverty in Zambia. While Governnent
increased the relative share of social sector expenditures in the Budget, social sector expenditures
declined in real terms. This contriibuted to a drop in school attendance rates in the 1995-1997
period. This deterioration could have been avoided had more resources been available;
- Zambia's economic growth rate could have been 2 to 3 percentage points higher, With the
resumption of economic growth in the 1995-1997 period which Government succeeded in
initiating, per capita income growth could have been positive over the past three years. As it
was, per capita income came down by 1 to 2 percent during the period, and,
- more progress could have been made with the rehabilitation of infrastructure which is holding
back economic growth and social progress.
6.    Clearly, Zambia's debt burden remains very heavy indeed. Unless it is reduced further, it
still will remain a strong brake on economic growth and poverty reduction, precisely at a time
when Zambia is poised for take-off in both areas. Government's policy remains focused on
sound macroeconomic management, but its strategic agenda for the medium-term is anchored on
a marked acceleration of economic growth and a decisive reduction in poverty.
7.    Most of the decline in external assistance in the 1995-1997 period is accounted for by a
reduction in bilateral balance-of-payments' support which fell from US $133 million in 1995 to



US $9 million in 1997 and which almost neutralised the benefits that was obtained from debt
relief granted to Zambia in the 1996-1997 period. The reduction in BOP support began in 1996
when bilateral donors introduced governance considerations into their decision-making processes
concerning the provision of BOP support. Since that time, the external financing programme
underlying the Economic Recovery Programme has lacked the critical elements of assured and
predictable availability. This seriously affected development cooperation between Zambia and
the donor coalition and weakened economic recovery and social development. The lesson for the
future is that more predictable and dependable levels of external assistance are needed to assist
adjusting countries in implementing their reform programmes. This may require a review of the
Special Programme for Africa which no longer assures that the successful implementation of
economic programmes of adjusting countries will not be held back by the lack of external
assistance resources.
8.    As regards the decline in copper production from 500,000 tonnes in 1994 to an average of
300,000 tonnes in the three-year period thereafter, this led Government to stress the revitalisation
of the mining sector so that it could once again become one of the most important determinants
of economic performance in Zambia by generating increased income, foreign exchange and
employment. In cognisance of this, Government decided to privatise Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines as the most viable alternative to arresting the Ion. run and steady decline in the
production of metals and shrinking metal base. This privatisation process is now close to
completion.
9.   In conclusion, with the help of the ERIP project, the foundations for higher growth were
strengthened in the 1995-1997 period, by the liberalisation of markets, by tax, tariff and financial
sector reform, and by privatising state enterprises, Those reforms are now being taken further
Government has already begun to Implement a three-year programme of economic recovery for
the years 1998 to 2000, For this period, Govermnent has now confidently adopted as its
macroeconomic objectives the achievement of economic ,-growth on the order of 5-6 percent a
year, a reduction in inflation to single-digit levels, and a further strengthening of Zambia's export
sector. To achieve these objectives, Government is continuing its stabilisation efforts through
tight financial policies. These are being complemented by structural reforms, specifically public
service reform, further trade liberalisation and export promotion, fiuther
privatisation and the provision of growth-enabling as well as social infrastructure. Government
has already reached agreement with the World Bank and the IMF on its economic programme for
the 1998-2000 period. As part of the recovery programme 19982000, Government is stepping
up Zambia's efforts to increase savings(,s, making Government leaner and more effective and
improving the efficiency of investment. Government is also stepping up investment in growth-
supporting infrastructure and in education and health,
10. The successful implementation of the ERIP pr 'project has not only benefited from IDA's
financial resources. Government also derived significant benefits from the high-quality
economic policy and technical advice received from IDA staff.
