                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The implementation progress of the project remains to be moderately satisfactory and requires close supervision. There are no unforeseen risks at this stage.
                         It was agreed with the Government of Jordan that the project requires an extension of the closing date of at least one year to complete (i) ongoing activities in Ajloun and Salt and
                         Karak Gateway; (ii) the local economic development component; and (iii) several consultancies related to the operations and maintenance manual, Jerash parking, and other
                         activities.
