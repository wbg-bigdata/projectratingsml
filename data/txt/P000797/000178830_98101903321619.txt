THE GAMBIA
APPRAISAL OF BATHURST PCRT PROJECT
SUMY1MRY
i.        This report appraises a project for the development of the port
of Bathurst, Ihe Gambia's most important transport facility.  Situated at
the mouth of the Gambia River, the port is characterized by excellent
navigational conditions and good road and river connections. However, its
development has been hampered by the limited economic potential of the
country and its small population.
ii.       Due to deterioration of an old wooden pier, there is now vir-
tually only one wharf available for handling export and import cargo and
port congestion has risen sharply in recent years. The project, there-
fore, calls for the rehabilitation of the remaining wharf, the construction
of a new one, the provision of sheds and handling equipment and the services
of consulting engineers and advisors for the design and implementation of
the project. Total costs are estimated at US$2.43 million equivalent, of
which the proposed credit would cover the foreign exchange ccmponent
(US$2.1 million) which is high because The Gambia lacks construction
materials such as cement, steel reinforcement, gravel, building sand,
bitumen and timber. This would be the first Bank Group operation in The
Gambia.
iii.      The project is based on a feasibility study prepared at the
request of the Gambian Government by consultants to the U.K. Ministry of
Overseas Development.
iv.       Operational, organizational and financial reforms will play an
important role in the project. Unified control over all cargo movements
in the port will be introduced, handling techniques improved, and an
autonomous Port Authority created. Finally, modern commerical accounting
and costing systems will be introduced and rates and charges related to
costs. Advisors will assist the Government in preparing and implementing
these steps and training will be provided for the staff of the proposed
Authority.
v.        Total traffic handled at Bathurst averaged 145I,00 tons in the
last three years.   Traffic forecasts are difficult to establish due to
an unknown quantity of unrecorded transit movements to and from Senegal,
which are subject to sudden changes.   The modest development proposed by
the project will, however, yield a satisfactory economic return even on
the basis of very cautious traffic forecasts. Main benefits will be the
reduction of ship waiting time and cargo handling costs.
vi.       It is considered that port tariffs which are low will need to



- ii -
be raised in two stages by an average total of 25% which should result
in a financial rate of return of about 6% in 1977 and 8% in 1979. To
this end the Government has agreed to increase rates by at least 10% by
October 1971 and, upon conpletion of the project, review such rates to-
gether with the Association.
vii.      The Ministry of Works and Communications will be responsible
for execution of the project. Final design will be prepared by consultants
who will also assist the Government in evaluating bids and supervising
construction. Contracts for construction and equipment supply will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit to
the Government of The Gambia of US$2.1 million. Issues on which agree-
ment was reached during negotiations are listed in Chapter 7.



THE GAMBIA
APPRAISAL OF BATHURST PORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Gambia, a small country on the West African coast, obtained
independence from the U.K. in February 1965. The country is largely
dependent on the foreign trade which passes through the Port of Bathurst.
However, no major investments have been carried out in the port during the
last decade and the existing facilities are clearly inadequate to meet
present and future requirements.
1.02      At the request of the Government, and with financial assistance
from the U.K. Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM), first studies were
carried out in early 1968 by the National Ports Council, London, with a
view to improving port organization and preparing future development.
Subsequently, ODM commissioned consulting engineers G. Mlaunsel and Partners,
in association with Cooper Brothers and Co., London, to prepare a feasibility
study and preliminary design for development of the Port of Bathurst. The
reports, submitted in April and supplemented in October, 1969, form the
basis for the proposed project.
1.03      The project consists of rehabilitation of an existing wharf,
construction of a new wharf and supporting facilities, provision of
handling and marine equipment and advisors to improve port operations and
organization. Total costs are estimated at US$2jj3 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$2.1 million. The proposed IDA credit would cover
the foreign exchange component. This would be the first Bank Group
operation in The Gambia.
1.04      The following appraisal report is based on the findings of an
appraisal mission to The Gambia in September 1969. It was prepared by the
members of the mission, Messrs. Fateen (port engineer); Oursin (economist,
head of mission) and Rodley (financial analyst).

2. *ACKGROUND
A. Country and People
2.01      The Gambia, which covers 4,000 square miles on the West African
Coast, is about one-third the size of the Netherlands. It consists of a
narrow strip of land some 20 to 30 miles wide, extending about 200 miles
inland on both sides of the Gambia River. Except for a short western sea-
board, it is completely surrounded by the Republic of Senegal (see Map 1).
2.02      Largely covered with open forests and grasslands, the country is
generally flat; maximum elevation is 120 feet. Rainfall, which varies from
30 to 50 inches, is concentrated from June to October. This limits agri-
cultural production to crops with a short vegetative cycle.
2.03      Population data are not very reliable.  The total population is
about 350,000, growing between 1%-2% per year.  Bathurst, the capital,
has some 30,000 inhabitants; all other towns have less than 5,000.
B. The Economy
2.O4      The Gambia is primarily agricultural.  Over 50% of GDP is derived
from agriculture, livestock and fishing, and over 80% of the working popu-
lation consists of small farmers. Another major sector of the economy is
public administration, accounting for almost 20% of GDP and employing two-
thirds of the salaried labor force. Trade and transport contribute about
13%, while manufacturing, private construction and other services are of
minor importance. Total GDP is estimated to have risen by about 5% p.a.
from 1945 to 1964 and by nearly 7% from 1964 to 1967/68. However, per
capita income still amounts to only about $80 in 1967/68.
2.05      The Gambia's economy is strongly monocultural. Groundnut pro-
duction, processing, and exports account for over one-third of total GDP
and groundnut products exceed 95% of total exports. The entire economy
is heavily dependent on the groundnut industry and fluctuations in
production and world market prices largely determine the country's
economic situation. Groundnut purchases by The Gambia Oilseeds Marketing
Board (GOMB) averaged 120,000 tons annually during 1965/66 - 1968/69 as
compared with 71,500 tons during 1955/56 - 1959/60.
2.06      By tradition, and in contrast with neighboring Senegal, The
Gambia is a low tariff, low price economy, with liberal foreign trade
policies. Furthermore, in recent years, it has offered farmers more
attractive terms than the Senegalese for groundnut crop purchases. This,
and the country's unique geographical position, has led to substantial
transit trade between The Gambia and Senegals, Mali and even Mauritania,
mostly unofficial and unrecorded. Senegalese groundnuts are sold in The
Gambia, and imported industrial products are purchased by the Senegalese
from the proceeds. Obviously, statistics are unavailable, but it is
generally estimated that in recent years some 20-25% of GOMB's ground-
nut purchase originated in Senegal.



-3-
2.07      In 1964L, shortly before The Gambia became independent, a team of
U. N. experts studied the possibilities of closer politico-economic coopera-
tion between The Gambia and Senegal. Their report did not recommend creating
a fully integrated customs union but considered that cooperation could best
be achieved by concluding separate agreements on a variety of subjects. As
a result, various agreements were concluded in recent years providing for
cooperation in security, defense, foreign relations, interstate road traffic
and for integrated development of the Gambia River Basin. Periodic govern-
mental consultations supplement these technical agreements and contribute to
good relations between the two countries, However, Senegal is considerably
concerned with the increase in unrecorded transit trade and this has recently
led to some political irritation on both sides of the border.
C. The Transport Sector
2.08      The Gambia River is permanently navigable up to Basse, 242 miles
from Bathurst, with seasonal navigation extending an additional 46 miles
up to Fatoto on the eastern border with Senegal. Internal transport is
dominated by evacuation of the groundnut crop. About one-third of the crop
is decorticated, 140 miles up river, at Kaur and exported directly from
there to Europe in ocean-going vessels; two-thirds are brought down the
river to Bathurst., proceesed into oil and cake in the two local mills and
exported from there. There is no railway system in the country.
Ports
2.09      Except for the groundnut loading station at Kaur, Bathurst is the
only deep water port of the country. All imports and exports, except decorti-
cated groundnuts, are shipped from there, Port installations are in bad
repair and there is virtually only one berth available to handle all traffic
which results in increasing delays to ships awaiting a berth. A description
of the existing facilities at Bathurst is given in Annex 1. Exports and
imports-through Bathurst reached about 144,000 tons in 1967/68; about
36o000 tons of groundnuts were shipped from Kaur in the same year.
Inland Navigation
2.10      Gambia River inland navigation is carried out by public and private
agencies. The Government runs a regular mail boat service for passengers
and cargo between Bathurst and Basse. The Gambia River Transport Company
(GRT), formed by GOMB and licensed buying agents to improve groundnut evacua-
tion efficiency, operates a fleet of about 12 powered craft and 50 barges
with a total carrying capacity of 4,000 tons. In addition, many small
independent carriers operate powered vessels and barges to bring foodstuffs
to markets and groundnuts to buying stations.
2.11      Despite its natural advantages as a low cost, all year transport
facility, the Gambia River has lost most of its general cargo and passenger
traffic, mainly because of an extensive road construction program. In
1967/68 the bulk of river transport consisted of about 75,000 tons of
groundnuts.



-h -
Roads and Boad Transport
2.12      The Government has  made considerable efforts to improve and
expand the road network. Since 1960, capital expenditure for roads and
road ferries totalled about WM2.0 million, close to one-third of total
development outlays. In 1969, of a total road network of 480 miles, 173
miles were paved. When the present program is completed in 1970/71, the
Gambia will be endowed with a good all-weather road parallel to the river
on each bank, and running almost to the eastern border with Senegal.
2.13      Expansion of the country's highway network has facilitated the
growth of road traffic. The number of newly registered motor vehicles
(excluding motorcyles) increased from 300 in 1963 to 900 in 1967; the
total fleet of registered cars, lorries and buses grew from 1,550 in 1963
to about 2,900 in 1967. Traffic counts indicate that road traffic in and
out of Bathurst increased by more than 10% per year since 1961.
Air Traffic
2.14      Yundum airport, about 20 miles from Bathurst, can accommodate medium
range jet aircraft. Plans are being considered to improve terminal facilities
and lengthen and strengthen the runway. Regular services, operated by foreign
companies, are provided to London, Dakar, Freetown, Accra and Lagos. Air
freight is negligible and the number of arriving and departing passengers
was about 5,300 in 1967/68.
Senegambian Regional Traffic
2.15      The Gambiats territory reaches deep into Senegal, separating Dakar,
the capital, from its southern province, Casamance. Ziguinchor, on the
Casamance river, is the natural port for that province but sizeable amounts
of general imports, industrial products manufactured in the Dakar area and
local produce are carried on the Trans-Gambia Highway between Dakar and the
Casamance. This road is almost entirely paved (325 miles) and crosses The
Gambia about 100 miles east of Bathurst. The Gambian Government operates
a ferry service which carried 31,000 motor vehicles in 1967/68 as compared
with 18,000 in 1961. A USAID financed study is being carried out to
determine the feasibility of replacing the ferry by a bridge.
2.16      Apart from the Trans-Gambia Highway, of prime importance to
Senegal, and small roads in the upper parts of The Gambia basin, there are
two road links between Bathurst and Senegal; a paved highway from Bathurst-
Barra to Kaolack and Dakar (210 miles) and a low standard dirt road from
Bathurst to Ziguinchor (100 miles). Both roads are potentially important
to Bathurst port, but political boundaries limit the port and river hinterland
to an area considerably smaller than its economic zone of influence.
Senegambian cooperation is, therefore, of special importance in the
transportation field in order to achieve optimum use of the existing road,
river and port facilities.



3. PORT ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION
A. Present Organization
3.01      The Port Administration, known as the Marine Department, is a
Department of the Ministry of Works and Communications. It is headed by
a Director of Marine, assisted by two marine officers and a dockyard
supervisor. The Department is responsible for providing pilotage, navi-
gational aids, berthing of ships, conservancy, the provision and mainte-
nance of floating equipment, dockyard operations, ferry service and the
re-gulation of navigation on the river. Responsibility fcr other.important ;
port activities rests with several other bodies;
(i) The Public Works Department constructs and maintains
maritime structures, sheds and administrative buildings.
Maintenance is generally long delayed and inadequate.
(ii)   The Customs and Excise Division of the Ministry of
Finance, in addition to its normal functions, exercises
general control over transit sheds and cargo handling
areas, collects shed charges and is responsible for
port seourity. The procedures associated with obtain-
ing customs clearance of goods are satisfactory but
cargo is not generally well stacked nor cleared promptly
by consignees because of inadequate coordination.
(iii)   The accounting section of the Ministry of Works and
':ommunications is responsible for the collection of all
wharf and harbor dues.
(iv)   The Accountant General is responsible for accounting
methods and budgetary control.
(v)   The Port Labor Board governed by the Labor Administra-
tion Act of 1966 is responsible for registration,
recruitment and discipline of workers handling ocean
cargo in Bathurst and Kaur.  Relations between employers
and employees in the port areas are usually good and no
serious labor disputes have been recorded in recent years.
(-i)   Shipping agents are responsible for the stevedoring and
wharf handling of the cargo of the shipping lines they
represent. Most of the agents' mobile equipment needs
replacing and the use of storage space is not planned and
effectively controlled.
(vii)   Consignees collect incoming cargo from the transit sheds
or open storage areas, using their own labor.
Such a division of responsibility is not conducive to efficient control

of operations) and cmm7ercial manaseme:,t and accounting techniques cannot
be applied so long as operational and administrative management is by
Governmnt Departments.
B. Property
3.02      Physical details of the port are given in Annex 1. *  he port has
an entrance channel which presents few problems and admits ships with a
draft of 30' at HWOST (high water, ordinary spring tide) which is equiv-
alent to about 12,000 to 15,000 dead weight tons.  It possesses an ex-
cellent anchorage giving almost complete shelter. The shore facilities
(see Map 2), however, are very poor: they consist esentially of two small
wharves - the Government Wharf which is 300 ft long and in fair condition
and the Admiralty Wharf which is 270 ft long and in very poor condition.
There are some inadequate transit sheds adjacent to the Government lWharf
but no sheds at the Admiralty Wharf. Between the two wharves there are
some shallow draft private jetties.
C. Port Operations
3.03      Ships are loaded and unloaded using ships' gear. The poor con-
dition of the Admiralty Wharf makes it virtually unusable for handling
general cargo, while the length of the Government Wharf restricts working
to only three to four hatches simultaneously. Lighters are occasionally
used but are limited by customs to handling homogenous bagged cargo.
Unloading from lighters is only possible at the Government Wharf if no
ship is lying alongside or at one of the small private jetties.
3.04      Wharf gangs provided by the shipping agents work a single shift
plus regular overtime. With better operational procedures and improved
facilities, and on the basis of two-shift working rather than excessive
overtime, average productivity could be improved from the present 525 tons
per ship per day to 650 tons per ship per day (which is good).
3.05      Most imported cargo is unloaded on to trailers and taken to the
tranait sheds or open storage areas by tractors. Due to the limited width
of the Government Nbarf and outdated layout of the sheds, trailer trains
must often be disconnected which frequently causes congestion in the en-
tire port area. Loading cargo aboard ships is more straightforward:
groundnut oil is pumped aboard by pipeline and groundnut cake is brought
by lorry directly to ships' side.
D. Accounting System
3.06      There is no separate port accounting system.  Cash receipts
collected by the Ministry of Works and Communications and the Ministry
of Finance as well as cash expenses incurred directly by the Marine
Department are shown in the national budget. Considerable port expenses,
suoh as repairs, maintenance, electricity and other services, pensions and
welfare costs, are included in other budget items and not clearly iden-
tifiable. No fixed asset accounts are kept and no depreciation is pro-
vided for. The dockyard and ferry service finances are administered in a
similar manner and the system fails to show whether or not these services
are viable.



- 7 -
E. Future Port Organization and Operation
3.07      A scheme to provide unified control of all cargo operations bet-
ween shipts side and shed is essential to improve efficiency, handle increas-
ing traffic and prevent increases in costs. Such a system (called a Master
Porterage Scheme) was recommended in a report prepared in 1968 by The National
Ports Council (London) at the request of the Gambian Government (see Annex 2)
and is expected to achieve more efficient and economic use of labor, cargo
handling equipment and storage space. The unified control should also per-
mit better cargo documentation and give coordination between customs, con-
signees and exporters. Goods should pass through the port more speedily and
with less likelihood of damage or pilferage. During negotiation it was agreed
that the Master Porterage Scheme will be introduced by July 1, 1971 and full
responsibility for the scheme assumed by the Port Authority by July 1, 1973.
The terms and conditions of the scheme will be agreed upon only after con-
sultation with the Association.
3.08      As a further step towards effective port control and forthe reasons
given in para. 3.01, it was agreed during negotiation that an autonomous
Port Authority be established. This will be a small organization designed
in relation to the volume of traffic, the nature of the business to be trane-
acted and the limited trained staff available. However, within these limita-
tions, the body will be financially self-supporting, free from day-to-day
Government interference and able to exercise unified but flexible control of
port activities, including the development of its facilities, on sound commer-
cial lines.  Powers will include control of navigation, port operations, cargo
handling, storage and all related commercial services.  The Authority will
employ permanent technical and administrative staff and maintain separate com-
mercial accounting and costing systems. An outline of its powers is given in
Annex 2. The creation of the Port Authority will result in better use of sheds,
storage areas and handling equipment and improved maintenance of port instal-
lations. It will be financially viable and will take account of the need for
future port development. It was agreed during negotiations that such an Au-
thority will be established in agreement with the Association not later than
July 1, 1972 and that the Chief Executive of the Authority will be appointed
in consultation with the Association.
3.09      To assist the Government in achieving these objectives it was
agreed during negotiations that, not later than January 1, 1971, a port opera-
tions advisor will be appointed for a period of two years. He will be res-
ponsible, among other things, for assisting the Government in creating the Port
Authority and resolving the question of the future of the dockyard. He will
also assist in establishing efficient management of port operations, mainten-
ance and development and advise on the preparation of port development plans
and the establishment of training schemes for the Authority's personnel. (Out-
line Terms of Reference are given in Annex 3).
3.10      The Government agrees that a modern commercial accounting system
must be installed, with cost accounting and budgetary control to establish
the costs of port and other interrelated services (such as the dockyard),
and relate tariffs and charges to costs.   The Government welcomes the



- 8 -
assistance of an advisor in this matter and in the training of accounting
staff. Such an advisor would also assist in planning the Master Porterage
Scheme and in creating the Port Authority. It was agreed during negotia-
tions that, not later than January 1, 1971, a port accounting advisor will
be appointed for a period of two years. In addition, two accountants will
be given training in commercial accounting techniques. The Port Accounting
Advisor will assist in this training, but some brief experience abroad is
also recommended. (An outline of the Advisor's Terms of Reference is given
in Annex 3.)
3.11      The dockyard at present comes under the Director of Marine. While
the dockyard repairs the river ferries, it also has work to do for the port
and other Government sectors. The dockyard requires a reliable costing
system and should be organized on a commercial basis. Having regard to this
need and also the location of the dockyard adjacent to the port and the in-
creasing need for dockyard facilities by the port, it was agreed during
negotiations that the dockyard will be managed by the Port Authority, either
as an integral part of the undertaking or on an agency basis. The port
operations advisor will assist the Government in defining an appropriate
formula and action will be taken on this matter in agreement with the
Association not later than the coming into effect of the Authority itself.
3.12      Cross-river ferries, which extend up river as tar as Fatoto, 288
miles east of Bathurst, are a public service under the Director of Marine.
The Public Wlorks Department is responsible for the maintenance of ferry
landing places and structures. Overall, the ferries are not financially
viable. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government shall decide,
before the Port Authority is created and in agreement with the Association,
whether the ferry services will be operated by the Port Authority or by
a Department of the Government.

4. TI-IE PROJECT
A. Description (Map 2)
4.01      The project is to construct a new wharf in place of Admiralty
w4harf, which is beyond repair, to rehabilitate Government Wharf and to
provide supporting facilities, handling equipment and consulting services.
Details of the project are:
(i,    A new deep-water wharf of 400 ft length and 30 ft depth
for general cargo ships and petroleum tankers;
(ii)    two transit sheds of 250 x 100 and 290 x 100 ft at the
new Admiralty Wharf;
(iii) rehabilitation of Government Wharf and construction of
two moorinc dolphins;
(iv)    a new jetty for shallow-draft vessels (including
removal of an existing obsolete jetty called'TBOAC" jetty);
(v)    reclamation by dredging of additional areas of about
tw-ienty acres for shore facilities;
(vi)    the necessary roads, with parking, sorting and open
storage areas;
(vii)   offices and miscellaneous buildingso
(viii)  procurement of a small suction-cutter dredger, cargo-
handling equipment, marine survey equipment, and navig-
ation aids; and
(ix)    provision of engineering consulting services, a port
operations advisor, a port accounting advisor and
personnel training.
4.02      The two wharves will handle all traffic forecast up to 1980.
The Government lJharf will be mainly for the export of groundnut oil and
cake; the new Admiralty W4harf will be mainly for importing general cargo
and bulk petroleum products. No significant trend towards cargo contain-
erization at Bathurst is expected in the near future. Information on
the calculation of berthage and transit sheds required is given in Annex
4.
4.03      The contractor will use the small suction-cutter dredger (viii
above) to carry out the dredging and reclamation works needed at the new
deep-water berth and shallow draft vessel's jetty. The Port Authority
will subsequently use it for maintenance and minor improvements of the
creek used by small vessels transporting groundnuts from up-river to
GOMB installations at Denton Bridge.



- 10 -
B. Subsoil Conditions
4.04      Subsoil conditions would have made it preferable  to locate the
new wharf close to Government Wharf. This was not possible because the ad-
jacent land is substantially built up andprovides insufficient room for
future development.
4.05      Borings have been made on the site of the new installations and
indicate layers of very soft clay to a depth of 70 ft below datum level,
then layers of soft clay to a depth of 110 ft below datum level, hard clay
exists at 110 ft depth. For this type of strata, wharves will be founded
on piles about 130 ft long. This type of structure will present the least
possible resistance to the river flow to avoid accretion of material carried
by the river and tidal currents.
C. Engineering Consultant Services
4.06      The Government will employ consultants approved by the Association
to design the project and prepare tender documents and assist with the con-
tract bidding procedures and construction supervision of the project.
D. Cost Estimate
4.07      The total estimated cost of the project is DG 1,012,000, US$2,428,800
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$2.1 million equivalent.
The cost of the project is based on consultants' reports (see para. 1.02) and
is based on the known costs of labor in The Gambia and materials to be imported;
it includes 205o contingencies for civil engineering works (10% for quantities
and 1C% for prices) and 5` contingencies for equipment.  The price contingen-
cies are based on rates of price increases on imported goods in the last few
years.   A summary of the estimate follows and Table 1 gives the details.

- 11 -
4.08      The foreign exchange required is 87% of the total cost estimate.
This is high because The Gambia lacks construction materials suchas cement,
steel reinforcement, gravel, building sand, bitumen and timber. The Gov-
ernment will provide the local currency costs estimated at M137,000.
E. Construction and Procurement
4.09      The ITinistry of Works and Communications, with the help of the
consultants, will be responsible for execution of the project. Contracts
for construction and equipment supply will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines and
will be subject to approval by the Association.
F. Phasing of Expenditure
4.10      Construction is expected to start during the first half of 1971
and the project should be completed by the middle of 1973. Disbursement
is expected to be approximately as follows:
G 000
Local       Foreign       Foreign Exchange in
Total    Currency    Currency      US$ 000 Equivalent
1971       505       67           438              1,051
1972       408       56           352                845
1973       _9L                     85                20L
TOTAL     1,012       137          875              2,100
The phasing of expenditure does not take into account disbursement of re-
tention money, after completion of work, since it is normal practice for
contractors to submit letters of guarantee in lieu of retention money.  It
is reconmended that any surplus funds available on completion of the pro-
ject be cancelled.
4.11      Disbursements from the Credit Account would cover:
(i)   the estimated foreign exchange component of 83% for
all civil engineering works;
(ii)  the actual foreign exchange costs of imported equipment,
advisory and consulting services and training of personnel.
G. Port Operations Advisor and Port Accounting Advisor
4.12      To impre the efficienby ard finanoial viability of the pcrt
the Government will  engage; fcr a period of two years, a Port Operations
Advisor and a Port Accounting Advisar fcr reasons outlined in paras. 3.09
and 3.10.



- 12 -
H. Future Port Development
4.13      The Government Bharf is affected by littoral drift entering the
harbor resulting in limited siltation alongside the wharf. Further disadvan-
tages of the site are the complete absence of any hinterland where support-
ing industrial facilities and additional storage areas might be developed,
and the fact that all approaching traffic passes through the center of the
town along the busiest street.   The hinterland around Admiralty Wharf is
much more promising; supporting areas are available and it is possible to
develop several wharves with easy road access. It is therefore considered
that the area to the west of Admiralty Itharf be reserved for long-term port
development (see Map 2).
4.14      The project conforms to the future town planning of the city.  All
land required for the project is Government-owned. During negotiations
the Government agreed that all areas allocated for future development, as
indicated on Map 2, will not be used in a way that may be an obstacle to
future port development.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic
5.01      Bathurst handles all seabcrme export and import trade of The
Gambia, excluding shelled groundouts which are shipped from Kaur (para.
2.08). The following table gives traffic figures for the last 12 years:

5.02      Bathurst port traffic has been subject to large yearly fluc-
tuations, generally following the groundnut crop pattern, for both exports
and imports. After seven years of virtual stagnation a marked rise occurred
in 1965/66 and 1966/67 which appears to have levelled off in the two sub-
sequent years. On a three year average, port traffic during the 1966/67 -
1968/69 period was about 33% higher than in 1957-1959, representing an
annual growth rate of about 3%.
5.03      The unrecorded Senegambian transit trade defies any attempt
at detailed analysis of traffic trends. Most observers agree that it
is substantial, but whether the recent growth in exports and imports
through Bathurst is only the result of an increase in unrecorded transit
movements is doubtful. Early in 1969 the Senegalese Government tight-
ened customs controls at the border and the Gambian Government has
imposed restrictions on the exchange of CFA francs within the country
but no drastic results can be observed in the trade figures for fiscal
1969. Clandestine traffic across political borders has a long history
in West Africa and generally responds to economic criteria such
as transport costs, levels of customs duties and purchase prices for
agricultural products. Border controls alone are not expected to
eliminate the transit trade between Senegal and The Gambia.



- 14 -
5.04      Detailed traffic figures for the last vlx years and forecasts until
1979/80 are given in Table 2. These forecasts are based on the consultants'
review and estimate of all major export and inport commodities, modified by the
mission's findings and the latest figures for fitcal 1969. The projections
for 1979/80, compared with the three year average of the 1966/67 - 1968/69
period, result in the following average annual growth rates:
Total Exports and Imports              + 4.0%
Exports (including groundnuts)         + 3.5%0
Imports                                + 4,4%
Exports and imports Bathurstp excluding
petroleum products and groundnuts    + h.3%
5.05      These growth rates do not appear excessive when compared with other
countries in West Africa. However, realization of the export targets requires
successful implementation of a few agricultural development schemes.
It should also be noted that projections are based on the relatively high
foreign trade level of the last three years and that transit trade with Senegal
is subject to unforeseeable developments. In determining the economic merits
of the proposed project, the projected growth rates were considered to
represent the upper limit of the expected development and were supplemented by
a lower hyphothesis, based on a 30% reduction of the consultants' growth
estimates.
B. Evaluation of Alternative Solutions
5.o6      The Gambia's economy is highly dependent on foreign trade.  During
1961-64 the combined value of imports and exports, including recorded re-
exports, averaged about 80% of estimated GDP (cf. Senegal:4hO).  Providing
adequate facilities for export and import trade requtrements is therefore
of prime importance to the whole economy.
5.07      During the last four years, as a result of growing traffic and
reduced handling capacity at Admiralty Tifharf, there have been considerable
delays to ships serving Bathurst:
Year             l4aiting time
(ship-days)
1965/66               54
1966/67              108
1967/68               68
1968/69               80
This development has led the shipping conference to threaten a freight
surcharge to and from Bathurst if no action is taken to increase the port's
capacity. Although no date has been mentioned, there is little doubt that
this surcharge would eventually be imposed.



- 15 -
5.08      In this situation, three alternative courses of action can be
considered:
Freezing the capacity of Bathurst port at its present
level and using overland transport to neighbaring ports
in Senegal for additional traffic;
Installation of lighterage facilities at Bathurst; and
Construction of one or more deepwater berths at Bathurst.
(i) Overland Transport to Senegalese Ports
5.09      The Senegalese ports of Kaolack and Ziguinchor, both within a
range of 75 to 100 miles from Bathurst do not offer an attractive alter-
native to Bathurst.  Both have difficult approaches due to shifting sand-
bars and are limited to ships of 13 to 15 ft draft. If the hinterland
of the ports in the Senegambian area were to be defined on economic
grounds there is every reason to expect that Bathurst would provide
cheaper service to areas now served by Kaolack and Ziguinchor, mainly
because of the very good navigational conditions of the Gambia River.
5.10      Dakar,  about 200 miles frcm Bathurst-Barra over a fully paved
road, is a modern and well-equipped port and the incremental tonnages
under consideration in Bathurst could probably be handled by this port
for some years without substantial capital investment. The proposed
new wharf of Bathurst is expected to eliminate port congestion almost
completely by 1973/74.  Without the new wharf the same result could only
be achieved by diverting a minimu  of 25,000 tons to Dakar in 1973/74
and more thereafter. The incremental economic costs of trucking to and
from Dakar are estimated at EG5 per ton or IG125,000 for the whole oper-
ation. This is in excess 4f the economic savings which would result
from postponing the project by one year and which are estimated, on the
basis of 10% opportunity cost of capital, at a maxi.mt of EGlOO00. With-
out considering in detail the adverse effects of traffic diversion on
local trade and the established oil milling industry in Bathurst it is,
therefore, concluded that providing additional port capacity at Bathurst
will be less costly than trans-shipment via Dakar.
(ii) Lighterage versus Deepwater Berth
5.11     Wlith existing installations and facilities, lighterage operations
cannot be expanded. If lighterage is to be considered as a means of re-
ducing existing and expected part congestion, the construction of a new
lighterage wharf would be required.  Two possible solutions were considered
by the consultants, basically consisting of acquiring a towing launch, five
barges, two mobile cranes and the construction of a special lighterage
wharf at either Government Wharf or Admiralty 1Jharf.  The total costs of
both lighterage schemes, together with the necessary supporting facilities,
rehabilitation of Government Wharf, etc., are estimated at about EG95,0O00,
only slightly less than the estimated total cost of the proposed project
(EG1l,012,000).In view of the necessity of providing additional installations



- 16 -
for the discharge of petroleum products and the higher labor costs of
lighterage due to double handlIng, the introduction of a lighterage scheme
is not an attractive alternative to the construction of a deepwater berth.
C. The Proposed Project
(i) New Berth at Admiralty Wharf
5.12      The proposed construction of one deepwater berth and supporting
facilities will increase the port capacity and improve operating efficiency.
Economic benefits will consist mainly of a reduction in ship turnaround
time and reduced cargo-handling costs. The major benefit will be the
avoidance of ship delays which are expected to increase rapidly in the
near future if no action is taken. For the purpose of the economic apprais-
al it was therefore important to forecast the development of ship waiting
time both with and without the proposed investment. The consultants
carried out a simple simulation of future operations and concluded that
a marked rise in ship delays would occur in 1972 without additional capac-
ity and that the port would become completely congested beyond 1976/77.
These findings were confirmed by a computation of expected ship-waiting
time based on a queuing theory model which had been developed in the Bank.
5.13      Apart from the statistical assumptions underlying the model, the
expected numdber of ship-days waiting or working alongside depends on the
future traffic and the productivity of port operations. The computation
was therefore carried out for two hypotheses of traffic development and
for two possible levels of productivity (tons per day per berth), allowing
for the introduction of two shift work for both exports and imports. The
results can be summarized as follows:
(a) Even under the lower traffic forecasts and the most
optimistic productivity assumptions, Government Wharf
alone is not capable of providing adequate service
beyond 1973/74.
(b) A second berth is likely to provide sufficient capacity
throughout the 1970's. Only an unexpected increase in
traffic would require a third berth and, in view of the
uncertainties regarding the transit trade, it is not
considered justified to provide more than one additional
berth at this time.
5.14      Since the existing one-berth port is likely to be completely
congested in the early years of the economic life of the proposed second
berth, the calculation of an economic rate of return on the investment,
which would then become infinite, does not produce a useful criterion for
the investment decision. Under these circumstances, and after having
concluded that an additional berth would provide the least cost solution,
the investment decision is one of optimum timing and the appropriate
criterion is the first year benefit. The return on the investment during
the first year of operation of the new berth should be at least equal to
the opportunity cost of capital.



- 17 -
5.15      Details of the cost-benefit analysis are given in Table 3. For
the purpose of this appraisal, the opportunity cost of capital has been
taken as 10%, and the cost of the project has been adjusted by accounting
for the cost of capital tied up during construction. On the benefit side,
based on information provided by the shipping industry and investigations
carried out by the consultants, the cost of an average ship-day for the
type of ships calling at Bathurst is estimated at a minimum of iG500
(US$1,200) per day. Labor cost of moving general cargo from the ship into
the transit shed presently averages 10 shillings per ton. Reductions in
the nunber of wharf and shed labor, resulting from provision of the new
handling equipment combined with an increase in gang productivity, re-
sulting mainly from improved working conditions on and with the new
facilities, are expected to result in a reduction of handling costs of
2 shillings per ton. Due to lack of data, the benefits from reductions
in pilferage and damage to cargo have not been quantified.
5.16      Accepting the consultantsl traffic forecast and assuming that
full two shift work can be introduced in 1973/74, the first year economic
return of the project is calculated at 13%. The project would yield a
satisfactory first year return of 9% even if the lower traffic forecasts
materialize and all cost and benefit parameters were to move in the neg-
ative directions by 10%.
(ii)   Rehabilitation of Government Wharf
5.17      The foregoing analysis assumes two wharves in working condition,
However, Government W4harf is also in bad repair and not expected to last
more than 10 years if no action is taken. The proposed rehabilitation
works will extend the life of the existing structure to a total of at
least 25 years, thereby postponing full reconstruction for about 15 years
and eliminating increasing maintenance costs. These savings are cal-
culated to yield an economic rate of return of at least 17%.
D.   Conclusion
5.18      As with most port projects designed to relieve congestion, the
bulk of the benefits will accrue to the shipowners in the first instance,
However, the shipping industry on the West African coast is not considered
to be in a position to fix rates independently of cost developments. Any
worsening of port congestion at Bathurst would certainly lead to sur-
charges on ocean freight rates. By the same token it may be expected
that, after some delay, cost reductions resulting from the proposed project
will be reflected in rate reductions, thus benefiting the economy of The
Gambia.

6. FUIPNCE AND TARIFFS
A. Present
6.01      An accurate statement of the port's present finances cannot be
prepared from the inadequate accounting records currently produced from the
system outlined in para. 3.06. However, a reasonable assessment is possible
by supplementing the available information with estimates of asset values,
depreciation and certain operating expenses.
6.02      The estimated values of fixed assets, including land, as at June
30, 1969 prepared by the Consultants and modified by the Mission total
LG 364,000 and total annual depreciation is estimated to be EG 189370.
6.03      It was also necessary to estimate the cost of the dockyard services
in order to assess the expenses incurred in repairing harbor craft and port
cranes. Detailed cost estimates of dockyard operations and the apportionment
of unallocated dockyard costs are shown in Table 4. The estimates show that
the value of work performed by the dockyard during fiscal year 1968 was
LG 109,000.  Of this, about 50,;j related to ferry repairs, 25% to port craft
and equipment and the remainder to other government departments and the
private sector. These estimated proportions have been applied to apportion
future estimated dockyard expenditure in calculating future port finances
in section B of this chapter.
6.04      The resulting assessment of the port's viability during the fiscal
years ending June 30, 1968, 1969 and 1970, using estimates described above,
is shown in Table 5. The port portion of it is summarized below:

- 19 -
The net operating revenue average of 1  20,000 represents an estimated annual
return of about 9S  on net fixed assets in use.
6.05      The port's tariff charges have not been changed during the last
ten years despite vage increases in 1966 for certain categories of daily
rated workers and low-scaled monthly paid staff in early 1969. Wharf,
pilotage, light and buoyage dues are governed by the 1966 Navigation and
Pilotage Act whilst harbor dues are fixed by the 1966 Harbor Dues Act.
Nevertheless, as indicated in para. 6.o4 the port is currently viable.
6.o6      As the port is only one of three services controlled by the
Marine Department, the other two being dockyard and ferries, and as finances
are considerably intermingled, Table 1 also shows ferry service estimated
financial results. The service is clearly unprofitable but if estimated
1970 fiscal revenue is reliable, the deficit will have been reduced from
LG 25,000 in 1968 to LG 10,000 in 1970. For reasons stated in para. 3.11
it is not considered that this service should fall within the Port Authority's-
functions.
B. Future
6.07      The future financial position of the port will depend very much
on certain interrelated events and conditions. The establishment of a Port
Authority will ensure separate accountability and enable future port rates
to be reasonably based upon the cost of such services. But in addition to
recovering costs, the tariff policy will be influenced principally by five
considerations:
(a)  the capital structure of the Port Authority;
(b) debt servicing requirements;
(c)  dividend, if any, on the Government's equity
contribution;
(d) the amount of reserves that should be created
for future investments; and
(e)  the incidence of taxation.
6.08      Regarding capital structure, debt servicing and equity, upon
completion of the project the new assets should be transferred at cost to the
Port Authority. The Port Authority will assume a debt to the Government equalto
the IDA credit at an interest rate of 7,fl per annum for a period of 20 years,
repayment to be made half-yearly commencing in fiscal year 1975. An inventorj
of existing port assets in use (including land) will be prepared and these
assets transferred to the Authority at a realistic value and the corresponding
capital treated as Government equity in the Authority. The inventory will



- 20 -
clearly distinguish between operating and non-operating assets.  These
arrangements were agreed during negotiations.
6.09      Insofar as the creation of reserves and the incidence of taxation
are concerned, it was agreed during negotiations that the Port Authority
will establish new tariff rates which will be reasonably related to costs;
these rates will be revised as necessary from time to time and designed
(except as the Government and the Association may otherwise agree) to enable
the Authority to maintain a cash position sufficient to cover the repayment
of the credit from the Government; replacement of equipment; maintenance
of adequate working capital; and adequate reserves for contingencies and
for financing minor future port investments. This should be achieved if
the Authority earns a financial rate of return on the average value of net
operating fixed assets after taxation, if any, of not less than 6%v by 1977
and 8% by 1979.
6.10      On the basis of the above conditions, future operating costs of
the port have been estimated and the extent of overall port rates increases
calculated, using project cargo tonnages and ships expected to use the
port, to produce revenues sufficient to cover these costs, earn a reasonable
return on the investment and enable adequate reserves to be accumulated.
Assumptions used are listed in Annex 5.
6.11      Table 6 gives the income account forecasts from 1973 to 1979, sum-
marized below, based on calculated tariff increases of 10% overall in Octo-
ber 1971 and a further 15% in July 1973 which are considered reasonable (see
para.6.l5) and necessary on the basis of financial data currently available
and traffic forecasts contained in Table 2. The first increase closely fol-
lows the introduction of a unified cargo handling scheme whilst the second
occurs soon after the ccmpletion of the project. During negotiations the
Government agreed to increase the rates by not less than 10% by October 1971
and, upon completion of the project, with the assistance of the Port Account-
ing Advisor, review such rates together with the Association.

The estimates cover a period of seven years with the project coming into
full operational use by the commencement of fiscal year 1973/74. During this
period little equipment replacement or addition would be necessary.  An 8d
return on average net fixed assets in use could be achieved by 1979 rising
from about 5% in 1975 through 6% in 1977.
6.12      The considerable rise in revenue and expenditure occurring in
1974 is due to the assumption of full responsibility by the Port Authority
of the Master Porterage Scheme referred to in para. 3.07 and outlined in
Annex 2.
6.13      During the period 1973-79 the port is expected to generate ample
cash, sufficient to permit payment to the Government of 7% interest on the
credit and to accumulate about LG260,000  towards the expansion of facilities
and equipment replacements which might be needed by 1979/80. Consideration
could be given at that juncture to the possibility of dividend being paid
by the Port Authority to the Government on the equity capital. The cash
flow statement shown in Table 7 is summarized as follows:

6.15      The proposed increases in the present rates are reasonable.
Current rates compare favorably with the port of Dakar (Senegal): vessel
port dues and pilotage charges are much lower and wharf charges (ex-
cluding handling costs) are the same for general cargo. A comparison of
handling costs is difficult to make because they are presently incurred
by shipping agencies. However, improved berthing and operational facil-
ities should provide lower costs to shipping to offset against higher
charges.
6.16      As a Government department, the Marine  Department's expendi-
tures and revenues are subject to audit by the Director of Audit as well
as by the Internal Audit Division of the Ministry of Torks and Communications,
However, as the accounting system of the Port Authority will be based upon
modern commercial practice, they should be audited by qualified independent
external auditors. This was agreed during negotiations and an undertaking
obtained that upon creation of the Port Authority external auditors, satis-
factory to the Association, will be appointed.
6.17      Since there is no insurance reserve to be taken over, it was
agreed during credit negotiations that the Port Authority will take out and
maintain with reputable insurers insurance cover for such risks and for such
amounts as are consistent with good commerical practice.

78 RVCCETNJDATIONS
7.01      During credit negotiations, the following principal points were
discussed and agreed with the Government:
(1) A Master Porterage Scheme will be devised and imple-
mented by July 1, 1971, under terms acceptable to the
Association, and full and sole responsibility for the
Scheme will be assumed by the Port Authority by July 1,
1973 (para.3.07);
(2) An autonomous Port Authority will be created in agree-
ment wTith the Association not later than July 1, 1972, and
the Government will consult with the Association on the
appointment of the Chief Fxecutive (para. 3.08);
(3) f2gineering consultants will be employed for designing and
supervising the project. A port operations advisor and a
port accounting advisor will be appointed not later than
January 1, 1971 (paras. 3.09, 3.10, 4.06);
(4) The Government will decide,before the creation of the Port
Authority, whether the dockyard will be managed by the
Authority on an agent basis or as owner by integration
(para.3.11); and whether the cross-river ferry services will
be operated by the Port Authority (para.3.12);
(5) Contracts for construction and equipment supply will
be awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines and subject
to Association approval (para.4.09);
(6) All areas allocated for future port development will
not be used in a way that may be an obstacle to future
port development (para.4.15);
(7) The new assets will be transferred to the Port Authority
at cost and existing port assets at a realistic value
(para.6.08);
(8) The proposed Port Authority assumes a debt to the
Government equivalent to the total IDA Credit at an
interest rate of 7% p.a. for a period of 20 years
(para.6.08);



- 25 -
(9) NewJ rates and charges based upon costs will be
established and an adequate cash position maintained
by achieving a financial rate of return on net opera-
ting fixed assets of not less than 6% by fiscal 1976/77
and 85's by fiscal 1978/79 (para.6.09); and to this end raise
such rates by at least 100 not later than October 1, 1971
and, upon completion of the project, review such rates
together with the Association (para.6.11);
(10) External auditors will be appointed and adequate
insurance cover be taken out and maintained by the Port
Authority (paras.6.16 and 6.17).
7.02      With the assurances indicated, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$2.10 million equivalent to the
Government of The Gambia.

DA7HUJRST PORT' PROJECT
Existing Port Facilities
1.        Bathurst port, at the mouth of the Gambia River, is the principal
shipping facility in The Gambia. The port possesses excellent anchorage and
completely shelters seagoing ships, although short-lived tornadoes can en-
danger small craft in the harbor area.  Maximum water depth in the harbor is
90 ft.
A. The Channel
2.        The entrance channel extends 25 miles from the outer fairway buoy
to the port. The eight miles long inner channel presents few problems as
there is deep water throughout its length; over the 17 miles outer channel,
there is a depth of at least 2S ft. There is an extensive bar that effect-
ively limits the draft of ships using the channel to about 30 ft, at ErHWSTI/.
However, this compares favorably with other UJest African ports.
3.        The channel is provided with insufficient navigational aids; the
positions of the few marker buoys are difficult to fix accurately owing to
the absence of landmarks on the distant coastline. As a result, ships some-
times wait for high water and waste time, especially in conditions of poor
visibility or swells.
B.  The 1harves
4.        The port consists of two berths c&-Led 1o hz*dl3 ocean-otig
vessels; namely Government ;Tharf and Admiralty Tharf.  The area immediately
behind and in-between the wharves is substantially built up.
5.       'Ihe Government TTharf is the main berth for unloading break-bulk
cargo and for loading groundnut-oil and cake. It is a T-shaped reinforced
concrete structure completed in 1952 as an extension of the original wrought
iron wharf. 'The head of the iwharf is 300 ft long and 40 ft wide. The ap-
proach structure is 32 ft w>xide and comprises a 26 ft roadway and six feet
pipe track which carries fresh water and groundnut-oil pipelines. A berth-
ing dolphin is located 100 ft to the north of the wharf; a similar one to
the south was accidentalLy destroyed in 1967.  A depth of 28 ft alongside
the wharf is maintained by occasional dredging.
6.       'The condition of Government W7harf is not good.  The underside of
concrete beams and parts of the deck slab is splintered and most of the
concrete supports for the timber fendering are craclked. Little effort has
been made to effect repairs and where reinforcement is exposed it is badly
7 High Water Ordinary Spring Tide



ANNEX I
Page 2
corroded. The cylindrical concrete p.les appear to be in good condition
although there is some evidence of slight settlement.
7.        Admiralty Wharf is used for discharging petroleum products and,
to a very limited extent, for loading and unloading general cargo. It is
also used by various river and harbor craft. The wharf is a U-shaped
timber-decked structure 270 ft long and 25 ft wide supported on rhum paLm
piles with an approach way at each end. The depth alongside the wharf
restricts its use to vessels of 21 ft draft. The southern arm wTas built
in 1941, while the northern arm was built in 1956. The two arms were
joined in 1959 to form the present structure.
8.        The wharf is in poor condition and cannot be used by cars and
lorries.  ilooring a tanker alongside this wiharf has become hazardous and
is giving rise to increasing concern.
C. Jetties
9.        Between Government Jharf and Admiralty Wharf, there are eight small
jetties owned by various trading companies, of which five are in very poor
condition.  The only one significant for port operations is that belonging
to the Gambia River Transport Co. (GRT).  The GRT Jetty can support a mobile
crane and is occasionally used for unloading lighters.
10.       The Bathurst-Barra ferry terminal is located to the north of
Admiralty K'harf and provides service for passengers and vehicles.  To meet
traffic demand an additional ferry is now under construction in the dock-
yard.  The existing terminal is likely to become increasingly unsatisfactory
as its importance grows. The present car parking arrangements are barely
adequate.
11.       There are three jetties south of Admiralty Wharf, all of timber
deck and piling. Tro were recently reconstructed for use by the dockyard;
the third, known as the BOAC jetty and in very poor condition, is accessible
only to pedestrians, however, it serves numerous small river craft.
D. "ransit Sheds, Open Storage
12.       Transit sheds adjacent to Goverrment W.harf comprise a new shed
with floor area of 16,000 sq ft and a number of old sheds with a combined
area of 18,000 sq ft. The layout ofthe older sheds makes the use of
mechanical-handling equipment very difficult and headroom at the entrances
and inside the sheds is inadequate. None of the sheds is marked to facili-
tate planning and control of cargo. There are no sheds at Admiralty lWharf.
13.       Considerable congestion occurs in the area immediately outside
the sheds due to the restricted approaches, the lack of adequate parking
and turning space for vehicles and indifferent traffic discipline. The
area available for open storage is about 17,000 sq ft.



AIVEX 1,
Page 3
14.       As the port has no warehouses it is comXmon to find certain con-
signees utilizing a transit shed as a warehouse by not collecting cargo at
the earliest practicable date. Rent is payable after five days but this
does not apply to Government cargo.  This factor, combined with a shortage
of transport, has resulted in considerable quantities of cargo remaining
in the port.
E. Cargo-Handling Equipment
15.       A-t Government WTharf ships are off-loaded using ships' gear.
16.       Mobile equipment owmed by the Government is limited to two cranes
of five tons each in poor condition, and one crane of 18 tons in moderate
condition. Mobile equipment belonging to private firms includes six trac-
tors and 56 trailers of one to five toIs.
17.       Floating equipment owned by the Government includes a twio-year old
clam-shell grab capable of dredging about 30 cu yd per day, a two-year old
325 hp tugboat used as a pilot launch and for towing lighters, 10 mooring
launches in good to moderate condition, two powered lighters and one dumb
barge of 150 tons each, 10 powered ferries and three cable-drawn across
the river, all in good to moderate condition. Privately-owned floating
equipment includes 250 wooden sailing canoes of 20 to 150 tons, 48 wooden
sailing cutters of 50 to 100 tons, 56 lighters of 50 to 200 tons and 21
towing tugs of 36 to 300 hp.
F. Dockyard
18.       The dockyard, situated to the south of Admiralty Wharf, is
operated by the lIarine Department. It includes the following facilities:
(i) a 40 x 130 ft mechanical shop, 50 years old, containing a
bettery-charging section, an engine-reconditioning section
and 10 machines for shaping, drilling and cutting;
(ii) a 30 x 60 ft plater and blacksmith shop, containing four
machines for drilling, cutting and rolling;
(iii) a foundry shop for casting small parts;
(iv) a fuel-pump shop for repairing fuel-pumps and injectors;
(v) a 60 x 130 ft building shed for building ferries, launches
and small craft,
(vi) a 30 x 80 ft carpentry shop, 20 years old, containing four
machines for satwing and plaring;

Bkr1HU7,ST PORT PROJECT
A. Cargo Handling
B. Functions of Proposed
Port Authority
A. Cargo Handling
1.       In 1967, a leading shipping agency which represents almost 3051
of all ocean-going vessels using Bathurst port, submitted proposals to the
Government for the establishment of a wharf cargo-handling system (termed
a Master Porterage Scheme) which provides for the unified control of all
cargo-handling operations betteen shipside and shed. Under the scheme
a small tean of permanent port staff will coordinate the supply of labor
and mobile equipment and supervise the movement, sorting and stacking of
cargo on the wharves and in sheds.  They will also be responsible for
cargo docwnnentation and security and the efficient use of shed and open
storage space. They will also assist in the raising of charges for these
services and maintain   timekeeping records for the labor under their
control.  It was proposed that these functions be undertaken either by the
Government or under Governmnent license by private enterprise.  At that
time it was also recognized that changes would be required in the organization
of the labor force and in the mode of cargo operations.
2.       On July 1, 1973, when cargo-handling operations are expected to
start at the Admiralty Wharf, two years' experience will have been acquired
in the working of the scheme and the knowledge gained can be applied to the
new facilities. It is also recommended that full responsibility for the
scheme be assumed by the Port Autlhority by July 1, 1973. Mechanical cargc-
handling equipment to be purchased under the proposed Credit could be used
on a hire basis in the operation cf the scheme until full control is assured
by the Port Authority.
B. Functions of Proposed Port Authority
3.       The principal operating powers of the Port Authority would be to;
(i) control shipping movements;
(ii) control pilotage and tug services;
(iii)  control communication systems and navigational aids;
(iv) carry out construction and maintenance including dredging;



AflNEX 2

(v)  provide wharf, cargo handling, storage and other port
facilities and services;
(vi) control other interrelated services (e.g. dockyard) as
considered necessary or desirable;
(vii) fix rates for services it provides;
(viii) prepare annual operating and capital budgets;
(ix) borrow money (subject to government approval); and
(x) operate banking accounts.

It has been agreed between the Association and the Government
of The Gambia that every effort will be made to improve the efficiency
and financial viability of the port of Bathurst by introducing a "Master
Porterage Scheme" to provide unified control of all cargo operations and
by creating a port authority to operate the port on sound commercial lines.
To this end it has been further agreed that a Port Operations Advisor and
a Port Accounting Advisor will be appointed for a period of two years to
provide to the Port of Bathurst recent managerial experience in port
operation, administration, accounting and costing. The advisors will carry
out these assignments with the full cooperation of the Government of The
Gambia.
Scope:
1.        The duties of the Advisors will be:
(a) To examine and report on the best way of reorganizing,
coordination and operating the separate activities of
the several bodies now responsible for port operations
in the Port of Bathurst to bring them within the control
of a single Port Authority which will become operational
not later than July 1, 1972.
(b) To report their findings and recommendations individually
to the Government. Copies of their reports will be made
available to the Association by the Government.
(c) To bear in mind the comparatively small volume of port
traffic and the limited number of trained staff available.
(d) To work in close cooperation at all times with the
Government and the several bodies now responsible for
port operations and with each other.
2.        More particularly the Port Operations Advisor will:
(a) Devise a scheme to achieve more efficient cargo handling
on the wharves and in storage areas, based upon the pro-
posed "MIaster Porterage Scheme", and assist in negotiating
the terms under wxhich a shipping agency shall operate it
for a period of two years.

THE GAE BIA
BA HURST POR-T PROJECT
Estimate of Berthage Required. Depth of lJater and Transit Sheds
A. Deep-sea Berths
1.        The number and length of berths required depend upon several con-
siderations, some of' which are interrelated, including (a) total cargo ton-
nage; (b) type of cargo; (c) volume of b-ulk, bagged, baled and liquid cargo;
(d)  discharge and loading rate; (e) availability of labor, number of shifts
and productivity.
2.        Bathurst is one of several ports of call for conference ships on
the West African route and is normally the first port on the southbound
voyage and the last on the northbound.  In 1967-68, 158 general cargo ships
and tankers called at Bathurst, and discharged or loaded 144,300 tons. In
1971/72 the number of vessels is expected to increase to 177 and the tonnage
to 160,000 tons whereas in 1976/77, the fourth year of operation of the pro-
ject these figures are expected to be 194 vessels and 210,000 tons.
3.        A reasonable average annual tonnage per foot of berth for such
mixed cargo (groundnut oil, petroleum products and general cargo) is 340
tons (eight hours working day and four hours overtime). Based on the con-
sultant's traffic forecast, the total length of berths wTould be:
Year                Total Traffic            Length of Berths
1972/73              170,000 tons                  500 ft
1075/76              200,000 tons                  600 ft
1979/80              239,000 tons                   700 ft
4.        Since the length of Government iTharf is 300 ft, the port should
have a new berth 400 ft long.  These two berths could handle traffic up to
1980, although in the later years some congestion is foreseen during peak
periods. In 1972/73, after completion of the project, about 70,000 tons of
groundnut oil, groundnut cake and miscellaneous cargo would be exported via
Government Ts7harf, and 100,000 tons of general cargo and petroleum products
would be imported via Admiralty fTharf.  In 1979/80 these figures will be
98,800 tons of exports and 140,000 tons of imports (see Table 3).  These
figures are reasonable for the length of berths and for the type of cargo
handled.
B. Shallow-Draft Vessel-s Jetty
5.        Harbor craft such as tugs, service launches, barges, fishing boats,
etc. contribute to, and form part of, the port traffic pattern. The Govern-
ment-owned harbor and river craft (A,nnex 1, para. 17) can be added to an
estimated oO Gambian and Senegalese fishing boats and a number of private
cutters, canoes and launches. Any increase in the number of harbor craft
is likely to stem mainly from a gradual increase in fishing activities. L



ANNEX 4
Page 2
small increase in the number of harbor craft has therefore been assumed by
the consultants, which gives a total of 150 by 1976/77, in addition to about
400 river-craft (cutters, canoes, barges and tugs). Present berthing faci-
lities for harbor craft are inadequate (see Annex 1, paras. 9 and 11). In
order to improve existing facilities, replacement of the delapidated BOAC
jetty by a new T-shaped jetty (llap 2) is recommended. The head would be
200 ft long and the causeway would be 20 ft wjide.
C.  Depth of Water
6.       Due to depth limitations at the majority of `W%est Mfrican ports, it
is unlik:ely that there will be any great increase in the draft of ships cal-
ling at Bathurst. Consequently, extensive dredging operations do not appear
necessary. The depth of the navigable channel is at least 28 ft. A depth
of 28 ft alongside the Government wharf is maintained by occasional dredging
whereas the depth in front of the new Admiralty TWharf will be 30 ft.  Sizeabis
container ship trade is not envisaged for many years but occasional single
containers carried as deck cargo may be expected.
D. Transit Sheds
7.       At present the average unloading rate per working day  at Government
Wharf is 420 tons for general cargo, 500 tons for cargo in cartons and
600 tons for cement. After completion of the project, Government TWlharf will
be used mainly for exports and Admiralty W.Jharf mainly for imports. After
1975 the average unloading rate per working day at the new Admiralty WIharf
will be 650 tons. Description of transit shed accommodation adjacent to
Government lharf is given in Annex 1, para. 12.  The new shed, which is the
only efficiently usable one, has a 16,000 sq ft area and will be used to
store export cargo. Consignees are allowed a free five-day period before
collecting their goods which is considered reasonable. Consequently,
transit sheds at Admiralty Wharf should be able to accommodate 650 x 5 =
3,250 tons of cargo. Assuming 10 sq ft are required for each ton of general
cargo and 40% of the shed area is required for the movement of goods, the
total transit shed area required would be 5L,000 sq ft. Two sheds 250 x
100 ft and 290 x 100 ft are thus included in the project. As the port has
no warehouses, it may be possible to allocate a closed area inside one of
the two sheds for long storage purposes.
