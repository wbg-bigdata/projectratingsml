Project Completion Report
Liberia
Third Power Project
Loan 1150 LBR
Preface
This is a completion report of the Third Power Project, for which
Loan 1150 LBR was approved on July 8, 1975. The objective of the loan was, in
the short term to halt the deterioration of the Liberia Electricity
Corporation's services and lay the foundation for later improvements, and in
the longer term to reestablish the Corporation as an efficient power utility
with enhanced planning capability for future developments.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Western Africa
Region on the basis of a country visit in November, 1981, the President's
Report of June 25, 1975, and a study of the files. Comments were received
from the borrower and have been attached as an Annex, and where appropriate
these have been reflected in the report.
The project has not been subjected to audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

Project Performance Audit Report
Liberia
Third Power Project
Loan 1150 LBR
Highlights
The project originated from the appraisal in 1974 of a project to
extend the Liberia Electricity Corporation's (LEC) diesel generating capacity
in Monrovia. The appraisal mission for that project concluded that because of
a reduced growth rate in demand for power, the project should be deferred for
about two years. The mission also concluded that the LEC was badly in need of
technical assistance to improve its management. Since neither the UNDP nor
bilateral financing was available, the Bank agreed to finance the required
technical assistance and some planning studies. The loan became effective in
October 1975. It was due to be completed by December 1978 but was extended
for two and a half years to June 1981 because of delay in completing a study
of the hydroelectric resources of the St. Paul River. The principal objective
of the loan was to improve the management of LEC, particularly in the areas of
planning and accounting, and also to improve the corporation's cash position,
in order to prepare a sound basis for the next stage of development.
The project was successful in completing an inventory of potential
developments of hydroelectric power on the St. Paul River, including a
prefeasiblity study of the preferred project for initial development. A
detailed five year investment plan was prepared and the foundations laid for
preparation of a long term development plan.
The project was not successful in improving the LEC's cash position
and only in the planning and transmission and distribution departments was
there any marked improvement in management. One of the reasons for this poor
performance was the fact that LEC had no previous experience of recruiting
expatriates for technical assistance and before the Bank was aware of it the
LEC hired a multinational team of experts which subsequently proved to be a
failure. Another reason for the lack of success in training management was
the difficulty of obtaining suitably qualified Liberians to train because of
the inadequate salary scales imposed on LEC by the Government. The main
reason for the failure to improve the cash position was the Government's
refusal to approve the required tariff increases. Other reasons were, the
failure to stop widespread theft of electricity through illegal connections
and tampering with meters, and inadequacies in the meter reading and billing
departments.
The Government did not meet the covenant in the Guarantee Agreement
that LEC would be permitted to fully exercise the powers conferred on them by
the Act of 1973 establishing the Corporation. As a result of the Government's



default the Borrower did not meet the covenants which required them to (i)
introduce a new salary structure adequate to attract qualified personnel, and
(ii) take such action including tariff increases as may be necessary to
achieve a rate of return on current value of net fixed assets of 10% from
January 1977. With regard to (ii) the rate of return on "historically" valued
assets was only 1.9% in 1977 and minus 3.6% in 1978, and losses increased from
28% of net KWh generated in 1975 to 34.5% in 1979.
The principal lessons to be learned from this project are
(i) supervision by the Bank needs to be more frequent than every twelve months
(as in this case), especially in the early stages when visits at three or four
months intervals might be justified, (ii) unless Governments are prepared to
observe the loan convenants which require them to permit parastatal bodies
such as LEC to exercise the degree of autonomy conferred on them by their
statutes - particularly in the matter of determining adequate levels of staff
remuneration and tariffs, there is very little the Bank Group can do to help
them improve efficiency through loans or grants for technical assistance.



PART I - INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01     In 1980 there was a general upheaval in Liberia following the coup
which formed the present Government. In the period following the coup a
number of changes were made in senior staff positions in LEC, in some cases
successive changes, as a result of which some senior staff have been in their
present jobs for a few months only. This factor made it very difficult for
the Bank staff responsible for preparing this project to obtain a coherent
picture of the sequence of events, the reason for certain actions on the part
of the borrower, or the performance of the main participants in the field.
Background
1.02     Before 1972, the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) operated as an
autonomous government-owned agency responsible for power, water supply and
sewer services. In 1972, when radio, T.V. and telecommunications were added
to its responsibilities, PUA was reorganized into a holding corporation with
four subsidiary corporations, one of which, the Liberia Electricity
Corporation (LEC), was responsible for the power sector. According to their
statutes, all of the four subsidiary corporations were to be run as separate
entities with full financial autonomy. PUA was to be responsible for policy
making only, leaving management functions to the four subsidiaries. However,
the law establishing PUA as a holding corporation was unclear about its
authority and responsibility, and in practice PUA was very much involved in
LEC's day to day management.
1.03     Up to 1975, the Bank had made two loans and a supplemental loan to
the Liberian public power sector, 684-LBR1Por US$ 7.4 million in June 1970 and
778-LBR for US$ 4.7 million in July 19711-    These loans helped finance a 34
MW expansion of the Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, two gas turbines for the
Monrovia system, and associated transmission and distribution facilities. To
cover project cost increases because of currency fluctuations and increase in
the size of the gas turbines chosen for installation, the Bank made a
supplemental loan of US$2.9 million in 1973 (loan 778A-LBR). The borrower for
these three loans was the Public Utilities Authority (PUA).
Power Sector
1.04     In 1972 a statute creating LEC as an autonomous government enterprise
gave it the authority to borrow money and set electricity rates. It had its
own Board of Directors consisting of nine members: a chairman who was
1/ Both these loans and the supplemental loan were the subject of an OED
audit in February 1977.



- 2 -
previously chairman of PUA, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Justice,
the Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs, and five representatives of the
private sector appointed by the President.
1.05     By 1975 about 40 percent of the power consumed in Liberia was
supplied by the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), while the remaining 60%
was generated and used mainly by iron ore mining companies. LEC's system was
the main source of public power and served the capital Monrovia and its
environs. LEC's generating plant consisted of two 15 MW and two 17 MW units
at the Mount Coffee hydroplant on the St. Paul River, four gas turbines with a
total capacity of 68 MW and six diesel units with a total capacity of 13 MW a
total of 145 MW. Since the Mount Coffee plant is a run-of-river plant and the
dry season riverflow is equivalent to about 10 MW, the total firm capacity of
the system was only about 80 MW, allowing for about 11 MW diesel plant in
reserve. In addition to these facilities, LEC operated seven small secondary
centers on an agency basis for the Government. The mining companies, together
with some small privately owned installations, have an installed capacity of
about 150 MW.
PART II - PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION
Project Identification
2.01     In 1974, LEC requested a third Bank loan to finance a thermal
generating facility recommended by its consultants. This facility was planned
to provide LEC's system with sufficient capacity to meet demand until the
early 1980s. While in the field to appraise this project, the Bank mission
concluded that because of reduced load growth the installation of a further
thermal generating facility should be postponed by about two years but LEC
urgently needed technical assistance to improve its management. The
Government accepted both of these conclusions, and the Bank and the Government
contacted a number of potential bilateral and multilateral sources for
financing a technical assistance project. Since none of the other sources was
willing to provide the funds required, the Bank agreed to finance the
technical assistance along with some needed studies, as an interim project
leading to the Power IV loan for expansion of generating facilities. The
objective was to halt the deterioration of LEC's services and reestablish it
as an efficient power utility and to determine priorities for additions to
generating facililties.
Project Description
2.02     The project consisted of:
(A) The provision of qualified and experienced personnel, including
consultants, to:



-3-
i. Investigate the hydro resources of the St. Paul River in order to
complete the inventory of hydroelectric potential in the vicinity
of the principal load centered around Monrovia;
ii. Establish a long range development plan for the power sector in
Liberia based on a demand study;
iii. Prepare a detailed investment program including the next
addition to generating capacity.
(B)  The provision of experts:
i. to strengthen the LEC's management; and
ii.  to train the LEC's management and operational staff.
Details of non standard covenants contained in the loan and project agreements
and comments on the borrowers adherence to them, or otherwise, are given in
Annex I.
PART III - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.01     The Project became effective on October 20, 1975 and was scheduled to
be finished by December 31, 1978. The closing date was extended to December
31, 1980 and finally to June 30, 1981, in order to provide time to complete
the hydro-resources study and the management assistance program. There were
no revisions and the project was finally completed at the estimated cost in
June 1981. A schedule of disbursements is given in Annex II.
3.02     Procurement.  For investigation of the hydroelectric resources of
Liberia, ten internationally reknowned consulting firms were approached by
Government and nine of these submitted proposals. These procedures and the
draft contract with the consultants were reviewed by the Bank and were in line
with the Bank's guidelines for selection of consultants.
3.03     Before calling on the Bank for assistance in financing the technical
assistance aspects of the project, the Government had already attempted but
failed to obtain the services of-a foreign electrical utility to assist LEC in
overcoming its management deficiencies. It had therefore hired an individual
consultant to assess LEC's manpower needs and help in international
recruitment of suitably qualified personnel for key positions. Following
pressure from the Ministry of Finance to urgently implement the Technical
Assistance Project, the LEC in late 1975 with assistance from this consultant
recruited a cosmopolitan group of expatriates. This exercise proved to be a
failure (see para 3.08). The LEC then invited proposals from engineering
consultants for provision of a team to provide management assistance. Only
two firms, both of which operated electrical utilities, submitted proposals,
and the preferred firm dropped out because of difficulty in assembling the
right team at the time required. LEC then negotiated a contract with the



- 4 -
remaining firm for provision of a five man team which started work in July
1978. This team continued working into the fourth power project, as 75% of
the expenditures for this part of the third power project were used for the
unsuccessful cosmopolitan team. Procedures and the draft contract for the
recruitment of the second team were reviewed by the Bank and were in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Part A. of the Project
Investigation of the Hydroelectric Resources of Liberia
3.04     The consultants completed their prefeasibility study of the hydro-
electric development of the St. Paul River with funds provided from the
loan. This study of the St. Paul River, which is the only large river with
hydroelectric potential entirely within the borders of Liberia and within
reasonable distance of load centers when combined with other studies already
completed or in progress met the project requirements for completing the
inventory of Liberia's principal hydro-resources. It recommended a storage
dam on the Via River, a tributary of the St. Paul, to which would be diverted
a major portion of the St. Paul River flow by means of dams and an
interconnecting channel. The other studies referred to are:
(i) Mano River, between Liberia and Sierra Leone. A feasibility study
of the 180 MW Mano-Basin Development Project was completed by
consultants in March 1981. The development would be shared with
Sierra Leone.
(ii) Cavalla River, between Liberia and Ivory Coast. A feasibility
study of the 225 MW Cavalla River hydroelectric scheme was completed
by consultants in 1979. The development would be shared with
Ivory Coast.
(iii) St. John River, a prefeasibility study of the 100 MW St. John's
hydroelectric developmnt is now being prepared by Japanese consultant
under the sponsorship of Japan's International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) and is expected to be completed in 1982. This river rises in
Guinea and runs through Central Liberia to the sea. It is, however,
relatively remote from LEC's present load centers.
Following completion of the prefeasibility study a full feasibilty study of
the 400 MW St. Paul River project was completed in October, 1982.
Establishment of a Long Range Development Plan
3.05     Until such time as all the studies referred to in para. 3.04 above
are completed, it is not possible to prepare a long range development plan for
the Liberian Power Sector. This part of the project was therefore not
completed, though the funds provided in the loan for this work were utilised
in the prefeasibility study of the St. Paul River project, which is a



prerequisite for meeting the objective. The demand study was not carried out,
nor would it be appropriate to do so, until nearer the time when all the
resource data is available for preparation of the long range plan.
Preparation of a Detailed Tnvestment Program
3.06     LEC prepared in November, 1976 a Five-Year Investment Plan based on a
7% annual growth rate. This plan proposed increasing the thermal capacity of
the Monrovia system by about 40 MW. The plan also included reinforcement of
the 69 kV transmission and the 12.5 kV distribution systems and the
construction of 5 new substations. The growth rate on which it is based may
be optimistic but the investment plan itself is soundly concieved and marks a
step forward in LEC's management capability. In fact, LEC's planning
department, which did not exist prior to the date of this loan (1975), is now
probably LEC's most efficient department, and in this respect, the loan can be
said to have achieved, or surpassed, its objective.
3.07     Following the Five-Year Investment Plan, the LEC's consultant
prepared a feasibility study for the extension of the Bushrod plant. This
study recommended the installation of three 13.4 MW slow speed diesel units
two of which were subsequently financed under the Bank's Power IV Project
(Loan 1600-LBR) and the third is being financed by OPEC with their loan No.
205 P.
Part B. of the Project
Provision of Experts to Strengthen Management
3.08     Partly because of their diverse backgrounds and experiences, and also
because the job descriptions and responsibilities for each position were not
clearly defined, the cosmopolitan group of expatriates did not work as a
team. Some expatriates, disappointed by the lack of leadership and their
inability to achieve results, left Monrovia before expiration of their
contracts, and none of their contracts were renewed or extended when they
expired in 1977. No progress report or final report on their work could be
found. Only in the field of planning and transmission and Distribution did
these expatriates have any real success and in the case of planning this was
largely due to the superior calibre of the Liberian counterpart. Up to 1976,
LEC had no planning unit, and all of its programs had been prepared by
financing agencies such as USAID. Today LEC's planning department is well
organized, staffed, and producing good results. In the field of transmission
and distribution some substantial improvements were obtained under the
direction of the team member concerned and a certain amount of training
provided for Liberian Engineers and Technicians. In other areas, the
expatriates were largely ineffective. Most of them were fully competent in
their fields, coming from executive positions in their own country, but they
were used to working with an efficient staff and seemed to be unable to adjust
to the limited training and experience of LEC staff and the difficult working
conditions in Liberia. They tended to concentrate more on formulating



- 6 -
recommendations in their fields of expertise than in training Liberian staff
to implement them. Their recommendations were often uncoordinated, creating
needless confusion.
3.09     The LEC than entered into a two year contract agreement with
Consulting Engineers from India to field a Management Support Team (MST)
starting on July 1, 1978. This five man team comprised a Team Coordinator,
Finance Executive,Manpower Executive, Administrative Executive, and Operations
Executive. The team was supplemented by short visits of other specialists.
The calibre of experts provided varied widely and although good results were
obtained in some technical spheres such as switchgear and protection,
negligible benefits were obtained in others such as manpower training and
finance during the period of the loan. There were, however, secondary
benefits since LEC, profiting from the lessons learnt from failure of the
technical assistance financed by the loan, has continued its employment of the
same consultants but on a more selective basis and with a considerable measure
of success.
3.10     The MST first identified the weaknesses of LEC's management and then
prepared a Management Improvement Program giving first priority to reduction
of system losses and improvement in billing, collection and accounting. A
system of monthly Management Information Reports was instituted. These
covered energy sales, revenue, energy balance, billing control, disconnections
and reconnections, meter installation and particular features of operation and
maintenance. Although well conceived, the Management Improvement Program did
not result in any great improvement, mainly because LEC was unable to hire
sufficient qualified personnel to undertake the required tasks, but also
because some members of the team were unable to follow up their
recommendations by personally getting down to showing the Liberian staff how
to implement them. Nevertheless, their efforts were not entirely wasted and
undoubtedly helped to arrest the general deterioration which had been going on
prior to their arrival.
Training
3.11     Training, which was one of the major objectives of the Third Power
Project, was not implemented successfully. Originally, training focused on
Senior Liberian staff. Since 1978, however, the training program has been
reoriented to include intermediate level staff. Under the terms of their
contract, the MST members were required to train counterparts. It was also
planned to use the proposed Monrovia Vocational Center to train skilled
personnel for LEC. Due to many changes in the country, this center is not
expected to be completed before March 1982. The biggest constraint for the
training program has been lack of qualified personnel to do the training,
mainly because LEC's salary scales do not enable it to attract or retain the
managerial and skilled personnel which it needs. Although LEC staff's
salaries are higher than those of Government employees, they are about 10 to
50% below the remuneration for similar positions in the mining and commercial
sector. This lack of qualified personnel has led to poor training within the
corporation and, as a result, LEC is now granting 26 foreign and 16 local
scholarships to students in electrical, mechanical and civil engineering,



- 7 -
accounting, computing and management. These students are expected to graduate
between 1981 and 1984, and then to serve LEC, but there is neither inducement
nor compulsion for them to do so, and it is expected that many will be lost to
private industry and other corporations on their return. In an attempt to
stem such losses, recent scholarships contain a covenant requiring a student
after graduation to work a specific number of years for LEC.
3.12     Tariff Study and Tariff Revision.  The loan agreement (Section 5.06)
required LEC to undertake a tariff study by June 30, 1976 and to adjust
tariffs by January 1, 1977 to a level which would achieve a rate of return of
10% on net revalued assets in service.  The study was completed, though not
until February 1977, and tariff increases of 14% in March 1978 and 25% in June
1979 were implemented as well as the introduction of a Fuel Adjustment
charge. These increases were however, quite inadequate to achieve a 10% rate
of return on the 1977 revalued assets, which were 2.4 times the previous book
value. In fact, the rate of return varied between plus 1.6% (1979) and minus
3.6% (1978).
3.13     Automony of LEC.  The Guarantee Agreement contained a clause (Sec.
3.02) specifically requiring the government to "ensure" that the LEC
management would be able to fully exercise the executive powers granted to it
under the laws governing LEC's operations. Not only did the government fail
to ensure that management was able to exercise its lawful powers but it
actually prevented management from setting salaries and tariffs at adequate
levels to achieve the purposes of the corporation - and in so doing it also
broke the covenants in the third loan agreements (4.04c in the loan agreement
and 3.02 in the guarantee agreement). In recent times it has gone further and
actually forced LEC to reduce salaries of senior management. Salary and
tariff levels are two of the most important items affecting the efficiency of
an electrical utility over the long term and the Bank's advocacy of autonomy
for utilities is based very largely on its conviction that unless the ulility
has the freedom to set them at appropriate levels it is impossible to achieve
acceptable levels of efficiency.
Project Cost and Disbursement

PART IV   PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS AND JUSTIFICATION
4.01     Those parts of the project in Part A, i.e. those relating to hydro-
logical studies, preparation of the long term development plan and a five-year
investment plan including the next addition to generating capacity, were
either satisfactorily completed (paras. 3.04, 3.06 and 3.07) or put in hand
and are expected to be satisfactorily completed in the near future (para.
3.05). LEC now has an efficient planning unit under the direction of a
competent, qualified engineer. As a result of these studies, the Bushrod
thermal plant extension project was carried out in 1980 financed by the Bank's
Power IV Loan 1600-LBR, and a full feasibility study of the St. Paul River has
been prepared.
4.02     Those parts of the project in Part B, i.e., provision of experts to
strengthen management and train management and operational staff have not been
entirely successful in arresting the deterioration in LEC's management,
finances, and services. This factor cannot be attributed to the change of
government following the coup in 1980 since most of the deterioration occured
before that event. The objectives which the project was expected to achieve
were:
(i) over the short-term -- a halt in the deterioration of LEC's ser-
vices, and the laying of foundations for an improvement in its
operations, in particular, equipment utilization and maintenance,
personnel productivity, customer service, billing and collection;
(ii) over the longer term -- the reestablishment of an efficient power
utility having satisfactory operational and financial controls in
addition to planning which would enable it to offer the most economic
electrical energy to po-tential users in the country.
Quality of Service
4.03     The quality of service has significantly improved during the project
period due mostly to the additional generating capacity at the Bushrod thermal
station commissioned in 1980. During the beginning of the project, 1975-1977,
up to 80 power outages a year occured in each region of the Monrovia system,
of which about 10 power outages caused total black out. These outages were
reduced by about 50, during 1980 and during the first ten months of 1981 there
was only one major power outage causing total black out.
Equipment Utilization and Maintenance
4.04     Some progress has been made with regard to LEC technical operations.
There was some improvement in the field of switching and protection, though
this is still not entirely satisfactory. The maintenance of the Mount Coffee
hydro plant has improved during the project period. Power generation and
supply has become more reliable since 1980 with the completion of two new slow
speed diesels. Most of LEC generating units are now available for maintenance



- 9 -
during a period of up to four or five months a year.    Since 1980, the use of
new slow speed diesels has made a substantial reduction in fuel costs; a
gallon of fuel produced 10.5 kWh in 1980 compared with 7.3 kWh in 1979.
Personnel Productivity
4.05     Personnel productivity does not appear to have improved as
expected. In 1975, it was estimated that one employee served about 16
customers. In June 1981 the number of customers on the meter books was 20,745
and the number of personnel believed to be about 1,300, which means the number
of customers per employee was unchanged at 16. It is however, impossible to
arrive at an accurate figure since the number of consumers recorded on the
meter books is estimated by the expatriate management team provided under the
project to be about 20% below the real number and no accurate figure of the
number of staff employed could be obtained. The accounts records show 1,416
staff on the books but the personnel department and senior management say it
is close to 1,300.
Distribution Efficiency
4.06     Recorded system losses increased from 28% of net generation in 1975
to 31.5% in the FY 1980/81 with a peak of 34.5% in 1979. These losses which
for such a system should not exceed about 13% are due to a number of factors:
(i)   significant thefts of energy;
(ii)  faulty meters;
(iii) failure to read the meters accurately;
(iv)  failure to install meters for every customer;
(v)   inadequate consumer records.
In an attempt to reduce these losses, a Block Mapping Project was undertaken
in 1976 on the recommendation of the Finance Ministry and initially obtained
encouraging results. Block Mapping consists of examining specific areas of
the city one by one and recording every connection, meter and consumer and
then checking the results against the records in the accounts department. In
the beginning, a 15% increase of billings was reported, but the project was
discontinued in 1978 due to lack of support from LEC management. In 1981 the
planning department of LEC prepared a study concerning the "Reduction of
System Losses in Monrovia" containing original ideas and proposals for
stopping thefts and preventing collusion between meter readers and consumers
to defraud the Corporation. The project is estimated to cost about US$ 8.5
million and has been included in an application for a loan from OPEC with the
Bank's recommendation.   The project is expected to reduce losses by 5 to 6%
but could well exceed these figures.



- 10 -
Billing and Collection of Revenue
4.07     Collection efficiency estimated at 90% in 1975 decreased to 69% in
1979 after which it recovered to 84% in 1980/81. The 1979 figure combined
with 21.5% excess losses before billing due to theft etc. means that LEC
collected only about 52% of the revenue due to it from consumers, a loss of
about US$26 million in that year, which would have given LEC a positive rate
of return on its assets if it had been recovered. There are several reasons
for this poor record. For example, the disconnection services are inefficient
and private consumers are known to have their service restored illegally by
local electricians who often are current or former employees of LEC. There is
no provision in the electricity laws for prosecution of illegal consumers or
persons stealing electricity. Moreover, the Government has set a bad example
in the past by not paying its power bills regularly or on time.
PART V - BANK PERFORMANCE
5.01     During the project period, the working relationship between the Bank
and Liberian Government representatives and LEC staff was good. The Bank's
presence almost certainly influenced events to some extent, and if it did
little else, it may have prevented an even more rapid deterioration. For
example, following discussion with the Bank in 1975, the Government reviewed
the institutional relationship between the PUA and its four subsidiary
corporations. Following this review, it abolished the PUA on August 22, 1975,
thereby removing one of the obstacles to the exercise of real autonomy which
experience shows is a prerequisite to the efficient operation of an electrical
utility. Regrettably, however, the Government's Ministers subsequently failed
to permit LEC to exercise the authority to which it is entitled under the law,
about which the Bank was able to do very little (para. 3.13).
5.02     The project success in creating a Planning Unit in LEC, which
prepared the First Five-Year Investment Plan for the power sector, led to a
feasibility study prepared by consultants followed by an extension of the
Bushrod thermal station in 1979/80.
5.03     The investigation of the hydro resources of Liberia was partially
underway before the Bank loan was made (see para. 3.04) and the prefeasiblity
study of the St. Paul River undertaken with the proceeds of the Bank loan
successfully completed an inventory of the major Liberian hydro resources
within easy access to the main load center of Monrovia. It has since led to a
full feasibility study of the next development of hydroelectric resources in
Liberia.
5.04     In achieving the above, the Bank's performance was good but the
Bank was not so successful in the more difficult areas of strengthening
LEC's management and training of LEC staff. One of the probable reasons
for this was inadequate supervision. The average time between consecutive
supervision missions was 12 1/2 months which was not adequate to follow up
the implementation of so difficult a project. Some programs started and



- 11 -
stopped between missions without the possibility of assistance or intervention
from the Bank. For example, the recruitment of a cosmopolitan expatriate
team for management assistance was started without reference to the Bank.
Similarly the Block Mapping exercise was stopped without reference to the
Bank.
5.05     In two other respects the Bank failed in its declared objectives.
The loan agreement required the LEC to implement a new salary structure
adequate to attract qualified personnel, and to raise tariffs so as to achieve
a rate of return on fixed assets of not less than ten percent, but it did
neither of these things (see paras. 3.12 and 3.13).   Both of these issues are
fraught with political overtones and it is doubtful whether any amount of
increased supervision would have altered the outcome. Only the withholding of
substantial and badly needed financial aid until action has already been taken
is likely to influence a government in introducing such long term measures
which could lead to its short term unpopularity.
PART VI - CONCLUSION
6.01     The Third Power Project succeeded in creating an efficient planning
unit in LEC, in completing the investigation of the major hydro resources
within easy access of the main load center of Monrovia, in preparing a
detailed five-year investment plan and in helping to lay the foundation for
the establishment of a long range plan for the power sector. The project was
not successful, in making any substantial contribution to the strengthening of
management or training of LEC's staff.
6.02     One of the main reasons for the failure of the Management and
Training aspects of the project was the method of recruitment and choice of
the original group of expatriate experts. It is probable that the errors and
misjudgements which occured could have been avoided if there had been frequent
and closer supervision by Bank staff in the early stages of the project.
Certainly, twelve months between supervision missions for this type of project
is excessive - even six months may be too long an interval in the initial
stages during recruitment and establishment of the experts. The lack of
supervision in this case was all the more disastrous because of the total lack
of experience of this kind of operation by the management of LEC, who were
themsleves feeling their way in the newly established autonomy of LEC.
6.03     Another major reason for the lack of success in improving management
is the Government's apparent failure to appreciate the relative importance of
an efficiently run electrical utility to the economy of the country. Salaries
of LEC staff are held down by Government to levels below those of some other
less vital corporations and well below those of commercial competitors for
technical and accounting staff in contravention of section 4.04(c) of the loan
agreement, added to which the recent reduction in senior staff salaries has
had a highly demoralising effect on management. This situation is
particularly bad in the accounts department which collects little more than
half the revenue due from consumers. Unless the Government permits LEC to



- 12 -
offer competetive salaries to its staff it would be a waste of the Bank's
resources to give further technical assistance to LEC and the Bank should
consider whether it should lend, or support other lenders, in the sector until
the Government has taken positive steps to improve the efficiency of LEC
Management; or at least until it has provided the framework within which
improvement can take place.
6.04     Some conclusions can be drawn as to the merits of this kind of
technical assistance for training senior management. The failure of the first
team confirms the view that in order to obtain cooperation among the advisers
and avoid conflicting advice, it is advisable to hire a team from one
organization from which they can be replaced if unsuitable, and to which they
can be returned when their particular task is completed. It is also
reasonable to conclude that consulting engineering partnerships are not the
best type of organization for this work.   What is needed are advisers from an
electrical utility who have proved their worth doing the same jobs and facing
the same problems as the people they are advising. If possible a utility from
one of the more advanced LDC's would be the best source since their recent
experiences are closer to those of the countries with which the Bank deals in
West Africa. Finally it can be concluded that the experts should not always be
put in line positions but sometimes put in advisory positions only. If put in
line positions the experts in a chaotic situation may not have time to train
their counterparts and in any case there is no better way of learning how to
do a job than actually trying to do it.

manager of the transmission and distri-
bution department (a member of the
cosmopolitian team) not only was a
substantial improvement made in the
overall transmission and distribution
but a certain amount of training was also
provided for Liberian engineers and
technicians. As a result of the above,
the LEC now operates a more reliable power
system manned by some of the same trained
personnels.
Although the addition of two slow-speed         Report amended.
diesel units contributed immensely to the
system's stability, they by no means were
the major factors in providing better
reliability of power supplies to our
customers. A vigorous maintenance
program of both the distribution and
transmission systems was inititated by
the expatriate transmission and distri-
bution manager and his team of Liberian
technocrats who worked dedicatedly
towards such improvements.

that such information was supplied by
the accounts department. Please note
that at June 1981, the total staff
strength of the LEC (inclusive of the
branch stations) was 1,328 - LEC main
(1,108) and branch stations (220).
We suggest that the figure of 1,108
be reflected since the 1150 LBR focussed
its financing on the Monrovia system only.
We note with some disappointment on the         Wording changed.
presentation of the Corporation's trend
in its collection efficiency. We suggest
that improvements be highlighted where
necessary, rather than reflecting,
indirectly, a negative level of efficiency.
For your information, a better format
would be to reflect the collection
efficiency as follows:

1980 (12 months): 90.2%
1981 (12 months): 101.2%
1980-81 (18 months): 84%
The improvements in the level of efficiency
is mostly due to the efforts being made
by the Government of Liberia in settling
its debt to the LEC, even though with an
unsteady cash outflow.
