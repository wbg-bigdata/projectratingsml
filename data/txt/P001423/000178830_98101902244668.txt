REPORT AND RECO9MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE LIBERIA ELECTRICITY CORPOltATION (LEC) FOR
A THIRD POWER PROJECT WITH GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
1.        I submit the following report and recomnendation on a proposed
loan to the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), with the guarantee of
Liberia, for the equivalent of US$1.8 million to help finance a program
of technical assistance. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
a 5-year grace period, with an interest rate of 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973, and its report
"Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report" (No. 426a-LBR
dated March 1, 1975) has been distributed to the Executive Directors.
Annex I contains basic country data.
3.        During the 1950s and 1960s Liberia experienced an unprecedented
rate of economic expansion averaging close to 7 percent and this rapid expan-
sion has enabled the Government, for the first time in the country's 150-year
history, to undertake significant investments in essential economic and
social infrastructure.
4.        The economic report concludes that the growth since 1950 has been
essentially based on foreign enclaves--iron ore mines, rubber plantations
and forestry concessions; that there is very little linkage between the con-
cessions and the rest of the economy; and that the benefits of growth have
been very unequally distributed. Annual repatriation by foreigners of profits
and savings equals about 20 percent of gross domestic product; about 4 percent
of the Liberians have per capita income levels above US$3,000 while the vast
majority are near subsistence level with incomes below US$100. The Govern-
ment proposes to increase its earnings from the enclave type of industries
and to use these resources to diversify the productive base of the economy
with increased participation of Liberians.
5.        To achieve these objectives, the Government is preparing a national
development plan for the period 1976-1979. In this exercise, it is assisted
by a special planning team financed jointly by the Bank, the UNDP, the USAID
and the Government (President's Memorandum R74-61 of March 25, 1974).
Further improvement of public administration, the availability of foreign
capital and technical assistance will in large part determine the size of
the public sector development program. The Government has initiated a major
effort to improve its administration and increase its capacity to plan and
implement investment programs. The United States, the Federal Republic of
Germany, and the Bank Group have been, and are expected to remain, the prin-
cipal sources of external capital. A gross inflow of assistance of about
US$30 million a year in support of public investment is anticipated. UNDP
and USAID are expected to be the main donors of technical assistance grants.



-2-
Recent Trends (1970-1974)
6.        With the transition from the 28-year rule of President Tubman
to the new administration of President Tolbert in 1971, the Government
initiated a number of necessary fiscal reforms, including tighter expenditure
control and renegotiation of concession agreements. This action has resulted
in a significant improvement of Government's fiscal performance. Yet, the
Liberian economy, particularly in the non-enclave sectors, has been under
severe strain since 1970. This was initially caused by uncertainty in the
private sector following the change in administration, and was accentuated
by the fact that rubber--which, in addition to being an enclave industry, is
also the principal export crop of Liberian farmers--experienced a price
deterioration during 1970-71 and again in 1974.
7.        The economic setback in the non-enclave economy has persisted until
the first months of 1975 because of the continued contraction in real terms
of the public sector and a significant, almost completely imported, inflation.
Three key items illustrate this inflation. First, rice: the domestic retail
price for a 100 lb bag3 in March 1973 was about US$10; at the end of 1974 it
was US$25. Rice is the staple food of Liberians and dominates the cost of
living index. Second, the impact on internal transportation of higher petro-
leum prices; this has produced an increase of about 40 percent in the price
for transporting goods and people. In addition, the cost of power has also
gone up. Third, the price of imported machinery and equipment has doubled in
the past two years.   This, in turn, has seriously affected overall investment
costs, particularly in agriculture and road building.
8.        On the export side, each of the three major exports--rubber, timber
and iron ore--has been affected differently in the past two years. Rubber
prices rose during 1973 and peaked in early 1974, dropping sharply thereafter
as the recession in industrial countries set in. In the timber industry,
demand has continued unabated for choice primary species but has fallen off
significantly for secondary ones. In the iron ore sector, the general shortage
of raw materials experienced in 1974 and the relative accessibility of Liberian
ores have enabled the concessions to negotiate compensation for higher energy
costs and a further increase in the contract prices for 1975 (30 percent
higher for ore, 50 percent for pellets). At the same time, serious interest
is being expressed by foreign groups in the development of three morc iron
ore deposits in Liberia. In the most optimistic scenario, all three will be
in production by the mid-1980s, doubling the national output from the present
annual 24 million metric tons to close to 50 million. Concession agreements
for two of these new iron ore mines are almost completed. While this would
certainly be a welcome development, it should not lead to abandonment of the
development strategy of diversification.    Opening of new iron ore mines will
only delay the inevitable decline of this sector by a decade or so.
9.        Owing to a successful program of fiscal reform implemented by the
Government, the fiscal picture for Liberia looks reasonably good for the



-3-
next five or six years. Manpower, rather than capital or budgetary constraints,
is likely to be the main development bottleneck in the immediate future.
Balance of Payment and Creditworthiness
10.       As Liberia is using US dollars as the medium of exchange, balance
of payments analyses are at best tenuous. In the period 1964-1972, exports
grew at 10 percent and imports by 5.9 percent. Thereafter, from 1972-1974,
following international inflation, imports rose by 29 percent annually
exceeding the export growth of 22 percent a year. Oil imports increased from
US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974. Nevertheless, Liberia achieved
a trade surplus of US$96 million in 1974 which was more than sufficient to
offset a deficit on current invisibles.
11.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed in December 1974 was
estimated at US$155 million. The debt service ratio was 5.3 percent in 1974,
as compared to 7.1 percent in 1972. The ratio is projected to fall further
in the next few years as the final portions of the heavy debt incurred in the
early 1960s are paid off. The Government has contracted little new debt in
recent years and most of it at concessionary terms. The proportion of out-
standing debt owed to the Bank/IDA is currently about 15 percent. Even with
an expanded public borrowing program and assuming adverse external conditions,
Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1980s is estimated to remain below
5 percent of exports. The country should therefore be regarded as creditworthy
for some additional Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
12.       The Bank has made 7 loans for projects in Liberia totalling US$31
million, and there have been 3 IDA credits totalling US$11 million, as well
as one technical assistance grant of US$200,000 for development planning
(paragraph 5). IFC has made one equity investment in Liberia: US$250,000
in the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI).
The Bank loans have been for roads, port expansion, power and a development
finance company. IDA credits have been for education and agriculture.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as at May 31, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       The objectives of Bank Group operations in Liberia are:     (a) to
increase the absorptive capacity of the economy and enable the Liberians to
take greater initiative in developing their own resources for the benefit of
their own people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to a broader
sharing of the fruits of economic progress; in the Liberian context this
implies carrying the development process to the 70 percent of the population
in subsistence agriculture largely by-passed by the recent economic gains;
(c) to help the Government in broadening the economic base; and (d) to assist
the Government in mobilizing development resources for sound projects from
other external agencies.
14.       A road project and an integrated agricultural development project
for Upper Lofa County have been appraised and are expected to be submitted
to the Executive Directors in the next few months. The agricultural project



- 4 -
will be co-financed with USAID. In addition, a second education project, a
rubber rehabilitation project benefiting small indigenous plantations and a
second integrated rural development project are in preparation. Bank Group
assistance will essentially improve the productivity of small farmers, improve
road transportation, including farm to market roads, and assist Liberia
restructure its power sectorc.
PART III   - THE POWER SECTOR
15.       In 1973, total electricity generating capacity installed in Liberia
amounted to about 300 MW and generation reached some 800 GWh. Captive plant,
mainly large diesel units installed in mining complexes, supplies about 60
percent of the power consumed. Liberia Electricity Corporation's (LEC)
facilities supply the remaining 40 percent, which represents the public power
supply.
16.       LEC owns and operates the Monrovia interconnected system which
serves an area of about 70 by 125 miles around the capital (see attached map).
In the northwest, this system extends to Bomi Hills, thereby interconnecting
with two of the four large mining complexes. LEC's installed system capacity
of about 150 M1W consists of the 70 MW Mt. Coffee hydro plant on the St. Paul
river and of 80 MW of thermal plants, 70 MW of which are gas turbine and
10 MW diesel. In addition, LEC operates on behalf of the Government 10 MWt Crf
small diesel units in seven secondary centers in rural areas.
17.       The Bank has made two loans (684-LBR of IJS$7.4 millior; I-. Jure 1970
and 778-LBR of US$4.7 million in July 1971) to the Liberian public power
sector to help finance a 34 MW expansion of the Mt. Coffee hydroelectric
plant, two 19 MW gas turbines for the Monrovia system, and associated trans-
mission and distribution facilities. To cover project cost increases because
of currency fluctuations and an increase in the size of the gas turbines
chosen for installation, the Bank made a supplemental loan of US$2.9 million
in 1973 which brought total Bank financing in the sector to US$15 million.
The projects have been satisfactorily executed and are completed except for
the distribution component of the last project which is expected to be opera-
tional by the end of 1975. Recently, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau
(Germany) provided a DM 10 million (about US$4 million) credit to finance
further extensions to the Monrovia transmission and distribution system.
Organization and Management
18.       In 1962, the Government created the Public Utilities Authority (PUA),
the Borrower of the two above-mentioned Bank loans, as an autonomous govern-
ment agency responsible for public power supply and water supply and sewerage.
In 1973, legislation was passed which: (i) increased PUA's responsibility to
include radio, TV and telecommunications, and (ii) transformed PUA into a
holding company with four subsidiaries: the Liberia Electricity Corporation;
the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation; the Liberia Broadcasting Corporation;
and the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation.
19.       According to its statutes, LEC is a largely autonomous government
enterprise with the right to borrow money and set electricity
rates. It has its own Board of Directors consisting of nine members: the
Chairman of PUA, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Justice, the Minister
of Planning and Economic Affairs, and five representatives of the private
sector appointed by the President. The President also appoints the Chairman



-5-
20.       In establishing PUA as a holding corporation, the Government's
intention was to make PUA essentially responsible for policy-making, leaving
the executing functions to the four subsidiaries. However, since the passage
of the new legislation, PUA's Directors have also been serving on LEC's Board,
and until the fall of 1974 PUA's Chairman kept LEC's day-to-day operations
closely under his control. Consequently, the separation of PUA and LEC has
been more de jure than de facto. During negotiations of the proposed loan,
the Government gave assurances that LEC's management will in future fully
exercise its operational authorities and responsibilities as prescribed by
LEC's statutes.
21.       LEC has a staff of about 800, i.e., 1 employee per 16 consumers,
which is very high. LEC is, however, short of qualified and experienced
Liberian personnel, and has to rely heavily on expatriate assistance for
management and for project preparation and implementation. At present, LEC
has three experts from a US consulting firm--Sanderson and Porter (S&P)--
engaged as senior executives and seven directly employed expatriates in
medium-echelon positions.
22.       In connection with the last Bank loan, the Borrower was expected
to assign counterparts to the S&P experts with the objective of the counter-
parts gradually taking over the executive functions from the experts, who
would then have assumed advisory roles. Unfortunately, little progress was
achieved towards this objective, mainly because LEC could not locate suitable
counterparts. As a result, LEC's Liberian staff is little, if any, better
able to assume senior management positions now than it was in 1971 when the
second Bank loan was made. Indeed, the situation has worsened, since in the
face of uncompetitive salaries and a deteriorating work environment several
qualified senior Liberians have left LEC.
23.       Because of its thin Liberian management and the gradual reduction of
expatriates, LEC's operations have deteriorated in recent years. The Govern-
ment is aware of these deficiencies and, in late 1974, it relieved PUA's
Chairman of his functions and appointed a task force headed by the Minister of
Finance to recommend remedial measures. These urgently needed measures will
require the extensive use of expanded expatriate assistance. However, in
the long run the success of LEC will depend on its ability to recruit, train
and retain qualified Liberians eventually to fill its key management positions.
It is estimated that LEC will be able to recruit the qualified Liberian staff
it needs provided its salary structure and other conditions of work are improved
(paragraph 36). The technical assistance project proposed in this report will
help LEC to obtain internationally-recruited staff to improve its operations.
by strengthening its management and to train Liberians to fill key management
positions.
Power Market
24.       Although in the 1960s the power load in the Monrovia system grew
at very high annual rates of 15 to 25 percent, in the last four years
the load growth has dropped considerably to an average of about 7 percent a
year and in 1974, partly due to the sharp tariff increases, reached a low 3
percent. The annual growth rate is expected to increase progressively again
to about 7 percent on average over the rest of the decade.



- 6 -
25.       LEC faces a difficult problem regarding future expansion of genera-
ting capacity. The Mt. Coffee hydro plant is a run-of-the-river plant.
Therefore, in the dry season demand has to be met mainly from thermal genera-
tion in the gas turbines, and since such units have poor fuel efficiency,
with the recent drastic fuel cost increases, the energy they generate has
become very expensive. These factors contribute to increase the cost of LEC
power to such levels that at present it is more economical for the mining
complexes to meet their additional power needs by installing their own diesel
plants.
26.        In future, a larger portion of the iron ore mined in Liberia will
be pelletized; this will require substantial quantities of power.     In addition,
exploitation of the Wologisi, Bie Mountain and Putu iron ore deposits is
planned to start in the early 1980s, each of which would also require much
power. Thus, there is a substantial potential market for LEC, provided it
can supply energy at competitive prices. However, this would be possible only
if LEC can produce large blocks of power from hydro power plants, which would
make LEC power cheaper than diesel generation at the mining sites. Investiga-
tions of hydro resources are therefore urgently needed, and would be carried
out under the proposed project.
Finances
27.       The increased use of thermal generation necessitated by recent
droughts and sharp increases in fuel prices have increased LEC's fuel expenses
five-fold over the last two years. Fuel costs presently amount to almost
one-half of total operating costs. In 1974, LEC increased its tariffs, twice
(a total increase of 40-60 percent, depending on consumer category) to offset
the effects of the increased fuel expenses, but its financial position remains
weak. In particular, LEC has a serious liquidity problem which is causing
it to be several months in arrears in paying the local refinery for the fuel
consumed. Its rate of return on net fixed assets in service was 5 percent in
1974 and is estimated at 7 percent for 1975, i.e., substantially below the
10 percent target established under previous Bank loans. Action is therefore
needed to resolve LEC's financial problems.
28.       A two-step approach is planned to improve LEC's current position
and earnings. First, the Government agreed during negotiations to make an
equity contribution of US$2.0 million by the end of 1975 and to assist LEC
in securing an additional US$1.5 million by June 30, 1976. An increase of
US$3.5 million in LEC's capital will enable LEC to settle its accumulated
debt and establish a satisfactory current position. Second, LEC agreed to
carry out a tariff study before June 30, 1976, and to take all necessary
action to achieve a rate of return of 10 percent in 1977 and thereafter. There
is scope for substantial improvement in the structure of LEC's tariffs and the
tariff study is likely to result in the introduction of seasonal tariffs and
appropriate fuel adjustment charges. The overall tariff increase for the
small consumers would, however, be marginal. These measures would restore
LEC's financial position and enable LEC to finance a reasonable portion of
future investments from internal sources.



- 7 -
29.       Standard financial covenants agreed in connection with
Loans 684/778-LBR, in particular those limiting dividend payments and incur-
rence of debt, and prescribing adequate insurance and the continuation of
present audit arrangements, would remain in effect.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       A loan and project summary is included in Annex III and additional
information concerning the project is given in Annex IV. The project was
appraised in October 1974 and negotiations took place in Washington on May 21-23,
1975, with a Liberian delegation led by the Honorable E. Williams, Minister of
Finance.
Project History
31.       The Bank has been assisting Liberia in the development of the public
power sector since 1970, a period in which the sector's installed generating
capacity has more than doubled. In 1974, LEC requested a third Bank loan for
financing a thermal generating facility recommended by its consultants (Oskar
von Miller, Germany). This facility was planned to provide LEC's system with
sufficient capacity to meet demand until the early 1980s. While in the field
to appraise this project, the Bank mission concluded that because of reduced
load growth (paragraph 24) the starting of the installation of a further thermal
generating facility could be postponed by about two years. It concluded addi-
tionally, however, that LEC urgently needed technical assistance to improve its
management. The Government accepted both of these conclusions, and the Bank
and the Government have contacted a number of potential bilateral and
multilateral sources for financing the technical assistance project.
The UNDP responded that their allocation for Liberia was fully committed;
and none of the other sources was in a position to provide the funds
required. As a consequence, the project is now proposed for financing
by the Bank.
Project Description
32.       The proposed project would strengthen the management of Liberia
,Electricity Corporation and help it to improve its services to its customers,
earn a satisfactory return on its investments, assess demand for power over
the medium and long-term, prepare a suitable investment plan and improve
its capacity to implement the plan efficiently and effectively.
33.       The project would consist of:
(i) provision of about 18 man-years of planning experts to
establish a long-range development plan for LEC involving,
inter alia, a demand study, investigation of Liberia's
hydro resources, and preparation of a detailed investment
program covering the next addition to LEC's generating
capacity; and



-8 -
(ii) provision of about 25 man-years of internationally-recruited
experts  :for strengthening LEC's management and for training
LEC's staff.
The project would be carried out over a three-year period and be completed by
December 31, 1978.
Project Costs
34.       The total expected cost of the project, excluding taxes, is estimated
at US$2.6 million of which the Bank would finance the off-shore component of
US$1.8 million (69 percent of total cost) and LEC the remaining US$0.8 million.

Project Details
35.       In view of the present fuel prices, LEC's previous development plan
(paragraph 31) calling for additional units at the Mt. Coffee hydro plant
supplemented by gas turbines is no longer feasible. As a first step towards
preparing a new long-range development plan, LEC will therefore employ engi-
neering consultants to investigate Liberia's hydro resources, on which present
information is very limited. The studies would be coordinated with those to
be undertaken on the border rivers with Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone; assist-
ance for the study of the Cavalla River forming the border with Ivory Coast
has been requested from the African Development Bank, while assistance for
the study of the Mano River on the border with Sierra Leone has been requested
from UNDP. These international projects would, however, only materialize in
the long-term, and the LEC investment program to be prepared by LEC's planning
personnel in cooperation with outside consultants would include a generating
facility that could be commissioned in the early 1980s.
36.       The Government, unable to locate a power utility to provide
management assistance to LEC, appointed an individual consultant to
assess LEC's manpower needs and to assist in internationalrecruitment
for key positions. Based upon the consultant's recommendations, LEC
and the Bank agreed during negotiations that about 10 of the 18
man-years of planning experts and all of the 25 man-years of management
and training experts to be financed under the project would be employed
to serve on LEC's staff (the balance of 8 man-years would involve
consulting services for planning). The positions to be filled
initially would include General Manager (to advise the Chief Executive),
Controller, Managers for Generation and Distribution, Manager for Long-
Range Planning (inter alia to supervise the Engineering Consultants)
and Manager for Training. It is anticipated that the most of



-9-
these posts will be filled before the S&P contract expires in November 1975.
Furthermore, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from LEC that
it would draw up, discuss with the 13ank before June 30, 1976, and then imple-
ment: (i) a new organizational set-ulp with job descriptions for all senior
positions; (ii) a manpower plan indicating recruitment needs; (iii) a new
salary structure that would be adequate to attract qualified Liberians to
seek permanent employment with LEC; and (iv) a work program,with performance
targets, to improve the operations of LEC (Section 4.04 of Loan AgreemenL).
LEC has already launched a recruitment program to employ qualified
Liberians who will work with the expatriate staff.
37.       Liberia has limited vocational training facilities, and LEC has no
training program of its own. LEC would, therefore, in addition to on-the-job
training for senior staff,-start an in-house training program for its inter-
mediate and lower echelon staff. It would be possible to coordinate such a
program with that of a vocational training center in Monrovia for which
Government is seeking financial assistance under a proposed second education
project (paragraph 14), and which is expected to be operational by 1978.
During negotiations, LEC agreed to prepare a detailed training program in
consultation with the Bank and to start its implementation before June 30,
1976 (Section 3.02 of Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       Consultant services required under the project would be procured
according to the Bank's guidelines for the selection of consultants. The
selection and appointment of technical assistance personnel would be subject
to agreement by the Bank. Disbursement for consultant services would be
made to cover the off-shore costs of these services. Sixty percent of LEC's
expenditures for gross salaries and benefits of expatriate management, planning
and training personnel would also be reimbursed from the loan.
Justification
39.       The planning personnel and the consultants would prepare an urgently
needed power development plan which would identify the least-cost solution
for meeting Liberia's future power requirement. The development plan would
cover the whole country and address itself to the problems of meeting the
power requirements of isolated mining areas. This is likely to lead to an
integrated development of the power sector with substantial benefits to
Liberia, in the long run, in the form of reduced imports of fuel.    These studies
would also provide basic data for government decisions concerning cooperation
with neighboring countries in the power field. Since part of the planning
would be carried out by experts employed directly by LEC, a permanent planning
unit would be established within LEC, and LEC's own staff would increase its
planning skills to reduce reliance on outside consultants in the future.
40.       With the management assistance program and the associated training
efforts, the objectives expected to be achieved are:



- 10 -
(i)  over the short-term -- a halt in the deterioration of
LEC's services, and the laying of foundations for an
improvement in its operations, in particular, equipment
utilization and maintenance, personnel productivity,
customer service, billing, and collection;
(ii)  over the longer-term -- the reestablishment of an efficient
power utility having satisfactory operational and financial
controls in addition to planning whichi would enable it to
offer the most economic electric energy to potential users
in the country.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Liberia Electricity
Corporation, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Liberia and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
42.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 20, 28, 29, 36 and 37 of this report.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 617-LIB                    Port Development Project; US$3.6 million
Loan of June 20, 1 969; Closing Date:
May 31, 1975.
This port project involved dredging the approaches and an area within
the Monrovia port to accommodate bulk ore carriers and tankers; provision of two
tugs and a pilot launch, as well as additional buoying and lighting of the
navigable channels; consultants' services for individual advisers and feasibility
studies for the development of roads approaches to the port. Project execution
has been satisfactory. The Bank has agreed to the Government's request that
funds still undisbursed be used to help finance an overall study of port develop-
ment needs in Liberia, which was stipulated in the project. Government signed
a contract in May 1974 for the port development study.
Loan No. 684-LIB                    Power projects; US$7.7 million Loan of
June 4, 1970 (fully disbursed  and US 7.6
Loan No. 778-LIB                    million Loan of October 26, 1973; Closing
dates June 30, 1975.
The loans to the Public Utilities Authority (PJA) have helped finance
the expansion of the Mount Coffee hyddroelectric plant, the installation of two
gas turbines at the Bushrod (Monrovia) plant; procurement and erection of 42
miles of overhead lines in Monrovia and 54 miles in outlying areas; establishment
of a new substation and related facilities. There have been cost overruns mainly
due to intemational currency fluctuations and the purchase of larger generators
than originally anticipated. A supplemental loan of US$ 2.9 million was provided
in October, 1973 to cover the cost overruns, and project implementation is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily.
Credit No. 305-LIB                  Education project; US$7.2 million Credit
of May 17, 1972; Closing date: March 1, 1978
The education credit is helping to finance construction of, and provide
equipment for, two new multilateral high schools in the north and the east, each
offering a wide curriculum in agriculture, mechanics and academic subjects; con-
struction of and equipment for a new college of agriculture and an adjacent

demonstration school, technical assistance and fellowships for manpower and
education planning, technical teacher training, secondary education and project
implementation. Some delay was encountered last year in obtaining requisite
expatriate staff for the project unit and the original effectiveness date had
to be postponed. This problem has been overcme and project implementation is
proceeding satisfactorily.
Credit No. 306-LIB                  Agriculture project; US$1.2 million Credit
of May 17, 1972; Closing date: December 31,
1976.
The agriculture credit includes feasibility studies and preparation of
detailed investment proposals for integrated rural development project; a
physical survey and detailed stucly of the Liberian-owned rubber industry; a
pilot rubber scheme to provide Liberian rubber farmers with credits to rehabi-
litate untapped or poorly tapped rubber; improving rice research; reorganization
of the Ministry of Agriculture and training for Liberians to prepare investment
projects. Effectiveness of this credit had to be postponed because of difficul-
ties in obtaining necessary staff for the project unit. A project alministrator
was designated in January, 1973 but left after a month because of irreconcilable
differences with the Ministry of Agriculture. A replacement served from a year
and a half but recently was forced to resign because of illness. The Government
has decided to carry on the project using staff from the ministry to oversee
project operations.
Loan No. 839-LIB                    Development Finance Company; US$1 million
Loan of June 26, 1972; Closing date:
Loan No. 1055-LIB                   December 31, 1976 and US$4 million Loan of
December 3, 1974; Closing date: June 30, 1979.
The first loan contributed to foreign exchange costs of industrial
projects financed by LBDI in 1972 and 1973. This loan is fully committed. The
second loan would help LBDI meet its financial requirements through calender year
1976.
Credit No. 907-LIB                  Highway Project; US$3.0 million Loan of
June 13, 1973; Closing date: December 31,1977;
Loan No. 395-LIB                    and US$2.6 million Credit of June 13, 1973;
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
Implementation of the maintenance program, which started about six
months behind schedule, is progressing slowly. Further delays were caused by a
US$4.0 million cost overrun on the US-financed maintenance equipment, and a delay
in its delivery. USAID has agreed to provide supplementary financing. Contracts
for all engineering studies have been signed, and work progress is satisfactory.
The construction contract for the Monrovia Bypass has been awarded and work has
begun.

Finances
Summary
1.        Owing to the combined effect of the recent droughts, which have
reduced hydro-power generation, and sharply increased fuel prices, LEC has
been unable to achieve the 10 percent rate of return covenanted under the
Bank loans. Furthermore, following its poor operating results and its
failure to collect consumers' accounts, LEC now finds itself in poor liquid
position, in spite of two tariff increasesin 1974. In order to assist LEC,
the Government as a first step made a contribution of US$1.5 million to
LEC in November 1974; however, further financial assistance from the
Government is required. During negotiations, the GovErnment agreed (i) to
make a further equity contribution of US$2.0 million to LEC by the end of
1975, and (ii) to provide LEC, or assist LEC in obtaining, an additional
US$1.5 million by June 30, 1976. LEC undertook to carry out a tariff study
before June 30, 1976 and take whatever steps are necessary to assure a 10
percent rate of return on net fixed assets in operation in 1977 and thereafter.
Operating Results
2.         LEC's operating results for the past three years are shown below:

Financial Position
3.        LEC's estimated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 1974, given below,
indicates both a weak current position and a high debt/equity ratio:

54.9             100
4.        Due to its weak cash position, LEC is unable to meet its payment
obligations in respect of the settlement of its fuel bills, most of which
become due during the first half of the year. To establish an acceptable
financial position, it is estimated that LEC would require an additional
US$3.5 million in working capital. Since the Government and LEC do not con-
sider it feasible to raise tariffs immediately to the extent required to
meet this shortage, the Government agreed during negotiations to further
raise its equity capital in LEC by US$2.0 million before the end of 1975 and
to provide LEC, or assist LEC in obtaining, an additional amount of US$1.5
million before June 30, 1976. An increase of US$3.5 million in LEC's work-
ing capital will enable LEC to pay-off all its accumulated short-term debts
and improve its current ratio from 1.7 to 3.7.
5.        Even at projected efficiency improvements resulting from the manage-
ment assistance, LEC's earnings might not be sufficient to meet the 10 percent
rate of return covenant governing the Bank loans. During negotiations, LEC
therefore agreed to carry out a tariff study before June 30, 1976 and to take
all necessary action to achieve a rate of return of not less than 10 percent
in 1977 and thereafter; it is estimated that a tariff increase of about 15
percent would be necessary.



ANNEX IV

Collections
6.         Billings and collections have been the source of concern in the
past. In this respect, LEC has been writing-off about US$1 million per
annum as bad debts, corresponding to a very high 8 percent of its total
billings, In addition, unrecorded consumption is believed to be substantial.
The Bank has discussed with LEC various means of improving the situation.
However, LEC's progress in this field has been poor and, particularly with
the new substantially higher tariffs, greater improvements are urgently needed.
The task force investigating LEC's operations has identified a number of
deficiencies in billing and collection procedures and has recommended a series
of measures to improve the situation, the most important of which are:
(i) the temporary assignment of an outside expert to assist LEC's own staff,
and (ii) the recent additional budget appropriations made to government
agencies to enable them to pay their utility bills.     Once appointed, the
management assistance personnel would place priority on and continue these
efforts.
Financial Outlook
7.        Generation for meeting regular consumption is expected to grow
at an average of about 7 percent per year. Sales growth, however, would be
slightly higher by the reduction of present high losses and unrecorded con-
sumption; sales, as a percentage of generation, would increase from 68 per-
cent in 1974 to 73 percent in 1980. In addition, LEC sells substantial
amounts of cheap power to one of the mines whenever LEG has spare hydro
capacity. It is estimated, however, that by 1980, LEC will no longer have
any spare hydro capacity available for the mines.
8.        LEC's net income is forecast to be satisfactory and would increase
until 1978, after which it would decline slightly. Hiowever, since no major
addition would be made to the rate base, the rate of return would meet the
10 percent covenant until 1981. LEC would have no difficulty in financing
the local costs of its ongoing projects and would in addition substantially
improve its cash position. However, since additional cash would be needed
for financing future investments, it is recommended that the dividend limit-
ation covenant be repeated during the disbursement period of the proposed
loan. LEC's borrowing capacity is restricted by the debt limitation covenant
from the previous loans; this covenant required LEC to seek Bank approval
before incurring additional debt unless the maximum future debt service in
any succeeding year is covered at least 1.5 times by its internal cash
generation at the time of incurrence of the new debt.
