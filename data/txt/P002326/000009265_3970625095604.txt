ENERGY SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A.   ENERGY SECTOR
1.   Energy Resources and Consumption
1.01      Senegal's energy economy is based on fuelwood and imported
oil. In 1984, the primary energy supply was about 2 million tons of oil
equivalent (t.o.e.) of which 60% came from wood, and 40% from imported
oil. Natural forest could supply fuelvood equivalent to about 2 million
t.o.e. annually, but 90% of this potential is in eastern Senegal and
Casamance, far from the urban consuming centers of western Senegal.
Consequently, fuelwood resources closer to the urban centers are being
rapidly depleted. In 1984, imports of crude oil and petroleum products
for domestic consumption, amounted to about 720,000 tons, accounting for
18% of the country's imports and costing the equivalent of 32% of export
earnings. In 1972, those percentages were 3% and 4%, respectively.
Senegal's other indigenous resources comprise a share of the untapped
hydro potential of the Senegal and Gambia rivers (combined total
estimated at 1,400 MW and 7,500 GWh); some petroleum resources whose
exploration is being promoted under an IDA-assisted project li; a small
natural gas deposit; and about 4 million tons of peat (1.6 million
t.o.e.). There is potential for wind and solar energy, whose commercial
prospects have not yet been established.
1.02      Senegal's annual per capita consumption of final energy (about
0.25 t.o.e.) is similar to that of other sub-Saharan African countries.
Fuelwood and charcoal are the principal sources of energy for househol.l
cooking, although small amounts of LPG are used in urban areas.
Petroleum products are used principally for electricity generation
(35%), for industry (25%), and for transport (20%). The household
sector consumes about 75% of final energy and industry/transport about
20%. The most recent (1982) energy balance for Senegal is as follows:

2.   Energy Sector Organization
1.03      The Ministry of Industrial Development and Crafts ("Minist&re
du Developpement Industriel et de l'Artisanat" - MDIA) has the main
responsibility for the energy sector. It controls the power sector
through its Department of Energy (DE) and the petroleum sector through
its Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) and is also responsible for
energy conservation and the development of new/renewable energy
resources. The Ministry of Hydraulics ("Ministare de l'Hydraulique" -
MH) is responsible for the development of water resources, including
hydro power. At present, coordination between the two Ministries is
adequate. A National Energy Committee, chaired by the Minister, MDIA,
reviews energy policy options and makes recommendations to the National
Energy Commission, which is chaired by the Head of State and is
responsible for policy decisions. The Department of Energy, MDIA, acts
as a technical secretariat to the Energy Committee. Both DE and DMG
suffer from a lack of qualified and experienced personnel, particularly
in the areas of economics, finance and specialized fields such as wood
and household fuel. Advisors to improve coordin'tion in MDIA on energy



policy were appointed under an ongoing power project. 2/ These efforts
are continuing with the recent secondment from the Bank Group of an
Energy Advisor to the Minister, MDIA.
1.04      A state controlled company, Petrosen, is responsible for
petroleum exploration and production activities and is embarking with
Bank assistance (Credit 1323-SE) on a major promotion effort to induce
foreign oil companies to explore the Senegalese basin. A private
company, `Societe Africaine de Raffinage" (SAR), in which GOS holds a
10% interest and foreign oil companies 90%, owns and operates a refinery
near Dakar with a capacity of 1.2 million tons/year. Because of its
financial problems, SAR has in recent years increasingly imported
refined products which now account for 65% of the total petroleum
consumption. Responsibility for the distribution of the petroleum
products rests with subsidiaries of foreign oil companies.
3.   Energy Policy and Pricing
1.05      In response to the second oil shock, the Government of Senegal
(GOS) formulated an ambitious energy policy known as RENES 3/ aimed at
reducing the internal consumption of oil products by 50X over the period
1981-1990.  The Government's strategy is to substitute indigenous energy
such as hydro, or less costly imported fuel such as coal, for imported
petroleum and to restrain energy consumption by increasing the
efficiency of utilization through energy conservation and an appropriate
pricing policy. So far, efforts to develop indigenous resources have
not been successful and the consumption of petroleum products has
increased from 600,000 to 720,000 tons since 1981. The translation of
policy into specific operational programs and projects will require the
resolution of some important issues related to the development of hydro
resources within the regional context, and in the allocation of
resources to the power sector (Section B.3).
1.06      A 1982 study by CIDA-financed consultants (Gaucher Pringle,
Canada) identified substantial potential for savings through energy
conservation in the industrial sector. An Office of Energy Conservation
has been established within MDIA (DE), with the assistance of two
Italian-financed experts. The approach to energy conservation has been
defined under the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) 4/
and would consist of energy audits of major industrial users as well as
institutional changes. UNDP is financing the first of three years'

activity under this program, CIDA (Canada) is considering financing part
of the energy audits and the proposed project includes financing for the
second and third years' activities.
1.07      As a follow-up to the Senegal Consultative Group meeting in
December 1984, GOS requested IDA to take the lead in organizing a
donors' meeting for the energy sector. For this meeting, GOS prepared,
with assistance under ESMAP, an analysis of sector problems and a
minimum-needs sector investment program for the period 1986-90. The
principal purpose of the donor's meeting, held in Paris on July 11-12,
1985, was to review sector development policies and investments and to
seek the commitment of the donor community to finance the investment
program.   During negotiations agreement was reached that GOS would
consult with IDA, prior to undertaking any investment in the energy
sector exceeding US$3 million equivalent.
1.08      Energy pricing distortions in Senegal were highlighted in the
Energy Assessment Report of 1983 5/, and were a principal topic
addressed by GOS in its Declaration on Energy Policy presented at the
July 1985 donors' meeting. Fuelwood and charcoal prices do not reflect
the cost of reforestation.  In the Dakar area, there is a need to fin;
substitutes for household fuel in order to reduce the current strong
demand for fuelwood from local forests and a study of this problem is
included in the proposed project. Although overall petroleum product
prices exceed the CIF level, the retail prices of products for
electricity generation, fishing and household use are subsidized, while
others including gasoline is highly taxed. Electricity tariffs in
recent years have been inadequate in relation to economic and financial
requirements. At the July 1985 donors' meeting, GOS announced that it
would elliminate in stages all cross-subsidies on petroleum products.
Petroleum product price increases ranging from 4% for a particular grade
of gas oil to 60% for LPG cylinders were introduced effective July 1,
1985, and are expected to yield an additional one billion CFAF
(US$2 million equivalent) in revenues. At the same time, GOS announced
a 1OX increase in average electricity tariffs as of September 1985 to be
followed by two further increases in March 1986 and March 1987.
However, in view of the reduction of fuel prices for SENELEC to be
applied on July L, 1986, the tariff increase of September 1985 will be
rolled back and the two further increases are made unnecessary. A
nearly ten-fold increase in the forestry tax to 20 CFAF/kg of charcoal
was also announced, to take effect from January 1987. This increase is
a step towards the elimination of distortions in fuelwood pricing.
1.09      The elimination of distortion in petroleum products pricing
requires a review of the refining and distribution activities as well as
the functioning of the National Energy Fund (NEF). Retail petroleum

product prices in Senegal are fixed by GOS so as to cover the
ex-refinery price. Value Added Tax, distributors' and retailers'
margins, and an element of a cross-subsidization as indicated at
para. 1.08. As the ex-refinery price is not regularly adjusted to
reflect fluctuations in the dollar price of crude and refined products,
SAR's profits in excess of a guaranteed return are paid into a National
Energy Fund (NEF) and, on the other hand, SAR's losses up to the
guaranteed return are made good from the NEF. The policy of
cross-subsidization is administered by the distributors' organization
(GPP) and the surplus is put into NEF. However, until mid-1985, SAR
operated at a loss and NEF's resources were insufficient to meet SAR's
accumulated deficit amounting to CFAF 11 billion. The position has
changed dramatically in recent months with the declining cost of oil in
the world market and the drop of the dollar rate of exchange. SAR's
profits soared because GOS did not pass on the benefit of cheaper oil to
the domestic market. By end of 1985 NEF had accumulated more than
sufficient funds to pay off SAR's deficit. While these circumstances
pra-ail, NEF will continue to accumulate substantial funds.
Consequently, during negotiations, agreement was reached that GOS would
Implement the principles of its July 1985 Declaration on Energy Policy
and, in particular (a) would furnish to IDA before July 1, 1986, an
action plan for the elimination of price distortions among various
petroleum products; and (b) would establish a formula for the regular
adjustment of consumer prices of petroleum products taking into account
price fluctuations on the world market and fluctuations in exchange
rates and regularly consult IDA on the application of this formula. To
this end, and to help GOS address this petroleum pricing issue, the
proposed project includes (a) a study of petroleum supply refining and
distribution of petroleum products in Senegal; and (b) a study to
recommend improvements in the functioning of the NEF. Finally, during
negotiations, GOS agreed to allocate CFAF 6.9 billion from NEF funds to
finance the immediate working capital requirements of the power utility:
SENELEC, in a form of a loan over 10 years including 4 years grace and
6% interest. The actual availability of this loan is a condition of
Credit effectiveness. In the meantime, a first tranche of
CFAF 5.8 billion has already been disbursed to SENELEC, with which
SENELEC settled a major part of its arrears to its fuel supplier.
B.   POWER SECTOR
1.   Existing Electricity Supply Facilities
1.10      The "Societe Nationale d'Electricite' (SENELEC), under the
supervision of MDIA, is responsible for electricity generation,
transmission and distribution throughout the country. The existing
electricity supply system in Senegal is shown on Map 19100. SENELEC
operates an interconnected power system with a capacity of about 200 MW,
and 22 secondary centers totalling less than 10 MW (in 80 diesel units).
Detailed characteristics of existing facilities are set out in
Annex 1-1.



- 6 -
1.11      The main generating facilities are a 60 MW steam plant at
Bel Air in the port of Dakar, and a 124 MW plant at Cap des Biches
comprising three fuel oil-fired steam units and two diesel oil-fired gas
turbines. The Bel Air plant is obsolete and inefficient (its net
specific fuel consumption is over 400 g/kWh) and it should be replaced
as soon as possible. Poor operation and maintenance practices at the
Cap des Biches plant caused serious outages in 1984. Emergency repairs
to the boilers are underway, with financing from BOAD and CCCE.
However, a major rehabilitation of the plant is required, the extent of
which was recently defined by Electricite de France (EdF), and would be
undertaken under the proposed project. As a result of these outages,
SENELEC was compelled to install 20 MW of gas turbine plant in October
1984 to reduce load shedding and restore adequate supply, albeit at very
high operating cost. Over 50% of the diesel units in the secondary
centers are in a bad state of repair. The Bel Air and Cap des Biches
generating stations supply a 90 kV interconnected network mainly serving
the area of Dakar-Thies-Talba. In 1984, the energy supplied to the
system was 756 GWh, with a peak load of 123 MW. Although connected to
the main system by 30 kV transmission lines, Saint-Louis in northern
Senegal and Kaolack in the southeast are supplied by small 8 MW diesel
generating units. The sugar and phosphate industries have about 15 MW
installed capacity and other autoproducers account for another 10 MW.
1.12      The existing transmission and distribution facilities are as
follows:
(a) a 90 kV network, comprising 130 km of overhead lines linking
the five 90 kV substations of Bel Air, Hann, Cap des Biches,
Thies and Talba;
(b) a 30 kV network comprising about 1,050 km of lines and eight
30 kV/6.6 kV substations; and
(c) a 6.6 kV primary distribution network in Dakar, Saint-Louis
and Ziguinchor.
1.13      The 90 kV and 30 kV transmission lines in and around Dakar are
adversely affected by marine corrosion and insulation problems caused by
severe contamination from dust and proximity to the ocean, resulting in
frequent outages. The transmission network has not been properly
maintained. In particular, the 90 kV Bel-Air/Hann/Cap des Biches
transmission lines are in poor condition and would be rehabilitated
under the proposed project. A second 90 kV transmission line, Cap des
Biches/Thies, is needed to guarantee security of supply to Talba and
Thies. The distribution system in the Dakar and Cap Vert region,
representing 80% of the market, has not been adequately expanded nor
properly maintained; this results in poor quality of service and high
(about 16%) los3es. There are two primary distribution voltages in
Dakar (6.6 kV and 30 kV) but a recent distribution study carried out by



- 7 -
Shawinigan (Canada) has recommended that future expansion should be at
30 kV. (Ref. No. 16). 6/
2.   Access to Electricity Service
1.14      SENELEC supplies electricity to about 150,000 consumers
accounting for about 17% of the population, or 38% of those living in
the supply area. Electricity consumption rose at an annual average
growth rate of 6% in the period 1970-1984, from 285 GWh to 643 GWh.
Peak demand on the interconnected system grew at about the same rate
from 50 MW to 114 MW. Industrial customers account for 70%, residential
for 23%, and commercial for 7% of electricity consumption. The
phosphate industry at Talba alone accounted for 17% of the total sales
in 1984.
3.   Sector Development and Investment Program
1.15      As a result of the downturn in the Senegalese economy, demand
forecasts made in 1981 have been revised and now assume an average
growth of 3.4% through 1990, rising to 4.5% p.a. thereafter. Forecast
power and energy balances through 1995 are shown at Annex 1-2. A
CIDA-financed Generation and Transmission Master Plan, prepared by
Shawinigan in 1981 was recently updated by EdF and a least-cost
development program for the period 1985-2005 was prepared which reviewed
hydro and alternative thermal solutions (including peat and imported
coal) (Ref. No. 17). The program indicates the following sequence and
timing of future investments in generating capacity:
(a)  2 x 20 MW low-speed diesel plant by 1988, thereby permitting
the retirement of the Bel Air plant, followed by another 20 MW
unit in 1990 in the Dakar area; and
(b) hydro power from the Manantali dam in 1992 (3 x 40 MW) with
two 220 kV associated transmission lines to Dakar.
This latter development poses complex problems which can only be
addressed in a regional context (para. 1.21).
1.16      Following the discovery in 1979 of peat deposits in the Niayes
region 150 km north of Dakar, the Government carried out studies for the
development of a 2 x 15 MW peat-fired power plant and requested Bank
Group assistance in financing the project. After further analysis by
consultants financed under the ongoing Credit, such a project was found
to involve unusually high technical risks and very great financial cost
per unit of power produced (Ref. No. 11). Conlsequently, the Bank Group
6/   Selected documents available in the Project File are listed on
pages iii-iv, and referred to in this report by their reference
number in that listing.

has declined to support the project and GOS will not now proceed
with it.
1.17      The Manantali hydro uevelopment would enable the
interconnected system to be expanded to all major cities presently
supplied by high cost, inefficient diesel plants. Until that time,
schemes to expand the secondary centers should only proceed where
economically justified and financially viable. Should GOS require
SENELEC to proceed with uneconomic schemes, financial compensation
should be provided. Agreement to this effect was reached with the
Government.
1.18      The most urgent transmission requirement is the construction
of a 50 km 220 kV line from Dakar to Thies to secure the supply to the
phosphate industry. COS confirmed at the July donors' meeting that the
inclusion of this line in the proposed project would enable it to drop
the planned investment by CSPT (Talba Phosphate) in a 15 MW captive
diesel plant. Such an investment by CSPT would have been inappropriate,
as greater benefits would ensue from integrating the plant in the public
supply system to take advantage of the future hydro power from
Manantali. The Shawinigan study (para. 1.13) has defined a program of
urgently needed subtransmission and distribution measures for Dakar, to
be implemented by 1988.
1.19      Investment requirements for the power sector were presented to
the July 1985 donors' meeting and amount to US$187 million equivalent
between 1986-90; they are summarized in the following table and detailed
in Annex 1-3.

The 1986-88 program consists of: ongoing, funded projects (22Z), the
proposed project (65%); and a planned start on the third 20 MW diesel
unit and transmission lines associated with the Manantali hydro
development (13%). Completion of the latter two projects accounts for
about 78% of the 1989-90 program. The Hanantali hydro power station is



not included in SENELEC's program, as its construction would be the
responsibility of OMVS. 7/ Financing of the investment program is
discussed at paras. 1.40-1.41 and, having regard to its impact on
SENELEC's future financial position, agreement was reached that GOS and
SENELEC will consult with IDA annually on the power sector investment
program.
4.   Power Sector Issues and Government Policy
1.20      The efficient operation of the power sector is critical for
the Senegalese economy because of its share of oil imports and the
adverse consequences of a deteriorating power supply. GOS's sector
policy aims to reduce the consumption of oil through substitution,
conservation, and appropriate pricing. As another step towards greater
efficiency, GOS merged the institutions in the power sector in 1983 to
form a single utility, SENELEC (para. 1.23). However, the development
of indigenous resources and institution building remain serious sector
issues.
1.21      Exploitation of the hydro power from the Senegal and Gambia
Rivers is the responsibiilty of two regional organizations, OMVS and
OHVG 8/ and its development poses complex institutional and technical
problems. The Manantali project would be the first step in the
least-cost sequence of development of hydro resources. OMVS is
constructing the dam principally for agriculture, but the design of the
dam allows for the generation of 600 GWh of firm energy by the addition
of a 200 MW power plant. The dam is due for completion in 1988, but
electricity could not now be supplied before 1992 at the earliest.
Detailed studies are needed for the two 900 km 220 kV transmission
lines, of which 300 km would be within Mali, to supply 130 MW from
Manantali to Dakar.  Furthermore, given the regional nature of OMVS, any
progress will require the resolution of institutional and intercountry
issues associated with the development, ownership and management of
power facilities. To this end, a recently approved advance from the
Special Project Preparation Facility (SPPF) is assisting the financing
of the necessary studies. The engineering for the transmission lines
would be financed under a separate operation, once the institutional and
intercountry arrangements have been agreed.
1.22      Efforts to strengthen the laws relating to public enterprises
in Senegal have begun under the Second Parapublic Technical Assistance
project (Credit 1398-SE, July 7, 1983). The present legislative
framework ("Cahier des Clauses et Conditions G6n6rales") for the power

sector has recently evolved from the concession system and is reasonably
satisfactory. The annex to this document, which regulates the tariff
issue, is being finalized. Strengthening SENELEC's autonomy as a power
utility is a longer-term objective which would be further discussed with
GOS during implementation of the proposed project.
C.   SENELEC - THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
1.   Organization, Management and Staffing
1.23      SENELEC is responsible for public electricity supply in
Senegal and has a monopoly of generation (with some restrictions),
transmission and distribution. SENELEC's Board ("Conseil
d'Administration") consists mainly of Ministry representatives who meet
at least three times a year to determine and monitor SENELEC's broad
policy. Policy implementation is pursued by a six-man Management
Committee ("Comit6 de Direction"). This includes the Chairman of the
Board and the General Manager of SENELEC who is responsible for
day-to-day management, with little interference from GOS.
1.24      At present, in addition to the supervision of NDIA (DE),
ex post control of SENELEC is exercised by the Financial Controller of
the Presidency, auditors from the Ministry of Finance, and by a "Conseil
de Surveillance" (equivalent to a shareholders' meeting). The Conseil
comprises the 16 Board members, a Chamber of Commerce representative,
and three SENELEC staff representatives, and its main function is to
approve SENELEC's annual accounts and authorize capital changes.
However, this supervision process is being reviewed in the broader
context of public enterprise reform under the ongoing parapublic sector
project.
1.25      SENELEC's existing organization is set out in Annex 1-4.  Its
headquarters are in Dakar and it has seven regional offices for
distribution and remote diesel generation. SENELEC suffers from serious
internal organizational and managerial weaknesses, and a precarious
financial position. Under the ongoing parapublic sector project, EdF
has recently finalized a rehabilitation program ("Plan de Redressement")
for SENELEC to address deficiencies identified in an earlier diagnostic
study (Ref. No. 12). SENELEC has a staff of about 2,100. By regional
standards this level is reasonable, but extra efforts are needed to
train staff, and this would be addressed under the rehabilitation
program (Section C.3). Furthermore, the proposed project would continue
to finance training of suitable candidates at the regional training
school ("Ecole Superieure Interafricaine de l'Electricite" - ESIE),
begun under the ongoing Power Engineering and Technical Assistance
Project.
2.   Financial Position
1.26      Accounting, Audits and Insurance.  The Power Engineering and
Technical Assistance Project provided funds to audit SENELEC's accounts
and to review its accounting procedures. The latter have steadily and



- 11 -
significantly improved in recent years, and the remaining weaknesses
would be addressed !n the rehabilitation program of the proposed
project. The audits for 1979-84 have been satisfactorily completed; 9/
agreement was reached that SENELEC will continue to have its accounts
audited by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, and will submit to
IDA its audited accounts, and the auditor's report thereon, within 6
months of its fiscal year end.
1.27      SENELEC has made satisfactcry arrangements for insurance
against normal power utility risks: It maintains comprehensive coverage
against civil liability, fire, explosion and electrical faults.
Vehicles and data processing equipment are also adequately insured.
1.28       Past Financial Performance and Present Position.  SENELEC's
financial performance has deteriorated in recent years, principally
because of its high cost of production, and of GOS's reluctance to grant
timely and adequate tariff increases necessary to cover rising costs.
Consequently, SENELEC has incurred operating deficits in each of the
last fonr years. As at end 1985, SENELEC's liquidity was inadequate
(the current ratio was 0.9). Primarily, as a result of high public
sector receivables (para. 1.28), SENELEC has had to delay payments for
fuel (CFAF 8 billion) and to resort to a bank overdraft (over
CFAF 1 billion). Due to the revaluation of fixed assets on January 1,
1983, when SENELEC was established, its debt/equity ratio is
satisfactory (30:70). A relatively high provision for depreciation of
fixed assets (8%) enabled SENELEC to finance 8% of capital expenditure
from internal sources. A tariff increase of CFAF 2/kWh (about 3
percent) was introduced from March 1, 1985, but was insufficient to
overcome SENELEC's serious financial problems in 1985. Reduction of
fuel prices, improved management and maintaining tariffs at adequate
levels should help to restore SENELEC's financial viability
(para. 1.36).
1.29      Income Statements, Funds Flow Statements and Balance Sheets,
which indicate SENELEC's unsatisfactory financial position for 1982-85,
are set out in Annex 1-5 and are summarized in the following tables:
91   Audits for 1979, 80, 81 and 82 (Ref. Nos. 3,4,5,6); valuation of
assets and opening balance sheet as of January 1, 1983, for the
merger of EDS and SENELEC (Ref. No. 7); audits for 1983 and 1984
(Ref. Nos. 8,9).

1.30      Billing and Collection.  Accounts receivable, as of end 1984,
were over CFAF 13 billion (US$31 million equivalent), representing about
four months' billings. This high level was due to the poor payment
record of the public sector in particular, whose accounts were more than
one year in arrears (about CFAF 4 billion) and, to a lesser extent, to
private consumers outside Dakar (five months).  However, the level of
private consumer receivables in Dakar (less than three months) was
satisfactory.
1.31      SENELEC has recently started a serious campaign to recover its
receivables, principally by reminder notices followed by disconnection,
particularly for private clients. For the public sector, SENELEC has
reached agreement with the various agencies on the amounts outstanding,
and on a plan to set off the arrears against accounts due by SENELEC in
respect of debt service. As of end 1985, receivables had dropped to
about CFAF 10 billion (US$24 mil'ion equivalent).  The rehabilitation
program (Section C.3) proposes comprehensive measures to strengthen
SENELEC's control of collections.
1.32      In order to complement the above actions, the following
agreements were reached:
Cal' From GOS: the annual budgets of all Government departments
and local authorities would include sufficient provision to
cover the cost of their annual consumption of electricity, and
a satisfactory centralized advance payment procedure would be
introduced; and



- 14 -
(b) From SENELEC: the level of consumer receivables would not
exceed the equivalent of 3 months' billings.
1.33      Tariffs.  Tariffs for each class of consumers are uniform
throughout Senegal. This results in a substantial subsidy to consumers
in the secondary centers, where the costs of supply from isolated diesel
plants are high. Details of existing tariffs are set out in Annex 1-6.
1.34      The present structure of electricity tariffs was introduced in
1977 following a study by EdF of Long-Run Marginal Costs (LRMC) of
supply. In principle, tariffs should have been adjusted according to a
formula pegging them to the costs of fuel, labor and materials. In
practice, although rates have been periodically adjusted, the formula
has not been promptly and correctly applied. To take account of
changing patterns of consumption and costs of supply as SENELEC's power
system expanded, a further review, including an update of LRMC, was
undertaken by EdF in 1982 with IDA financing (Ref. No. 10). However, as
agreement could not be reached with GOS on SENELEC's investment plan,
which provided the basis for the study, the new proposed tariffs were
not implemented. GOS continues from time to time to approve rate
increases, but the tariff structure, which is regressive, has remained
unchanged.
1.35      Based on the medium-term least-cost development program
(Annex 1-3), SENELEC's economic tariff is about CFAF 60/kWh
(USt15/kWh) 10/. However, they need to be related more closely in
future to costs of supply in order to restore SENELEC's financial
viability and enable it to contribute a reasonable proportion of its
future investment program from internal funds. Agreement has been
reached following a recent tariff study on an acceptable tariff
structure and levels, which are to be implemented as a condition of
effectiveness.
1.36      In order for SENELEC to contribute to the financing of its
investment program as needed to ensure its envisaged implementation,
SENELEC's financial position needs to be substantially improved. The
reduction in the price of its fuel as of July 1986 would go a long way
towards the achievement of this objective. Tariff increases are,
therefore, unlikely to be required during the program period, as long as
fuel prices to SENELEC (US$23/barrel) remain at about their present
level. However, in order to ensure SENELEC's ability to meet that
objective, agreement was reached that the Government and SENELEC would
undertake whatever measures would be required, including tariff
increases, so that SENELEC achieves a contribution to its investments
from internally generated funds of not less than 30 percent annually as
10/ Medium-term marginal cost based on diesel investment through 1988,
but excluding the cost of isolated secondary centers and
investments in transmission lines from Manantali.



- 15 -
of 1987. At this stage of SENELEC's development, it was deemed simpler
to establish a satisfactory level of internal cash generation, taking
into account debt service and working capital requirements, than a rate
of return requiring a regular fixed asset revaluation.
3.   Rehabilitation Program and Performance Contract
1.37      EdF's diagnostic study identified major weaknesses in all
aspects of SENELEC's organization, management and staffing, the
principal of which are an unsuitable internal structure, lack of a
management information system, poor internal communication between staff
and management, archaic methods of work and decision making, resistance
to change, overstaffing and chaotic recruitment practices. SENELEC has
reduced the number of expatriates from 30 to 2 since the termination in
December 1984 of the technical assistance agreement with EEOA, but it is
clear that SENELEC still needs technical assistance at senior staff
level to improve its management and operational practices.
1.38      Measures to remedy the above weaknesses and problems have been
set out by EdF in a rehabilitation program (Ref. No. 13). This
rehabilitation program forms part of the proposed project, and agreement
was reached to implement it over the period of the performance contract.
Details are given in Annex 1-7. Many of the proposed changes will
require time to be implemented, particularly, those requiring a change
of management style and practices. SETELEC has engaged advisory
technical assistance personnel in the areas of finance, customer
accounting and operations to assist SENELEC's own staff in the
rehabilitation; they are drawn from a power utility under a general
"twinning" agreement.
1.39      Agreement was reached between GOS and SENELEC on a framework
("Contrat-Plan") to regulate the performance of SENELEC over a four-year
period (1986-89), thus covering the rehabilitation program. The
finalizing and signing of this performance contract is a condition of
Credit effectiveness.
4.   Financing Plan (1986-90)
1.40      SENELEC's financial requirements through 1990, based on the
investment program at Annex 1-3, are summarized in the following table,
and detailed in the Funds Flow Statement at Annex 1-5.

a/  Working capital includes the variation in cash between 1986-90;
however, the contribution formula excludes cash variations. On
this basis, SENELEC would contribute 42% to investment between
1986-90.
1.41      SENELEC has already secured about US$20 million to finance
ongoing projects from AfDB, BADEA, CCCE and CIDA. For the proposed
project GOS would be the borrower of the IDA Credit of US$20 million, of
which US$18 million would be passed on to SENELEC (para. 2.06). An
additional US$41 million of the proposed project would be financed by
other donors (para. 2.05). Further borrowings of about US$85 million
would be needed to finance major new investment from 1988 onward, most
of which is attributable to the further 20 MW diesel investment required
by 1991 and the construction of the transmission links to the Manantali
hydrostation. At this stage, however, the investment program and
financing plan after 1988 must remain tentative.
5.   Future Finances
1.42      SENELEC's forecast Income and Funds Flow Statements and
Balance Sheets through 1990 are set out in Annex 1-5, together with the
assumptions used in their preparation. With the progressive
implementation of the rehabilitation program and the reduction in fuel
prices to be applied in July 1986, SENELEC's financial position would
improve: in particular, SENELEC would be L,le to repay its overdraft
within one or two years, and maintain adequate levels of working capital



- 17 -
and liquidity. Arrears due by SENELEC to its fuel supplier have already
been repaid thanks to the first tranche of GOS's loan (para. 1.09).
1.43      However, to protect SENELEC's future financial viability,
agreement was reached during negotiations that SENELEC would not incur
new debt without IDA's prior concurrence, unless its expected future
internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times future debt service,
including the proposed borrowing. Salient features of SENELEC's future
finances through 1990 are as follows:

D.   BANK GROUP ROLE IN THE ENERGY SECTOR
1.   Strategy and Rationale for Involvement
1.44      Bank Group strategy aims at assisting the authorities to
achieve an optimal use of energy resources, to reduce the cost of
supply, meet economic demand and ensure satisfactory service to
consumers while, at the same time, reducing the burden of financial
demands imposed by the sector on Government resources. These aims are
being pursued by a strategy of: (a) continued institution building in
the power sector, by way of strengthening SENELEC; (b) assistance to GOS
and SENELEC in making optimal decisions on rehabilitation and expansion
of power facilities, including the promotion of regional hydro
resc-urces; and (c) conservation measures, including economic pricing of
energy. The Bank Group role is essentially catalytic. For example, at
GOS req'lest, the Bank Group acted as coordinating agency for the July
1985 Energy Sector donors' meeting, which provided a forum for major



- 18 -
sector policy reforms and for mobilizing the substantial cofinancing
needed for the proposed project (paras. 1.07-1.08). Without our
involvement, it is unlikely that the above aims would be achieved in a
satisfactory and coordinated way, as other sector aid is predominantly
of a bilateral nature.
2.   Past Involvement in the Sector
1.45      In FY80, the Bank Group approved the Power Engineering and
Technical Assistance project (Credit S-26-SE) to assist GOS to develop
an overall energy plan and to reorganize the sector. Several studies
(generation/transmission master plan, tariffs, audits) have been or are
being completed satisfactorily, and provide the basis for the
institutional, technical and financial improvements envisaged under the
proposed project. Technical assistance was also provided to NDIA in
energy and power sector planning, and an overseas training program for
Senegalese officials responsible for energy planning was established.
Identification of energy sector reforms was further supported in FY83
through the Second Parapublic Technical Assistance Project which
provided funds to finance, inter alia, a diagnostic study and
rehabilitation program for SENELEC. Implementation of both projects has
been satisfactory.
II. THE PROJECT
A.  PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.01      The proposed project would assist Senegal to:
(a) optimize its use of energy resources through the elimination
of price distortions and :hrough the implementation of energy
conservation measures;
(b) reduce the cost of generation through improved efficiency and
availability of existing plant, and through the construction
of more fuel-efficient facilities;
(c) strengthen and expand the existing transmission and
distribution system to improve reliability, reduce losses and
generate sales, mainly in the Dakar area; and
(d) strengthen SENELEC's management and restore its financial
viability through a comprehensive rehabilitation program.
B.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.02      The proposed project consists of the following components, the
principal of which are shown on Map 19101R1:



- 19 -
(a) Generation:
(i)  the installation of 2 x 20 MW of low- (or medium-) speed
diesel units at Cap des Biches; and
(ii) completion of the ongoing rehabilitation of the existing
steam units at Cap des Biches (condenser retubing, sea
water intake modification, and spare parts).
(b) Transmission:
(i) rehabilitation of the existing 90 kV transmission line
and substations, Bel Air/Hann and Bel Air/Cap des Biches;
(ii) construction of a new 50 km, 220 kV line, Cap des
Biches/Thies (operated at 90 kV initially) and a 90 kV
substation at Tobene; and
(iii) construction of a new 18 km, 90 kV line, Hann/Cap des
Biches.
(c) Distribution:
(i) rehabilitation and strengthening of the Dakar network
(75 km of 6.6 kV line and 34 substations); and
(ii) rehabilitation of about 100 km of 30 kV line outside
Dakar and construction of 45 km of 30 kV line to connect
2 secondary centers to the main grid.
(d) Engineering: Consultant services for the generation,
transmission and distribution components (135 man-months);
(e) Energy Conservation: Consultant services, training and
equipment for the industrial sector energy conservation
program (1986-88);
(f) Studies of: (i) petroleum product supply, refining and
distribution arrangements, (ii) organization and operation of
the "Fonds National de l'Energie", and (iii) household energy
consumption;
(g) Technical Assistance: (125 man-months) to SENELEC, as defined
in the rehabilitation program; and
(h) Training: Continuation of the program of scholarships to ESIE
of 7 students annually for the three-year period 1987-89 and
provision for about 40 man-months training for SENELEC staff
in those areas identified in the rehabilitation program.

C.  PROJECT COST
2.03      Based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of
negotiations, the estimated cost of the project, including provision for
physical and price contingencies, but excluding interest during
construction, is US$81 million equivalent (including US$2 million of
energy conservation), as summarized in the table below. The foreign
exchange cost of US$61 million equivalent represents about 75Z of the
project cost. Full details of the project cost are given in Annex 2-1.

2.04      Project cost estimates are based on recent studies and are at
end-1985 prices. Foreign costs of engineering services and technical
assistance personnel are based on currently prevailing rates. Cost
figures do not include any taxes or duties on the proposed project. The
cost of the 40 MW diesel component is based on low-speed units, although
bids will be invited for both low- and medium-speed units in mid-1986
(para. 2.11). The project cost includes 10% physical contingencies for
all equipment, which is reasonable. Price escalation for both foreign
and local costs have been included at rates of 7% in 1986 and 7.5%
thereafter. Since these cofinancing amounts are denominated in
currencies other than US dollars, fluctuations of the US dollar exchange
rate will have no real effect on the financing plan. With respect to
the IDA share which is pegged in SDR's to the dollar value in effect at
negotiations, when the exchange rate of the US dollar was CFAF 412, used



- 21 -
in this project, such fluctuations would have no significant effect, and
would, at any rate, be absorbed by the built-in contingencies.
D.   PROJECT FINANCING
2.05      At the October 1985 cofinanciers' meeting in Dakar, CCCE
indicated the availability of about US$28 million to finance the
electromechanical part of the diesel plant, and AfDB and BOAD indicated
an interest in financing the 220 kV line and some distribution works.
The appraisal of their respective components has now been carried out.
CCCE is financing the diesel plant package which includes design,
electromechanical components and construction. However, formal
commitment of CCCE is awaiting a satisfactory agreement between SENELEC
and CSPT, its largest industrial customer, on further reduction of the
tariff level to be applied to CSPT. We do not anticipate any problems
in this respect since all concerned agree on the basic principles being
applied in determining this level. AfDB would contribute US$8 million
equivalent and BOAD US$5 million equivalent to the financing of the
transmission component and the distribution component outside Dakar.
BOAD is also financing part of the rehabilitation of the Cap des Biches
steam plant.
2.06      An IDA Credit of US$20 million equivalent to GOS is proposed
which would finance about 25% of the project cost. IDA would finance a
part of the civil works of the new diesel plant, the foreign cost of the
Dakar distribution rehabilitation component for Dakar, consultant
services for the energy conservation component and energy studies,
engineering, technical assistance, and training. Most of the IDA Credit
(US$15.5 million equivalent) would be relent by GOS to SENELEC for 20
years, including 5 years of grace at the IBRD prevailing rate.   About
US$2.5 million equivalent would be relent to SENELEC for 20 years,
including 10 years of grace at IBRD prevailing rate, to finance the
technical assistance and training component. SENELEC would bear the
foreign exchange risk on its share of the Credit. The execution of a
satisfactory subsidiary financing agreement between GOS and SENELEC is a
condition of Credit effectiveness. The remaining US$2 million
equivalent of the IDA Credit would be retained by GOS to finance the
energy conservation and energy studies components of the project. The
local cost of the project (about US$23 million equivalent) would be
covered by SENELEC from internally generated funds. GOS and SENELEC
would assume responsibility for any cost overruns. The details of
project financing are set out in Annex 2-2 and summarized in the
table below.

2.07      At the request of GOS, IDA has taken the lead in coordinating
the arrangements for cofinancing of the proposed project.  With CCCE,
AfDB and BOAD contributions, the project financing plan is now firm.
The effectiveness of all cofinancing is a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed IDA Credit.
E.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
1.   Status of Preparation and Execution
2.08      Project preparation has been satisfactorily advanced under the
ongoing IDA power engineering and parapublic projects, and through the
CIDA-financed distribution expansion study, which have defined optimal
programs for power sector rehabilitation and expansion. Project
completion is expected by end-1990; an implementation schedule is at
Annex 2-3.
2.09      SENELEC would implement all aspects of the proposed project,
except for the energy conservation component and energy studies for
which MDIA (DE) would be the executing agency. Existing SENELEC staff
would be responsible for project management, with overall co-ordination
by the General Manager. However, in view of SENELEC's limited
experience and capabilities, assistance from engineering consultants and
technical assistance personnel would be needed. SENELEC lacks
experience in engineering the dieseE component and has appointed
Electricite de France (EdF) for design, bid evaluation and supervision
under terms of reference agreed with IDA. EdF has also been appointed,
with ongoing CCCE financing, to engineer the transmission component.
Consultants have been appointed to assist SENELEC in programming and
monitoring the transmission and distribution components of the proposed
project under satisfactory terms of reference agreed with IDA. SENELEC
has also appointed technical assistance personnel, drawn from a power
utility under a "twinning" agreement, to assist in implementing major
aspects of the rehabilitation program. An advance of US$400,000 was
made from the Project Preparation Facility to accelerate the engineering
and technical assistance components of the proposed project.

2.11      Apart from the civil works, the CCCE-financed diesel plant
package (para. 2.05) would be prrcured following French procurement
procedures; in order to maximize competition, bids for both low- and
medium-speed diesel options will be sought. Civil works would be
procured in accordance with the Bank Group's ICB requirements; bids
-would be restricted to prequalified contractors. Transmission line and
substation contracts would be awarded on a supply and erect basis,
following BOAD and AfDB procurement procedures. The distribution
component outside Dakar would also be procured under BOAD and AfDB
procedures. IDA-financed distribution materials would be procured under
Bank Group guidelines. Most of the installation work on the
distribution component would be financed by SENELEC and would be carried
out by competent local contractors, following LCB procedures which are
satisfactory.  IDA-financed components for amounts over US$0.25 million
equivalent would be subject to prior review. Consultants and technical
assistance personnel to be financed by IDA have been appointed in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines.

3.   Disbursements
2.12      The proposed Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by
mid-1991 in accordance with the estimated schedule at Annex 2-5. This
corresponds to the Western Africa Region Power Sector Profile. The
proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:

4.   Monitoring and Reporting
2.13      SENELEC has established a Project Unit satisfactory to IDA,
under the General Manager, to monitor project execution.  Detailed
monitoring and reporting requirements were discussed with SENELEC during
appraisal and were finalized at negotiations. These would include
quarterly reports on SENELEC's activities (project, investment program
and financial position).
5.   Environmental Aspects
2.14      The proposed project would not have any major adverse
environmental effects. The diesel plant would be located at the
existing Cap des Biches power plant, which is some distance away from
Dakar, and measures would be incorporated in the design to minimize
noise and pollution.
F.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION, BENEFITS, AND RISKS
1.   Least-Cost Solution
2.15      No technical alternative exists for the rehabilitation
components of the proposed project. These are urgently needed to



- 25 -
improve the efficiency and availability of existing generation plant and
to improve reliability and reduce losses in the transmission and
distribution system. New investments in generation and transmission
have been selected on the basis of the least-cost sequence of system
expansion to meet load growth to the end of the decade (para. 1.13).
2.   Economic Rate of Return
2.16      The composition of the proposed project makes it appropriate
to consider the return on SENELEC's five-year investment program through
1990 as a reasonable proxy for the return on the proposed project. The
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on SENELEC's investment program (excluding
investments ralated to the Manantali project) is about 17%, based on
measurable costs and benefits. The assumptions used and the
calculations of the IRR are detailed at Annex 2-6. Measurable benefits
understate the total benefits, particularly those arising from
rehabilitation which have not been quantified (improved reliability and
maintenance of the present level of sales). A 10% increase in total
benefits would raise the IRR to 20%. A 10% reduction in costs would
have the same effect. On the other hand, the IRR is not particularly
sensitive to different assumptions on the trend of real oil prices after
1995. The effect of a 10 percent variation in the exchange rate of the
US dollar would have no significant effect on the IRR.
3.   Risks
2.17      The project presents no unusual technical or environmental
risks. The risk of cost overruns is small, as the cost of the largest
component of the project (new diesel plant comprising about 50% of the
total project cost) may prove to be lower than estimated. The main area
of uncertainty is the pace of implementation of SENELEC's recovery
program as, despite the proposed use of technical assistance personnel,
considerable political and managerial will is needed to resolve present
problems.
III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.01      The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
(a) From GOS:
(i)  loan of CFAF 6.9 billion to SENELEC (para. 1.09);
(ii)  not to expand isolated centers unless economically
justified or unless SENELEC receives compensation
(para. 1.17);
(iii)  consultation on its investment program (para. 1.19); and



- 26 -
(iv) satisfactory future budgeting for electricity dues
(para. 1.32 (a)).
(b)  From SENELEC:
Ci)  consultation on its investment program (para. 1.19);
(ii)  audit of accounts (para. 1.26);
(iii) consumer receivables not to exceed three months' billings
(para. 1.32 (b));
(iv)  minimum 30Z annual contribution to investment
(para. 1.36);
(v)  implementation of the agreed rehabilitation program
(para. 1.38); and
(vi)  debt limitation (para. 1.43).
3.02      The following are conditions of Credit effectiveness:
(a)  GOS loan of CFAF 6.9 billion to SENELEC (para. 1.09);
(b) Introduction of new tariff structure and levels (para. 1.35);
(c) signature of Performance Contract (para. 1.39);
(d) subsidiary financing agreement between GOS/SENELEC
(para. 2.06); and
Ce) effectiveness of cofinancing (para. 2.07).
3.03      Subject to agreement on the above matters, the proposed
project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$20 million equivalent.

SENEGAL
ENERGY SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Assumptions Used
Investment Costs: In constant end-1985 prices taken from SENELEC's
investment program. Costs of transmission lines to bring power from
Manantali excluded. Local costs (35%) have been adjusted by the
standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.95.
Incremental Fuel Costs: Heavy fuel oil was priced at US$154/ton (CIF
Dakar plus local handling costs as of July 1986). The July 1985 Bank
oil price forecast was applied through 1995. The following plant fuel
efficiencies were applied:
1986       1987        1988
Cap des Biches (Gross)         336         331        328
Bel Air (Gross)                441          -          -
New Diesels (Net)                           -         240
Incremental Operating Costs: Labor and materials. These have been kept
constant in real terms at the 1984 level of CFAF 15/kWh of sales.  Labor
costs have been adjusted by the SCF of 0.95.
Incremental Sales: 4.5% p.a. growth from 1986 up to the limit of the
annual output of the new diesel plant.
Incremental Revenues: Calculated using the real level of tariffs
expected to be in place in 1985-87. The real average tariffs assumed
are CFAF 61/kWh in 1986 and 1987.
GWh Replaced: This represents the generation of Bel Air replaced by the
new diesels, less the incremental sales in a given year.
Value of Fuel Savings: Calculated using the difference in the fuel
consumption between Bel-Air and the new diesel plant.
Reduced losses: It is estimated that the rehabilitation program will
reduce losses by 2% in 1987, 3% in 1988 and 4% in 1989 and thereafter.
These reduced losses have been valued at the short-run marginal cost of
generation using gas turbines (CFAF 75/kWh).
Reduced Fuel Consumption - Existing Plant: The rehabilitation of the
Cap des Biches plant will reduce its fuel consumption by 3% from 1987 to
1995.

ANNEX 2-6
Page 2 of 3
Reduced Fuel Consumption - Isolated Centers: Estimated on the basis of
a 10% reduction in fuel consumption in these plants as a result of the
rehabilitation program. The value of fuel saved by supplying two
centers from the grid rather than from their own plants has also been
included.
