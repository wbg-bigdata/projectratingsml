FIFTH HiGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2363/CREDITS 1423 & SF-6-MAI)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Highway Project
for which Loan 2363 (US$18.0 million), and Credits 1423 (SDR 12.4 million) and
SF-6-MAI (SDR 13.1 million) were approved and declared effective on December 8,
1983 and June 22, 1984 respectively, and which - except for a cancelled balance
of US$0.3 million - were fully disbursed on December 31, 199C. The Closing Date
of the project was extended once from September 30, 1990 to January 31, 1991.
2.    The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the
Southern Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and
by the Borrower (Part II).
3.    Preparation of this PCR was based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the Loan, Development Credit and Special Fund Credit Agreements;
supervision reports; consultants' reports; correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2363S/CREDITS 1423 & SF-6-MAI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Prolect Objectives
1.    The primary objective of the Fifth Highway Project was to consolidate the
implementation and management capacity established under previous Bank projects
in the highways sub-sector by improving and maintaining district roads,
strengthening the maintenance capacity of the entire road network, upgrading an
important section of the North-South Highway, and assessing alternate routes for
handling export/import traffic.
2.    Major project components included: completion of the third phase of the
District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP); the establishment of
a 4-year maintenance program f^r the entire road network; the construction of a
section of the North-South Hig, ..y :n the Northern Region; and the provision of
equipment for the Ministry of ' :s and Supplies (MWS) Training Center as well
as for Axle Load Control.
3.    The project was largely executed by MWS with the assistance of consultants.
Implementation Experience
4.    Project implementation was substantially successful despite factors beyond
the control of the main executing agency.   In 1984, a severe fuel shortage
contributed to the delay of some project components, namely, the road
construction component, the rehabilitation and resealing of paved roads, and the
rehabilitation of earth and gravel roads. More work than had been anticipated
was carried out under Phase II of DRIMP. This combined with the fuel shortage
led to Phase III of DRIMP getting underway one year behind schedule.  Cost
overruns under Phase III resulted from rain damage repairs and a wage increase
for unskilled labor in FY88/89. This resulted in the deferral of the completion
of improvements to two districts and the postponement of improvements to three,
to Phase IV under the Infrastructure Project (Credit 2069-MAI, 1989, US$28.8
million).



iii
5.    With the introduction of the Maintenance and Rehabilitation Management
S stem (MARMS) - a program of maintenance designed to help MWS make efficient use
of ezisting resources on an annual basis - the need for ma!.ntenance depots in 11
districts was identified.   Financing of thrce depots took place under the
project, and the remaining eight were deferred for financing under the
Infrastructure Project.
6.    A contract under the program for resealing of paved roads was drcpped due
to financial constraints and extensive deep and surface patching had to be
carried out along the designated road. The program for rehabilitation of earth
and gravel roads underwent many revisions during its implementation Including the
upgrading of certain roads to higher standards than anticipated in an attempt to
help ease future maintenance burdens.  Ultimately, rehabilitation    uoo 'O  km out
of the envisioned 1700 km was carried out.  The remainder is be  ,    ried out
under the Infrastructure Project.
7.    Budget allocations for ma'ntenance of all road networks were inadequate and
remained below targets agreed upon at negotiations.  The burden was lessened
somewhat by the Bank financing incremental maintenance costs on a declining basis               F
over three years under Phase III of DRIMP.
8.    The Closing Date of the project was extended once (from September 30, 1990
to January 31, 1991) to cover an extension of technical assistance and completion
of some of the delay'd works. Total project costs at completion amounted to
US$83.7 million, 0.4Z lower than the appraisal estimate of US$84.01 million.
Results
9.    Although the main objectivres of the project were achieved, some targets
were not fully reached. Work on three districts under DRIMP III was deferred to
Phase IV under the Infrastructure Project.   The work completed, however, is
expected to enhance access to markets and facilitate delivery of supplies and
services to rural areas as well as contribute to savings in vehicle operating
costs. The total length of earth and gravel roads rehabilitated under the road
maintenance program was reduced as a result of some roads beii.g upgraded to a
higher standard,
10.   Based on traffic levels, the economic rate of return for Phase III of DRIMP
has been estimated to be greater than the appraisal estimate of 122.  The
economic rate of return for the construction of the Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo Road
was reestimated at 30Z, close to the economic rate of return of 29? estimated at
appraisal. For the rehabilitation of both paved and unpaved (earth and gravel)
roads, the economic rates of return were within the ranges estimated at appraisal
(Table 6B).



iv
11.   The project had a positive impact in the area of road maintenance
management and the studies ctrried out contributed positively to the capacity and
institution-building of the executing agencies.  The implementation of MARMS
established a comprehensive system of cost control and monitoring nationwide.
12.   A formal agreement between the Governments of Malawi and Tanzania fow the
further development of the Northern Access Route (leading from southern Ma'lawi
to the port of Dar-es-Salaam) has been signed. Studies were carried out under
this project in preparation for this, as well as for the Northern Transport
Corridor Project (Credit 1879-HAI, 1988, US$13.4 million).
13.   Beneficial effects to the environment as a result of the project included
reduction in the potential for soil erosion, improvement in drainage, noise
abatement, and a decline in vibration as well as in the generation of dust.
Sustainability
14.   The sustainability of the project depends on Government provision of
adequate funding for maintenance.  Also, it is essential that trained local
professionials assume greater responsibility in the operation of both DRIMP and
MARHS.
Findings and Lessons Learned
15.   The main lessons drawn from the implementation of the Fifth Highway Project
are:
a realistic assessment of Government's  capability to allocate
sufficient funding for maintenance is necessary during appraisal;
-     care needs to be taken to ensure that adequate supervision of road
works and crews, and quality control of inputs are in place on time;
-     the importance oa  a clearly defined role for technical assistance
and the training of local personnel in key areas of planning,
management and maintenance to the sustainability of the project;
-     flexibility in design to allow for the inclusion of elements that
will facilitate implementation of the project and help it to better
achieve its objectives; and
-     the importance of a functional cost-monitoring system to the early
detection and containment of potential cost overruns.

Sector                   Infrastructure
Sub-sector               Highways
2.    Background
2.1         Since the early 1970s, the Government of Malawi has sought a more
balanced pattern of growth across the country, and policy in the transport sector
in general, and the highways sub-sector in particular, has played a large part
in its attempt to achieve this goal. Malawi's road network totals about 13,280
km.  with 19S (2,520 km) of it paved, 32 of it engineered gravel standard, and
earth and tracks making up the  rest  (78?).   Under various agricultural
development projects, about 2,000 km. of feeder and crop extraction roads have
been constructed to minimum all-weather standards. Some 800 km of earth roads
and tracks are located within forestry plantations and reserves while another 800
km or so run through national parks.
2.2         In the early 1980s,  the Government became concerned over the
increased vulnerability of its principal access routes - rail links to the ports
of Beira and Nacala in Mozambique - to continued insurgent disruption. It took
steps to lessen the impact of these difficulties on trade and at considerable
cost, transit traffic was diverted through Zambia and the Republic of South
Africa (RSA).  Civil war and strife in Mozambique continued and the situation
deteriorated further.   Thus, the development of alternative routes became
crucial.



-2-
2.3         A study financed by the European Development Fund (EDF) in the early
1980s, examined anticipated changes in Malawi's composition and direction of
trade.   The study recommended that the Govern=ent  give high priority to
developing the Northern Access Route, deeming this route - linking Malawi to the
Tanzania-Zambia (TANZAM) Highway, the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA), and the
port of Dar-es-Salaam - cheaper in time and,cost than the alternatives.
2.4         In addition to exploring and providing efficient links to the Indian
Ocean for export/import traffic, transport policy sought to: a) improve the
administrative, social, and economic integration of the country by linking all
three regions (North, South, and Central) with reliable all-weather connections;
and b) foster rural development by improving access to rural areas.
2.5         The World  Bank  -has  supported  the  sector  since  1966 when  an
eiagineering credit (Credit S-2-MAI) was approved.  It financed the design of 290
km of highway between Zomba and Lilongwe, as well as studies on road transport
licensing and road/rail coordination.  Since then, four IDA-financed projects in
the '-ighways sub-sector - First Highway (Credit 112-MAI, US$11.5 million) in
1968, Second Highway (Credit 523-MAI, US$10.0 million) in 1974, Third Highway
(Credit 758-HAI, US$10.5 million) in 1977, and Fourth Highway (Credit 1099-HAI,
SDR 25.9 million or US$33.0 million equivalent) in 1981 - have, in total,
financed construction of some 620 km of highway. These sections run from Zomba
in the south to the Luwawa Turnoff in the northern region, as well as from Mbowe
to Ekwendeni further north. In addition, a 100 km stretch between the Luwawa
Turnoff and Mbowe has been improved under these projects.
2.6         Under the Second and Fourth Highway Projects, the District Road
Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP) was established in 13 of Malawi's 24
districts.  The program aims to: a) bring existing roads up to a maintainable
standard; b) provide depots and equipment for maintenance; and c) provide
training  for maintenance  staff.    Under  the  program,  effective  district
organizations were put in place during the first two phases, that brought 3,700
km of district roads up to all-weather standards.
2.7         The Fifth Highway  Project  continued to  support Malawi's  main
objectives in the transport sector and broadened IDA-Government collaboration
established under the previous projects.   The project was prepared by the
Government in mid-1981, with assistance from consultants and the Bank. It was
appraised in February/March and June/July of 1983.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1         The objective of the Fifth Highway Project was to consolidate the
implementation and -,anagement capacity estfblished under previous Bank projects
in the sub-sector. It continued to support the Government's aims of:
- improving and maintaining existing district roads;



-3-
- strengthening the maintenance capacity of the entire road network (main
and secondary) system;
- developing the economic potential of the northern half f the country by
upgrading an important section of the main North-South (Bangula to
Karonga) Highway; and
- assessing alternate routes for handling export/import traffic.
In addition, it proposed t  strengthen .he planning capacity of the Transport
Planning Unit (TPU) of thr  .raomic Planning and Development Division (EPD) of
the Office of the Preside:  a Ad Cabinet, as well as the management capabilities
of the Ministry of Works and Supplies (MVS)1/.
3.2         The project consisted of the following components:
a)    the completion of the thiru phase of the DRIMP;
b)    the establishment and financing of a maintenance program for both
the main and secondary road Lyitems that would:
i.    resee.l/rehabilitate/re,onstruct paved roads;
ii.   rehabilitate earth and gravel roads; and
iii.  provide maintenance equipment for the Roads Department
(RD) of MWS;
c)    the construction of a two-lane bituminous, SO-km section of the road
between the Luwawa Turnoff and Champhoyo in %.he Northern Region;
d)    the provisien of weighbridges and vehicles for axle load control,
and construction of houses for the operating staff;
e)    the provision of furniture, training aids, and equipment for the MWS
Training Center in Lilongwe; and
f)    the provision of consultant services to assist in the implementation
of a) and b), in preparing a study of the Northern Access Route that
would include the road link to the TANZAM/TAZARA corridor; in
strengthening the management capabilities of TPU and the Plant and
Vehicle Hire Organization (PVHO) of MWS; as well as in the
preparation of future projects.
3.3         MWS was responsible for execution of the project except for the axle-
load control component and the technical assistance to MTC's planning unit for
which MTC was responsible. The study of the Northern Access route was supervised
by EPD, as was the technical assistance for its TPU.
l/Renamed Ministry of Works (MOW) as of March 1988.

3.4         The project %as implemented over 7 years and at appraisal total costs
were estivAated at US$78.5 million net of taxes and duties..  US$13.1 million
(16.7Z) of this was financed by a credit from IDA, US$13.8 million (17.6Z) by a
credit from the IDA Speci&l Fund, US$18.0 million (22.9Z) by a loan from the
Bank, US$16.0 million (20.4X) by a loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB),
and the remainder US$17.6 million (22.4Z) was counterpart funding from the
Gnver.znent.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1         The project design was straightforward, the objectives clear, and
responsibilities for implementation and management were clearly demarcated. As
was evident from the relatively smooth process of implementation, the project was
well prepared and the goals of the Bank and the Government coincided.   Time
frames under the project were realistic and allowed for optimum phasing of inputs
for each component.
4.2         In those components where physical progress was apparent, e.g., civil
construction, rehabilitation and resealing of roads, the developments could be
easily monitoted.
4.3         As in the earlier phases of DRIMP, the participation of District
Councils in the maintenance aspect of the Program was of great importance. This
allowed the community important say in the establishment of priorities regarding
road improvements to be carr'.ed out.  It also established an important link
between the project and the majority of the intended beneficiaries.
5.    Prolect Implementation
5.1         On the whole, the project experienced no major problems during its
implementation.   However,  during the early stages a severe fuel shortage
contributed to the delay of some components.   The construction component
(exclusively financed by AfDB), the rehabilitation and resealing of paved roads
and the rehabilitation of earth and gravel (unpaved) roads, all sot off to a slow
start. Delays in procurement resulted in the delivery of road maintenance
equipment one year behind schedule.
5.2         Phase III of DRII4P got underway in mid-1985, one year later than
scheduled. This was due in part to the fuel shortage, but principally to the
increased amount of work carried out under Phase II. The increased quantity of
work in Phase II districts led to cost overruns and pointed out the deficiencies
of the existing cost and monitoring system. A detailed study undertaken as part
of this project identified the extent of Phase II cost overruns and was
instrumental in developing a comprehensive site costing and reporting system.



-5-
The system, aimed at exercising more effective control over future project
expenditures, was put in place during implementation.
5.3         Heavy rains, major repairs on completed road sections and a 128Z wage
increase for unskilled laborl/ in FY88/89 contributed to cost overruns under
Phase III of DRIMP. As a result, it became necessary to defer the completion of
road improvements to two districts (Nkhotakota and Zomba) and postpone
improvements to three (Mwanza, Blantyre and Chiradzulu) to Phase IV under the
Infrastructure Project (Credit 2069-MAI, 1989, US$28.8 million). Under the civil
works components of Phase III, the extension to MWS headquarters was completed
on schedule, but there were delays in depot construction.
5.4         The Maintenance and Rehabilitation Management System (MARMS) was
instituted under the program of technical assistance to MWS in late 1984/early
1985 and reinforced by the addition of new staff in 1986. It was designed to
help MWS make efficient use of existing resources for road maintenance. By April
1986, MARMS was operational nationwide and was a.. effective planning a.2d
monitoring tool. Its implementation involved a cyclical process of planning,
organizing, directing, and controlling. Extra effort had to be expended to bLing
overhead items under stricter budgetary control.
5.5         As a result of the introduction of MARMS, MWS identified the need for
maintenance depots in eleven districts. These depots were to include offices,
stores, and accommodation for maintenance staff.  The project was, therefore,
amended to include the construction of depots in three districts, the remaining
eight to be financed under the Infrastructure Project.
5.6         The program for rehabilitation of paved roads comprised three
construction contracts totalling 75 km. Though all were completed, the delay of
the first (22 km of the Chikwawa-Bangula Road) as a result of the fuel shortage
in 1984, pushed both the second (13 km of the main North-South Highway through
Lilongwe) and third (40 km from Lilongwe to Balaka) 2-3 months behind schedule.
5.7         Work under the program for the resealing of paved roads was carried
out by Roads Department (RD) force account units. The Bank's contribution was
postponed to the last two years of the 4-year program after financing from the
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom (not available
at appraisal) was secured. In 1986, the program was expanded to include 94 km
of roads to be let by contract.
5.8         The crushing plant used for resealing work exacted high maintenance
and repair costs due to age. The plant having broken down on several occasions
was eventuaily closed in March of 1986. As an alternative to providing a new
plant, the Bank attempted to develop the capacity of the private sector to supply
crushed stones. The Government was encouraged to tender bids for the furnishing
of aggregates. However, a lack of quality control resulted in the delivery of

Malawi's structural adjustment program.

stones not fully in compliance with specifications. Despite this, the stones
were used, resulting in portions of the roads having to be closely monitored to
determine whether an earlier than anticipated reseal would be necessary.
5.9         Heavier than anticipated patching work done on previously completed
sections caused a delay in the patching and resealing of a 120 km stretch between
the Zambia border and Lilongwe. In the initial stages of this contract, MWS
supervisory presence was lacking resulting in sloppy and haphazard work being
carried out over a 6 km stretch before the situation was noticed and corrected.
5.10        A contract for 29 km of slurry seal between Liwonde and Zomba under
the program which was deferred to FY89/90 was eventually dropped. This was due
to financial constrairts and extensive deep and surface patching required along
the designated road, which escalated costs.
5.11        The program rehabilitation of earth and gravel roads underwent many
revisions during its implementation. In an attempt to ease future maintenance
burdens, MWS decided to upgrade all the roads under the program to gravel
standard.  This, combined with an increased deterioration of the roads since
initial inventory, necessitated a reduction in the total length of rcads
upgraded. The project originally called for improvements to road formation and
drainage of some 1700 km of roads over the 4-year program. Revisions resulted
in about 900 km being completed and the remainder being deferred for completion
under the Infrastructure Project.
5.12        Under the axle load control component, 4 mobile weighbridges were
delivered to MTC at the beginning of December 1984 and dummy platforms had to be
manufactured prior to their use. One existing stationary weighbridge at Blantyre
was metricized in November 1985.   The project financed the training for two
inspectors and the procurement of required spare parts and tools as well as the
construction of six houses for operators at the stationary weighbridges.
5.13        Over the course of the project, budget allocations for maintenance
of all road networks were inadequate and remained below targets agreed upon at
negotiations. Under DRIMP III, the Bank financed incremental maintenance costs
on a declining basis in districts where improvements were made. Maintenance
costs (declining from 75Z for the first year to 501 for the second, and 251 for
the third) were to be matched to the Government's assistance to the District
Councils in accordance with the agreed targets.
5.14        Towards the end of the project, there was a notable decline in the
quality of maintenance of both paved and unpaved roads in certain limited areas.
This was attributed to inadequate supervision caused by the inability of super-
visors to get to necessary locations on a regular basis.  These problems are
being addressed under the Infrastructure Project
5.15        The Project Closing Date was extended from September 30, 1990 to
January 31, 1991.  This was necessary in order to cover the extension of the
contract for the Chief Planning Engineer hired to assist the Road Planning Unit
of MWS.   Also, it ensured the orderly closing of accounts with respect to
payments made covering the delayed resealing and DRIMP III works.

6.    Results
6.1         The project was implemented along the lines envisioned at appraisal
with no major changes in fc:us, and its main objectives were successfully
achieved. DRIMP III targets, however, were not fully reached and it was
necessary to defer the completion of improvements to two districts and postpone
improvements to three, to the next phase due to both financial constraints and
the increased work carried out under DRIMP II.
6.2         Despite the postponement of improvements to certain district roads,
it is expected that the works carried out will improve access to markets and
facilitate the delivery of supplies and public services to rural areas. Roads
improved under the project and the maintenance system put in place will
contribute to savings in vehicle operating costs which can then be passed on as
lower rates to shippers and receivers of freight.
6.3         The economic benefits of Phase III of DRIMP are not ascertainable by
direct means. The attribution of any positive changes that have occurred in the
areas of influence of the DRIMP roads specifically to the road improvements
carried out would be difficult. At appraisal, roads selected to be improved were
estimated to have rates of return of at least 122 based on anticipated benefits
from savings in vehicle operating costs and from incremental increases in
agricultural production. Selection was made in accordance with socio-ecor.omic
criteria which not only took into account institution-building aspects but access
to health, education and other facilities as well as reducing the poten ial for
spoilage of agricultural produce for those residing in the vicinity of the roads.
6.4         At appraisal, a traffic level of ten vehicles per day was shown to
be sufficient to yield an economic rate of return of at least 12S based on
savings in vehicle operating costs. An examination of traffic counts shows the
roads included in Phase III meet the minimum rate of return criteria on the basis
of vehicle operating costs alone.
6.5         At appraisal, it was expected that the principal benefits derived
from both the construction and road maintenance components were to be savings in
vehicle  operating  costs  and  future  road  maintenance  costs.    The  main
beneficiaries were expected to be shippers and consumers located in the areas of
road influence. Vehicle operating costs (Table 4A) for earth and bitumen roads
have increased since appraisal for all classes of cars.
6.6         At appraisal, the rate of return for the AfDB-financed construction
component (Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo Road) was estimated at 29Z. Justifications
for this estimate rested substantially on the transport of export/import traffic
over the road and thus, the impact of the construction of other stretches of
highway - between Champhoyo and Mboye and between Karonga and the Hbeyi-Itungi
road in Tanzania - was considered. The exogenous effect of security which this
northern route would afford the export/import traffic was also taken into



-8-
account, as were cost minimizations resulting from time delivery of goods and
services. On the basis of traffic and vehicle operating cost data as well as
price adjustments, the rate of return for this component has been estimated at
30X.
6.7          The road maintenance component was expected to increase the capacity
of MWS to maintain the road networks by a substantial amount.  Analysis of
anticipated benefits carried out using the Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model (HDM), took into account incremental increases in capital
construction costs and road maintenance costs, on the 'costs' side, and savings
in vehicle operating costs and travel time on the 'benefits' side. At appraisal,
the rates of return for individual unpaved roads rehabilitated under the program
were estimated to range from between 362 and greater than 500Z. Rates of return
for all the paved roads except one were estimated to be above 25* with the
highest being 111Z. Rates of return for the rehabilitation of specific paved and
unpaved roads (Table 6B) are within the ranges estimated at appraisal.
6.8         The project has had a substantial impact in the area of maintenance
management as noted by the development and nationwide implementation of MARMS and
the provision of training and equipment.   The institution of MARMS in a
relatively short time established a system of cost control and monitoring that
afforded the project large benefits and provided early warning of potential cost
overruns.
6.9         Major inroads in the development of the Northern Access Route were
made. The studies completed by consultants under this project were vital in the
preparation of the Northern Transport Corridor Project.  A formal agreement
between Malawi and Tanzania for the further development of this route has been
negotiated. Thus, dependence on the less secure routes through Mozambique, or
the longer southern routes, will be reduced; it further provides Malawi with
additional access for import/export traffic.
6.10        The labor-intensive aspect of DRIMP allowed the utilization of large
quantities of unskilled labor. However, the statutory wage increase (1282) in
1989, contributed to cost overruns.
6.11        The project had beneficial effects on the environment, namely,
reducing the potential for 'soil erosion, improving drainage, and cutting down on
vibration, dust, and noise.
6.12        In addition to low budget allocations for maintenance, the prolect
suffered as a result of poor MWS supervision in some instances and an under-
estimation of road damage at the time of inventory resulting in the reduction of
roads covered under the program for rehabilitation of unpaved roads and the
resealing program.



-9-
7.    Pro1ect Sustainability
7.1         The sustainability of the project hinges on continued Government
support, particularly in the provision of adequate funding to RD for maintenance.
In the long term, the technical assistance under the project will have the
greatest impact if it has promoted greater participation of Malawian
professionals in DRIMP and MARHS operations. Also, it is important that MWS be
given the freedom to retain high quality staff and deploy them as they see fit.
7.2         The importance of careful, contlaued monitoring of costs cannot be
overstated. It is essential that the computerization of commitments and
expenditures that facilitate this continue to be done.
7.3         It is clear that for the gains made under this project to continue,
regular routine and periodic maintenance of all road networks should be carried
out.   Proper supervision of works and crews and sound quality control are
important areas of focus. Although the Bank's financing of incremental costs on
a declining basis under this project lessened the budgetary burden, it is vital
that when Government assumes total responsibility for maintenance, that
allocations not only be adequate but timely.
7.4         On a preveative level, axle load control could play a significant
role in reducing repair and maintenance work done on road networks.
Sustainability of the benefits from this component will depend on rigorous
enforcement supported by fines and penalties appropriate for deterrence.
7.5         Completion of the international route via Karonga and Dar-es-Salaam
is viewed as providing an alternative route to the disruption-prone ones through
Hozambique. This project's contribution, as with those prior to it, has also
give. a boost to regional integration. Continued support for this endeavor by
both the Governments of Halawi and Tanzania should ensure accrual of benefits to
both countries long after cessation of World Bank support under the Northern
Transport Corridor Project.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1         The Bank continued to play a key role in the conception, preparation
and financing of projects that further both the goals of regional integration and
developing new access to the sea for Halawi. The appraisal mission noted the
importance of technical assistance to MWS and emphasized the need for training
of Malawians in the planning, management and maintenance aspects of the road
networks. Thus, the decision to make the recruitment of consultants to assist
and train HWS staff a condition of effectiveness, was sound.



- 10 -
8.2         Supervision missions were carried out regularly and were extremely
useful in critically reviewing project progress and facilitating implementation.
They also helped to identify problems and made recommendations to ensure the
long-term success of the project. For example, suggesting that an investigation
into causes of road failure be carried out with a view to MWS preventing those
problems from recurring, a suggestion which was implemented, was one of the key
contributions offered by Bank supervision missions.
8.3         The recommendation to extend the project closing date was practical
and allowed for the continuation of valuable assistance to MWS and for the
orderly closing of accounts.
8.4         The following lessons may be learned from the implementation of the
Fifth Highway Project:
a)    A. realistic  assessment of Government's  capability  to allocate
sufficient funding for maintenance is necessary during appraisal;
b)    Care needs to be taken to ensure that adequate supervision and
quality control are in place on time;
c)    The importance of a clearly defined role for technical assistance
and training of local people in key areas of planning, management
and maintenance to the success of the project;
d)    Flexibility in design to allow for the inclusion of elements that
will facilitate implementation of the project and enhance its
success; and
e)    The importance of a functional cost-monitoring system in the early
detection and containment of potential cost overruns.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1         There was full Borrower participation in the preparation of the
project and the identification of the need for National Maintenance Depots, as
the implementation of MARMS progressed, reflected the Borrower's cowmitment
tow-ards ensuring that road maintenance be effective and sustained. The decision
to bring the roads under the program for rehabilitation of earth and gravel roads
up to gravel standard, showed similar concern although it meant a reduction in
the length of roads covered under the pLogram.
9.2         The shortage of funds available to District Councils and MWS for
maintenance was a reflection of the economic situatioa of the country over the
course of the project.  In 1985, there were concerns that as a result of the
previous year's fuel crisis, funding shortfalls and thus, delays in project



- 11 -
implementation, would occur. This was not the case, however, as the Borrower
eased the anticipated financial constraints thereby allowing the timely awarding
of two contracts under the program for rehabilitation of paved roads, which
otherwise would have been postponed. Strictly speaking, however, the Borrower
did not entirely fulfill its commitment to provide adequate funds for maintenance
under the project.
10.  Prolect Relationship
10.1        The good working relationship between the Bank and the Borrower built
up over the course of previous projects in this sector continued. The
professional rapport between project management and supervision missions
facilitated timely identification of problems and helped in tackling them. The
consultants employed under the project carried out their duties professionally
and had a good deal to do with the success of the project.
11.   Consulting Services and Studies
11.1        The rec_uitment of consultants to assist MWS in the project was a
condition of effeciveness.  On the whole, the performance of the consultants
hired was satisfactory and they displayed a clear understanding of their roles
and functions. Needs-assessment services were provided to RD by a team of six
experts under this contract and recommendations were made as part of a
comprehensiva proposal.   A nine-man team of consultants assisted with the
implementation of recommendations put forward. Three main aims existed: i) the
training of Malawian staff for deployment in MARMS; ii) providing support for the
Road Planning Unit, and movement towards implementing the Bank's Highway Design
and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM); and iii) carrying out an inventory of
bridges and preparing a bridge maintenance and rehabilitation program. Under the
program for rehabilitation of earth and gravel roads, consultants assisted in
developing criteria for road classification and in designing procedural manuals
for staff.
11.2        Consultants carried out a study of road failure and provided MWS with
assistance in formulating plans to the avoid the occurrence of similar problems
in the future.
11.3        Technical assistance to EPD was provided for transport and economic
studies as well as a 3-year plan for the collection of traffic information.
Studies were carried out on the Rural Transport System, Lake Transport Services,
and on Tobacco Transportation.  Work was also carried out on the Prime Route
Policy. This program of assistance employed the services of a Transport Planner
(on secondment from the Bank) and provided for overseas training of staff from
the Planning Unit in areas of management and planning.



- 12 -
11.4        After completion of a management study of PVHO, a four-man team oif
consultants was engaged to provide assistance in its reorganization and
improvement. Proposals made included the institution of a preventive maintenance
program and of bulk ordering procedures.
11.5        The feasibility study of the Northern Access Route was successfully
completed in July of 1985. The final report provided considerable input in the
preparation of the Northern Transport Corridor Project (appraised in October of
1985).
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1        The Loan and Credit Agreements were adequate and straightforward and
were valuable tools for project management in the implementation process.
Amendments to the Project Description and Disbursement Schedule were required
after key components for MARMS, identified during the early stages of
implementation (see para 5.5) were included.
12.2        No  distinguishable  delays  were  experienced  in  submission  of
withdrawal  applications  and  progress  was  reported  on  regularly.    The
establishment and auditing of accounts were carried out as agreed at
negotiations. Consultation with the Bank was also carried out according to the
covenants of the Agreements.
