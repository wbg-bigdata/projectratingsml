STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORI SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Structure on Transport
1.01      Malawi is a long, narrow, landlocked country situated in the
Great  African Rift Valley, with a land area of about 94,300 km2 and a lake
area of 24,200 km2 (see Map IBRD 17178).  A major escarpment runs the
length of the country, separating the Lake Malawi plain from the plateau to
the west; altitudes range from about 60 m above sea level in the Shire
Valley in the south to over 2,500 m in the northern plateau. Rainfall
averages between 750 mm and 1,600 mm, but is much heavier in the high
plateau areas of Mulanje, Zomba, Viphya and Nyika (4%' of land area).  The
high rainfall and long rainy season in the mountainous areas, combined with
steep slopes and scarcity of naturally available gravels for road
construction and maintenance, render gravel roads uneconomic in those
areas.
1.02      Gross domestic product increased in real terms at the relatively
rapid rate of 5.5%O per year over the period 1964-82. Even so, per capita
GNP is an estimated US$210, and Malawi is classified by the United Nations
as one of the least developed countries in the world.
1.03      With a population of about 6.0 million, growing at an average
rate of 2.9%O p.a., Malawi has one of the highest population densities per
sq km of agricultural land (140 per km2) in Africa. However, development
in the country's three administrative regions has been unbalanced. Until
independence in 1964, most development was concentrated in the Southern
Region, which had the only rail link, most of the all-weather roads, the
administrative capital of Zomba and the main commercial center of
Blantyre. This fundamental imbalance, aggravated by the still inadequate
road access to the north, has caused the Northern Region to remain
isolated and   undeveloped, and it is still sparsely populated. At present,
almost three quarters of the total population lives in the southern half of
the country, and one of Government's main socioeconomic objectives, as set
out in the Statement of Development Policies (1971), is the promotion of
more balanced regional development. To this end, it has moved the
administrative capital some 250 km north from Zomba to Lilongwe, and has
initiated several agricultural development projects in the northern half
of the country, including major projects at Lilongwe, Salima, Karonga and
Viphya, and smaller projects around Kasungu and Mzimba. The road network
is also gradually being upgraded in the Central and Northern Regions, and
further development in these areas is underway and planned under the
National Rural Development Program.



- 2 -
1.04      Sin-e almost 90% of the population lives in rural areas, and
agrxculture colitributes over 90% of Malawi's exports, rural development is
a primary economic and social objective.  In addition to raising
agricultural productivity, it is seen as an effective vehicle for the
Government's policy of redistributing incomes in favor of the rural poor.
Although the most rapid growth in agricultural output in the past has been
achieved by private estates and discrete regional projects, since the start
of its National Rural Development Program irn the mid-1970s, Government has
increasingly supported agricultural development through minimum package
rural development projects with rather wide geographic coverage. The Bank
Group has given considerable support to this Program, and is currently
preparing for its fourth phase.
1.05      About 50% of Malawi's total land area is classified as forest
land, about 20%0 of which consists of forest reserves, administered by the
Ministry of Forestry and Natural Resources as protected government land.
Malawi's Forestry sector produces a limited number of forestry products:
sawn timber, veneer, plywood, poles and fuelwood. Annual production of
industrial roundwood from both state and private forests  is about 85,000
m3.   The wood is locally processed and largely absorbed by the domestic
market, as exports of forest products are negligible and some 20% of the
softwood requirements are imported. The Government is expanding the wood
processing industry and exploring the potential export market for wood
products in southern Africa.
B. The Transport System
1.06      Malawi's transport system consists of about 13,280 km of roads,
678 km of railways, 4 lake harbors and a number of landing points served
by a lake service, and 4 airfields served by domestic services. The
principal features of this system are: a main road network of about 2,900
k6, which is fairly well developed south of Lilongwe but less developed in
the northern half of the country; the rail system which lies entirely in
the southern half of the country and is primarily used for Malawi's exports
and imports and a small amount of Zambian transit traffic; lake transport
which mainly serves the north and compensates to some extent for the
limited land transport links; and air transport which handles mainly
passenger traffic. Roads dominate internal transport while the railway
carries most export-import freight. The main outlet to the sea for
Malawi's external trade historically has been by two railway lines through
Mozambique to the ports of Beira and Nacala on the Indian Ocean. In the
past two years, however, problems on the Mozambique lines have led to
considerable diversion, at significantly increased cost, of export/import
traffic to alternative routes, particularly through Zambia, Zimbabwe and
the Republic of South Africa.
Highways
1.07      The highway network is discussed in Chapter II.
Railways
1.08      The main railway line extends from the southern border northward
through Blantyre to Lake Malawi and then westward through Lilongwe to the
Zambian border. At the southern border this line is linked to the



- 3 -
Mozambique rail line serving the port of Beira. An extension of the Malawi
Railway to the eastern border connects with the Mozambique rail line
serving the port of Nacala. Rehabilitation of the southern part of the
line within Malawi has been underway during the last several years with
British aid and is expected to be completed by 1985. The extension
westward in recent years from Salima to the Zambian border (210 km),
financed by a grant from the Canadian Government, will soon be extended to
Chipata in Zambia (about 25 km). The Malawi Government would like to see
this line linked to the main railway line of Zambia but the construction of
such a costly 390 km link is unlikely in the foreseeable future.
1.09       Traffic carried on the railway in 1982 amounted to about 890,000
tons of freight or about 182 million ton-km. Traffic in terms of ton-km
has been declining by 7% p.a. since 1975 because of the slowdown in
imports since 1975 and exports since 1977, decreasing Zambian transit
traffic, and declining capabilities of the Mozambique rail lines. The
Malawi railway is operated more efficiently than many African railways and
until 1982 earned a modest net operating surplus. The number of passengers
carried on the railway increased to 1.5 million in 1982, the highest level
ever attained. Recently, however, it has experienced operating losses as
overall traffic has declined.
Lake Transport
1.10      Freight and passenger transport on Lake Malawi is provided by a
subsidiary of Malawi Railways, Lake Services Limited, which principally
serves the remote northern areas of the country. Twenty-one ports or
landings are served by the Lake Service fleet which consists of five
cargo/passenger vessels, six barges and oil pontoons, five tugs and one
timber pontoon. Traffic volumes are relatively light, amounting to about
37,000 tons of freight and some 111,000 passengers in 1978. The main
products transported by lake are petroleum products, rice and fertilizers.
At present, nearly 70%O of the traffic moves northbound from Chipoka, the
only port served by the railway; this pattern may change in the future as a
result of ongoing rural development projects in the north.  In most years,
the Lake Service has incurred operating losses.
Air Transport
1.11      Air transport within Malawi accounts for far less traffic than
other modes, and only four airports (Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Karonga)
have scheduled services. Even air traffic over long distances between the
north and the south is quite low, despite the poor quality of road
connections and slowness of lake transport. Until recently, Chileka
airport near Blantyre was the only airport that could accommodate medium
size, long-range jet aircraft. Chileka accounted for nearly 60%a of Malawi's
355,000 recorded passenger movements in 1978 and 80%o of passenger movements
at Chileka were international. In 1982 the Government completed
construction of a second international airport at Lilongwe. Full
international operation there was scheduled to begin in November 1983. Air
Malawi, a Government-owned airline, provides international services and all
scheduled domestic services. Several foreign airlines also provide
international services, and one local company and Air Malawi provide
unscheduled domestic services.



- 4 -
1.12      Air Malawi's passenger traffic of about seven millton passenger
kilometers in 1981 was about the same as in 1978. Air freight traffic, on
the other hand, has increased during the past few years because of
congested ports and poor rail service in Mozambique, and difficulty of
using other modes to transport goods between South Africa and Malawi.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
1.13      A transport crisis arose in 1982-83 when Mozambique rail lines
lost their ability to handle the normal level of transit traffic for
land-locked Malawi. As a result, the Malawi Government has faced a major
problem of facilitating the movement of export/import traffic over
alternative routes. The high cost of transport by these alternative routes
has had far-reaching economic consequences and therefore the Government
appointed in 1983 a transport specialist in the Ministry of Transport and
Communications to monitor internalional transport concerning Malawi's
external trade and to take appropriate steps to expedite movement of the
goods. He is also to make recommendations for achieving, over the longer
term, improved means of transport, such as developing a more economical
route between Malawi and Indian Ocean ports (para 1.16). Included in the
project are funds to finance a continuation of this specialist for a two
year period beyond an initial year- financed by UNDP and, possibly, USAID.
1.14      Since the beginning of the seventies, Malawi's transport policy
has had three broad aims: (a) to improve the administrative, social and
economic integration of the country by linking all three regions with
reliable all-weather connections; (b) to support rural development by
improving access to rural areas; and (c) to provide efficient links with
transport routes to the Indian Ocean seaports for exports and imports.
Substantial progress has been made on all of these objectives. In the case
of (c), however, as noted above great difficulties have been experienced on
transit services through Mozambique, problems beyond the control of the
Malawi Government. Within Malawi, Government ]Ls undertaking an extensive
transport development program; a number of transport studies have been
carried out or are in progress, and investments are either planned or
underway in all transport modes.
1.15      Government's overall sector priorities are given in its
"Statement of Development Policies 1971-1980," and are determined in more
detail in a 3-year rolling public sector investment program which is
revised annually during budget preparation. Investment in the transport
sector has been high during the last four years, representing an average of
34%/O of total Government capital expenditure. Pk large part of this
investment is represented by the railway extensions and development of the
Lilongwe International Airport. Although the Elank expressed reservations
about these projects, they were undertaken by Government, with the
assistance of external donors.
1.16      The Government has been deeply concerned about the vulnerability
of its principal route of access to the sea through Mozambique,
particularly in view of recent events which halted or substantially reduced
transit traffic. The same concern has prompted Government to request
financing under the present project for upgrading a portion of the
North-South road which links Malawi to Tanzania (para. 3.06). The European
Development Fund (EDF) recently financed a study of the international
transport routes available to Malawi; the study examined the transport
constraints to the development of the country as well as future changes in

improved transport routes in northern Malawi.  Ihe need for Malawi to have
more reliable access routes to the sea has been shown by a UNDP/UNCTAD
regional study1/ of transit transport in eight southern African countries,
including Malawi. The project includes funds for a transport system study
of a northern access route, which will include a new road link between
northern Malawi and the TAZARA/TANZAM2/ corridor (para. 3.09). The
planning and construction of such a link and the efficient use of the
international route will require cooperation between the Malawi and
Tanzania Governments. The study will, inter alia, evaluate the viability
of the split between transport modes in both countries, for example, of
using lake services for international traffic between the northern lake
port of Chilumba and other ports to the south, especially Chipoka. The
study will also consider other aspects of transport on the route, such as
customs procedures, and facilities in Dar es Salaam and at/or near the
Malawi-Tanzania border. Availability of truck and railway capacity will
also be studied. The Malawi Government has prepared an action program on
steps to be taken to open up the proposed route. As one of the first key
steps in the program, the Malawi Government has already in August 1983
reached agreement with the Tanzania Government on the proposed terms of
reference for the study. During negotiations, the Government and the Bank
reached agreement on the terms of reference and the action program (Item
III. J in Annex 8).
1.17      The Government's 3-year plan for FY1979-81 allocated 40%O of total
planned capital expenditures to the transport sector (Table 1.1), mainly
for the railway extension from Lilongwe to the Zambian border, the Lilongwe
International Airport, and main road construction. Although various donors
assisted with most of the new projects under the plan, some of these
projects were delayed or scaled down during the 3-year period due to
Government's inability to provide the required local funds (only 63%0' of the

amount planned for 1979/80 was actually allocated) and the Lack of
completed feasibility studies for some of the proposed projects.  The
percentage of total public investment represented by transport has declined
sharply from 51% in 1979 to about: 25% in 1983. This decrease was
attributable mainly to the completion of the railway and airport projects.
At negotiations, the Government and the Bank reviewed the proposed 1984-86
pubLic investment program, which was found to be reasonable in terms of
overall level of financing (around 30% of the development budget for the
transportation sector) and subsectoral allocations (roads about 80% of
expenditures followed by rail ancl aviation wi;:h about 10% each).
1.18       Coordination of transpcirt investmenl: plans is the responsibility
of the Transport Planning Unit (TPU) of the Economic Planning Division
(EPD) of the Office of the Presiclent and Cabinet which reviews proposals
put forward by the Ministry of Works and SupplLies (MWS) for roads and by
the Ministry of Transport and Communications (:MTC) for all other modes. In
practice, however, such coordination has not been satisfactory because of
EPD's Limited staffing (TPU is presently staffed by two professionals
only), and as a result the development of each mode has proceeded almost
independently of the others.  This is becomingI a problem since road
transport increasingly competes with the railways and lake transport. In
1980, Government therefore requested assistance in strengthening its
transport planning and coordination capability, and accordingly the Fourth
Highway Project provided EPD with technical assistance (one expert) for
transport planning as well as overseas training for local staff. The
technical assistance is helping Government, inter alia, to define and
establish an adequate system of transport planning and provide on-the-job
training for Malawian professional staff. Uncler the project, further
technical assistance will be provided to the 1ransport Planning Unit and
for various purposes including preparation of a future highway project
(para 3.09). The loan agreement for the proposed project contains a
covenant requiring that, prior to the adoption of the annual budget during
the project period, Government will discuss with the Bank the transport
investment program (para. 5.01(a).
D. Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.19       The Bank Group has been involved in Malawi's transport sector
since 1966 when Credit S-2-MAI was approved tc help finance detailed
engineering of the Zomba-Lilongwe road (290 kmi).  This was followed by the
First Highway Project (Credit 112-MAI, 1968, UIS$11.5 million) comprising
the reconstruction and bituminous paving of that road, the refinancing of
Credit S-2-MAI, and a consultants' study of road transport licensing
regulations and road-rail coordination.  A Performance Audit of the Project
(No. 946, December 15, 1975) concluded that all of the project's objectives
were achieved.  Construction costs were within appraisal estimates,
although the road was completed about one year behind schedule3/. Traffic
was greater than projected at appraisal, and the rate of return was
conservatively re-evaluated at l3%, compared with the appraisal estimate of
12%. The consultants' study recommended deregulating road transport,
raising axle load limits to 9 tons, improving transport statistics, and
relating rail tariffs more closely to economic factors, all of which have
been implemented, although there is scope for further refinement of rail
tariffs. The study expressed misgivings about planned rail projects, but
3/ The first contractor selected for the Zomba-Lilongwe road section was
unsatisfactory and had to be replaced, leading to the delay in



Government did not share IDA's reservations and proceeded with these
investments. Both the consultants' study and the Audit Report agreed that
the country might soon have an oversupply of transport services in the
Blantyre-Lilongwe-Zambian border corridor. The major recommendations of
the Audit called for closer project supervision by Bank staff and
rectifying the neglect of lower class roads--although the Audit did not
question the composition of the First Highway Project, noting that the
"Zomba-Lilongwe road . . . is undoubtedly the most important highway in
Malawi." Both of the recommendations made in the Audit Report are being
addressed under the Second, Third, Fourth and the present Fifth Highway
Projects and in the agricultural projects financed by the Bank Group.
1.20      The Second Highway Project (Credit 523-MAI, 1974, US$10
million) originally comprised construction of the Lilongwe-Kasungu road
(113 km) and a pilot scheme for the improvement and maintenance of district
roads serving rural development in the Kasungu District. Both components
have been completed, the construction in March 1978, a few months behind
schedule, and the pilot scheme in September 1978. Substantial cost savings
were made on the construction component which were used to finance
completion of the pilot scheme in Kasungu district and extension of the
scheme to three other districts, following the recommendations of a
consultants' study which evaluated the results of the pilot program. Ihe
four districts made up the first phase of a District Roads Improvement and
Maintenance Program (DRIMP) planned to cover all of Malawi's 24 districts
in three phases. This first phase was completed in September 1981.
According to the Project Completion Report, the economic rate of return is
now estimated at 23 percent compared with 14 percent at appraisal.
1.21      The Third Highway Project (Credit 758-MAI, 1977, US$10.5 million)
comprised construction of the Kasungu-Jenda road (85 km) and a feasibility
study and detailed engineering of the Jenda-Mzuzu road. The road
construction was completed in October 1980, a few months behind schedule,
and the detailed engineering in September 1980. The Project Completion
Report indicates that the quality of the physical components was
satisfactory, but due to the general deterioration in Malawi's economy in
recent years, the economic rate of return is now estimated at 8 percent
compared with 14 percent at appraisal. However, with the increased traffic
generated by linking Malawi to the TANZAM corridor, the traffic flows and
rate of return are expected to improve significantly.
1.22      The Fourth Highway Project (Credit 1099-MAI, 1981, SDR 25.9
million or about US$33.0 million equivalent) comprises construction of the
Jenda-Luwawa Turnoff road (32 km), the Mbowe-Mzuzu-Ekwendeni road (32km)
and spot improvements on the Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe road (about 100 km), the
second phase of DRIMP extending the scheme to 10 additional districts, a
comprehensive study of Malawi's road maintenance needs, provision of minor
road maintenance equipment, construction of a new training facility for
road personnel, technical assistance in transport planning for the Economic
Planning Division (EPD) of the Office of the President and Cabinet, and
overseas training of two of EPD's transport economists. The maintenance
study is complete and implementation of all of the other improvements is
well underway.
1.23      Finally, transport components have been included in IDA projects
in other sectors (Annex 1). Credit 5-17-MAI, 1974, provided US$2 million

for planning and engineering of infrastructure for the proposed Viphya
timber exploitation scheme. In addition, agricultural projects in the
Lower Shire Valley (Credits 114, :563 and 823-MAI), the Lilongwe (Credits
113, 244 and 550-MAI) and the Karonga (Credit 282 and Loan 1286-MAI) areas,
as well as the more widespread National Rural Development Project (Credits
857-MAI) have included improvement and construction of about 4,000 km of
feeder and crop extraction roads, while the Karonga Rural Development
Project also included port improvements at Chilumba and Chipoka on Lake
Malawi as well as procurement of a self-propelled barge for the lake
service.
1.24      The strategy for highway subsector development followed by the
Ministry of Works and Supplies over the past several years has been aimed
mainly at (i) construction of a basic road network with particular focus on
development of a main north-south road; (ii) irnprovement and maintenance of
district roads; and (iii) strengthening of maintenance of the main and
secondary road system.  The Bank'S Highway Projects I through IV have
accomplished much with regard to items (i) and (ii). The present project
will contribute significantly to the realization of all three objectives
(para. 3.01).

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The classified road network totals about 13,280 km (Table 2.1) of
which some 2,520 km (about 19%) are paved, and 390 km are of engineered
gravel standard; the rest are earth roads and tracks. In addition, there
are about 2,000 km of as yet unclassified feeder and crop extraction roads
constructed to minimum all-weather standard under agricultural development
projects and an undetermined length of unclassified earth roads and tracks,
including about 800 km within forestry plantations and reserves and about
800 km within the national parks. Road density is about 141 km per 1,000
sq km or 2.2 km per 1,000 inhabitants, which is above average for East
African countries. The coverage of the network is adequate for the
country's present needs, but its standards and conditions are not
satisfactory. Although some improvement has been made, principally by
upgrading roads to paved standard (Table 2.2), low standard roads prevail,
resulting in high transport costs. About 85%o of the paved and improved
roads are located in the southern half of the country, reflecting the
general pattern of regional imbalance.

2.02      Some 1,790 km, or 63°% of the main roads, connecting principal
cities and towns, are paved. Dur:Lng the last Few years, construction of
paved roads has been concentrated on the 1,100 km north-south spine road,
the most important road in Malawi, running from Bangula in the deep south
to Karonga in the far north (see Map 17177). '#hen ongoing projects are
completed in 1984, some 1,010 km of that road will have been paved to a
satisfactory standard. The project would increase this length to about
1,060 km. Government has also started reconstruction of old, narrow
pavements; over 100 km of main roads were reconstructed during 1976/79, and
about 110 km of secondary roads connecting smaller communities to the main
roads, are under reconstruction. Further improvements of the secondary
network are being prepared (para. 2.22). Some 1,100 km of the long
neglected district roads were improved under the first phase of DRIMP
(para. 1.20) and some 2,400 km are being covered under the program's second
phase. The third, and last, phase is included in the project.
B. Road Use
Vehicle Fleet
2.03      In 1981, the latest year' for which complete vehicle fleet
information is available, the vehLcle fleet (excluding motorcycles, farm
tractors, trailers and self-prope:Lled, pneumatic-tired construction
equipment) totalled about 27,600 or 4.6 vehiclies per 1,000 inhabitants,
much lower than the 32 vehicles per capita in Zimbabwe but about average
for East Africa. The fleet includes about 14,100 passenger cars, 300 buses
and 13,600 goods vehicles, with the balance made up of 6,700 motorcycles
and 7,200 other vehicles.  About 175% of all vehicles are registered in the
Southern Region, reflecting the general pattern of economic development.
Over the period 1978-82, the tota-L fleet increased with the number of goods
vehicles growing much faster than cars. One positive development with
regard to fuel efficiency is that motorcycles have become a popular means
of private transportation. Motor vehicle registrations over the period
1978-1982 are shown in table 2.3; these are thie best available statistics
suggesting changes in the size of the motor vehicle fleet. Unfortunately,
the data do not accurately reflect. the actual Fleet because some vehicles
are registered twice a year and for other reasons. The Government is
presently seeking to improve its statistics on the motor vehicle fleet.
2.04      More than two-thirds of the goods vehicles have less than a 3-ton
carrying capacity, a large portion of which are 4-wheel drive vehicles.
Only 3%' of the goods vehicles, ma:Lnly owned by companies involved in
international movement of freight, have more than a 10-ton capacity, and
truck-trailer combinations are corimon on the main routes.  Ninety-seven
percent of goods vehicles over 3 tons have a relatively low average
capacity of 7 tons, partly because most shipmenits of agricultural produce
are relatively small.

Traffic
2.05      There were no systematic traffic counts in Malawi until 1974
when, following an agreement reached during negotiations of the Second
Highway Project, Government instituted a system of automatic counts
supplemented by periodic manual counts at a number of strategic points on
the road network. The counts are conducted by the Transport Unit of the
National Statistical Office in Zomba. The census indicates that between
1974 and 1978 traffic increased by about 3%0. The census should be used
with caution, since results of the automatic and periodic countings are
often inconsistent, indicating a need for improved counting operations.
From 1979 onwards available traffic data indicates no clear trend in Malawi
but the number of registered vehicles was almost static, fuel consumption
fell and GDP growth was restrained. It is concluded, therefore, that there
has been little or no traffic growth since 1978. Traffic volumes on main
roads vary considerably between the south, where traffic is mostly in the
range of 200-600 vehicles per day (vpd) (although parts of the main
north-south road and the Lilongwe-Salima road have over 1,000 vpd), and the
north with far lower traffic levels, mostly in the 40-130 vpd range.
Traffic on secondary and district roads averages about 30 vpd. Overall
traffic on Malawi's roads is lower than that in Kenya and comparable to
that in Zambia, where traffic on paved roads is about 400 vpd and on earth
roads about 20 vpd.
Road Transport
2.06        The great majority of trucks are owned by various private and
public agencies for transport of their own goods. Among transport
companies hiring out their vehicles, about 470 companies operate an
aggregate fleet of some 1,400 trucks of 3 ton capacity and over. More
than 60%0 of these trucks are owned by small operators, and 34°o by 9 large
operators with over 30 vehicles each. The average size of the for-hire



- 12 -
fleet operated by small operators is 3 vehicles with an average capacity
of 7 tons, compared to 9 tons operated by the 'Large companies.
2.07      Road transport licenses are awarded by the Road Traffic
Commissioner's Office within MTC, and are given for specific routes. In
theory, freight rates are regulated by MTC, and at present maximum rates
are 13.6 tambala per ton-km for paved roads and 17.8 tambala per ton-km
for earth and gravel roads; the Aciricultural Development and
Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) is not bound to pay these rates for bulk
shipments on the Blantyre-Lilongwe!-Mzuzu road. In practice it appears that
these rates serve as maximum tariffs, and on most routes competition among
road transporters leads to charges lower than the regulated rates.
However, maximum rates are established since transporters on a number of
routes are in a monopoly situatior. Government tries to ensure that
regulated maximum rates are kept at a reasonable level by periodically
revising rates, based on costs kept by one of the larger companies, United
Transport (Malawi), and research into vehicle ciperating costs.
2.08      Road passenger services are provided by United Transport
(Malawi), and a few small local operators. Of the total fleet of over 200
buses, 170 are licensed for public service and these operate on over 150
routes. The services are mainly concentrated in urbanized areas and along
the main roads with long distances between scheduled stops, and until
recently large buses with passenger capacity of 40-50 people were being
used. In the early 1980's the Government allowed the introduction of
mini-buses with 15-20 passenger capacity on an experimental basis in three
urban areas, and limited to a 25 km radius from the urban center.
Provision of public transport services along secondary and district roads
is virtually non-existent. The Government is now considering to hasten
development of low-cost transport services in rural areas, using cheap,
fuel-efficient small vehicles of the pick-up type commuter to accommodate
both passengers and goods. The Government wishes to conduct a brief
consultants study of the various financial, operational, technical, and
road safety aspects associated with the introduction of this kind of
service. The study will be combined with a bus management study for United
Transport (Malawi), for which the Government will receive financial and
technical assistance from Germany. This study is scheduled to begin in mid
1984.
Vehicle Regulations
2.09      Vehicle dimension and we:Lght regulations are adequate (maximum
allowable axle load being nine tons), but enforcement by MTC's Road Traffic
Commissioner's Office and the national police was generally lax up to 1976
when pavement failures noted at that time on thte Lilongwe-Zomba road were
attributed to overweight Zambian trucks, then carrying considerable freight
to and from the railhead at Balaka.  IDA missions thereafter emphasized the
importance of adequate enforcement, as required under the Credit Agreement
for the Second Highway Project. Government subsequently opened three
weigh-bridges installed at strategic points in the South and Central
Regions, and enforcement improved considerably. While the much reduced
Zambian truck traffic now terminates at the new railhead at the Zambian
border, Malawian firms increasingly use large trucks on paved trunk roads.
Strong enforcement of axle load limits should therefore be expanded to
other parts of the country; toward this end, appropriate regulations are
being developed and the project will help strencthen enforcement
capabilities by provision of mobile scales and vehicles for police patrols
(nara 3.10).

Road Safety
2.10      The toll of road accidents in Malawi is heavy. Some road accident
data, compiled from reports prepared by the Malawi Police Force, are given
in Table 2.4.
2.11      Available information on road accidents suggests some
inconsistencies between the numbers of accidents reported and the numbers
which actually occur. The most reliable of the statistics are those for
fatalities, but even these probably understate the extent of vehicle
fatalities. Some general conclusions can be inferred:
(a)  in relation to population and road use, the number of road
fatalities in Malawi is about the norm for the developing
countries;
(b) the rate of fatalities per 1,000 vehicles decreases with
increased vehicle ownership (number of vehicles per 10,000
inhabitants).
(c)  between 1969 and 1982 road use has approximately doubled.  Over
this period the number of vehicles reported to be involved in
accidents has increased by less than 50%. But the number of
road fatalities, a somewhat more reliable statistic, has
increased by over three times; and
(d)  the ratio of fatalities to injuries, normally 1 to 10 or more
in most developing countries, has increased rapidly over the
years; it was about 1 to 10 from 1967 to 1971, increased to 1 to
8 during 1977, to 1 to 4 during 1978 and 1979, and to 1 to 2.6 in
1982.
2.12      The increase in the rate of fatal accidents over the last several
years is probably due to the rapidly increasing length of the bituminized
road system. This is of considerable concern to Government, which is
planning to address the problem by improved education and enforcement of
regulations as well as identification of "black spots" (short sections of
road with high accident occurrence) and the improvement of roads in these
areas.
2.13      Road use and traffic regulations are contained in the Road
Traffic Act of 1969, with several amendments and expansions of the Act
having been made over the years. The Act contains the usual regulations on
vehicle sizes and axle loads, speed limits, driving instruction schools and
licences, insurance, road service permits, regular inspection and testing.
Licensing and vehicle inspection, annually for all goods vehicles and for
all other vehicles over 10 years old, are the responsibility of MTC's Road
Traffic Commissioner's Office; enforcement of traffic regulations is the
responsibility of the Police Force's Traffic Section who patrol trunk
roads, but lack capacity for strict enforcement.
2.14      Government established a National Road Safety Council (NRSC) in
1978 to coordinate road safety measures and activities at the national
level. Members of NRSC are drawn from the Ministries of Transport and
Communications, Trade, Industry and Tourism, Health, Justice, Education and

Works and Supplies as well as from non-governmental organizations. Funds
allocated to NRSC have been limited, and its activities to date have mainly
consisted of twice weekly radio broadcasts on road safety. The Council is
planning increased propaganda activities, e.g., seminars and film shows as
well as the introduction of traffic education in primary and secondary
schools. In addition, the Finnish Government, according to the MTC, will
soon sponsor a road safety study and provide assistance in implementing
recommendations of the study. During supervision of the project, the
Bank1/ will monitor the situation and maintain a dialogue with
Government. If proposed measures do not produce adequate results, we would
seek to define more clearly how IDA resources can be usefully employed in
future projects to assist the Government in reducing the toll of road
accidents.
Road User Revenue
2.15      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and
duties on fuel, lubricants, vehicles and spare parts, and through license
and registration fees. At the time of appraisal in February 1983, the pump
price of petrol was 91.9 tambala per liter and of diesel, 88.2 tambala per
liter; equivalent import prices are 38.5 tambala and 38.3 tambala,
respectively. Shown in Table 2.5 is a comparison of wholesale prices of
fuel (including duty, special levy and surtax) in December 1980 and
February 1983; retail prices are 5% higher. Petroleum product prices,
including taxes, more than cover CIF costs and internal distribution costs,
as indicated in table 2.5. Government has traditionally followed a
realistic and sensible policy with regard to pricing these products2/.

Duties on vehicles range from 5°o for buses and trucks up to 40%o for high
value cars.  There are surtaxes of 24°o on fuel and 18%o on all vehicles
except buses and trucks over 3 tons. As shown in table 2.6 total revenue
from road users was about US$20.2 million in FY 1978 and is estimated at
about US$ 59.0 million for FY 1981.

Present expenditures on administering and maintaining the road network,
including the costs of the Road Traffic Commissioner's Office, amount to
some US$ 6.5 million. Thus, road user revenues are satisfactory as they
more than cover maintenance expenditures and the capital costs of the
network.
C. Administration and Training
2.16      MWS is responsible for all classified roads except district
roads, which are the responsibility of the district councils. MWS is also
gradually taking over responsibility for maintenance of 2,000 km of feeder
roads being constructed under several agricultural development projects;
these roads are expected to become the districts' responsibility as the
district councils gain sufficient road maintenance capacity. The Ministry
of Forestry and National Resources is responsible for the 1,600 km of
forestry and national park roads ancl tracks. No authority is responsible
for the undetermined length of unclassified earth tracks (para. 2.01), but
the most important of these, tracks Eire expected to be classified as
district roads over the next few years. MWS is organized according to its
three functions (see Chart 1): administration is carried out by departments
for administration, finance, personnel, stores and auditing; engineering is
done by the departments for design, building and roads; and development,
the most recently established department, still has rather vague
responsibilities but will increasingly be concerned with planning. Road
planning and overall supervision are handled by the headquarters' staff at
Lilongwe.  MWS has offices in each of the three regions, which are directly
responsible for field operations for roads and other works. In addition,



- 17 -
these regional offices have 4 branch offices, 14 district depots and 48
subdistrict depots for road maintenance. The Ministry has a Plant and
Vehicle Hire Organization (PVHO) with workshops in all regions and in inosL
districts with a central workshop in Blantyre for major repairs.
2.17      MWS has some 100 professional staff, about 400 subprofessional
and supervisory staff and about 1,300 other salaried staff; its Roads
Department has 14 civil engineers, one electrical engineer, and two
economists. The Ministry has in the past been administered by senior
expatriate staff, financed by ODA of UK; these are gradually being replaced
by Malawians as they acquire the education and experience needed. The
present salaried staff of about 1,800 includes 67 expatriates; in 1980 the
number of expatriates was 105 and in 1977 it was 135. Of the 50 most
senior posts filled by expatriates in 1980, 23 are now filled by Malawians;
and only 7 of the Road Department's 17 professional staff are expatriates.
The Roads Department has recently increased its number of posts for
professionals to 25, in preparation for increased emphasis on road
maintenance and planning; the new posts are expected to be filled by
Malawians graduating from the Malawi Polytechnic during the next few years
or temporarily by expatriates. For experienced engineers and other
technical personnel, the private sector offers better salaries and thus
Government has some difficulty competing with private firms.
2.18      Until about 1978 the rate of localization was relatively slow and
expatriates were replaced only when well-qualified Malawians had acquired
substantial experience; this ensured the long-standing high standard of
efficiency of all departments of MWS. Since 1978 ODA has been reducing its
financial assistance for expatriate staff in MWS and the accelerated rate
of localization has imposed an increasing burden on management of many of
MWS's functions; planned expansion of road maintenance, more attention to
planning and the administration of DRIMP until about 1990 will strain
management still further. The proposed project will therefore provide
substantial technical assistance to MWS (para. 3.09).
2.19      Although each of the 24 district councils has a road foreman on
its staff and a few councils have a core of road employees, their
administration for road improvement and maintenance has been weak. DRIMP
was designed to overcome this problem by providing for the establishment of
an organizational framework, training of key staff, and the provision of
equipment and depot facilities. The concept was successfully tested under a
pilot scheme in Kasungu District (para. 1.20) where the maintenance
organization is now fully operational under the full responsibility of the
District Council.
2.20      The Government has an active program for selecting, educating and
training nationals for professional positions, but the program has not yet
met the demand for qualified personnel, mainly because of the scarcity of
suitable candidates. Training abroad is provided with external assistance,
mainly from the U.K., the European Economic Community (EEC) and the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP). For instance, during 1978 about 220
trainees in all categories returned to Malawi, 25 with professional degrees
and 30 from post-graduate training; at the end of 1978 about 600 Malawians
were studying overseas, 65 for professional degrees and 95 in post-graduate
courses. Opportunities for training overseas are sufficient for the number
of suitably qualified candidates, and as the University of Malawi
Polytechnic develops its capacity in the technical fields, the need for



- 18 -
overseas training of engineers will gradually diminish except for
post-graduate courses. Good progress has also been made in training lower
echelon personnel, such as road supervisors, foremen, equipment operators
and mechanics, at the Ministry's fully localized Training Branch in Zomba.
While the training program, the quality of training, and the availability
of staff to be trained are adequate, the capacity of the Traininq Branch is
now fully utilized. In Lilongwe, MWS is developing a new training center
which will ultimately replace the center in Zomba. This change is needed
because of convenient MWS supervision of training activities in Lilongwe as
well as the opportunity to use MWS's professionals as part-time
instructors. The Lilongwe center also will permit the use of existing
facilities (design and surveying divisions, materials and soils laboratory)
in Lilongwe for training purposes. Initially, the center will provide
facilities for the training of road construction and maintenance
personnel. The Fourth Highway Froject is assisting in financing facilities
(class-rooms, dormitories and staff housing) required for the training of
about 50 Roads Department staff annually. The present project will finance
furniture, teaching aids and equipment (item III. A in Annex 8), the cost
of which could not be covered urnder the Fourth Highway Project because the
bids for civil works were higher than estimated (para 3.08). The first
phase of the new training center is expected to be in operation in early
1984.
D.  Planning and Financing
2.21      As stated in para. 1.18, MWS is responsible for road planning but
has limited capacity for this wcrk. All major projects are, however,
preceded by feasibility studies carried out by consultants. Most of this
work is done by international consultants as local consulting services are
in an early stage of development. Government's need for assistance in
transport planning, including that for roads, will be addressed under the
proposed project by the provisinn of technical assistance and training
(para. 3.09).
2.22      A summary of current and planned road projects is presented in
Table 2.7.   Most of the projects are in the Central and Northern Regions,
reflecting Government's general strategy of promoting development in those
regions. Main road projects, accounting for over 50%O of current and
planned road expenditure, are mainly devoted to improvement of the
north-south and lakeshore roads, and roads linking Malawi to Mozambique and
Zambia. Road improvements are being carried out under DRIMP (for district
roads), a small Key Rural Road F'rogram (for all classes of roads), and an
Upgrading of Secondary Roads Program. The latter, financed by the Canadian
Government, began with a study of the secondary road system which was
completed in early 1983.
2.23      Government is planning, with UNDP assistance, a Village Access
Road Program including construction/improvements of 1,134 km of village
access roads, 286 road bridges, 234 footbridges and 32 km of footpaths for
a total cost of some US$5.5 million to be financed by United Nations
Capital Development Fund (UNCDFK together with UNDP but executed on a
self-help basis.   The program i.s designed to relieve problems of access
where no classified road connects villages with local markets, health
centers and schools. Execution of the program is expected to start in
1984, covering the Northern Region in the first stage, and take several
years to complete.

2.24      Highway expenditures are financed from the general budget or, for
new construction, from the development accoun't which is largely made up of
grants and credits from bilatera:L and multilateral aid programs.
Expenditures on construction have averaged about US$ 25 million equivalent
annually over the past four years (para. 1.17), while MWS's maintenance
expenditures have averaged about MK 4 million in recent years (Table 2.8).
Maintenance funds prior to 1983 have been insufficient to maintain the
aging network (para. 2.29).  Thev have been increased for 1983 and will be
further increased in the future (para 3.05).

E. Engineering
2.25      The Design Department of MWS is staffed by 12 civil engineers and
25 technicians and surveyors. The Department has a well-equipped
laboratory for materials and soils testing and is primarily engaged in
design of structures; it carries out preliminary investigations and road
and bridge designs, but engineering for major road projects is done by
consultants. The design standards adopted by the MWS (Annex 2) are
appropriate for the country's topographic and traffic conditions.
F. Construction
2.26      For major road projects, the Roads Department employs
contractors, following suitable prequalification and tendering procedures;
contracts are generally let on a unit-price basis. In recent years, the
Roads Department has undertaken several minor force account road
construction projects (about US$3 million equivalent annually) with three
road construction units (one in esach region) and one bridge construction
unit; the performance of the uniis has been satisfactory with
labor-intensive methods generally employed for construction of culverts,
drains and structural excavation. In addition, MWS operates three units
for the improvement of district roads under DRIMP; the first phase of DRIMP
concerning improvements of 1,100 km of roads in four districts began in



- 21 -
1979 on the basts of intermediate technology but have increasingly, and
with good results, involved labor-intensive methods, presently with about
3,500 laborers employed. The second phase of DRIMP covers nine distficts
and about 2,600 km of roads; work has been completed in five districts and
is underway in another four. The third and last phase of DRIMP, covering
the remaining 11 districts and about 1,900 km or roads, will be financed
under the present project (para. 3.03).
2.27      The developing domestic contracting industry is nearly fully
employed on buildings, small structures, estate and other minor roads, as
well as resealing of short sections of main roads and of runways of minor
airfields. Domestic contractors lack the capacity for major road works,
but would be capable of carrying out some rehabilitation work on earth and
gravel roads (para. 3.16). Foreign contractors have shown considerable
interest in working in Malawi and all major construction works have been
undertaken by foreign firms. Private Malawian firms have lately been
acquirinq holdings (up to 49°0) in local branches of foreign contracting
firms. Senior domestic contractor personnel are largely drawn from MWS,
whose training facilities (para. 2.20) therefore perform a useful function
in indirectly training contractor personnel. Construction supervision is
carried out by the Roads Department or by consulting engineers acting as
its representatives. Supervision is satisfactory, payment procedures are
prompt, and, in general, the experience of MWS in dealing with contractors
has been satisfactory.
G. Maintenance
2.28      The Regional Divisions of the MWS are responsible for maintaining
the classified road system with the exception of district roads. Each of
the regions has a small but well trained cadre of maintenance personnel.
Maintenance operations are largely mechanized, although extensive use is
made of labor for routine maintenance. The Roads Department rents
equipment from the Plant and Vehicle Hire Organization (also under MWS),
which is responsible for procuring and maintaining all Government-owned
equipment and vehicles; rental rates are based on the cost of purchasing
and maintaining the equipment. Equipment availability and utilization
rates have been deteriorating but are expected to improve as new equipment
and technical assistance provided in the project are implemented.
2.29      Until a few years ago maintenance of main and secondary roads  in
Malawi was fairly good, much better than in most other East African
countries. However, while the funds allocated to MWS for recurrent road
maintenance have increased by about 10% annually, the current high
inflation rate and the rapid increases in the length of the improved
network have now caused the funds to be barely sufficient for routine
maintenance and therefore periodic maintenance has been neglected. The
proposed project will assist the Government in improving road maintenance
substantially (para. 3.05).
2.30      A road maintenance study was carried out by consultants Renardet
S.A. (Switzerland) in 1982 covering all of the classified network of main
and secondary roads as well as township roads and streets. The main
conclusions of the study were:



- 22 -
(a) the regular routine and periodic maintenance
activities of MWS were found deficient both in
quantity and quality and would require substantial
increases of funds and improvements in operations
and management;
(b)  due to the inadequate regular maintenance a
sizable backlog of periodic maint;enance had been
accumulating in recent years and many road
sections are now beyond repair by such
maintenance.  The st;udy identified 663 km of paved
roads that would recluire reconstruction/
rehabilitation/resealing and over 1,730 km of
gravel and earth roads that needed improvements.
2.31      The consultants made recommendations of actions required to
arrest the deteriorating maintenance operations and to overcome the
backlog. For this purpose they developed a 5-year comprehensive maintenance
program which includes the following main items:
(a) improved routine anci periodic maintenance
operations by inter alia increased budget
allocations; improved equipment availability
through provision of not only new equipment but
also technical assistance to MWS' PVH0 to improve
its management and operations; irnproved field
operation through better planning and preparation
by provision of technical assistance to MWS's
regional offices and improved equipment
utilization and increased training;
(b)  a program for the 663 km of paved roads comprising
resealing by double bituminous surface dressing
(DBST) of 138 km; asphaltic concrete (AC) overlays
on 23 km; new base course and DBST on 439 km; new
base course and AC overlays on 365 km; and full
reconstruction of 27 km; and
(c)  a program for the 1.733 km of gravel and earth
roads comprising: full regravelling of 429 km and
spot gravelling of about 1,200 krn; and improved
side and cross drainage and formation work on
1,733 km.
The consultants have prepared design and tender documentation for the work
included in the first year rehabilitation program. In addition, the
consultants have prepared specifications and bidding documents for
procurement of equipment, and stanclard documents suitable for local
tendering of rehabilitation work on earth and gravel roads.
2.32      Due to the difficult economic and fiscal situation in Malawi the
consultants' program has to be somewhat constrained and scaled down.  After
discussions with Government and Bank officials it was decided that the
level of regular maintenance in FYB3/84 would be agreed at about BO°o of



- 23 -
that recommended by the consultants and that budget allocations would be
increased in real terms by 3MO for each of the three following years and by
5%,0 thereafter for the following two years, thus reaching the recommended
level in about five years. These increases were confirmed by the
Government during negotiations. It was also decided that the resealing/
rehabilitation/reconstruction of paved roads would be stretched over seven
years instead of the five years recommended and that the rehabilitation/
improvement of gravel and earth roads would be completed in four years
instead of the planned five years.
2.33      Although Government has traditionally supplemented the district
councils' limited funds for recurrent maintenance by providing an annual
light grading to the most important district roads, the major portion of
the district roads network was neglected prior to the start of DRIMP under
the IDA-financed Second Highway Project. Under an initial pilot project in
the Kasungu District, an improvement and maintenance unit was established
which assumed responsibility for all maintenance operations of the Kasungu
district council and trained its roads staff as well as introduced road
foremen from all 24 districts to the scheme. The pilot scheme was
successful and was subsequently extended to three additional districts.
This first phase of DRIMP, also financed under the Second Highway Project,
and completed in September 1981 included the establishment of maintenance
units in each district, improvement of about 1,100 km of district roads to
a maintainable but minimum all-weather standard, and the training of key
district council staff both on-the-job and at the Zomba training center.
It also included the establishment of three improvement units equipped with
heavy graders, which supplement the maintenance units in each district
during the improvement phase. Improvement works were mostly carried out by
intermediate technology but labor-intensive methods were used on a 50 km
demonstration project and proved successful. Ihese methods are being
increasingly used under the ongoing second phase of DRIMP, financed under
the Fourth Highway Project, which extends the program to ten additional
districts with improvement of another 2,400 km of roads (para. 3.03).
2.34      The establishment of DRIMP and the improvement works are being
implemented by MWS with some assistance from consultants because of MWS's
staff constraints. As this stage is completed in each district, the
facilities and trained staff are turned over to the district councils so
that they can improve their mostly labor-intensive effort to effectively
take over full responsibility for the district roads. MWS, however,
supervises maintenance operations in each district during the first three
years of improved maintenance. Recurrent maintenance costs are
supplemented by the Government as district councils' revenues are very
limited. The Fourth Highway Project is assisting Government by providing
financing on a declining basis for the incremental portion of the recurrent
maintenance costs during the project period. This assistance will continue
under the present project (para. 3.04).

III. Ihe Project
A. Objectives
3.01      The main objectives of t:he project are to assist the Government
in (a) further achieving a balanced pattern of economic and social growth
by continuing to provide for improvements and nnaintenance of district
roads; (b) improving the maintenance of main and secondary road networks;
(c) further promoting the general strategy of dieveloping the economic
potential of the northern half of the country; and (d) assess alternative
routes for handling Malawi's export/import traffic. More specifically, the
project is designed to:
(a)  extend DRIMP, which was initiated under the Second
Highway Project and continued under the Fourth
Highway Project;
(b)  redress the country's deteriorated road
maintenance performance;
(c)  continue the upgrading of a section of the
north-south road to paved standard;
(d)  strengthen the management capabilities of MWS;
(e)  study a proposed northern access route to the
Indian Ocean; and
(f)  strengthen the Transport Planning Unit in the EPD.
B. Project Scope
3.02      The project consists of:
(a)  the third, and last phase of DRIMP;
(b)  implementation of a four year maintenance program
for the main and secondary road networks
including:
(i)  resealing/rehabilitation/reconstruction of
paved roads;
(ii)  rehabilitation of earth and gravel roads; and
(iii) provision of maintenance equipment for MWS's
Roads Department;
(c) construction of a two lane bituminous-paved road
between Luwawa Turnoff and Champhoyo (50.1 km);
(d)  provision of weighbridges and vehicles for axle
load control;



- 25 -
(e)  provision of furniture, training aids and
equipment for MWS's new training center in
Lilongwe;
(f)  consultancy services for:
(i) assistance to MWS in preparing and carrying out (a)
above;
(ii) assistance to MWS to prepare and carry out (b)
above, including the design and supervision of
b (i);
(iii) design of (c) above (through PPF);
(iv) supervision of (c) above;
(v) transport system study for a northern access
route;
(vi)  preparation of future projects;
(vii) assistance to Transport Planning Unit of EPD.
(viii) assistance to PVHO in strengthening equipment fleet
management.
C. Detailed Project Description
Third Phase of DRIMP
3.03      The project will extend the ongoing second phase of DRIMP to the
remaining eleven districts of the country (map II), one of which (Thyolo
District) has been transferred from the Fourth Highway Project to the
proposed project because of insufficient funds in the earlier project.
Selection of roads for improvement and planning for maintenance units in
these remaining districts were carried out by the consultants, Scott Wilson
Kirkpatrick and Partners (UK). Depots and facilities to be provided and a
list of roads to be improved during the first year of the program were
agreed with Government at negotiations (para. 5.01 (c)); the work program
for subsequent years is to be agreed with Government not later than four
months before the beginning of each fiscal year until the completion of the
component (para. 5. 01 (c)). The project provides for the establishment of
maintenance units in each district including the provision of a depot, sub-
depots where necessary, housing for key staff and light equipment (Item
III. B in the project file, Annex 8). An extension of MWS headquarters to
accommodate the new rural roads division will also be constructed under the
project. In addition, it will provide for the improvement of some 1,900 km
of district roads under the jurisdiction of the district Councils in these
last eleven districts. Lists of roads to be improved are in the project
file (Item III. C in Annex 8). These works are to be carried out by the
three improvement units established under Phase I of the programme and the
eleven maintenance units to be set up under Phase III of DRIMP.
Implementation of the third phase should start immediately following
completion of the second phase in mid to late 1984. In order to avoid



- 26 -
disruptions in implementing road improvement works, depots and housing for
key staff in the first 2-3 districts of the third phase should be completed
at that time, thus work on depots and housing must start as soon as the
Loan/Credit become effective.
3.04      Maintenance of the district roads, subsequent to improvements,
is to be undertaken by the district councils using the facilities provided,
and staff trained, under the project. While Government has in the past
provided the district councils with some assistance for recurrent
maintenance (para.2.33), regular maintenance of the improved network
requires substantial and increasing Government, assistance. Under DRIMP's
second phase the Government agreed to assist the District Councils by
providing grants to supplement the Councils' revenues available for road
maintenance, in amounts sufficient to bring the total up to the recurrent
maintenance cost for each district as annually assessed by MWS.  Government
disbursements are tied to output which in turn requires supervision by
MWS's regional offices.   Because of the country's difficult economic and
fiscal situation and because Government concurrently needed to increase its
allocations for recurrent mainterance of main and secondary roads, the
Fourth Highway Project is providing financing on a declining basis for the
incremental portion of the recurrent maintenance costs of roads that have
been improved under the first two phases of DRIMP. As the economic
situation is still difficult this assistance will be continued through the
period of the project; the system of assistance and the appropriate
allocations needed during the project period (Item III. D in Annex 8) were
agreed with Government during negotiations, while the appropriateness of
the agreed allocations would be discussed annually by Government and the
Bank on the basis of MWS' updated estimates of funds required by the
district councils (para. 5.01 (d)).
Maintenance of Main and Secondary Roads
3.05      The project will assist in financing the following high priority
maintenance activities and related items during the first four years of the
five year constrained program (para 2.32):
(a) equipment (including spares and workshop tools and
equipment) for routine and periodic maintenance;
(b) a resealing program of single bituminous surface treatment
(SBST) for about 400 km of paved roads as part of MWS
periodic maintenance activities;
(c) a rehabilitation program for 67 km of paved roads
including:
(i)  resealing by DBST of 5 km;
(ii) AC overlays oF 46 km;
(iii) new base course and DBST of 4 km;
(iv) new base course and AC overlay of 3 km; and
(v)  full reconstruction of 9 kin;



- 25 -
(e)  provision of furniture, training aids and
equipment for MWS's new training center in
Lilongwe;
(f)  consultancy services for:
(i) assistance to MWS in preparing and carrying out (a)
above;
(ii) assistance to MWS to prepare and carry out (b)
above, including the design and supervision of
b (i);
(iii) design of (c) above (through PPF);
(iv) supervision of (c) above;
(v) transport system study for a northern access
route;
(vi)  preparation of future projects;
(vii) assistance to Transport Planning Unit of EPD.
(viii) assistance to PVHO in strengthening equipment fleet
management.

3.05      The project will assist in financincl the following high priority
maintenance activities and related items during the first four years of the
five year constrained program (para 2.32):
(a) equipment (including spares and workshop tools and

(v)  full reconstruction of 9 kin;



- 27 -
(d) a rehabilitation/improvement program including
improvements of road formation and drainage on the
total length of 1,733 km of gravel and earth roads,
spot regravelling on about 1,200 km and full
regravelling on 431 km.
The maintenance component will include technical assistance as detailed in
para. 3.09. During negotiations Government and the Bank agreed on budget
allocations for road maintenance during the project period, on a list of
maintenance equipment and a list of roads and road sections to be improved
during the project period (Annex 8, Item III. H) as well as on terms of
reference for the technical assistance (Annex 8, Item III G) (5.01 (e)).
Road Construction
3.06      The road construction component is for a 50 km section, between
Luwawa Turnoff and Champhoyo, of the main north-south road which links the
Northern Region with the more developed Central and Southern Regions. The
road has, in recent years, been constructed from the south with IDA
financing under the First, Second, Third and Fourth Highway Projects (about
530 km from Zomba through Lilongwe, Kasungu and Jenda to Luwawa Turnoff),
and from the north with financing from the EDF, the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW), the African Development Fund (AfDF) and IDA under the
Fourth Highway Project (about 250 km from Karonga through Chiweta, Rumphi
and Mzuzu to Mbowe). Construction of this section would leave a gap of
only some 45 km of unpaved road out of a distance of some 1,100 km between
Bangula in the deep south and Karonga in the far north. The detailed
engineering for this section of the road financed by a PPF advance, was
completed in July 1983.
Axle-Load Control
3.07      In order to improve MTC's operation of the three existing
permanent weighbridges and to operate them on a 24 hour basis, the project
provides for construction of six houses for operating staff. To further
expand the enforcement of legal axle load limits and other vehicle
regulations, the project provides for procurement of five mobile
weighbridges, of a type developed by TRRL of UK for tropical conditions,
and five vehicles for control patrols. MTC is presently training an
adequate number of staff to carry out the expanded enforcement program.
Training Center at Lilongwe
3.08      The Fourth Highway Project provides for construction of the
first phase of a training center for MWS in Lilongwe in preparation for
expanded maintenance activities; the buildings and housing for key staff
will be completed by the end of 1983. In order to begin training
activities in early 1984, the project provides for procurement of
furniture, teaching aids and equipment. A detailed list of items to be
procured was reviewed by the appraisal mission (Item III. A in the project
file, Annex 8) and agreed with Government at negotiations (para. 5.01 (f)).



- 28
Technical Assistance
3.09      The project provides consulting services (totalling 648
man-months) for the following purposes:
(a)  technical assistance (50 man-months) for
implementation of the third phase of DRIMP, the
establishment of the necessary maintenance units,
the training of local staff, the road improvements
and subsequent maintenance;
(b)  design of rehabilitation works (30 man-months) for
paved roads in the maintenance program, after the
initial year, and the subsequent supervision of
the work (48 man-months), which would be carried
out by contractors;
(c)  technical assistance (220 man-months) for MWS to
prepare and implement the expanded routine and
periodic maintenance program and the force account
works of the resealing of paved roads and the
rehabilitation of earth and gravel roads included
in the maintenance program (Item III. H in Annex
8);
(d)  design of the road construction (30 man-months)
from Luwawa Turnoff to Champhoyo, initially financed
through PPF;
(e)  supervision of the construction of the Luwawa
Turnoff - Champhoyo :oad section (90 man-months);
(f)  transport system study (75 man-months) concerning
a proposed route to 1the north (para. 1.16)
including the TANZAM/TAZARA Corridor to
Dar-es-Salaam and the design of recommended
infrastructure. This component also includes
technical assistance to strengthen the capability
of the planning unit in the Ministry of Transport
and Communications to monitor conditions on the
existing import/export routes and to take
appropriate action promptly. The terms of
reference for the technical assistance are in the
project file (Item I]I. I in Annex 8). A
consultant is already in the post financed by UNDP
for a six months period; the project includes
funds to continue this service;
(g)  preparation of future highway projects (45
man-months) includinq detailed engineering for the
Champoyo-Mbowe road;
(h)  strengthening of the Transport Planning Unit (IPU)
in EPD (24 man-months), including the execution of
several transport stLldies, and continued training
abroad of TPU staff (para. 1.18); and



- 29 -
(i) strengthening of equipment fleet management (36
man-months) through improvements in management
systems, financing, equipment maintenance and
replacement within PVHO, and determination of
those equipment services which might more
economically be obtained from the private sector
(terms of reference for the services are in the
project file, Annex 8, Item III. K).
During negotiations agreements were reached with Government: (i) that
selection of a firm of consultants to provide technical assistance to MWS
(item (c) above) would be completed as a condition of effectiveness of the
loan/credit; (ii) that consultants will be employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) on terms of reference for feasibility and
engineering studies; and (iv) that Government will consult with the Bank on
the recommendations of feasibility studies before proceeding with
engineering studies (para. 5.01 (h)).
Cost Estimates
3.10      The total estimated financing required for the project, including
contingency allowances and the capitalized front-end fee on the Bank loan
(US$18.0 million) is estimated at about MK 105.1 million or US$84.1
million. Total cost includes: (a) physical contingencies of 10% of base
cost on all items; and (b) price contingencies amounting to about 24% of
base cost on all items, including physical contingencies. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at MK 65.4 million (US$ 52.3 million).
Identifiable taxes and duties are about MK 6.9 million (US$5.5 million),
and the total project cost net of taxes and duties is MK 98.2 million (US$
78.5 million). Details are provided in Table 3.1.
3.11      The base costs are estimated as of October 1983 and have been
derived as follows:
(a)   DRIMP  The costs of establishing the maintenance units and
of improvement works and subsequent maintenance are based
on actual costs incurred for these activities under the
second phase of DRIMP. The implementation period would
extend from about mid to late 19B4 until late 1987;
(b)   Road Maintenance:  The costs of implementing the
maintenance programs were based on consultants' estimates
which in turn are based on MWS's force account operations
and on recently let contracts for similar works in Malawi;
(c)   Road Construction:  The cost estimates for construction of
the Luwawa turnoff-Champhoyo road section were based on
quantities derived from detailed engineering and on the
consultants' conservative estimates of unit costs, in turn
based on considerable experience from similar construction
works adjacent to the location of this road section. The
foreign exchange component is assessed at 73% of total
costs and includes all elements except labour and taxes.
(d)   Axle Load Control:  The cost of the mobile weighbridges,
vehicles and related equipment was based on recent
quotations to MTC. The price of houses to be built at the
sites of the permanent weighbridges is based on actual
costs of such houses built by MWS's force account units.

(e)   Training Center at Lilongwe  The estimated costs of
furniture, equipment and training aids is based on MWS's
detailed assessment of requirements and price quotations
from local suppliers.
(f)   Consultancy Services:  The technical assistance for
preparation and implementation of the third phase of DRIMP
will require about 50 man-months of consulting services
(US$510,000); the design of the rehabilitation of paved
roads will require about 30 man-months and supervision of
these works about 48 man-months (US$740,000); technical
assistance to implement and supervise the expanded
maintenance program will require some 220 man-months
(US$2,160,000); the design of the road construction element
will be paid for on a lump sum basis but includes about 30
man-months (US$300,000); the supervision of this
construction will require some 90 man-months (US$680,000);
the study of emergency routes is estimated to require some
75 man-months (24 man-months technical assistance, 16
man-months feasibility study, 27 man-months for possible
road design and 8 man-months for possible design of port
facilities) (US$760,000); preparation of future hiqhway
projects, including the detailed engineering of the
Mbowe-Champhoyo road, about 45 man-months (US$400,000); and
technical assistance (including staff training) for TPU,
about 25 man-months (US$450,000), and technical assistance
for PVHO, about 36 man-months (US$380,000). The average
man-month cost, including salary, fees, international
travel, subsistence and other applicable charges is
estimated at about US$10,000 for the technical assistance
for DRIMP and for TPU in EPD, US$9,000 for design and
supervision of rehabilitation of paved roads and for
technical assistance for the expanded maintenance program,
US$7,500 for supervision of construction works, US$10,500
for the study of the northern access route, and for the
technical assistance for PVHO, and US$8,500 for detailed
engineering work. These costs are in line with recent
experience in Malawi. In addition to these personnel costs
the contract costs include local transportation costs,
local office operating expenses, report printing and other
minor expenses.
D. Financing
3.12      The total project cost (net of taxes and duties) of US$78.5
million includes financing of recurrent maintenance costs of district roads
(para.3.04) amounting to US$9.61/ million (net of taxes and duties). In
1/ Item A (iv) in the cost table (US$6.7 million) plus US$2.9 million
contingencies.



- 32 -
view of the severe domestic resource constraints, the Government's
contribution to the project financ:Lng will be limited to 10°O of the capital
cost of civil works2/, to about 80"o (on average) of the maintenance cost
for district roads and 10%o of consulting services.  The Government's
contribution will thus be about US$17.6 million or US$13.8 million if
financial assistance can be secured also for the last two years of the
resealing program. The project requires external financing of about
US$60.9 million to cover the foreicjn exchange component of US$52.3 million
and a share of the local cost amounting to US$8.6 million. The external
financing will be provided through an IDA credili of US$26.9, of which
US$13.8 million will be provided from the IDA Special Fund, a Bank loan of
US$18.0 million, and a loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) of
about US$16.0 million. During negotiations, assurances have been obtained
that the Government will take timely action to :Ldentify sources for
financing the gap of US$3.8 million for the resealing program or,
alternatively, provide for this from its own resources (para. 5.01 (g)).
The external financing from Bank/IDA, IDA Special Fund and AfDB, will be
used in parallel financing of various components as shown in Table 3.2.
2/ With exception of resealing work (Item B (ii) in cost table) for which
the Government will provide 100%zo financing for the last two years
(1986/87 and 1987/88) of the program unless other sources of financing
can be identified.

E.  Implementation and Procurement
3.13      MWS will be responsible for project execution apart from the
components for axle load control and the technical assistance to MTC's
planning unit For which MTC will be responsible, and the study of the
northern access route and the technical assistance for transport planning
for which EPD will be responsible. These agencies are capable of carrying
out these responsibilities. Road construction, costing some US$12.9
million (net of taxes and duties), will be executed under unit price
contracts awarded after international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with guidelines of AfDB. The rehabilitation work on paved
roads, costing some US$11.9 million, will also be executed under unit price
contracts awarded after ICB in ac-ordance with the Bank's guidelines for
procurement but with special procurement eligibility criteria for the IDA
Special Fund.
3.14      Because of the small scope and scattered location of works the
depots and housing for the third phase of DRIMP, including the extension of
MWS headquarters totalling about IJS$2.4 million, and housing for axle load
control, costing some US$0.1 million, will be constructed by local
contractors, following local competitive bidding procedures which are
satisfactory, or if this proves unsuccessful by force account as under
previous phases of DRIMP.  In order to train local staff in the eleven
districts, improvement and maintenance works under the third phase,
amounting to a total of some US$15.9 million will be by force account with
consultants providing technical assistance in line with experience under
the previous two phases of the program.
3.15      Resealing of some 400 km of paved roads, to a total cost of about
US$7.7 million, will be carried out by MWS force account units in order to
maintain a minimum capacity for resealing in MWS. The proposed project
will strengthen one or two existing MWS units through provision of finances
for materials and operating expenses during the first two years of the
4-year program3/. The annual capacity of the MWS units will amount to
about 100-150 kim, while over the next few years the annual requirement for
resealing of the paved network is expected to gradually increase to some
150-200 km.
3.16      The rehabilitation works, costing some US$11.7 million, on earth
and gravel roads are mostly of small size and in scattered locations, and
would generally be best suited for implementation by force account.
Hovever, the Government intends to create an opportunity for further
developing the local construction industry through provision of work
continuity and has therefore decided to group about 30 percent (at a total
cost of about US$3.5 million) into small packages (estimated to cost less
than US$300,000 each) suitable for construction by contractors. The work
will be tendered through local competitive bidding under Government
procedures satisfactory to the Ban<. The remainder of the program will be
carried out by force account, and the project will strengthen the existing
MWS maintenance units with new equipment (including spares) and provide
funds for materials and operating expenses.
3.17      Design and supervision of road construction and overlays for
paved road rehabilitation as well as technical assistance for the road
3/ New equipment for the resealinq units will be provided in 1983-84 and
financed by the Overseas Development Administration (UK), which also
might finance materials and operating expenses during the last two
years.



- 35 -
maintenance program, the third phase of DRIMP, the study of the northern
access route, the technical assistance to EPD and PVH0, and the preparation
of future projects will be carried out by consultants employed under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank at the total cost of about US$8.1
million; this was agreed with Government at negotiations (para.5.01 (h)).
Cost will not be a consideration in the selection of the consultants.
3.18      In view of the diversity of types and the small number of each
type of equipment, tools, furniture and other minor items for the Lilongwe
training center, costing about US$0.2 million, and for axle load control,
costing some US$0.2 million, procurement of these items will be through
local shopping. In order to maintain standardization and
interchangeability between districts as well as with MWS's PVHO, which will
undertake repairs and overhauls, equipment (including spares) for the
districts' maintenance units under the third phase of DRIMP, costing a
total of about US$1.1 million (including some US$0.2 million for equipment
to strengthen the existing improvement units), will be obtained either from
manufacturers supplying such items to the previous phases of DRIMP, by
extending existing contracts if still in effect at the time of Credit/Loan
signing, or by local shopping and limited international tendering.
3.19      Road maintenance equipment, including spare parts, for routine
and periodic maintenance of main and secondary roads as well as
rehabilitation of gravel and earth roads, amounting tQ about US$6.3
million, will be procured following international competitive bidding in
accordance with guidelines of the Bank Group and AfDB as appropriate
(para. 2.31).
3.20      All documentation for equipment procurement under ICB and
financed by the Bank Group will be subject to Bank Group review prior to
issuance of tenders. Bidding packages for civil works estimated to cost
US$500,000 or more (that is, about 50% of the total Bank Group-financed
civil works to be procured under competitive bidding) will be subject to
the Bank's prior review of bidding documents. The bidding packages for
civil works estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent and all other
contract documentation will not be routinely reviewed but MWS will maintain
copies of bid evaluations and final contracts which will be subject to spot
review by Bank Group supervision missions.
3.21      An implementation schedule is presented in Chart 2, the details
of which was agreed with Government at negotiations (para 5.01 (i)).
F.  Disbursements
3.22      The credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a)  90%9 of expenditures on civil works under the third
phase of DRIMP, including:
(i) district road improvements;
(ii).depots, housing, and MWS headquarters extension.
(b)  80%O of total expenditures for civil works for main
and secondary roads in the rehabilitation program
for paved roads, and for earth and gravel roads;
(c)  90%0 of expenditures on civil works for housing
for the axle load control;



- 36 -
(d)  100%O of foreign expenditures and 90%O of local
expenditures for equipment, vehicles and spare
parts;
(e)  100%0' of foreign expenditures and 90%0 of local
expenditures for weighbridges and associated
equipment, and imported items to be provided for
the Lilongwe training center;
(f)  90%O of total expenditures for locally produced
items to be provided for the Lilongwe training
center;
(g)  100%o of foreign expenditures and 50%0 of local
expenditures for consultants' services;
(h) for incremental maintenance expenditures on
district roads: for each district being brought
into the maintenance program, subsequent to
completion of road improvements, 75%0 of
incremental costs during the first year of
maintenance; 50%0 during the second year of
maintenance; and 25°% during the third year of
maintenance; and
(i) 100%O of foreign expenditures for training abroad of
EPD staff.
IDA financing of the incremental total cost of maintenance, declining from
75%O for the first year of maintenance to 50%O for the second year and 25 for
the third year, would be matched to Government's financial assistance to
the district councils in accordance with targiets agreed with Government
(para. 5.01 (c).  The AfDB loan would finance 80%o of total expenditures for
the construction of the Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo road, 90%O of expenditures
on consulting services for construction supervision, and 100%O of foreign
and 90%' of local expenditures for maintenance equipment (vehicles and
graders), including spare parts.
3.23      All disbursements will be fully documented except for
expenditures under force account for civil works included in parts A, B,
and D(ii) of table 3.1, which wiLl be made against certificates of work
performed, to be issued by the technical assistance consultants. The
documents supporting these staternents of expenditures will not be submitted
for review but will be retained by MWS for inspection by the Bank during
project supervision missions.

This schedule is in line with disbursements under previous highway credits.
G.   Accounting, Auditing and Repirting Requirements
3.25      Project accounts, including statements of expenditures, will be
maintained by MWS with separate accounts for each component. In previous
IDA projects, accounts have beer audited by the Auditor General; as this
arrangement has proved satisfactory, it woulcl also be followed for the
proposed project. During negotiations, Government agreed to have all
project accounts audited by the Auditor General and to have audited
accounts together with the auditors' report submitted to the Bank not later
than six months after the end of the fiscal year (para. 5.01(j)). At
negotiations, Government also agreed on progress reporting requirements,
which include indices for measuring implementation, (Items III. E and F in
Annex 8) and the submission of a project completion report, in a form
satisfactory to the Bank, not later than six months after the closing date
(para. 5.01 (j)).
H. Environmental Impact
3.26      In general the project would have beneficial effects on the
environment by reduction of vibration, dust and noise; and improved
drainage will reduce the danger of soil erosion. During road construction,
however, there is a risk that migration of wild animals may be hindered by
construction activities, including noise. This risk is only temporary and
is considered minor.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Economic Evaluation of Project Components
General
4.01      The project is consistent with sectoral development objectives of
the Government (para 1.15) and represents a continuation of work done under
previous IDA-financed transport projects. Various components of the
project are expected to have significant favorable effects on the economy
of Malawi. Extension of DRIMP to the remaining districts will enable rural
people in large areas of the country to benefit from improved access to
markets, sources of supplies and public services. The road maintenance
component will improve road conditions on the major routes, thus reducing
transport costs, enhancing the reliability of transport and preventing
progressive road deterioration. The road construction component will
contribute toward economic integration of the northern and central regions
which presently lack a paved road link and will provide a significant link
in an international route for Malawi's export/import trade. As a result of
the improved transport to be realized under the project, general economic
development should be stimulated, particularly in rural areas.
4.02      District roads to be improved under the project were selected in
accordance with socio-economic criteria (Annex 3) and have rates of return
of at least 121%. The road maintenance component of the project will have
an economic return of 62%C'. Construction of the 50 km of paved road will
yield an economic return of 29%O. No calculation of rates of return has
been attempted for other project components representing, in the aggregate,
less than 5%' of total project investment; these small components are
nonetheless well justified.
1. District Road Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP)
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.03      The extension of DRIMP to the remaining districts will establish,
in all eleven districts, appropriate units to improve and maintain about
1,870 km of roads. The following types of benefits are expected from this
work:
(a)  savings of vehicle operating costs in the
transport of non-agricultural goods, although such
traffic alone will not be sufficient to justify
improvements on many of the roads, and
(b)  increases in agricultural production made possible
by better access to farms and markets.
Improved access to agricultural extension services and markets are expected
to induce farmers to not only increase productivity on land already
cultivated but also increase somewhat the area under cultivation.
4.04      Significant project benefits are also anticipated in
institution-building in the district councils as capabilities for road
maintenance are expanded through the provision of training, equipment and



- 40 -
depots under the project. Other expected benefits are reduced spoilage of
produce and improved access to heEilth, education and other social and
administrative facilities for people residing in the influence area of the
project roads.
4.05      Most of the benefits from the reduction in transport costs will
accrue to (a) the road transporters, since ADMARC pays them fixed rates for
transport of goods to and from rural market centers, and (b) the farmers
living within the roads' influence area, because of the competitive nature
of the road transport industry. The main beneficiaries from the increased
agricultural production and improved access to social services will be
those residing in the vicinity of the roads.
(b) Economic Analysis
4.06      Selection of the district roads to be improved during the  three
year period covered by the third phase of DRIMP has been based on
socio-economic criteria, and all these project roads have an estimated rate
of return of at least 120.  The ec3nomic analysis of the roads includes
consideration of benefits from not only vehicle operating costs savings but
also incremental agricultural production, the latter estimated on the basis
of farm models representative of farms in the areas of project road
influence. Details of the methodoLogy employed are given in Annex 3. The
selection criteria and methodology for calculating the rates of return were
agreed with Government during appraisal. In 1982, Government appointed
consultants to select all roads to be included in DRIMP III, Government and
the Bank have agreed on roads to be improved during the first year of the
program, and roads to be improved in subsequent years will be agreed
annually not later than four months before the beginning of each fiscal
year (para 5.01 (c)).
2. Road Maintenance Program
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.07      The road maintenance component of the project will overcome
substantial deficiencies in the capacity of the Ministry of Works and
Supplies to maintain its road netwcrk. The principal benefits from the
road maintenance program will be savings in vehicle operating costs.
Additional benefits will be derived from the avoidance of both road
closures caused by poor road conditions and the premature rehabilitation of
poorly-maintained roads. The benefits will accrue largely to the road
transporters and farmers living in the areas of road influence, as in the
case of the DRIMP (para. 4.05). Since the road transport industry is quite
competitive and -the users of the main and secondary roads are diverse,
transport cost savings from the project component. should be realized by
virtually all economic groups in the country.
(b) Economic Analysis
4.08      The economic justification of the project component is based on
an assessment of economic costs and benefits with and without the project
over the estimated seven year average economic life of the equipment
involved. A basic tool employed in the analysis was the Highway Design and
Maintenance Standards Model (HDM) and related computer programs (a system
developed with the cooperation of the Bank).  The costs and benefits of the
road maintenance program are as follows:

As indicated in the table, the incremental costs are increases in capital
construction costs and road maintenance costs while the principal
quantified benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time
of road users. It is apparent that the benefits are very large in relation
to costs and therefore the economic rate of return (ERR) is high, that is
about 62°o. For individual unpaved roads in the program (Annex 8,Item
III.H) the ERRs vary considerably but none is below 36°o. For specific
paved roads (Annex 8, Item III. H) all but one of the ERR's are above 25°o.
4.09      The basis for the savings in vehicle operating costs are the data
on vehicle operating cost factors shown in Annex 7, road deterioration
parameters (roughness, depth of ruts and depth of loose materials), user
cost relationships and traffic estimates. For paved and unpaved roads,
traffic estimates are shown in Annexes 5 and 6, respectively. Assumed
traffic growth rates for paved roads range from 5 to 8°% p.a. but tending
toward the low side, while the rates for unpaved roads are 4 to 5%0 p.a.
4.10      The value of savings in travel time constitute only about 3%0' of
total quantified benefits. They were calculated on the basis of estimates
of the unit values of passenger time as shown in Annex 7 and estimates of
time saved.
4.11      Selection of the particular roads included in the road
maintenance program was based on economic analysis of a large number of
candidate roads. Economic return was the key factor in the selection of
particular program roads. Another factor was the practicability of
organizing the work on the roads in an efficient manner.
4.12      The ERR for this project component is so high that even if the
costs were substantially higher or the benefits much lower than estimated,
or both, the ERR would be acceptable.

3.  Upgrading of the Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo Road (50 km)
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.13      The main project benefits from this road construction are
reductions in transport costs for a portion of Malawi's export/import
traffic which will be transported between centers in Malawi and the port of
Dar-es-Salaam via Karonga (about 1,500 km from Lilongwe to the Tanzania
port) rather than over the longer and more costly routes to the sea via
Lusaka -- either to Dar-es-Salaam (about 2,600 km) or to Durban (about
2,800 km). While the most economical routes from land-locked Malawi to the
sea are two railway lines through Mozambique to the ports of Beira and
Nacala, the ability of these lines to carry Malawi traffic has declined
sharply in recent years thus for2ing substantial amounts of traffic to be
transported at high cost via Lusaka and either Durban or Dar-es-Salaam
(para 1.13). The outlook in Moz3mbique regarding guerilla attacks on the
railway lines and deterioration 3f those lines is not promising.
Therefore, Malawi's need for an economical alternative route to the sea is
evident and the best choice for this purpose is a northern access route
including the main north/south road and the TANZAM corridor (both road and
railway) to Dar-es-Salaam. The economy of Malawi would benefit greatly
from the reductions in transport costs and the beneficiaries would include
virtually all elements of the population.
4.14      Additional benefits from the road construction are reductions in
vehicle operating costs for normal domestic traffic. Benefits derived from
the impact of the road on the area of influence, in terms of increased
agricultural production, have been included in generated traffic. Savings
in personal travel time have been included for passengers and owner-drivers
of cars, landrovers and buses but excluded for passengers on trucks.
Benefits representing savings in road maintenance costs have not been
quantified. Similarly, benefits from accident reduction have not been
included in the economic analysis.
4.15      In the first instance, the major beneficiaries of reductions in
transport costs on both international and domestic traffic will be the
truck owners and operators. However, in view of the competitive nature of
the road transport inductry (para 2.07) and the fact that Government-
prescribed rates take account of road conditions, it is expected that the
savings in vehicle operating costs and time wiLll be passed on as lower
freight rates to the shippers ancl receivers of freight. Farmers and
consumers in the area are also expected to benefit from the reduced
transport costs.
(b) Area of Influence of the Project Road
4.16       The Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo road forms part of the
Bangula-Karonga highway, the backbone of the country's road network. Much
progress has been made on the development of this road which is not only
important for internal trade and for achievincg unity among the regions but
also will in the near future, form part of an international route to Dar es
Salaam. The latter role of the road has assumed increasing significance as
the rail routes through Mozambique have become less reliable.  The Luwawa
Turnoff-Champhoyo segment to be constructed under the project extends the
existing paved road northward into the Viphya area which is now being
developed as a source of wood and wood products and for agriculture.



- 43 -
4.17      The Viphya area contains the largest forest resources in the
country, many thousands of hectares having been planted with ODA assistance
during the past two decades. A sawmill was built at Mazamba in 1979; also,
preparation is far advanced for the development of a new plywood and
blockboard mill in the area served by the road. Viphya timber resources
are sufficient to support substantial growth of wood processing
industries. However, the economic analysis of the road construction
component takes into account only a modest future growth in traffic
attributable to wood products industry.
(c) Economic Analysis
(i) Approach
4.18      Since the justification of constructing the Luwawa
Turnoff-Champhoyo section rests to a substantial extent on the transport of
export/import traffic over the road, it is necessary to consider the
economic impact of building not only this section but also the adjacent
section between Champhoyo and Mbowe, which would be required for
export/import traffic to move on the international route.  As previously
indicated (para. 3.09) detailed engineering has not yet been done for the
recently selected alignment of the Champhoyo-Mbowe section and therefore
financing of construction of this segment cannot be included in the project
but this civil works is expected to follow as soon as possible.
4.19      The economic analysis also takes into account the fact that
another gap exists in the international route to Dar es Salaam, that is,
between Karonga and a point on the paved Mbeya-Itungi road in Tanzania.
since the completion of this 48 km road is dependent on and essential to
the effective use of the international route, the cost of building has been
included in the economic analysis. The road is assumed to have little
domestic traffic and therefore any benefits based on such traffic are not
reflected in the analysis.
(ii) Savings in transport Cost on Malawi Export/Import Traffic
4.20      One factor which has not been taken into account in the economic
analysis is the exogenous effect of security which this northern route
would bring to Malawi's export/import traffic. A study on the impact of
the recent transportation crisis in Malawi (para. 1.16) found that direct
and indirect cost to the economy (cost incurred from the shortages of fuel
and other essential industrial and consumer inputs) in 1983 will be at
least 3.5% of GDP, or about US$ 45 million, including a net loss of
approximately US$20 million in foreign exchange. The construction of
Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo section will minimize the cost to the general
economy incurred through shortages of essential imported goods and late
delivery of exports.
4.21      As previously noted (para 4.13) the most economical routes for
Malawi's export/import traffic to and from Indian Ocean sea ports are
through Mozambique but the inability of the Mozambique rail lines to handle
all of the traffic available has required the use of costly alternatives.
Following is a comparison of alternative road routes in terms of distance
and transport cost:



- 44 -
Lengtli  Transport Cost per ton
Route                           (Km)              (MK)
Lilongwe to Durban via Lusaka                2,835               207
Lilongwe to Dar-es-Salaam via Lusaka         2,630               192
Lilongwe to Dar-es-Salaam via Karonga        1,500               109
Clearly, the shortest and least costly route is that to Dar-es-Salaam via
Karonga (Karonga international route) and the savings per ton, as compared
with the next best route, is a substantial MK 83. The reason for the large
cost difference is, of course, the substantially greater length of the
route to Dar-es-Salaam through Lusaka.
4.22      Large tonnages of export/import traffic would be diverted from
other routes to the proposed Karoncia international route. In recent normal
years some 750,000 tons of Malawi traffic transited Mozambique. In 1983,
this traffic is expected to decline by about 300,000 tons or 40%0, and to
decrease further in subsequent years. For purpcises of the economic
analysis of the road construction component, it is estimated that at least
150,000 tons per year of export/import traffic will be transported in 1988
over the Karonga international route, or 20%O' of the current annual tonnage
of Malawi's foreign trade. It is further estimated that this tonnage will
increase at the rate of 5%O p.a. over the economic life of the road. The
international traffic will be transported in relatively large trucks of
25-30 tons capacity and therefore the estimated 150,000 tons of
international freight would represent vehicular traffic of only 15 trucks
per day. The road, railway, and port facilities in Tanzania would be able
to handle Malawi traffic of this magnitude without new major infrastructure
investments1/. However, if the Mozambique routes remain problematic a
much higher Malawi traffic through Tanzania would be expected to develop.
The Bank is currently planning to assist Tanzania in the port of Dar es
Salam, on the TANZAM highway and on the TAZARA railway. Through such
assistance the Bank will also be helping Malawi alleviate its problems of
costly and time-consuming international transport. The transport system
study (para 3.09) will determine the required investments in transport
infrastructure in relation to various levels of Malawi's transit traffic.
4.23      The 150,000 tons of traffic would be transported over the Karonga
international route at a cost savings of MK 13.7 million in 1988 based on
the MK83 cost savings per ton indicated in para 4.20. Over the economic
life of the road these savings would increase moderately, reaching some
MK 36 million annually after 20 years.
(iii) Traffic
4.24      Traffic on the Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe road is assumed to grow at 5%0
p.a. in accordance with traffic counts during recent years.  This growth
rate is slightly higher than the actual traffic (rowth over the past year
or two when economic activity has been somewhat depressed; however, the
assumed 5°% rate is considerably lower than actuaL growth rates during the
seventies. Specific estimates were made of traffic related to the Viphya
wood industry project which is assumed to begin operations in 1987.  In
1/ The throughput in the Port of Dar es Salaam in 1981 was 4.3 million
t nnc; -



- 45 -
addition, the traffic estimates reflect a small amount of generated traffic
for passenger movements equal to 20% of the normal traffic of cars and
other light vehicles. 2/ By 1987, when construction of the road is
completed, total traffic on the road, as shown in table 4.1, will average
about 159 vpd.

(iv) Vehicle Operating Costs
4.25      Vehicle operating costs (voc) for the road to be built would
increase significantly on the earth road as traffic increases, particularly
when traffic exceeds 100 vpd. This increase occurs even with a modest rise
in road maintenance expenditures since the roads involved were not
originally designed and constructed for a high level of traffic. Table 4.2
gives voc's for representative vehicles on the Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo
road and the potential savings in vehicle operating costs if the road is
upgraded.

applied to normal traffic in the economic analysis.

(v) Cost of Construction
4.26      The construction cost estimate of MK 16.3 million for the
Luwawa-Champhoyo road is net of taxes and based on October 1983 prices; it
includes the cost of supervision and 10%O physical contingencies.  Costs
cover construction of the road to paved standard and assumes that the road
will be built under contract. Theo estimated economic costs of constructing
the Champhoyo-Mbowe section is MK 18.5 million. To build the
Karonga-Tanzania section would involve an additional economic cost of MK
14.0 million.
(vi) Economic Return
4.27      Economic analysis of the project road shows that the construction
is justified with an overall rate of return of 29%. The economic
justification of the road construction is baseci on an assessment of
economic costs and benefits with End without the project component over the
estimated 20 year economic life of the road. Since construction of three
road sections (Luwawa Turnoff-Champhoyo; Champhoyo-Mbowe; and
Karonga-Tanzania) will be requirec to realize the benefits from
international traffic, the costs cf constructing these three sections are
taken into account in the economic analysis. It is assumed that the two
sections not included in this project will be built during the period
1983-87, as the Government plans. Details of the economic evaluation are
presented in Annex 4. Consideration was given to improving the road to an
engineered gravel standard rather than a paved standard but this was not
found justified due to the very high cost of regravelling (gravel sources
in the area are scarce and rock-crushing would be necessary) and the
eventual need to construct the road to paved standard.
(vii) Sensitivity
4.28      The sensitivity of the economic return to variations in the
estimated costs and benefits was determined and the results indicate that
even with a 30%C increase in construction costs the ERR would be a
substantial 25%0'. A 50%o decrease in transport cost savings on international
traffic would result in a 19%o ERR. If both of these variations are
considered the ERR is still satisfactory at 14%o.
B. Risks
4.29      The principal risk associLated with this project is that the
international route via Karonga and Dar-es-Salaam may not become available
for Malawi's international traffic because of lack of the eventual
agreement between the Malawi and Tanzania Governments on construction of a
road link between the two countries or the conditions affecting use of the
route. The two Governments, however, recognize the benefits that may be
realized by both countries from use of the route. As already noted (para.
1.16), Malawi officials have prepared an action program for development of
the route and reached preliminary aigreement with the Tanzania Government on
various relevant issues. The development of this international route is
quite consistent with the objectives of the Southern Africa Development
Coordination Conference of which bcoth Malawi and Tanzania are members.



- 47 -
4.30      Another risk is that the necessary financing for the
international road link may not be obtained. This possibility seems
unlikely, however, given the interest already shown on the part of certain
donors in developing this important regional artery.
4.31      There is some possibility that the transport problems in
Mozambique restricting transit handling of Malawi's export/import traffic
may be quickly solved thus eliminating the need for the proposed route
through Karonga and Dar es Salaam. Such improvements would be fortunate
for Malawi but seem unlikely. The guerilla problem affecting the Beira
rail line seems as intractable as ever and the deterioration of facilities
on both the Beira and Nacala rail lines is so severe that, even with ample
financing, several years would be required to achieve satisfactory
operations. Overall, it appears prudent for Malawi to undertake the
proposed investments in the new international route to avoid potentially
heavy economic penalties in the years ahead.
4.32       A risk for both DRIMP III and the maintenance program to be
agreed under the project is the possibility that Government's financial
resources for maintenance of both the national and district road networks
may be inadequate. To minimize this risk, agreement was reached on
Government financing of maintenance costs (para 3.05). The Bank will help
cushion the burden on Government by financing incremental maintenance costs
for DRIMP on a declining basis. However, the Government's eventual ability
to uphold these agreements will depend on the strength of the economy and
Government's continued responsiveness to the needs of the road subsector.
Possible serious weakness in the general economy over the next several
years is, of course, a risk that could affect the project adversely.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01       During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following:
(a) a covenant that prior to adopticin of the annual
budget during the project periocd, the Government
will discuss with the Bank the transport
investment program (para. 1.16);
(b) a list of facilities (depots, hcusing, equipment,
tooLs) to be provided, and a list of district
roads to be improved during the first year of the
third phase of DRIMP; the work program for
subsequent years wilL be agreed not later than
four months before the beginning of each fiscal
year until completion of this project component
(para 3.03);
(c) a system of financial assistance for recurrent
maintenance to be provided by Government to the
district councils and the allocations needed
during the project period. The appropriateness of
aLlocations will be discussed annually, not later
than four months be-fore the beginning of each
fiscal year, by Government and the Bank on the
basis of MWS's updated estimates of the funds
required by the district councils (para 3.04);
Cd) Ci) maintenance allocations for M1WS for the
project period (para. 2.32) the appropriateness of
which will be discussed with the Bank annually not
later than four months before the beginning of
each fiscal year; (ii) a list of maintenance
equipment to be procured; (iii) a list of roads
and road sections tc be improved during the
project period; and the terms of reference for the
technical assistance to be provicled to MWS (para.
3.05);
(e) equipment and supplies to be provided for MWS'
training center in Lilongwe Cparai. 3.08);
(f)  that selection of the firm of consultants to
provide technical assistance to MSW would be
completed as a condition of effectiveness of the
loan/credit;
(g) that timely action will be taken to identify
sources for financing of the Last two years,
1986/87 and 1987/88, of the resealing program, or,
alternatively, that the Government will provide
for this from its own resources (para.3.12);
(h) Ci) that consultants will be employed on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) on terms



- 49 -
of reference for feasibility and engineering
studies; and (iii) that Government will consult
with the Bank on the recommendations of
feasibility studies before proceeding with
enqineering studies (paras 3.09 and 3.17);
(i) a project implementation schedule (para. 3.23) as
well as progress reporting requirements, and the
submission of a project completion report (para.
3.25); and
(j) that all project accounts will be audited by the
Auditor General and that the audited accounts
together with the auditor's report will be
submitted to the Bank not later than six months
after the end of the fiscal year (para. 3.27).
5.02      The project is suitable for (a) an IDA Credit of SDR 12.4 million
(US$13.1 million equivalent), (b) an IDA Special Fund Credit of SDR 13.1
million (US$13.8 million equivalent), and (c) a Bank Loan of US$18.0
million equivalent, all on standard terms, to the Government of Malawi.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Terms of Reference for the Economic Analysis and Selection
Criteria for Improvement of District Roads under DRIMP
Introduction
1.        The Third phase of DRIMP provides for improvement of all district
roads in the ten districts proposed for inclusion in the program. However,
since improvement of some of these roads will not be justified, at least
during the program period, a selection process is necessary to eliminate
those roads not justified on socioeconomic grounds. This will leave capa-
city under the program to improve important rural roads which are not des-
ignated as district roads, but which have already been identified by the
District Councils as high priority roads in need of improvement.
2.        All district and other rural roads will be screened as outlined
below and, if they pass the screening criteria, will be subject to economic
evaluation.  In addition, some roads will be subject tc further social evalua-
tion procedures.  Although all roads to be improved will be identified before
Phase III of DRIMP begins, the program will be flexible and provide for up-
dating of the list of roads whenever necessary.
Screening
3.        It is important to screen the list of district and other roads
recommended for inclusion in the program at an early state in order to avoid
costly and unnecessary project preparation work. The screening criteria
outlined below will be applied after all the roads proposed for the program
have been marked on an appropriately large-scale map of the area (in itself
a screening device):
(a) all roads to be improved should connect with: existing roads
in good and maintainable condition; roads to be constructed at
about the same time as the proposed roads are to be improved;
or with a facility such as a local market;
(b)  there should be no other economically viable transport alter-
native within a distance of about 2 km of the proposed road
or other reasonable distance in the case of physical barriers,
such as a river;

Page 2 of 4
(c)  the area to be served by the proposed road should be covered
by a development program,, such as an agricultural extension
service, credit facilities, or an agri.cultural cooperative
program.  The program should preferabLy have already been
established; however, if there is a definite commitment by
Government to a planned program which is already at an ad-
vanced stage of preparation, the proposed road should not be
excluded from the program; and
(d)  all roads should be below a maximum per kilometer cost unless
above-average benefits are expected from improvement of the road.
One of the first tasks of consultan-ts carrying out the selection
process will be to determine the per kilometer maximum cost,
after estimating the maximum number of' kilometers to be improved
with the given resources available. The inclusion of roads with
significantly higher costs than average will mean that  the total
length of roads to be improved under the program would be reduced;
only i.f the benefits of such roads are particularly high will it
be justified to include t'hem.
Those roads that pass screening should be subject to the following evalua-
tion process.
Evaluation
4.        Previous DRIMP studies indicate that a significant proportion of district
roads will have traffic levels of over 10 vpd. which bas been found sufficient to
yield an economic return of at least 12% based on. savings in vehicle operating costs.
A number of roads may therefore meet the minimum rate of return criteria on the basis
of vehicle operating cost savings alone, without the need for further analysis of
other benefits. It will therefore be very important to obtain reliable traffic
counts on such roads.
5.        For other roads it will be necessary to estimate the increase in
agricultural producer surplus due to improvement of the road and associated
development programs. It is a common practice to evaluate agricultural
projects on the basis of farm models which are typical of the local crop-
ping patterns and representative of the area. S:Lmilar models should be
developed for the areas of influence of the proposed roads. More than one
farm model may apply in any given district, depending on the variety of
cropping patterns.  The farm models should not only be based on patterns
of production but also on the developmental level of the area (subsistence
farming, level of farm technology and market orientation, etc.), and an
assessment of the capacity of the population to develop the potential for
agricultural development. Once the farm models have been developed, their
suitability will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, by the appropriate
agricultural agencies, as this will not be within the purview of the Roads
Department.

ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 4
6.        Each area of influence of the proposed road (estimated at approxi-
mately 4 km) should be examined to determine the following:
(a) the area of cultivated and cultivable land;
(b)  the fertility and suitability of the land, taking into
account such factors as soil characteristics, climate,
topography, water availabilitv, etc.; and
(c) the farm model which is most representative of the area.
When the above data have been collected, the increase in agricultural produc-
tion after improvement of the proposed road can be estimated on the basis of
application of the farm models. Some indication of the magnitude of such
benefits can be obtained from at least one evaluation study, which has been
carried out in Malawi's Lilongwe District, where the increase in producer
surplus has been estimated after roads have been improved, without expansion
of agricultural extension programs. All costs associated with realizing the
potential benefits should be estimated and included in the economic analysis;
this should include not only incremental costs of improved inputs but also
the costs of improved methods, i.e., labor and extension service costs.
The potential incremental producer surplus that will result from improvement
of the road should then be correlated with development potential, cultivated
and cultivable land, and fertility/suitability of the land, to arrive at a
reasonable estimate of benefits given the above factors. This may mean that
where the development potential or fertility/suitability of the land is low,
only half of the potential increase in producer surplus will be realized, or
where they are high, nearly all potential benefits will be realized.
7.        It will not be necessary to calculate economic rates of return for
every road, but rather for representative roads serving reasonably homogenous
areas. The level of benefits yielding a 12% rate of return should be decer-
mined, using the average cost of road improvements in each area, so that roads
falling below this rate can be excluded from the program unless justified on
other grounds (para. 8). For roads with improvement costs above the average,
minimum rates of return can be estimated for each band of costs, i.e., 1-25%,
26-50%, 51-75%, etc., over the average cost. Roads which are marginal can be
examined in more detail. All benefits should be net of incremental costs, not
only for increased inputs such as fertilizers and seeds, but also additional
agricultural extension costs or the costs of extending credit facilities,
cooperative or mechanization programs, etc.
8.        The distribution of project benefits between farmers, middlemen
(including transporters) and consumers needs to be examined tu ensure that
farmers will recoup at least a significant portion of the benefits. Also,
there should be an indication of the size of farms to be served by the road,
so as to ensure that most of the benefits of the program are going to the
smaller farmers. In addition to size of landholding, such social criteria
as income level of inhabitants within the area of influence of the road, and



-60-
Annex 3
Page 4 of 4
average distance to educational, health, and other social and administrative
facilities should be evaluated for roads that are economically marginal.
The importance of social considerations and improved accessibility should
be given in as quantified terms as possible (e.g., estimated change in school
attendance ratios, delivery of health services in terms of visits to health
clinics, etc.). Where the social indicators show a significant impact on
the community as a result of improving the road, but the economic evaluation
is marginal, a separate case can be riade for including the proposed road in
the program.
