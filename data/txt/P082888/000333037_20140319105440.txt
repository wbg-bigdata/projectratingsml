A. SUMMARY

1. The purpose of this restructuring paper (RP) is to seek an approval for a level 2 restructuring
   of the Mauritania Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PRECASP). This SDR 9.1 million
   (US$13 million equivalent) project which closes on March 30, 2014 supports to improve
   performance, efficiency and transparency of public resource management. The restructuring foresees
   more successful project implementation through a minor revision of three indicators in the Result
   Framework to reflect current project circumstances. The PDO and PDO indicators remain unchanged.
   The safeguard category will remain C. Also, the implementing entities are in compliance with the
   Bank’s financial management requirements, and there are currently no overdue audits or interim
   financial reports from these entities. The changes proposed by the restructuring are consistent with the
   Government’s formal request on October 3, 2013.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. Aimed at strengthening public sector capacity, the project (US$13.0 million equivalent) was
   approved by the Board on July 6, 2006 and became effective on January 16, 2007. The objective
   of the project is to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania’s effort to improve
   the performance, efficiency and transparency of public resource management. The project comprises
   five components: (A) improvement of Public Finance Management (PFM), (B) support to Local
   Development, (C) mainstreaming Environment into development management, (D) improvement of
   Human Resource Management (HRM) in public administration; and (E) support to project
   implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

3. The project has undergone 1 thorough restructuring and 3 extensions due to the unstable
   political situation and to ensure the completion of all planned activities. A first extension was
   granted in 2009 to extend the closing date of the project (originally, December 31, 2009,) to
   December 31 2011, due to suspension of the Bank’s activities resulted from the political situation . In
   2011, a three-month extension of the closing date (from December 31, 2011 to March 30, 2012) was
   granted to prepare a thorough restructuring with a third and final extension to March 29, 2014. Other
   than extending the closing date to March 2014, the restructuring aimed at reallocating resources,
   reallocating non-committed funds and revising indicators.

4. Despite the previous restructuring, the project remains in a challenging situation of
   accomplishing its objective. After 7 years of implementation, the disbursement rate stands at 70% at
   7 months from the closing date. Only 2 PDO indicators out of 6 and 8 intermediate indicators out of
   14 achieved the targets. The supervision mission conducted in June 2013 assessed, in particular,
   significant delays in implementation of several IT contracts related to establishment of different PFM
   systems in total amount of US$1.3 million, as well as the procurement process for the remaining
   activities. Given slowness in disbursement, weak achievements and several contract management
   problems, the project rating was downgraded from Moderately Satisfactory (MS) to Moderately
   Unsatisfactory (MU) in the last Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) approved on
   September 10, 2013.

5. However, it is worth acknowledging that the project achieved important and tangible
   accomplishments. Moreover, given Project Implementation Unit (PIU) efforts to improve project
   management and a closer supervision by the World Bank team, the project re-launched activities that
   were inactive for longtime. While the team envisages conducting a comprehensive stocktaking

                                                    1
    exercise to better capitalize on and draw lessons from those accomplishments and sharing them with
    all the stakeholders, noteworthy achievements to date are as follows;


Component A
(1) Computerized network for budget expenditure chain (RACHAD) established (previously budget
executed manually). Issuance of payment orders through RACHAD now delegated to all Ministries
whereas previously concentrated in Ministry of Finance, which delayed budget execution;
(2) Inter-operational system, which links all public financial management systems (Treasury, Expenditure
chain, Central Bank, Taxes, Customs, Debt management), is partially completed and in place to ensure
transparent and efficient financial management;
(3) Medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) prepared in the following Ministries: Education,
Health, Water, Transport, Equipment, Housing and Urban, and Rural Development;
(4) Fiscal census identified 2500 taxpayers in 2012 against 700 in 2010. As a result, tax revenue increased
by 250% in 2012;
(5) Population census successfully completed in May 2013. The provisional number presented at the
council of ministers (3.387.868 inhabitants);
(6) E-archives of the government established in the Prime Minister's office as a part of E-government
project;
Component B
(8) A Local Development Plan prepared as part of the territorial administration reform;
Component C
(9) The Ministry of Environment created in the Prime Minister’s office and environmental policy fully
integrated into development management;
(10) National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) officially approved by the Government;
Component D
(11) Civil servant census and reconciliation of results with two existing databases successfully completed.



C. PROPOSED CHANGES

6. The proposed restructuring aims at better reflecting the measurement of PDO and intermediate
   indicators. This is contemplated through minor revision1 of some indicators to reflect current project
   circumstances. The proposed changes will better reflect the activities supported by the project and
   their contribution to the achievement of the PDO. With the proposed changes, the project will
   immediately achieve the targets of 3 PDO indicators out of 6, and 10 intermediate indicators out of
   14. In this sense, the revision would seek to contribute to improve the project rating from MU to MS.

Changes to PDO and Intermediate Indicators

7. The PDO remains unchanged. The changes in the measurement of PDO 1 and wording of the
   two intermediate indicators will better reflect project impact and adjust to current project
   circumstances. The revised indicators better articulate the causal relation between inputs, outputs and
   outcomes in the project. The revision is deemed necessary to reflect the activities that the project
   finances on the basis of the most updated project action plan for 2012-2013 prepared in line with the
   priorities of the Government in which some indicators are no longer in the project scope. Table 1

 The revision is considered only minor in so far as one of the PDO indicators is not being changed as much as re-
measured in a more meaningful way.
