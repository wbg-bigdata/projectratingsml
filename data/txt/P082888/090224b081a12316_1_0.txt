                         This US$ 13-million Mauritania Public Sector Capacity Building Project (P082888) was approved by the Board on July 6, 2006 and became effective on January 16, 2007. Due to the
                         political situation, the Bank's activities were suspended for 15 months between August 2008 and October 2009. The Project has undergone several restructuring to date. The original
                         closing date of the project, December 31, 2009, was thereafter extended for two years to December 31, 2011, then to March 2012, and further extended for a third and final time to
                         March 29, 2014.

                         The project has five components:
                         Component 1: Public Finance (45%)
                         Component 2: Local Development (7%)
                         Component 3: Environment (8%)
                         Component 4: Human Resources Management Function (21%)
                         Component 5: Support to project implementation, monitoring and evaluation (14%).
                         The remaining 5% corresponds to project preparation and contingencies.

                         As part of the restructuring, the project development objective remained unchanged, but resources were further focused on the components Public Finance & Public Procurement,
                         Human Resources Management (HRM), and Monitoring & Evaluation and implementation capacity.

                         The disbursement rate as of March 1, 2013 stands at approximately 60% (against 82% of contracting rate), and remains low considering the number of activities still to be completed
                         before the closing date of March 2014. Following a supervision mission in February 2013, the team maintained the rating of “Moderately Satisfactory? (MS) due to the low
                         disbursement rate, delays in implementation, and limited progress towards achievement of PDO indicators (2 out of 6).

                         The challenges of the project and implementation delays are due to (i) the broad variety of beneficiaries (5 ministries) which makes the coordination and project management difficult,
                         (ii) a long and complex national procurement process (duplications of roles in several commissions and frequent complaint cases), (iii) a limited level of monitoring by the project
                         committee (it was organized twice in 2012 compared to the target of at least 4 times a year foreseen in the grant agreement).

                         However, the team also noted tangible achievements of the project to date including:
                         -        a very significant improvement of tax collection following the fiscal census. Tax revenues more than doubled in 2012, and the census identified 2500 taxpayers in 2012
                         against 700 in 2009),
                         -        the reconciliation of 2 sets of public agents' HR data in the ministry of finances (payroll data) and the ministry of public service (HR data) following the census in 2008, and
                         -        the successful introduction of an expenditure tracking system (RACHAD).

                         Major remaining activities are: (i) support to the procurement reform based on the recent diagnostic work; (ii) support to tax administration; (iii) support to implementation of the PFM
                         master plan; (iv) support to the Green Growth Study; (v) interfacing the HR database and payroll system; and (vi) rehabilitation of a building of the Ministry of Environment.

                         To complete the remaining activities within the tight schedule, the pilot committee needs to be organized more frequently to assess the state of play of implementation, to discuss and
                         review/modify activities if needed, and to evaluate results and impacts. The Bank team is also strengthening supervision in calendar year 2013.

                         During the mission in February 2013, the team suggested to the government to closely follow up on certain unrealized activities representing an amount of USD 580,000 which are
                         currently unlikely to be executed. During the next supervision mission scheduled for April 2013, the team will assess the state of play and discuss necessary measures regarding
                         these activities.
