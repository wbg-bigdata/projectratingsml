MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A THIRD PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed credit to Pakistan for SDR112.8
million (US$145.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance a primary education
development project.
2.      Background.  Consistently low levels of public investment and the lack
of sustained political commitment have resulted in severe neglect of the
education system in Pakistan, especially primary education. The country's
literacy and school enrollment rates are amongst the lowest in the developing
world. Only 24Z of the population is literate and an estimated 48% of primary
school age children are enrolled in school. Rural-urban and male-female
imbalances are stark: literacy ranges from 7% for rural females to 55% for
urban males, and primary school enrollment ranges from 20% for rural girls to
77% for urban boys. In the last fifteen years the education system has barely
kept pace with the rapidly expanding school-aged population which is growing
at some 3% p.a. The low educational attainment of Pakistan's population,
particularly of women, poses serious obstacles to the country's long term
development. Increasingly, Pakistan is finding itself with a workforce
ill-equipped to compete with other emerging industrial countries, and with
a rural population unable to reap the benefits of improved agricultural tech-
nology. For the female population, gaining access to primary education is
essential not only to equip them to take advantage of ecouomic opportunities,
but also to improve the health status of their families and to facilitate the
conditions for a reduction in fertility.
3.      Neglect of the education system goes beyond the lack of schools;
teaching and learning conditions within schools are often deficient and the
quality of the education offered is both poor and generally inappropriate for
the needs of the population. Only recently has the Government begun making
serious attempts to reform these areas of neglect. Strengthening of the
country's education system, the base of which is primary education, was at the
heart of the Sixth Plan strategy. Ambitious enrollment targets for primary
education have, however, proved beyond the scope of the Plan and a number of
subsequent policy initiatives have been announced in an attempt to make up the
lost ground. These include the Priority Plan presented in 1985 for the
remaining Plan years (1986-88), a 5% import surcharge levied in 1986 to
finance a special primary education program and the recently announced Prime
Minister's Five Point Program (1986-199C) which includes a substantial rural
primary education component.



-2-
4.      Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project is concentrated in the
Punjab province. The main objective is to support the core program of the
Punjab's five-year primary education investment program. The specific objec-
tives would be to support: a) institutional development; b) implementation of
policy reform; and c) the development of innovations in the delivery of
primary education. The activities which will be supported and financed by
this project are expected to lead to increased enrollments, especially for
girls; improved quality reflected in improved learning achievements of stu-
dents; and increased efficiency in the management of primary education in the
Punjab.
5.      Proiect Description.  This is the third project which focuses on the
problems of the primary education sub-sector in Pakistan, but is also the
first in a series of major operations planned for the education sector which
will address systemic issues through policy reform, institutional and qualita-
tive improvements, as well as supporting the expansion of the system. This
project includes the following components: a) Manaaement Improvement through
the reorganization and strengthening of the Punjab's Directorate of Public
Instruction, including the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation sys-
tem; b) Curriculum Reform through the development and introduction of a new
two-stage primary school curriculum and the development of new teach-
ing/learning materials (textbooks, teachers guides etc.); c) Teacher Training
under which both the pre- and in-service training program would be revamped to
raise the quality of training - this would affect 40,000 pre-service trainees
and 17,500 in-service unqualified teachers during the project; policies intro-
duced to improve the career development prospects for primary school teachers;
and increase the number of female teachers, as well as develop incentives for
teaching in rural areas; d) Communications/Demand-Generation programs designed
to increase the participation of parents in the management of primary school-
ing, and thereby increase the demand for primary education; and e) a School
Construction and Maintenance effort which would concentrate on constructing
new schools for girls and additional classrooms for shelterless girls schools
and the maintenance of the existing stock of primary schools. The project
would finance over 20,000 now classrooms and provide over 0.8 million places
for female enrollments.
6.      The project would have two phases.  The first phase (up to December
1989) would concentrate on institutional development and policy reform
activities to complement and support the expansion of physical facilities and
training in the second phase (January 1990-June 1993). Annual reviews would
assess progress in reaching the institutional developmert, policy reform and
physical objectives of the project. The project, to be implemented over 6
years, provides funds for civil works, furniture, equipment, local costs,
training, technical assistance, consumable materials and incremental operating
costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$207.87 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$25.32 million (12%). The proposed credit of
US$145 million would finance 72% of project costs net of taxes. CIDA will
finance communications/demand generation (US$3.7 million) and the cost of



-3-
consumable materials (paper) for to'xtbook development (US$8.0 million). EEC
will finance technical assistance (US$3.5 million) and part of the costs of
construction (US$6.5 million). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disburse-
ment schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events
ar.d the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No6492-PAK, dated May 28, 1987, is being distributed separately.
7.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Goverrment has requested that IDA
play a more active role in the education sector than hitherto to support the
various initiatives of the Government. In the light of the country's inade-
quate human resource base, a stepped-up involvement in primary education is
clearly warranted; without it, Pakistan's development pace will be retarded.
Social sector development was the theme of the Country Economic Memorandum
titled "Pakistan Economic and Social Development Prospects, Volume II: The
Social Sectors" (Report Number 5962-PAK, February 18, 1986) and has been
followed up in subsequent country dialogue. The proposed project would sup-
port the Government's strong commitment to the development of primary educa-
tion and also support the institutional arrangements necessary for its expan-
sion and qualitative improvement. It builds on experience gained in the first
(and completed) pilot primary education project (Cr.892-PAK) and the on-going
Second Primary Project (Cr.1602-PAK). The latter project focuses on the
provinces of Sind, Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Province. The
proposed project therefore has the Punjab as its geographical focus.
8.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(i)   make arrangements to establish, as a condition of
credit effectiveness, the Additional Directorate of
Public Instruction in the Punjab for the purposes of
effective management of primary education;
(ii)   make arrangements to provide funds from CIDA and EEC
as a condition of credit effectiveness;
(iii)  select, as a condition of credit effectiveness,
consulting engineers;
(iv)   undertake annual reviews with IDA to assess progress
in the implementation of institutional development, policy
reforms and the introduction of im zvative programs based on
agreed criteria and a detailed action program;
(v)    introduce the integrated (two-stage) curriculum for Grades 1-3
in April 1990 and for Grades 4-5 in April 1993;



-4-
(vi)   increase the per student allocation for learning materials of
the recurrent budget to levels acceptable to IDA by FY 1993;
(vii)  review the prices presently set 'or school textbooks by
February, 1989 and thereafter agree with IDA on a suitable
new pricing schedule;
(viii) take niecessary measures to hire female teachers, and by
April 30, 1988 establish a plan so that by t1-c end of
1993 the number of female teachers would meet the
ratio of 1:40 female students enrolled;
(ix)   undertake a study to review existing incentives to teachers,
and by February 1990, develop and implement non-monetary
incentives for service in rural areas;
(x)    carry out studies in accordance with terms of reference
satisfactory to the Association on how to strengthen the
present teacher career system; complete the study and
review the findings with IDA by December 1988, and
implement such a system in the 1989 school year;
(xi)   introduce by the 1988 school year, flexible scheduling of
school hours and calendars in all Provinces and districts
where this does not presently apply; and
(xii)  carry out a study on the maintenance of primary schools,
complete it by December 1988, and starting July 1989 make an
adequate annual budgetary allocation for the maintenance of
primary schools.
9.      Justification.  Real momentum for the development of primary education
is now evident in Pakistan.  The proposed credit presents an opportunity to
reinforce this trend through supporting increased access to primary education,
especially for girls, and at the same time supporting quality improvement in
the primary schools and more effective management of the primary education
system. In the longer term this will result in more relevant and effective
primary education. Given the extremely low literacy levels and in particular
the low participation rate of girls in primary education, additional invest-
ment in this sub-sector, with girls as a target group, is essential.  Such
investments are expected to yield high economic and social returns through:
(i) increased productivity in both urban and rural settings; (ii) improved
healti  and nutritional status of both reci; ents of education and their
families; and (iii) in the longer run, a decline in fertility rates.
10.     Risks.  The operation is large and complex and is concerned with three
difficult areas: institutional development, sectoral policy reform and physi-
cal expansion. There is a risk that the Punjab government's implementation



-5-
capacity will not be adequate to the task. This risk is reduced by the two
phase approach which calls for institutional and managerial improvements to be
given priority in the early years of the project to support the major physical
expansion and training programs under the program. The risk is further
reduced by the inclusion of a monitorable Action Program in the project's
design and the inclusion of managerial in-' .rvice training and technical
assistance. Traditional community and parental attitudes towards the educa-
tion of girls also pose a risk to tie activities designed to improve their
educational opportunities. Measures to reduce this risk are included in the
project, namely the appointment and training of female administrators,
teachers and supervisors and monitoring and evaluation activities to con-
tinuously assess progress in girls' education. These measures are reinforced
by communications activities which link parents and the community to the
school and aim at increasing the understanding of the value of education for
girls.
11.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
