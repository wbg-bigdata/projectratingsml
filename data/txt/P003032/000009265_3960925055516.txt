KWILU-NGONGO SUGAR PROJECT (CR. 1089-ZR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Kwilu-Ngongo
Sugar Project, for which Cr. 1089-ZR in the amount of SDR 20.2 million was
approved on December 9, 1980. The credit was closed on December 31, 1987, one
year behind schedule. It was disbursed for 99.4% and the last disbursement was
on March 8, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Division, South-Central and
Indian Ocean Department of the African Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III). On June 2, 1988, the Bank requested the Compagnie
Sucriare Kwilu Ngongo, the executing agency, to prepare Part II which it received
with a final project report on July 25, 1989. The Government of Zaire did not
respond to requests for further comment.
The preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank supervision
mission of the project in November 1986, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report and Working Papers, the Credit, Guarantee and Project Agreement
and Subsidiary Loan Agreement; Supervision Reports: correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower and Executing Agency (and its completion report); and
internal Bank memoranda.

KWILU-NGONGO SUGAR PROJECT (Cr. 1089-ZR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.          Commercial sugar production datets back to 1925, when a Belgian
company SOGESUCRE established a sugar plantation, Kwilu-Ngongo, in Bas-Zaire.
Next came a plantation in Kiliba, in South-Kivu, in 1958. Sugar production
reached a peak of 63,400 tons of mill-white sugar in 1975, but annual imports
of about 10,000 tons were needed to satisfy demand.   Since Government
nationalized the estates, production dropped to about 47,000 tons while
population increases raised estimated demand levels to 100,000 tons.  In
December 1976, Government restored 602 of the capital of the sugar estates to
the original owners and allowed private management to be reestablished.
Further studies of the sugar industry revealed that the quickest way to
obtain production increases was to rehabilitate and expand the existing
estates. Subsequently, IDA funded, with co-financing of the Caisse Centrale
de Cooperaticn Economique (CCCE), the proposed project aiming at a 70%
production increase for the local market.  The present Completion Report
covers the experience of this project.
Objectives
2.          The project was designed to: rehabiliT.te the existing factory,
expand the milling capacity from 3,000 to 5,O,U0 tons of cane per day,
increase the sugar production of Kwilu-Ngongo from 38,000 to 65,000 tons of
sugar in 1985, and to carry out pilot projects aiming to improve living
standards of the rural population in the region. Total project costs were
estimated at US$ 80.4 million at appraisal and -,ould be financed for 67% from
external funding from IDA (33X) and CCCE (34%), and for 33% from local
funding provided by the CS The credit proceeds were made available to the
Compagnie Sucriere (CS) through a subsidiary loan, to be repaid in 15 years,
bearing a 15% interest rate, and a 5 year grace period with the sub-borrower
carrying the foreign exchange risk. The project's financing prospects were
based on the assumption that incremental production had an assured local
market and on agreements that Government would adjust sugar prices so as to
allow reasonable profits, and allocate adequate foreign exchange to import
necesuary inputs.  The cost price structure and profit criteria were not
defined at the appraisal stage.
Implementation Experience
3.          The  industrial  rehabilitation  program  was  carried  out
satisfactorily within the planned four year period and far below estimated
costs (US$ 64.1 million vs. US$ 80.4 million). The adjustments identified



during implementation were carried out later on within the project period and
financed by using part of the remaining project funds.
4.          The agricultural program was also carried out ahead of time, and
the planted area exceeded projections by 101. However, the management put
more emphasis on additional investment and expansion rather than on
consolida.ion and productivity, and rigorous application of known production
systems.  As a result, cane yields remained much below expectations.  The
disastrous decision to extend the sugar campaign of 1984 to 210 days, well
into the rainy season, in order to arrive at a 50,000 tons of sugar
productioa, reduced the chances of improvement and the low yields (56 tons of
cane/ha as compared to the estimated 90 tons) contributed to the financial
difficulties  of CS.    However,  the CS  changed  its policies  in 1986,
consolidateng its sugar operation, and improving cultivation techniques,
which led to higher cane yields and better factory efficiency. The changes
proved to be successful and the CS will likely attain the originally planned
yields and the corresponding incremental sugar production of 65,000 ton by
1991, compared to an appraisal estimate of 1985.
5.          The difficult inflationary circumstances prevailing at appraisal
implied high risks  for Government  in providing  the  necessary  foreign
exchange, as well as for the sub-borrower in accepting repayment in foreign
exchange.  Also, the agreed pricing policy, including a guaranteed profit,
invited financial indiscipline and the financial position of the compA_ny
turned out to be far less favorable than expected.   The CS had to face
various unforeseen developments:  a major devaluation of the local currency
in 1983 followed since by heavy monetary erosion; the liberalization of
imports  combined with a steep drop  in world market  sugar prices  and
Government's reluctance to let domestic sugar prices follow the company's
cost price increases, without renewed sub-sector review. Also, the CS was
not able to obtain sufficient foreign exchange for the import of basic
inputs.   Government did establish a sugar import duty to protect Import
dumping, but this did not allow the company to service its debts in foreign
exchange. IDA repeatedly urged both the Government to review the situation
and to renegotiate the subsidiary loan agreement with the CS, and the company
to improve its management and reduce operating costs.
6.          By end 1988, Government and the company reached an agreement to
reschedule CS debt:   Government accepted the foreign exchange risk, thus
subsidizing in fact the CS's development.  The CS debt was converted into
current zaires at the 1988 exchange rate, and divided in two parts: one made
up of the total arrears of wnich 102 would be repaid immediately and the
balance in 10 years, bearing a 7% moratory interest rate; and one of the
remainder of the loan not in arrears to be repaid in 8 years, bearing a 41
interest rate. CS has already made its first repayments and it has improved
its management structure and expects to obtain the original production target
by  1991,  and  to  further  reduce  operating  costs.   The  issue of  the
availability of sufficient foreign exchange to ensure the import of equipment
and supplies necessary for proper operations, has however not been resolved;
the CS is presently able to cover about 50% of its needs.

Results
7.          As a r6sult of the delays in obtaining yield improvement, the
effects of devaluation and scat , foreign exchange, and reduced international
sugar prices, the project shows negative rates of return (-121 for the
financial rate of return and -82 for the economic rate of return).
Sustainabilitv
8.          After the transfer of the foreign exchange risk from the CS to
Government, the company achieved for the first time a positive net revenue
level in 1989, with a prospect of future increases due to improving
productivity.    However,  if the foreign exchange risk had remained CS
responsibility, the company would not have had any future.  The financial
status of the CS also remains subject to the availability of sufficient
foreign exchange, which is not ensured. Consequently, the future viability
of the company and of increased and sustained sugar production are, at best,
uncertain.
Findinzs and Lessons Learned
9.          The basic idea incorporated in project design, that the best way
to increase sugar production in the short term in Zaire was to rehabilitate
and expand the existing sugar estates, and that an experienced private
company would manage project funds efficiently, has proven to be correct.
Rehabilitation investments have on the whole been carried out efficiencly, on
time and within project estimates; adjustments, when necessary, were quickly
decided and carried out.   Overall production increases,  however,  were
seriously delayed and combined with pricing, macroeconomic and policy
Impediments to result in the poor overall returns on project investmex.t.
10.         Important lessons were as follows:
(a)   imposing the foreign exchange risk of the loan on the sub-
borrower is a very high risk proposition in a situation in which the overall
economic and financial climate is highly unstable, especially if the
commodity produced with the investment is destined only for the domestic
market. In the event, it proves - as do other IDA investments in Zaire with
private companies, e.g. cotton palm oil - that such investments may be
technically sound, but financially disastrous without economic stability;
(b)   already a;i appraisal, it could bA foreseen that the project
would be very risky in e.conomic terms as, even at the assumed shadow exchange
rate, sugar was produced at twice the equivalent import substitution price.
Although this has substantially improved since, CS' sugar prices in 1988 were
still well above the CIF Kinshasa import price (by about 41%), and protected
by the 50% import tariff. In terms of the ROR, therefore, this project is
likely to have been a failure but it is not excluded that plantation
efficiencies can be improved (particularly in yields) ane unit costs brought
down; and



- vi -
(c) the project has not contributed to the formulation of a
national sugar policy.  This is acutely lackinE at a time when Government
wants to make considerable investments in a new sugar plantation, which is
questionable both from the financial and the economic point of view.

KWILU-NGONGO SUGAR PROJECT (Cr. 1089-ZR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.01     Sector  development  oblectives.    After  the  highly  regulatory
agricultural policies in the seventies, Government prepired an agricultural
recovery program based on price liberalization, decentralization, and greater
participation by the private sector. To stimulate this participation, the
Government established in 1978 an Economic Recovery Fund to be funded by
special sales taxes. The Fund was to be used to finance priority development
projects,  engaged in a productive activity.   Private enterprises could
implement such projects on their own or subcontract them to other entities,
under implementation agreements with the Government's Executive Council. The
recovery program would also give a priority status to agro-indu4triis based
on local raw materials and include, inter alia, additional foreign exchange
for the purchase of raw materials and spare parts for local industries. The
project supported the Government policy of increasing local sugar production
and it also stressed the need to develop a national sugar policy.
1.02     The suaar subsector.   Sugarcane is grown all over Zaire,, but
commercial production and processing into mill-white sugar was concentrated
in two plantations Kwilu-Ngongo (Bas-Zaire) and Kiliba (Kivu). There are no
precise data on small farmer sugarcane production (estimated at about 250,000
tons per annum), mainly for chewing and artisan liquor production.   The
overall annual estate production in the 1976-1979 period averaged 50,000 tons
of sugar, while domestic demand was estimated at 100,000 tons. Since scarce
foreign exchange did not allow substantial Imports, acute shortages occurred
periodically.   Government's strategy at the time wa  to increase local
production.  Various firms carried out five feasibility studies, of which
only the Lotikila estate in Haut-Zaire came to fruition in 1984. In 1977,
the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program reviewed the sugar industry in Zaire,
in cooperation with the World Bank Industrial Sector Survey Mission.  It
appeared from the review, that domestic supplies could best be improved La
the short run by rehabilitating and expanding the sugar estate of Kwilu-
Ngongo.
1.03     The project was linked to sector objectives and policies by aiming
at increased food production and the replacement of sugar imports. rt was
supposed to seek participation of the private sector in rural development,
by providing funds for agricultural pilot projects in areas neighboring the
sugar cane plantation, with a view to develop the aroas as a whole and to
improve labor supply to the sugar company.   The pilot projects were to
receive financing from the Economic Recovery Fund.   Although Government
supports price liberalization, it influenced domestic sugar prices
substantially throughout project implementation.
1.04     Domestic plantation sugar production will likely reach the 90,000
ton level in 1990. However, both recorded imports of sugar and unrecorded



imports from neighboring countries, estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000
tons per annum, are continuing. Demand is expected to surpass local supply
for a long period, due to population Lncreases and extremely low consumption
per capita, currently at 4 kg. A national sugar policy is still lacking.
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
2.01     Proiect oblectives.  The objective of the project was to increase
sugar production from 38,000 to 65,000 tons, through the rehabilitation of
10,800 ha of existing plantation, the extension of the plantation by 2,700
ha, the improvement of the cane transport system and the rehabilitation and
extension of the processing facilities to a milling capacity of 5,000 tons
of cane per day.
2.02     Project description.  The  project provided for:
a)    rehabilitation of the existing plantation (early replanting)
and its extension from about 10,800 to about 13,500 ha;
b)    provision of equipment for land preparation, cultivation, and
harvesting;
c)    provision of equipment for sugarcane transport and
plantation track maintenance, the modification of some
existing transport equipment, and infrastructure (about 10 km
of rail track);
d)    rehabilitation asd expansion of cane processing
facilities;
e)    construction of various civil works related to extension of
the factory and construction of offices, social infrastructure
facilities and staff and workers accommodation;
£)    design and implementatiot of an applied sugarcane research
program;
5)    recruitment of technical assistants and local staff for the
detailed design, assembly and start-up operations of the
factory extensions and for the agricultural research program,
h)    training of local staff;
i)    installation of an improved electronic data processing
system; and
j)    pilot projects to promote food crop production and improve the
living conditions of the rural population.
2.03     The project was scheduled to be carried out over four years. The
Bank would finance the agricultural components and ancillary improvements



3-
and the pilot projects.  The factory rehabilitation and expansion would be
financed by t.e CCCE (Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique), and the
Compagnie Sucriere would finance the civil works and operating expenses.
3. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
3.01     Project design and organization was clear and straight forward,
following proven experience in Zaire and the suga.. industry.   The pilot
projects were not detailed, allowing flexibility to adapt these projects to
local circumstances. However, one of the objectives, to promote the dialogue
with Government on t-he development of the Bas-Zaire province, was probably
out of focus, because such an approach would have required a more detailed
and separite organizational set-up.   In the end these projects were not
successful (para 5.05).
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.01     Factory program.   The factory rehabilitation and expansion were
implemented within the planned period, and much below estimated costs. The
primary reasons for these cost savings were: (_j speedy implementation of the
project, avoiding inflation induced cost increases; (ii) lower than estimated
costs by using ICB and local assembly; (iii) reduced use of expatriate
manpower for the design, planning, implementation and start-up of the factory
program; and (iv) reduction of local costs in US dollar terms, especially
labor, due to the rapid devaluation of the zaire.
4.02     The new boiler and the 3,000 ton/canelday tandem for cane crushing,
financed by the CCCE, were commissioned 10 months ahead of planning. Part
of the remas.lng funds of the CCCE credit were used for additional spare
parts of the n_ tandem, boiler and pipes and valves, as well as to finance
an IRAT mission for improvement of cultivation techniques. The new tandem
performed as planned and milled slightly over 3,000 tons!cane/day. The use
of the new boiler reduced drastically the consumption of diesel oil during
the campaign, from over 2 million liters in 1983 to about 50,000 liters in
1985. Additional bagasse storage and drying capacity for the boiler will
further reduce die3el oil consumption and down-time, due to the lack of
steam.
4.03     During the first year of operation of the expanded factory various
shortcomings were identified. The required improvements to solve them were
carried out in the 1984-1985 period, and financed under the IDA credit,
because no CCCE funds were available. The IDA funds became available from
economies under other categories and from unutilized pilot project funds.
The proposed corrections were necessary to ensure the 5,000 tons of cane/day
milling capacity and to reduce factory losses. The financed items consisted
of a pumping station to safeguard the water supply to the factory; the reform
of the cane unloading station for the existing cane mills, including two
overhead cranes; expanded filter capacity and improved evaporation and
crystallization facilities;  and increased sugar storage capacity.   The
factory milled in the 1984 campaign an average of 4,800 tons of cane per day
(compared to an estimated 5,000 tons), and sugar factory losses were reduced
to below 2Z of sugar content.



- 4 -
4.04     Cane transport.  Cane transport was carried out before the project
by rail, tractor and truck. The project planned to eliminate transport by
truck and to increase rail transport.   Truck transport was eliminated in
1982, but cane transport by rail and tractor encountered continued
difficulties due to late arrival and factory faults in delivered equipment,
and problems at the cane overloading stations in the field. The planned 850
cane wagons (550 modified and 300 new) were not available in time. Also the
CS wished to postpone the planned railroad to a distant new cane area,
because the company acquired an area in between the main area and the
originally planned new area. Since new railroad plans had to be worked out,
temporary transport by road was approved, with the additional tractor,
trailer and trans-loading equipment.  After many initial difficulties the
cane transport was reasonably under control by 1987, with about 75%
transported directly by rail, at a satifactory averag2 wagon load, and 25%
by tractor.
4.05     Production.    To increase cash revenues  to finance the inter-
campaign period and to keep its promise to produce 55,000 tons of sugar in
,984, the CS decided to extend the 1984 campaign, well into the wet season,
to 210 days, instead of the optimal length of 160 days. This decision had
major negative consequences leadir.g to i) an average extraction rate of 7.62
(as compared to a normal rate of 10.5%); ii) a breaking of the replanting
cycle resulting in a decrease of cane yields in the following years; iii)
soil compaction due to tractor work on wet soil; and iv) excessive cane and
sugar production costs. CS management agreed in 1985 not to extend future
campaigns beyond November and to increase daily production by about 452.
This has permitted to reduce unit production costs and to improve replanting
and field maintenance. Soil improvements were also considered necessary to
reduce soil acidity, increase the content of organic matter and to increase
soil tillage. The Bank financed the purchase of tillage machinery as well
as of tipping trucks to transport the filtercake to the field to increase the
pH, and the purchase of a fibre press used to produce fibre bales for easy
transport to the field for on site composting and to increase the content of
organic matter in the soil.  Cane yields have gradually increased from 40
t/ha in ;984 to reach 56 t/ha by 1989, but still remain much below the 90
t/ha estimated at appraisal.   Yields of 70 t/ha and 80 t/ha should be
obtained in the longer run (para 6.02).
4.06     The appraisal report foresaw that 2,700 ha additional would be
raplanted during project implementation.   Actual new plantation stood at
4,200 ha at the end of 1987.
4.07     Pilot proiects.   Several pilot projects were presented early on
during project implementation.   IDA s quired proof of financial viability
and clarification of the sources of financing and financing terms, before
taking a position. The CS changed its strategy afterwards and carried out
some food crop developments in the Luala valley, with its own funds and
financing by the Economic Recovery Fund. The result. were unconvincing, and
financial viability was not clearly demonstrated. The CS concluded in 1985
a technical assistai.ce agreement with Belgian bilateral aid in an effort to
reduce the management burden of the Luala project. After its own internal



. 5 -
management reorganization in 1986, the CS withdrew from all ancillAry and
pilot projects.   Much time and effort, which should have been directed
towards improved sugar cane cultivation, were spent on pilot projects during
a critical rehabilitation period of the sugar estate. The lesson to be drawn
is that such projects can be justified only after the company's main activity
is under firm control, and if the company sees a firm motivation for its own
requirements.
4.08     Research.  The appraisal report foresaw that trials would be carried
out on all relevant aspects of sugar cane production on the CS estate and the
testing and selection of new cane varieties in order to reduce the dependency
on two old varieties. Research trials were started with some delays but were
conducted  in  a  satisfactory  manner.    The  trials  resulted  in  the
identification of four new promising varieties.  The CS did not develop a
long term research strategy.
4.09     Extension.   The closir  date was extended once by one year to
December 31, 1987, in order to allow disbursement of the remaining SDR
245,000 for the procurement of equipment and spare parts. By the time of the
revised closing date, procurement was completed and a balance of SDR 117,632
was cancelled.
5. PROJECT COSTS
5.01     Total Actual Costs are estimated at USS 64.1 million compared to USS
80.4  million  at  appraisal.    Project  costs  were  lower  due  to  the
implementation of the factory program much below estimated costs (para 4.01),
changes in the planned rail road (para 4.04), and ths cancellation of the
piLot projects  (para 4.07).   In addition, local costs were lower than
estimated due to the rapid depreciation of the zaire. Part of the savings
were used for investments identified during supervision.
5.02     Disbursements:  Estimated and actual disbursements of Cr. 1089-ZR
are given in Tables 3A and 3B, Part III. Disbursements followed expectations
at appraisal fairly closely as a result of the efficient implementation of
the project and the reallocation of the project savings for other investments
identified during implementation (para 4.02-4.03).
5.03     Credit Allocation:   The original and revised allocation of the
proceeds of Cr.  1089-ZR is shown in Table 4C, Part III.  The original
allocations were revised on March 15, 1985, in order to reflect changes as
a result of the new investment requirements identified during supervision
missions.
6. PROJECT RESULTS
6.01     Technical aspects. The rehabilitation and expansion of the factory
provided the estate with a processing facility, that can work efficiently
with low sugar losses if managed well. At the present stage with a 5,000
ton/day milling capacity the factory could produce 65,000 tons of sugar.
Further expansion of production is feasible, but not economically justified
without substantial improvements in productivity per ha and per employee.



6.02     Cane production results have on the whole been disappointing. While
now and replanted area under cane has exceeded appraisal estimates (15,800
ha versus 12,400 ha), productivity, expressed in tons of cane/has, went up
only 152 in eight years, as compared to the expected 1002. Recent management
improvements (particularly in planting techniques) is likely to further
increase productivity.   Appraisal estimates were somewhat optimistic as
insufficient account was taken of the low soil fertility of newly opened
areas. The projected average yields of 90 t/ha at appraisal appear to be
optimistic. CS obtained before 1984 yields of 70 t/ha to 80 tlha, and these
appear to be obtainable on an average basis over the whole cane area in the
longer run.
6.03     Financial aspects.  At appraisal, a serious issue emerged as IDA's
condition that the final borrower (CS) would have to carry the foreign
exchange risk,, wa  strongly resisted by the latter.   In the end, this
resistance was overcome only by the stipulation that in annual reviews
between CS and Government on wholesale sugar prices charged by CS, Government
would agree to price adjustments to a level needed to give CS a reasonable
return on its capital. The assumptions behind this agreement were that if
sugar prices would move more or less in line with inflation and that, if
exchange rate adjustments would also move in line with net inflation, CS
would be able to purchase sufficient foreign exchange to pay off its debt
without harming its financial viability.
6.04     Due to the very unstable financial and economic climate in Zaire
during the implementation period, however, all the above financial agreements
fell apart. Due to rapid inflation, Government was very hesitant in agreeing
to CS' price adjustment requests, and did so usually only partially and after
long delayts.   As a result, over the 1981-1988 period, while inflation
increased about 26 times, sugar prices went up by only 16 times.   Most
importantly, however, the local currency devalued much faster against the
dollar than inflation rates, about 62 times in the 1981-88 period. Thus,
paying back the debt in foreign exchange and paying interest on it in foreign
exchange would have bankrupted the company (as was clearly shown on its
balance sheet and in its cash flow position) and CS obtained a moratorium on
its payments. In 1985, Government tried to assist CS in overcoming three
problems by rescheduling accumulated interest charges, suspending tax
payments and extending benefits of the investment code, but these measures
only had a short term impact. By end 1988, Government and the company came
to an agreement to reschedule CS debt:  Government accepted the foreign
exchange risk, thus subsidizing in fact the CS's development. The CS debt
was converted into current zaires at the 1988 exchange rate, and divided in
two parts: one made up of the total arrears of which 102 would be repaid
Immediately and the balance in 10 years, bearing a 7X moratory interest rate;
and one of the remainder of the loan not in arrears to be repaid in 8 years,
bearing a 4% interest rate. CS has already made its first repayments and has
improved its management structure.   The company expects to obtain the
original production target by 1991 and to further reduce operating costs.
The issue of the availability of sufficient foreign exchange to ensure the
import of equipment and supplies necessary for proper operations, has however
not been resolved; the CS is presently able to cover about 50 of its needs.



-I -
As * result of the above influences, the project shows negativ, rates of
return (-12S for the financial rate of return and -81 for the economic rate
of return).
6.05     Economic results.  The ex-post economic rate of return Was found to
be negative as against 17.51 during appraisal.   The** two figures are
difficult to compare as the appraisal calculations were based on incremental
investments resulting in incremental production.  Investments made during
project implementation in fact benefitted the CS sugar activities as a whole.
For this reason it has been assumed in the PCR calculation that the lack of
investments (without project) would have resulted in a decreasing production
(from 36,000 tons in 1981 to 0 in 1989).  The difference between actual
production and the resulting one without project has been considered a direct
result of project investments. The calculation was carried out over a 20
year project life. All costs and benefits were expressed in 1981 constant
US dollars. Costs were calculated by using the average yearly exchange rate
and adjusted by the MUV index for the period. The calculation of benefits
is based on the import-substitution value of sugar.
6.06     The main reason for the low actual ERR is the sharply lower world
market price for sugar, both during the implementation period and in future
forecasts, compared with the appraisal estimates.   The average  import
substitution price for sugar for purposes of the PCR was estimated at US$ 352
versus US$ 619 at the time for appraisal.
6.07     Sustainabilitv.  After the trans.#ar of the foreign exchange risk
from the CS to Government, the company acaieved for the first time a positive
net revenue level in 1989, with a prospect of future increases due to
improving productivity. However, if the foreign exchange risk had remained
CS responsibility, the company would not have had any future.
7. PARTICIPANTS PERFORMANCE
7.01     Borrowers Performance.   Although the drastic devaluation of the
zairian currency had an overriding financial impact on the CS, the non-
compliance of two important covenants of the development credit agreement,
also influenced negatively the company's financial results: the provision of
adequate foreign exchange (section 4.02) and the adjustment of sugar prices
(section  4.04).    The  former  obliged  the  CS  at  an  early  stage  of
implementation to acquire expensive foreign exchange on the parallel market
and the latter was the cause that after 1983 the increase of the sugar price
lagged behind the general cost increases.   However, the Government took
various measures (para 6.03) to ensure that the CS could continue covering
recurrent costs, until a final settlement was reached on the debt structure
of the company.   The final arrangement, reached after the credit closing
date, not been submitted to IDA for consultation. This is in contravention
to section 3.01 (b) of the development credit agreement, in particular
because this agreement departed from the principal assumptions of the
project: that the CS would carry the foreign exchange risk of the credits,
and that the interest rate would follow market levels.
7.02     Sub-borrower's performance.  The CS's overall performance has been



- 8 -
generally good with the exception of the 1984 decision to extend the 1984
harvest campaign to 210 days. The consequences of this decision are being
remedied. However, the negative effects of such a major error can only be
overcome over a longer period.
7.03     Bank performance.  The Bank's performance was good during project
implementation, particularly in detecting the effects of the 1984 decision
to extend the campaign. This permitted to explain to the CS the consequences
of such a decision and was instrumental in convincing CS management not to
repeat such a mistake.   During project appraisal the Bank identified the
foreign exchange risk issue and the appraisal report provided for this risk
to be eliminated by a pricing covenant requiring government to set prices for
sugar ensuring a minimum return to the company.   This solution utterly
failed, first because of the rapid inflation and devaluation of the Zaire and
second because Government was reluctant to follow each year CS's proposals
for a full compensation of inflation. Another area where Bank performance
was weak concerned the assumptions made on yields which proved unrealistic
as well as on the economic analysis because the project investments did not
benefit only the incremental production of CS as defined in the SAR but its
overall production and processing functions, and because estimated sugar
prices were considerably higher than those occurred in practice.
7.04     Participants relationshig.  The relationship between the project
cofinanciers was excellent during project implementation. The relationship
between the cofinanciers and the CS, the Government was also very good. The
relationship between the CS and the Government was however often tense
primarily due to issues relating to the foreign exchange risk on CS debt
service, and relating to sugar pricing.



PART II - REVIEW BY THE BORROWER
Adequacy and accuracy of factual information in Part II.   The
project data defining the project profile at completion as presented in
Part III was prepared on the basis of documentation established by the
borrower. It was divided into the various tables presented in Part III.
Evaluation of Bank's performance. Bank personnel were recognized
as professional and helpful during project implementation. The borrower has
sent the Bank a recent correspondence indicating its satisfaction with the
role played by the Bank during implementation.
Evaluation of Borrower's own performance. In general CS management
has been strong and technically capable and the successful implementation of
project activities ahead of schedule is mainly due to t'he quality of CS
management. Procurement of equipment and civil works was well managed mostly
due to the availability of PPF financed technical assistance which enabled
the CS to have all tender documents finalized at project effectiveness and
resulted in prompt and efficient procurement.
Maior lessons learned. In order to increase production in the short
run, the CS took the decision to extend the 1983 campaign to 210 days instead
of the normal 150 days. This considerably affected yields which dropped by
about 25Z. The CS has since substantially reduced the length of the campaign
which has resulted in an acceptable level of yields.  The CS's desire to
increase production in 1983/1984 has also resulted in new planting on soils
with low fertility, with an increase in maintenance costs and a decrease in
average fertilizer use for lack of foreign currency to purchase inputs.
After changes within the CS's management team in 1986, the situation has
improved and sugar cane yield has increased from 40 t/ha in 1986 to 56 t/ha
in 1989.   The lack of inputs has nevertheless continued to be a serious
problem affecting soil fertility and has forced the CS to cancel some capital
investments to purchase a minimum of inputs. This situation is causing the
CS's equipment to be less performing than it should.

* Schedule 2 of the Development Credit Agreement states that the project is
deemed to be completed if t (i) the physical facilities included in the
project are completed; (iU) the facilities have operated at least 902 of its
designed capacity during one sugar harvest season; and (iii) 60,000 tons of
sugar have been produced during a period of 12 consecutive months.  The
points sub (i) and (ii) have been complied with, in 1985. Point (iii) was
not attained at the same time, due to delays in CS's attention to soil and
cane quality, and a decision to extend the harvest period 1984 to 210 days.
However CS poliey was reversed in 1985 and production is on the rise,
reaching 57,000 tons in the 1988 campaign ending 11/15188, with a prospect

of 60,000 tons in 1990.
The following issues were raised at the various stages of the
project cycle:
During pre-appraisal: the financing gap; company ownership; project benefits;
markets and prices.
During appraisal: justification of a preparation facility; retroactive
financing; eligibility of equipment for IDA financing; retrocession
arrangemerts; foreign exchange needs for financing of recurrent costs; and
co-financing options.
During decision meeting: satisfactory completion of the retrocession
agreement between Government and SOGESUCRE; retroactive financing and
assurances that Government would make available sufficient foreign exchange.
At negotiations: the subsidiary loan agreement, in particular Government's
obligation to inscribe in the annual budget of the Conseil Executif an
adequate amount of foreign exchange for the company to cover its operating
costs, and to establish a mechanism for price adjustments in case of a
devaluation of the zairian currency; and the financing plan.
During supervision: availability of foreign exchange; impact of the September
1983 devaluation of the zairian currency on CS cash flow, debt/equity ratio
and capital structure; sugar price setting and sugar import tariffs; the need
for a national sugar policy; the harvesting cycle and the estate's
operational efficiency.
