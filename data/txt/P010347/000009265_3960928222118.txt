REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT OF SDR 68.3 MILLION
(US$90 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC 0F SRI LANKA
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Economic
Restructuring Credit (ERG) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
for SDR 68.3 million (US$)O million equivalent) on standard IDA terms.
2.    The  proposed  ERC would  support  the Government's  efforts  aimed  at
stabilizing the economy and implementing the structural reforms outlined in the
second-year Policy Framework Paper (PFP) discussed by the Committee of the Whole
and by the IMF Board in October 1989, when a second-year SAF was also approved.
In addition to addressing the country's serious internal and external imbalances,
the focus of the ERC is on: (i) the public sector, its size, its claims on
resources and the efficiency with which it uses such resources; (ii) the
development of the private sector through improvements in the existing regulatory
framework and incentive system and through transfer to the private sector of
activities and assets now being managed by the public sector; and (iii) improving
the consumption levels of the poorest segments of society.
3.    An economic memorandum on Sri Lanka (Report No. 8193-CE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 18, 1989. The report reviewed: recent
economic developments and how they were influenced by Sri Lanka's political
problems; the Government's recent stabilization program; and the role of aid
in financing the balance of payments in 1990 and beyond to ensure the success
of the new Government's economic program.
I. Sri Lanka's Development Strategy and Adjustment Issues
A. Background
4.    Sri Lanka is well known for its achievements in the social areas, poor
growth performance after Independence in 1948, and for implementing in 1977 one
of the most radical liberalization efforts in the developing world.   The
country's unsatisfactory growth performance results from a development strategy
which, for several decades prior to 1977, relied on inward looking
industrialization and increasing government intervention in the economy. The
net result of these policies was stagnation; rates of unemployment as high as
242 of the labor force during the 1970's; recurr ut balance of payments crises
and foreign exchange shortages. Poor economic performance was the main reason
for the reorientation in policies in 1977, when the trade regime was liberalized
and government interferences in the functioning of markets were substantially
reduced. The economy responded well generating new sources of economic activity
and export earnings. At 5-7Z per year during '1978-85, GDP growth reached an
unprecedented high level and unemployment declined to 122 in the early 1980's.
5.    Since the mid-1980's, however, slow growth, macro-economic imbalances,
and high unemployment have re-emerged as serious problems.  There are three
reasons for this recent deterioration in economic performance: (i) the macro-
economic policies pursued since 1977 led to unsustainably large deficits in the



-2-
external and internal accounts; (ii) the Government did not carry the break with
the pre-1977 development strategy beyond the liberalization of trade, financial
markets, and prices, i.e. it did not reduce the size of the public sector nor
did it address the root causes for its inefficiency; and (iii) the outbreak of
the ethnic conflict in 1983 in the North and East of the Island, compounded by
the resurgence of terrorism in the South after a Peace Accord was signed with
India in July 1987, put heavy pressures on the budget and has been responsible
for drastic losses in output, and reduced foreign investment and tourism.
B. Macro-Economic Imbalances
6.    Macro-economic problems emerging after 1977 have to do with several inter-
related factors: ti) the excessive size of the public sector, which employs over
20S of the country's labor force (i.e., 1.25 million people out of a labor force
of about 6 million); (ii) the relatively high levels of assistance from the aid
comxunity to support the 1977 liberalization of the economy (with commitments
at about 152 of GDP in the late 1970's and 112 in the 1980's) enabling the
Government to undertake overly ambitious expenditure programs which crowded out
the private sector; (iii) the country's access to international capital markets
after 1977 and its ability to borrow on commercial terms until 1984; and (iv)
the Government's reluctance to adjust the exchange rate for fear of exacerbating
inflation. These factors throughout the 1980's led to large deficits in the
current and fiscal accounts; high debt service ratios; critically low levels of
foreign exchange reserves and inflation rates which are relatively high by South
Asian standards.

7.    Far from reducing the role of government in the economy,  the 1977
liberalization program increased it. The availability of external finance both



from donors and commercial sources led the Government to expand its investment
program. Current expenditures rose both as a result of increased public sector
employment and of public corporations in need of budgetary support after they
were exposed to market forces and international coutpetition. As total government
expenditures soared, so did fiscal deficits in spite of Sri Lanka's relatively
high tax-GDP ratio which gradually increased from a historical 16-17? of GDP to
slightly over 202 of GDP in the mid-1980's. The fiscal deficit for the period
of 1978-1987 averaged 14t of GDP, about half of which was financed by grants and
concessional loans and the other half by domestic borrowing. At close to one-
half of national savings, this level of domescic borrowing has been the main
cause for relatively high real interest rates. On average, commercial lending
rates have been at about 101 per year in real terms in recent years.
8.    Together with the commodity boom of the late 1970's, the government-led
expansion  in  aggregate  demand  exacerbated  inflation.        Because  of  an
insufficiently flexible exchange rate, inflation led in turn to a gradual
appreciation of the real exchange rate in the first half of the 1980's. This
appreciation impeded a more vigorous development and diversification of the
export sector and contributed to a current account deficit which averaged 16?
of GDP in 1980-82--with a gradual decline to around 102 of GDP thereafter. As
part of this deficit was financed through commercial borrowing up until 1984,
debt service ratios increased from 14? of exports if goods and services in 1978
to 302 in 1988. Commercial debt reached one-third of the country's medium- and
long-term debt by the mid-1980's, although, by end-1988, it had declined to 202,
i.e. US$850 million out of US$4.5 billion. Thus, the good growth performance
after liberalization can be explained by a once-and-for-all gain in efficiency
that followed eliminating many of the market distortions prevailing before 1977,
complemented by an expansionary fiscal policy. How'ver, as a large share of the
country's resources was diverted from the private se7:tor and absorbed in public
expenditure programs with disappointing returns to the economy, this growth could
not be sustained.
C. The Size of the Public Sector and Its Use of Resources
9.    Concentration and inefficient use of a large share of the country's
economic resources in the public sector has been one of the main obstacles to
achieving more rapid economic growth. Evidence of this iss (i) in public sector
enterprises which have grown at much lower rates than their counterparts in the
private sector; and (ii) in the large number of wasteful central government
expenditure programs.
Public Enterprises.
10.   In spite of a decade of liberalization, public sector enterprises still
are an important segment of the economy.   The state owns about 130 public
enterprises (PEs) in all sectors. They employ over 600,000 people (of which
400,000 in state-owned tea and rubber estates), i.e. over 10? of the labor force.
Excluding utilities and transportation (i.e. including PEs in agriculture,
industry, and financial sector), they account for 8 of the GDP. Most of these
enterprises are a legacy of the pre-1977 period when through nationalization or
outright creation of new enterprises the state grew to become the largest
entrepreneur in the economy. With the growth of the private sector after 1977,



-4-
however,  the  inefficiency  of  PEs  became  evident.    Public manufacturing
enterprises' output stagnated while that of the private sector grew by over 10X
per year. Three-quarters of the growth in the country's tea output since 1977
came from the private sector even though the latter owns only half of the land
under tea.  A similar pattern can be observed in all the sectors where the
private sector has been allowed to enter: e.g. bus transportation; insurance;
banking and marketing of agricultural inputs and products. There is a question
as .o whether the PEs' poor growth performance is the result of less investment
than their covaterparts in the private sector, or less efficient use of
resources.  While investment data for the entirety of the public enterprise
sector are not available, information for the most significant PEs indicates that
their poor growth performance is the result of a less efficient use of resources
rather than less investment per se. The public sector enterprises' inefficiency
is mostly the result of the mutually inconsistent functions Pfs' managers are
expected to fulfill: to provide employment, to reduce the cost of living, to
substitute for imports with little attention paid to economic efficiency, and
to comply with rules and regulations suited for bureaucratic processes but not
for comercially oriented ones.
11.   To offset, at least partly, the cost of such a system, PEs have been
granted privileges in terms of protection against foreign and domestic
competition, monopolistic and monopsonistic privileges, access to the budget or
government credit guarantees. The economic cost of PEs' mismanagement is thus
not entirely captured in the budget. The direct cost to the budget has been as
high as 1-2Z of GDP in mid-1980's but it has been declining more recently as (i)
certain public enterprises financed their losses by building up arrears with
their suppliers (e.g. the Central Transport Board in 1989): (ii) a few underwent
restructuring processes which included sales of assets and improvements in
management (e.g. Air Lanka and the Ceylon Shipping Corporation); and (iii) others
financed their losses through the banking system (e.g. -he State owned tea and
rubber estates in 1988 ani 1989).
Central Government Expenditure.
12.   Central government expenditure account for about 33-342 of GDP with current
expenditures at 20Z of GDP in recent years and capital expenditures at 13-14Z.
About half of current expenditures are for civil servants' pensions, wages and
overheads (about one-third of that amount being for defense) while the other hal'
is approximately equally divided between interest on the government's debt and
other transfers to households, public corporations and other levels of
government. In addition to the transfers required to support public enterprises,
public expenditure programs have suffered from three other problems. The first
is the high cost of the civil administration. Compared to other countries of
its size and level of development, Sri Lanka's civil administration is
exceptionally large. It employs 650,000 people in 24 central ministries
overseeing 130 departments and 86 decentralized units of government reporting
to central ministries (500,000 in the central ministries and 150,000 in the 86
decentralized units). Excluding police, armed forces and pensions of retired
civil servants, the cost of the country's civil administration is over 6Z of GDP,
of which wages accounted for two-thirds and overheads for the remaining one-
third.



-5-
13.   The President appointed an Administrative Reforms Comittee (ARC) in 1986
to review the government's administrative structure (then with over 40
ministries), staffing, and compensation policies.   The ARC concluded that:
(i) the number of ministries should be reduced to 16; (ii) staff Pt the lc.ver
level was overpaid and underpaid at the higher level; and (iii) overstaffing was
a pervasive problem throughout the public sector. Excluding the armed forces.
police, health and education personnel, the ARC estimated that some 20Z of staff
could be retrenched without any impact on the quality or level of government
services rendered. This figure does not include, however, those employed in
decentralized units of government for which an assessment of overstaffing still
needs to be made (see para. 49)
14.   Transfers and Subsidies.   The second problem with central governs.ent
expenditure is the large number of mis-targeted transfers to households. The
oldest and largest of these programs (1.3? of GDP in 1989) is the Food Stamp
Program (FSP). Since its inception in 1979, the FSP has suffered from a serious
mis-targeting problem as about half of the population (8 million people in 1988)
was enrolled in the program instead of the 600,000-700,000 families who should
have been the target group according to recent household surveys.  The mis-
targeting of FSP was accentuated as of January 1989 when the value of the food
stamps was doubled and the number of beneficiaries increased to 8.5 million.
Two other transfers programs were announced during 1988 in the run-up to
elections and have rendered the problem of inefficient and costly transfer
programs much more serious than before: the Mid-Day Meal Program and the Jana
Saviya Program (JSP) or people's strength in Sinhalese. The mid-day meal is a
program designed to provide one lunch a day to all children enrolled in primary
or secondary schools. Despite costing close to 12 of GDP, it fails to improve
the country's nutritional status significantly. Pre-school children, the ones
most nutritionally at risk, do not benefit from the program while a large number
of children who because of their age or income level of their families are not
nutritionally at risk, do benefit. The costs of meeting the nutritional needs
of pre-school children would be only a fraction of the cost of the mid-day meal.
15.   As originally envisaged, the JSP consisted of a monthly payment of Rs 2,500
(i.e. about US$63 at today's exchange rate) for two years to all eligible
families. About Rs 1,500 was to be paid in coupons enabling beneficiaries to
purchase basic consumption items, mainly food, and Rs 1,000--the so called
'investment component"--was  to be deposited  in a savings  account.    The
accumulated amount would be released after the two-year period as a grant to
families having formulated a viable investment project--which could range from
purchasing livestock to developing a micro-enterprise. Crucial to determining
the cost of the prop-am is the number of eligible families. When the Government
announced the program during the 1988 election campaign, eligible families were
all those enrolled in NFSP, a principle that would have required over 20? of GDP
per year to finance the program.   As it became clear that this amount of
resources could not be mobilized and as discussions with the IMF and the Bank
on a second-year PFP progressed, the program was reformulated several times.
The 1989 budget included Rs 6.8 billion (31 of the GDP) for the JSP of which only
Rs 0.9 billion was actually spent while the 1990 budget includes Rs 4.4 billion
(1.5? of the GDP). In spite of its cost, the JSP is not an effective anti-
poverty program because of loose selection criteria, benefits which create strong



-6-
disinccAtives to work and are unrelated to the beneficiaries' income, and its
failure to address the roots of poverty.
16.   Historically, the most important subsidies (0.5? of GDP) in the budget are
for fertilizer use; the National Savings Bank (NSB) and sugar production. The
subsidy on fertilizer was entirely eliminated as of January 1, 1990 after being
in effec;t for almost three decades. Previous Governments have been of the view
that the fertilizer subsidy is an important determinant of rice production and
thus farmer's income. As in many other countries, however, most of the fertilizer
subsidy accrues to better-off farmers, i.e. those with the largest plots and
access to irrigation. The need for the NSB subsidy stems from an important share
of its assets being locked in long-term government securities purchased in the
1960's and 1970's, paying interest rates of 5-6X while interest psid on savings
deposits are more than twice this level.  As these low yielding government
securities maturea, the NSB subsidy has been gradually reduced from an annual
Rs 500 million in the early 1980's (US$21 million in 1983) to Rs 230 million
(US$6 million) in 1989-90; it is expected that the need for the subsidy will
disappear completely in the early 1990's. Finally, the subsidy for sugar is to
compensate domestic producers who cannot compete with sugar imports, in spite
of an extremely high tariff (see para. 37).
17.   A number of important subsidies became effective in 1989 without any
provision in the budget. The most significant one is the subsidy on wheat. As
the price of imported wheat rose and the government decided not to increase the
price of wheat flour accordingly, the Food Comnissioner (in charge of food
distribution to the cooperatives and other private and official outlets)
experienced losses close to Rs 2.1 billion (0.9Z of GDP). In the case of rice,
mostly imported by the state-owned Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE),
the subsidy (0.2? of GDP) has been financed by the commercial banking system and
profits from other CWE activities. In the case of the Ceylon Transport Board
where losses reached about Rs 800 million, 0.3Z of GDP, while the budgetary
allocation was only Rs 150 million, the unbudgeted subsidy was financed through
arrears to the Employees Provident Fund; and zo suppliers such as the Ceylon
Petroleum Corporation and the Tyre Corporation, both state enterprises.
18.   Public Investment Program (PIP). The third problem with central government
expenditures are public investment projects which do not provide adequate returns
to the economy.   Since liberalization in 1977,  Sri Lanka has had public
investment at levels as high as 12-13? of GDP on the average, with peaks at over
15? of GDP in the early 1980's. The 1988 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) on
Sri Lanka contains a detailed analysis of the main public expenditure programs
and, more particularly, of the PIP. A major conclusion was that many of the
capital investment projects begun in the early 1980's were unproductive but by
now most of them were either completed or discontinued. Another conclusion of
the CEM was, however, that insufficient funds were allocated for (a) maintenance
programs, particularly for irrigation and roads; (b) the development of the
transport infrastructure; and (c) the development and maintenance of the health
and education sectors.

D. The Economic Impact of Civil Disturbances
19.   Since the early 1980's, civil disturbances have been a major impediment
to Sri Lanka's economic development. They began as an ethnic conflict in the
Northern and Eastern districts of the country in 1983 and escalated gradually
until the conflict reached war-proportions in early-1987. The ethnic conflict
subsided for a few months following the signing of the India-Sri Lanka Peace
Agreement of July 1987. By 1988, however, the ethnic conflict had again reached
serious proportions and the Reconstruction Program of the Northern and Eastern
provinces, for which the Bank held a Special Aid Group Meeting in December 1987,
could not be implemented at the pace envisaged originally. At the same time,
leftist nationalistic groups against the 1987 Peace Accord were able to mount
a well articulated anti-government campaign, which escalated to the point of
leading the country to quasi-paralysis in mid-1989.
20.    Defence expenditures rose from about 12 of GDP in the first half of the
1980's to 4-52 of GDP in 1987-89. Civil disturbances have not only put heavy
pressures on the budget but also have been an important reason for the decline
in growth to below 5 in the last three years. Paddy production in the Northern
and Eastern provinces declined by about one-third, fishing by half, and tourism
itflows to the island were reduced by two-thirds. The resilience of the economy,
its abil'ty to weather a high level of disturbances and ita responsiveness to
improved incentives have been remarkable, however. Tea production in 1988, for
example, was at its highest level since 1965; private sector manufacturing
continued to grow at over 10? through the 1988 and 1989 turbulence and non-
traditional exports continued to expand rapidly. Also of note is the rapid
improvement that followed the implementation of the mid-1989 stabilization
package (para 28).
II. Adjustment Efforts and Dialogue with the Bank and the IMF
21.   Reducing the country's unsustainably large external and internal imbalances
and reducing the size of government and improving its efficiency, have been
recognized as important policy issues in Sri Lanka since the late 1970's and the
early 1980's. Several efforts at stabilizing and restructuring the economy were
made with IMP support during that period. However, with the escalation of the
ethnic conflict which erupted in mid-1983, such efforts could not be sustained.
Furthermore, until shortly after the outbreak of the ethnic conflict, Sri Lanka
could still borrow on commercial terms in the international market and, from 1983
to 1985, export earnings were boosted by the record high price of tea. Thus the
adjustment could, and was, postponed.
A. The 1988-90 Policy Framework
22.   By 1983, however, with foreign exchange reserves declining rapidly and
deficits in the fiscal and external accounts at unsustainably high levels, the
need for economic reforms became evident. During the 1985 Annual Meetings in
Seoul the Government requested a SAL from the Bank.  In  November 1986, as
discussions on a PFP-SAF were ongoing, the Government announced a three-year
stabilization program consisting of a gradual reduction in public expenditures
and the adoption of a more flexible exchange rate policy. As a result, the
fiscal deficit fell to 112 of GDP in 1987 (from 122 in 1985-86), and the trade-



-9-
weighted real effective exchange rate depreciated by 152. In addition, during
the course of 1987, the Cabinet approved the reports and recommendations of three
high level committees--the Administrative Reform Committee (ARC), the
Presidential Tariff Commission (PTC), and the Industrial Policy Committee (IPC).
Their recommendations were bold and formed the basis of a PFP-SAF negotiated in
late 1987.  The economic reforms outlined in the first-year PFP covering the
.?eriod 1988-1990 addressed both the need to stabilize the economy and to develop
a basis for sustainable growth over the longer term. The key macro-economic
objectives of the program were further reductions in the fiscal deficit (to 92
of GDP in 1990); in the external current account deficit (from 92 of GDP in 1985-
87, to 62 in 1990) and in inflation (from 8S in 1986-87, to 52 in 1990).
23.   Three major structural reforms were envisaged in the program.  The first
was an Administrative Reform of the public sector aimed at a long overdue
streamlining of the Government administrative structure, a reduction in the
number of Ministries by over one-half, and a reduction in the number of civil
servants by 20X. The second was a comprehensive package of Industrial Reforms
aimed at accelerating industrial growth and increasing the export-orientation
of the manufacturing sector. The Government committed itself to maintaining an
exchange rate policy that would ensure the competitiveness of Sri Lanka's exports
for that purpose and it also began a program of tariff reforms aimed at reducing
effective protection and simplifying the tariff system.   In addition,  it
requested World Bank assistance to formulate an action plan to reform public
manufacturing enterprises and begin a privatization process: three enterprises
were selected for privatization during 1988. The third plank of the adjustment
program was a Restructuring of Public Expenditures partly drawing on the 1988
CEM and aimed at eliminating programs with low rates of return and increasing
the efficiency of the remaining ones.
B. Performance under the First-Year PFP-SAF (1988)
24.   The implementation of the adjustment program at the pace envisaged in the
first-year PFP-SAF did not prove feasible.  Political violence in the South
escalated to a degree that no one could have predicted and disrupted economic
activity and civil administration. As the December 1988 Presidential elections
approached, the disruptions, initially concentrated in the South, spread towards
Colombo and the densely populated districts of the Central and North Western
provinces. Work stoppages caused by terrorist activity had a negative impact
on production, exports, and tax collections.   The loss in tax revenues was
considerable and was an important reason for the deterioration in the fiscal
situation in 1988 vhen the fiscal deficit reached 152 of the GDP instead of the
11 of GDP aimed at in the first-year PFP. The financing of the fiscal deficit
relied primarily on Central Bank financing and was the main factor for the rapid
monetary growth experienced in 1988 which in turn increased inflation, from 102
in 1987 to 152 in 1988. Besides the fall in revenue collections, several other
factors contributed to the deterioration of the fiscal situation. First, public
sector wages were increased and the freeze on vacancies in effect since 1985 was
reversed. Second, because of the troubled political situation, the Government
did not pass on to consumers the increase in international prices of wheat,
fertilizer, and rice, a decision that lead to large subsidies--the effect of
which was particularly felt in 1989. Third, as a result of the 1988 wage hikes,
public enterprises' operational costs increased substantially; the Central



-10-
Transport Board (CTB) and railways, already loss-making concerns, required
significant additional budgetary assistance.   Fourth, a severe island-wide
drought in 1988 required costly emergency relief programs.
25.   The escalation of political violence also exacerbated external imbalances
as tourist arrivals, foreign private investment, and exports of tea and garments
were negatively affected, as were foreign-aid related capital inflows since the
security situation slowed the implementation of most public investment projects.
Thus, the 1988 current account deficit was close to 92 of GDP (instead of 82
expected in the first year PFP) and the overall balance of payments deficit
reached US$100 million (instead of a small surplus). By the end of 1988, gross
official reserves, equivalent to about one and a half months of imports, had
reached their lowest level since 1977. Adjustments in the exchange rate led to
a small depreciation of the rupee in real effective terms, but this proved
inadequate to offset the deterioration in the balance of payments.
26.   Progress in implementing the itructural reforms envisaged in the first PFP
was also unimpressive. The department by department assessment of staffing needs
and overstaffing for almost 130 ministerial departments in the Central
Government, an essential step to implement the Administrative Reform, was to be
completed by end-1988 but was delayed by one year.   Restructuring public
expenditures became a much more complex task than before with the announcement
of the mid-day meal program and the JSP, and the doubling of food stamps and
increase in the number of beneficiaries. Some limited, albeit important progress
was nonetheless achieved in reforming the tariff system, where effective
protection was reduced as envisaged initially and a number of import license
requirements were eliminated during 1988 and 1989. In addition, the efficiency
of three public enterprises heavily dependent on the budget since the mid-1980's
(Air Lanka, Sri Lanka Cement Corporation, and Ceylon Shipping Corporation)
improved considerably as a result of managerial changes and disposal of assets.
Consequently, they are not expected to put any further claim on the budget from
1990 onwards.
C. The 1989-92 Policy Framework
27.   The new Government formed in early 1989 found itself confronted with
escalating violence, rapidly declining foreign exchange reserves, rising
inflation, and a fiscal deficit out of control.  Its first reaction was to delay
all stabilization measures and to concentrate on restoring political order, a
process in which the implementation of the mid-day meal and JSP was seen as
important because the Government thought at first that increases in poverty were
at the root of political instability. The 1989 budget aimed at a modest decline
in the fiscal deficit, and large expenditures on social programs. During the
course of the year, however, it became evident that a number of expenditures had
been under-budgeted, that tax revenues anticipated in the budget were over-
optimistic (given the impact of the civil conflict on tax collections), and that,
as a result, the fiscal deficit would be at over 16X of GDP instead of the 13.72
aimed at in the budget. The prospect of further fiscal deterioration at a time
when foreign exchange reserves had declined to three weeks of imports, the lowest
level in a decade, prompted the Government to accelerate discussions on a second-
year PFP and to take actions on several fronts. First, the rupee was devalued
sharply, from Rs 351US$ in July to Rs 40/US$ by mid-September. Second, it took



-11-
a series of fiscal actions. The main one was to phase over several years the
implementation of its costly and poorly targeted poverty program. In addition,
the price of wheat was increased by 202; a 102 across-the-board cut in
discretionary current expenditures was implemented in August; starting in
September, this cut was increased to 20Z and to over 30Z in the last three months
of the year; and, the prices of petroleum products were raised by 25Z in
September.  Third, on the monetary front, the Central Bank decided to sharply
reduce its holding of Treasury Bills and allowed interest rates to increase to
18-202 beginning in September.
28.   The July stabilization program formed the basis of second-year PFP-SAF
arrangement and produced encouraging results with performance exceeding
expectations in many important respects.  Tightened expenditure controls and
improved revenue flows in the last few months of 1989 have kept the overall
deficit within the PFP-SAF target of 12.52 of GDP (the original budget was 13.7%
of GDP). With foreign inflows slightly lower than anticipatad, the domestic
financing of the budget was at 6.82 of GDP instead of the 6.42 PFP-SAF target,
still 32 of GDP less than the domestic financing required in 1988. The balance
of payments responded strongly and immediately to these positive developments:

in 1990 is estimated at US$100 million, instead of the US$220 million estimated
when the PFP-SAF targets were set. Inflation is one area where the stabilization
program has not yet been entirely successful.   In spite of tight monetary
policies, and partially as a result of the devaluation and reduction in
subsidies, inflation accelerated in late 1989 and early 1990. With continued
restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, inflationary pressures should ease in
the second-quarter of 1990 however.
29.   The government's key macroeconomic objectives over the medium term, as
outlined in the second-year PFP, are: (i) to increase growth from its current
22 in 1989 level to 3-4Z by 1991-92; (ii) to reduce inflation to 72 by 1992; and
(iii) to reduce the current account deficit of the balance of payments to about
62 of GDP by 1992. While these objectives may appear modest, they represent a
major improvement over the country's recent macroeconomic performance and appear
realistic given the political constraints under which the program is to be
implemented. On the structural front, the second-year PFP consists, essentially,
of the continuation of the agenda in the first year PFP, and of a renewed
emphasis on poverty alleviation and privatization, particularly that of the
state-owned tea and rubber estates and the CTB.
30.   Fiscal Policies. At the heart of the stabilization effort is the reduction
of the fiscal deficit from 152 of GDP in 1988 to 12.52 of GDP in 1989. and thence
gradually to 82 in 1992. The burden of the fiscal adjustment will fall on public
expenditures which are to decline from 342 of GDP in 1988-89 to 292 in 1992.
Current expenditures are expected to decline by 32 of GDP between 1989 and 1990,
while capital expenditures would decline by about 22. The potential as well as
the desirability for increasing revenues is limited since at 21X of GDP, tax
revenues are relatively high for a country with a US$ 400 per capita income.
The tax base is narrow, however, while its incidence is regressive. Following
a recommendation in the 1988 CEM, the Government has appointed a Tax Commission
to analyze the current tax system and propose measures which would maintain
current taxation levels but would broaden the tax base with a view to improving
its elasticity and reducing its regressiveness. This credit would finance a
technical assistance program to the Tax Commission, to be supervised by the IMF,
to help implement tax policy and tax administration reforms (para. 102).
31.   1990-1992 Balance of Payments Projections.   The balance of payments
projections and external financing requirements in Tables 2 and 3 of Annex I and
Annex II respectively, are an update of those in the second-year PFP. They take
into account: (i) the response of the balance of payments in 1989 to the
adjustment program which was more positive than expected at the time the PFP was
prepared; and (ii) higher imports of food grain because unfavorable weather
conditions and lower than expected imports in 1989 resulted in a run-down on
grain stocks. Three assumptions underlie the projections. The first is that
a return to normalcy will continue to be viewed as highly uncertain by
prospective investors and thus foreign investment receipts will continue to be
at relatively low levels. The second is that, driven by non-traditional exports,
export volume will grow by an annual average of above 5 percent over the medium



-13-
term -- a rate significantly higher than that achieved in the last few years -
- as a result of the more favorable exchange rate and industrial policies aimed
at increasing the export orientation of the manufacturing sector. The third is
that the medium term import growth rate remains below those of both exports and
GDP (except for 1990 when they are expected to grow at 6.7 percent reflecting
the higher imports of food-grain). This slow import growth is in line with the
trend in the recent past and consistent with the realignment of relative prices
following the depreciation of the exchange rate.   The balance of payment
projections in Table 2 of Annex I are slightly more optimistic than those in
the PFP (the current account deficit projected for 1992 is 5.4Z of GDP instead
of 6.32 in the PFP) reflecting the strongest than expected response of the
balance of payment to the July 1989 program.   The growth in gross official
reserves assumed in these projections is still modest, however, with gross
official reserves at only about two months of imports in 1992. Details on how
the financing gap is expected to be financed are in para 101. The financing gap
continues at the levels indicated in the PFP, however, because the 1989
improvements in the balance of payment allow less commercial borrowing than
envisaged in the PFP--US$107 million instead of the US$152 million anticipated
in the PFP for 1990, and US$71 million instead of another US$136 million in 1991.
III. The Proposed Economic Restructuring Credit
32.   The proposed Economic Restructuring Credit (ERC) represents the culmination
of a process of policy discussions with Government spanning many years. It aims
at supporting the implementation of the most important policy reforms outlined
in the second-year PFP; most of these policy reforms have been discussed in the
most recent CEMs on Sri Lanka and have been issues in our economic dialogue with
tne Government for some time. The April 1987 CEM focused on the country's macro-
economic imbalances, the narrowness and regressiveness of the tax system, and
industrial policies. The report also made concrete recommendations on tariff
and public manufacturing enterprise reform which were incorporated in the first-
year PFP.  The May 1988 CEH focussed on public expenditure issues and made
recommendations on how to address fiscal imbalances by restructuring specific
public expenditure programs. The recommendations in these two reports provided
the basis for an IDA financing for project preparation in mid-1988 to prepare
the ERC.   The program of tariff reforms was,  likewise,  prepared by the
Presidential Tariff Commission (PTC) as part of the conditionality associated
with a series of industrial finance loans. The Government's response to Bank
and IMF recommendations has, in general, been positive.  The strong measures
taken in the second half of 1989 are a demonstration of the Government's
commitment to the policies outlined in the second-year PFP.  These actions,
together with the policies outlined in the second-year PFP, demonstrate that the
Government is committed to an adjustment program which represents the most
radical policy changes in Sri Lanka since the economy was liberalized in 1977.
33.   The precariousness of the balance of payments is another important reason
for the proposed operation. At about five weeks of imports at the end of 1989.
gross official reserves continue to be low. The bunching of maturities of the
commercial debt contracted in the early and mid-1980's will keep the debt service
ratio at over 20Z of export of goods and services until 1992. The financing gap
for 1990 is estimated at US$170 million, and US$130 million in 1991 (See



-14-
para. 101) assuming that about US$80 million in these two years (US$50 million
In 1990 and US$30 million in 1991) are contracted on commercial terms to finance
imports of wheat.
34.  The ERC would be disbursed in two trenches, one after Board presentation
in May 1990 on the basis of measures already taken and the other in January 1991,
after the 1991 budget is presented to Parliament (in November 1990) and the
measures outlined in this report are taken. The NRC would support policy reforms
in four areas. The first is macroeconomic stabilization. In this area, the ERC
complements the INF efforts aimed at stabilizing the economy and it supports the
measures necessary to reach the balance of payment, fiscal and monetary targets
set out in the PFP, e.g. increases in the prices of wheat, rice and elect-icity
tariffs; raising bus fares, as a first step to total deregulation of fares; and
maintaining a flexible and competitive exchange rate.   The second is the
rationalization of the public sector, where the credit would support improvements
in efficiency through the restructuring of some major government expenditure
programs and an administrative reform of the civil service aimed at reducing
overstaffing; streamlining and depoliticizing recruitment; improving the
personnel management capability within the public service; and more generally,
improving morale and motivation in the public service. The third is private
sector development consisting of measures aimed at (i) changing the regulatory
and incentive framework in ways that will facilitate and support private sector
initiatives, and (ii) making room for the private sector by gradually
transferring assets and activities now being managed by the public sector. This
process would be supported by the reduction in the Government's domestic
financing needs from 92 of GDP in 1988 to less than 22 by 1992--one of the main
targets of the second-year PFP macroeconomic framework. Finally, the fourth area
is poverty alleviation concentrating on measures aimed at mitigating the social
cost of adjustment and improving consumption and productivity levels of the
poorest segments of society. Restructuring to a more efficiently targeted group
the poverty-oriented programs now in the budget--the Mid-day Meal Program, the
Jana Saviya Program and the Food Stamp Program (FSP)--would be the most important
steps to achieve this objective.
A. Stabilization and Macroeconomic Policies
Macroeconomic ObJectives and Policies.
35.     Fiscal Policies.  As indicated in the second-year PFP, the Government
intends to reduce the fiscal deficit from 12.52 of GDP in 1989 to 10.42 of GDP
in 1990; 9Z in 1991 and 82 in 1992, mostly through a reduction in current
expenditures--from 232 of GDP in 1989 to 202 in 1992. The reductions in current
expenditures is expected to be brought about by a further reduction in subsidies
in the short-run and, in the medium term, by: (i) retrenchment in the public
sector; (ii) lower interest rates on the Government's debt as the Treasury's
domestic borrowing needs are gradually reduced--from 9.52 of GDP in 1988 to 6.82
in 1989; 4.12 in 1990; 2.62 in 1991 and 1.42 in 1992; and (iii) hopefully, lower
defense expenditures as the security situation improves. The fiscal targets can
be exceeded on account of compensation packages to workers made redundant by the
c4.vil service reform (see paras. 44-49) and the privatization of the bus
transport system (see paras. 74-77). The total amount of compensation packages
is estimated to be slightly below 12 of GDP in 1990, and an equivalent amount



-15-
in 1991.   These additional expenditures are not expected to increase the
Treasury's domestic borrowing needs, however. They would be financed out of this
credit's disbursements as well as disbursements from balance of payments support
loans now under discussion with bilateral agencies to cofinance the ERC (see
para. 101). Except for the cost of these compensation packages, and the cost
of restructuring the Mid-Day Heal Program (see para 94), the structure of fiscal
expenditures in 1990 is expected to be that indicated in Table 2.
36.   Prices and Subsidies. As of January 1, 1990, subsidies for fertilizer and
rice have been entirely eliminated, while that for wheat flour has been
substantially reduced. During 1990, the policy begun in July 1989 of gradually
increasing the price of wheat-flour by 8-9Z a month will be continued until the
subsidy is entirely eliminated, probably by Hay-June, 1990--depending on the
evolution of the international price of Wheat-grain and the RseUS$ exchange rate.
In the case of buses, private operators were granted, as of January 1, 1990, a
502 increase for short-distance fares, and 25? for long-distances. The CTB was
not allowed to increase fares so far because the Government finds it difficult
to justify increases in CTB fares given the poor quality of services at present.
As the CTB is restructured and transformed into smaller private enterprises (see
para. 74), the newly created companies will charge the fares now in effect for
private sector operators. Meanwhile, the 1990 budget has not provided for any
subsidy for CTB which continues to finance its losses through arrears to
suppliers and to the Employees Provident Fund (see para. 75). In the case of
railways, a restructuring plan is now unler discussion with the World Bank and
several bilaterals.  As the plan is drawn-up, measures to reduce costs and
increase revenues will be gradually implemented with the objective of reducing
in 1991 the railways subsidy to tw-o-thirds the amount of Rs 500 million budgeted
for 1990. The subsidy for the railways in the 1991 budget would thus be Rs 350
million or less. In early 1990 electricity tariffs, which had not been increased
since January 1988, were inadequate to enable the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)
to earn a financial rate of return of 8? on net revalued assets as agreed with
IDA and AsDB. This rate of return would enable CEB to self-finance a reasonable
proportion of its investment program. However, in late February, the Cabinet
approved an average tariff increase of 351, effective April 1, 1990, to improve
CEB's rate of return and increase its self-financing level. A further tariff
increase may be required in early 1991 to ensure that CEB meets the agreed rate
of return target in 1991.
37.   The pricing of sugar is a complex issue. Because of high tariffs on sugar,
Sri Lankan consumers have been paying two to three times the international price
of sugar following Government"s decision--supported by multilateral and bilateral
institutions--taken in the late 1970's to increase local production to 50? of
total domestic consumption. The 1988 CEN estimated that in 1987, the poorest
252 of the population paid by way of implicit and explicit taxes on sugar, 802
of the income supplement they got through food stamps at that time. At the
beginning of 1990, the retail cost of imported sugar was US¢0.35/kg. Tariffs
brought it up to US¢0.75/kg for domestic consumers. A part of the difference
between USJ0.75 and US¢0.35 is captured by the budget through the tariffs--almost
1.52 of GDP. Another 0.252 of GDP takes the form of implicit subsidies paid by
consumers through higher prices for sugar purchased from the uneconomic domestic
sugar factories which, directly and indirectly, employ about 20,000 people.
These artificially high prices notwithstanding, some of these factories still



-16-
need direct subsidies from the Treasury. They amounted to Re 290 million in 1988
and then gradually declined (to Rs 175 million in 1989 and an estimated Rs 75
million in 1990) as the domestic price was increased. The AsDB is financing an
on-going study of the sugar industry to examine whether there are technical,
managerial or policy decisions that could help reduce, in the next two or three
years, production costs to a level reasonably close to the international price
of sugar, i.e., no more that 10-25Z above the c.i.f. price at which Sri Lanka
can import sugar. This exercise should be completed towards the middle of 1990
and its results will be discussed with IDA with a view to formulating by the
end of 1990 an action plan to restructure the sugar industry. The plan will aim
at bringing within two to three years, the consumer of price of sugar to levels
reasonably close to the c.i.f. price at which Sri Lanka can import sugar. In
the meantime, the Government has already stopped all plans aimed at expanding
capacity in the sugar industry.
38.  Tax Policies.  As indicated earlier, a Tax Commission has been appointed
to review the tax system and make recommendations for change by the end of 1990.
The main task of the Tax Commission is to identify measures that would broaden
the tax base, improve its elasticity, and reduce its regressiveness while
improving tax collections and tax administration. In particular, the following
measures will be considered by the Tax Commission: (i) replacing the existing
business turnover tax by a value added tax; and (ii) broadening the coverage of
the income tax to include currently exempt persons and institutions.  After
review and discussion with the World Bank and the IMF, a plan to implement the
Commission's recommendations will be formulated, and the first phase of such plan
will be incorporated in the 1991 budget to be presented to Parliament in November
1990.
39.   Exchange Rate Policy.  Maintenance of a competitive exchange rate policy
would be crucial to the macroeconomic and structural reform objectives of the
second-year PFP-SAP program and this restructuring credit. Financial policies
and a low inflation environment will be key to its achievement. Toward this
end, under the SAF arrangement, the Government has also undertaken to review and
adjust the exchange rate as necessary, in consultation with the IMF. The conduct
of exchange rate policy is monitored under the SAF arrangement with benchmarks
for net official reserves and indices of the real effective exchange rate vis-
a-vis trading partners and export competitors.
Conditions for Second Tranche Disbursement.
40.   In addition to meeting conditions in the policy areas discussed in the
next sections, the second tranche would be disbursed in January 1991 after the
following two conditions are met. The first is satisfactory implementation of
the reforms outlined above. In assessing performance IDA will examine whether:
(i) subsidies are reduced and prices are increased according to the time-table
outlined in para. 36; (ii) a restructuring plan for the sugar industry with the
objectives outlined in para. 37 has been formulated and agreed upon with IDA by
end-1990; and (iii) the recommendations of the Tax Commission are reviewed and
discussed with the IMF and IDA and incorporated in the 1991 budget to be
presented to the Parliament in November 1990. The second is a favorable IDA
assessment of the implementation of the macroeconomic framework outlined in the
second-year PFP. This assessment will take into account the IMF's most recent



-17-
assessment of Sri Lanka's macroeconomic performance and policies, including the
size of the fiscal deficits the domestic financing of the fiscal deficit;
exchange rate developments; inflation; and how they compare with the targets set
in the second-year PFP.
B. Public Sector Rationalization
41.   Most of the policies supported by the ERC will, directly and indirectly,
help establish a better and more efficient public sector and reduce public
spending, but there are three areas which will merit special attention in that
regards (i) the Administrative Reform of the public service; (ii) the public
investment program; and (iii) welfare programs. The first two are discussed in
this section while the rationalization of welfare programs is discussed in
conjunction with the reforms aimed at mitigating the social cost of adjustment
and improving the living standards of the poor (paras. 84-95).
Administrative Reform
42.   The reform of the civil service is one of the most important objectives
supported by the ERC.   Sri Lanka's civil service, once well known for its
independence and high professional standards, has gone through a process which
led to a gradual deterioration in the quality of services rendered. Until 1972,
the independence of the civil service was ensured by a Public Service Commission
(PSC) set up under the 1948 constitution responsible for recruitments,
promotions, transfers and dismissals. It had a high degree of independence and,
in particular, was not subject to ministerial control.   However, the 1972
constitution vested the PSC's powers in the Cabinet of Ministers, a decision
which meant that appointments were made by the Cabinet collectively and
therefore, in practice, by Ministers individually. While the 1978 constitution
re-established a Public Service Commission, the power of appointment, transfer,
dismissal and discipline is still vested in the Cabinet.   The Cabinet has
delegated these powers to the PSC but this Commission has then passed these
powers back to individual ministries. The politicization of the civil service
was exacerbated in the late 1970's and early 1980's when the job bank was
created, giving to Members of Parliament from the majority party the privilege
of nominating candidates for recruitment to the public service who were then
appointed from the job bank as vacancies arose.   Gradually, overstaffing,
inadequate pay at the higher staff levels and excessive at the lower, and
political interference in the day-to-day administration of government
institutions led to low morale and decline in the standards of service. These
problems are identified in the reports of the Administrative Reform Committee
(ARC) issued in 1988 and were brought to the fore once again at the beginning
of 1990 by the Presidential Commission appointed in October 1989 to investigate
the causes of the youth unrest which has plagued the country since 1988. In its
report, this Commission highlighted that a major cause for youth unrest was the
abuse of political power in the recruitment of personnel to the public services.
43.   Thus, while reducing overstaffing and the fiscal cost of the civil
administration is an important objective of the administrative reform, there are
also four others which are equally important. The first is to establish rules
and procedures ensuring that recruitment and promotion are based on merit and
well known transparent criteria. The second is to develop a personnel management



-18-
cavability within the public servic2 to tackle areas such as career development,
training, staff inspection, organization and methods studies, and organizational
audit and cadre review.  The third is to rationalize reward and motivation
policies, including salary, bonefits levels and pensions.  The fourth is to
create for employees in the private sector an Employees Pension Scheme to replace
the Employees Provident Fund. This measure would reduce the privileges of public
sector employees vis-a-vis those in *_he private sector.   The Government' s
excessively generous pension scheme is a source of disparity in employment
conditions between the public and private sectors and measures to reduce the
benefits as well as the fiscal cost of the government pension scheme will also
be supported by the ERC.
44.   Staffing and Over-Staffing.  The Central Government employs about 500,000
people in 26 central ministries--down from 45 in 1988 but still well above the
16 recommended by the Administrative Raforms Committee (ARC). In addition, there
are about 86 decentralized units of Government reporting to central ministries
such as the Ceylon Tourism Board, the Mahaweli Development Authority, the Road
Development Authority, i.e., institutions which for all practical purposes are
performing central government functions. They employ about 150,000 people who
are not considered part of the public service, i.e., they are not entitled to
pensions after retirement and they are not subject to the salary scales
prevailing in the Central Ministries--although they tend to follow them. Based
on partial surveys, the ARC estimated that the staff strength in the central
ministries could be reduced by 20? without any effect on the quality of the
services delivered.
45.   The ARC findings have led the Government to believe that overstaffing may
be as high as 80,000-90,000. The implementation of a retrenchment plan over a
three-to-four-year period for those who are identified as redundant was an
objective of the first-year PFP and is again set as an objective in the second-
year PFP.  Identifying precisely the agencies and categories of staff where
overstaffing exists proved to be, however, more time consuming and complex than
was envisaged when the two PFPs were discussed between the Government, the Bank
and IMF. The work was initially conducted by the Salaries and Cadres Commission
(SCC) formed in early 1988 to implement the recommendations of the ARC. The
escalation of political violence in 1988 and first half of 1989 delayed this work
considerably, however. In addition, following the reorganization and reduction
in the number of ministries in March 1989, the SCC's role was redefined to
provide high policy advice on cadres and salaries issues and an independent forum
for considering pay and grading anomalies as they arise. Finally, the process
of devolution of power to the newly created Provincial Councils (PCs) (see para.
48) put new demands on the SCC and the administration in general. Thus, it was
only late in 1989 that the actual work of identification of surplus-staff began.
46. The process gained some impetus in late 1989, when a new Policy Division
(PD) was created in the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils
and Home Affairs to formulate policies related to: (i) personnel management; (ii)
organizational audit and cadre review; (iii) reform of administrative systems;
and (iv) the development of training and career development. The PD will now
be entrusted with the function of identifying surplus-staff, and organizing their
retraining for reassignment in other departments if possible, or retrenchment.
So far, an estimated 46,000 staff have already been identified as redundant and



-19-
the Government has set a target to reduce the staff strength in central
ministries by 15,000-20,000 during 1990. An estimated 10,000-12,000 are expected
to reach their retirement age during 1990 and will not be replaced while another
additional 5,000-8,000 will be offered compensation packages.
47.   About 2,800  of these 5,000-8,000 were identified in early 1990 and, by
March 1990, had been taken off the payroll. About 300 have already been paid
their compensation while the remaining 2,500 will be paid their compensation by
April-May.   The compensation package is attractive.   It consists of early
retirement benefits and a lump-sum payment equivalent to about 2-year's salary.
Typically, civil servants in the groups targeted for retrenchment are in the Rs
20,000-40,000 a year salary group, are 40 years of age, and have 15 years of
service. Under certain simplifying assumptions, for a civil servant in this
category, earning Rs 30,000 a year, the compensation package amounts to Rs 55,000
and the pension to Rs 18,000 a year. From a cash-flow point of view the pay-
back period is about four-years (see Table 6 in Annex IV for details). In net
present value terms, however, the budgetary savings are higher since included
in the compensation package is a lump-sum payment to which all retirees are
entitled to--the so-called "commuted pension' whereby a retiree has the option
of receiving up front, at the time of retiring, 2-years of pension equivalent
against a 0I reduction for 10 years in the value of the monthly pension he is
entitled to. As the pension increases with the number of years in service, the
lump-sum payment for commuted-pension would have been higher in case of non-
retrenchment. Interpreting the compensation package as the initial investment
of a project and the budgetary savings as benefits, the internal rate of return
is 27.2Z. The total cost to retrench 8,000 in 1990 is about Rs 400 million.
48.   The reduction in over-staffing will take place while the government is
transferring the responsibility of numerous administrative functions to the newly
established Provincial Councils. As a result of the Sri Lanka-India Peace Accord
of 1987, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution created 8 Provincial Councils
(PCs) with a fair degree of autonomy (although they are subordinate to the
Parliament, in particular as to compliance with national policy and control of
the annual budget) to manage government services in social and economic sectors
such as health, education, irrigation, etc. These new administrative entities
have been in existence since 1988 but, until very recently, they were not
operational. The process of devolution of power is now being accelerated with
transfers of staff and resources from the central ministries to the PCs. As the
taxation powers of the PCs are limited, the bulk of their expenditure program
is financed by budgetary allocations from the central government. About one-
third of the central government's non-interest, non-defense current expenditures
was transferred to the PCs in the 1990 budget while about half the staff now in
the Central Ministries are being gradually transferred to the provincial public
services.  It is important that the problem of overstaffing in the central
ministries be not also transferred in the process. For this purpose, the SCC
has made an estimate in 1989 of the staffing needs of each PC and a monitoring
unit has been established in the Plan Implementation Division of the Ministry
of Policy Planning and Implementation to conduct censuses of public servants
covering the entire public sector, including the provincial council services,
the 86 decentrslized units of government and the public corporations. This unit
carried out the first census in January 1990, will carry out a second one in
September 1990 and again in each September until a full personnel information



-20-
system is established. This unit is also responsible for monitoring the freeze
now in effect, and for approving recruitment in exceptional cases where essential
skills are needed.  In addition, an expenditure control system is now being
established to monitor and control the use of all Central Government provisions
to the Provincial Councils.
49.   The problem of overstaffing also exists in public corporations and
decentralized units of the Government.   In the case of public corporations,
overstaffing Is being addressed as a part of the general restructuring process
and privatization of public enterprises.  In the case of decentralized units of
government, the Government will conduct a review during 1990 to assess the
problems and set retrenchment targets for the future.  Meanwhile, obvious cases
are being addressed on an individual basis.   The River Valley Development
Authority (RVDA), for example, with a staff strength of 2,000, was duplicating
functions under the Ministry of Irrigation and Mahaweli. In January 1990, the
Cabinet decided to close down the RVDA and retrench its 1,600 staff. Similarly
during 1990, the Paddy Marketing Board will be restructured with a view to
rationalizing its activities and reduce its 1,600 staff strength to probably less
than 500 (see para. 68).
50.   Recruitment and Promotion.  Depoliticizing recruitment and promotion is
another important objective of the Administrative Reform. The Government has
already taken some administrative steps to return to a system of recruitment
based on competition. It is now preparing legislation to create, by the end of
1990, a powerful independent Commission to oversee recruitment, promotion,
appointments, dismissal and discipline in the public service. As a first step,
the delegation of powers from the Public Service Commission (PSC) to ministries
will be withdrawn; and the delegation from the Cabinet to the PSC will remain.
In the case of the Provincial Councils, each Provincial Governor may appoint a
Provincial Public Service Commission, to which he may delegate his powers of
appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the
provincial public service. Before the end of 1990, the Government will ensure
that all the Governors have delegated their powers to the Provincial Public
Service Commissions and that they operate on the same lines as the all-island
Commission.
51.   Developing a better personnel management capability and improving staff
motivation will be one of the main functions of the newly created Policy Division
of the Ministry of Public Administration. As part of its activities it will
carry out during 1991 a study of public service remunerations (including base
salary, allowances, holidays, pensions, housing and other benefits) as compared
with a range of comparable private sector employees and corporations.   This
review will focus on whether after implementation in 1988 cf the wage increases
recommended by the ARC, relatively low pay at the higher levels and excessively
high pay at the lower levels, is still a problem.
52.  An important reason for Sri Lanka's high youth unemployment is that young
people queue awaiting a job in government because, except for the most senior
levels and some technical streams, the government pays higher salaries and
provides better benefits than the private sector. For example, civil servants
are entitled to a non-contributory pension scheme whereby they can draw a pension
of 852 of their last year's salary when they retire at age 55. Employees in the



-21-
private sector are only entitled to a lump-sum payment when they retire (also
at 55). This lump-sum is paid by the Employees Provident Fund (BPP) a fund which
is entirely invested in long-term government securities (which pay lower than
market interest rates) and treasury bills (which pay market interest rates), to
which both employees and employers have to contribute through high taxes on wages
(over 202).
53.   The Cabinet approved in March 1989 the conversion of the EPP into the
Employees'  Pension Scheme  (BPS).   This is a contributory pension scheme
actuarially valued in 1984 by the International Labor Organization.   The
necessary legislation is being drawn with ILO assistance and will be enacted
during 1990 to enable an early start to be made on the technical preparations
for the introduction of the scheme in 1991 provided the ILO actuarial update of
the 1984 study, now ongoing, proves that the scheme is financially viable and
imposes no financial obligations on the Government. The creation of the EPS will
help to make employment conditions in the private sector more comparable with
those in the public sector and will also facilitate the transfer of staff who
are retrenched, or otherwise wish to leave pensionable posts, to the private
sector. While the initial EPS envisaged retirement at age 55 for males and 50
for females, appropriate changes will b2 introduced to increase the retirement
age by 5 years.
54.   The review and adoption of corrective measures to reduce costs of the
Government's overly generous pension scheme is another measure supported by the
ERC. By June 1990, the Government will have appointed a group of experts to
review the conclusions of a 1989 study which highlighted the high cost of the
scheme and its potentially serious fiscal consequences in the future. While the
1989 study was of a preliminary nature, it clearly identified, inter alia, the
need to increase both the retirement ages of public servants and the qualifying
periods for full pension benefits. By the end of 1990, based on the new study's
conclusions, the Government will formulate an action plan to reduce the cost of
the existing government pension scheme.
Public Investment Promgam.
55.   The Public Investment Program was at levels as high as 16-17? of GDP in
the late 1970's and early 1980's.  As indicated earlier, the high level of
Government capital expenditures crowded out the private sector, was at the origin
of a significant expansion of the public sector, and was the cause of
macroeconomic imbalances that have yet to be corrected.   In addition, the
emphasis on power, irrigation and land settlement projects crowded out other
important investments in transportation, health, and education as well as
appropriate provisions for maintenance in general.
56.   In the PFP macroeconomic framework, the overall level of public capital
expenditure is expected to decline from 10-11? of GDP in recent years to 9-10X.
This is a level that can be financed through foreign aid and public savings --
thus reducing the Treasury's domestic borrowing requirements to a negligible
amount in the mid 1990's -- and it is also a level that is sufficient to develop
the country's infrastructure at an appropriate pace.



-22-
57.   Corrective measures have also been taken regarding sectors which have been
neglected in the past. In the case of transportation, with IDA assistance, a
comprehensive rehabilitation and investment program covering the most important
transportation modes is being developed. This program, to be financed by IDA
as well as several multilateral and bilaterals, includes fundamental
institutional changes, such as the commercialization of the railways (now a
Government department) as well as a variety of investment projects. Similarly,
in the case of health and education, capital expenditures had fallen to less than
1Z of GDP in the mid-1980s. This has been increasing gradually since then and
capital expenditures in health and education have risen to the more appropriate
level of 1.5Z of GDP in the last two years.  IDA is supporting this renewed
Government emphasis on health and education through recently approved projects
in each sector. Both projects focus on management issues and, in addition to
providing needed assets or rehabilitation of existing ones, they aim at
increasing the efficiency of government spending in these two sectors.
58.   During 1989, as a result of the need to contain f'scal expenditures within
the limits set in the second-year PFP, across-the-board cuts in expenditure had
to be implemented in the last four months of the year.   As a result, the
implementation of a number of foreign-aid financed public investment projects
was delayed for lack of adequate counterpart funds. The Government is taking
steps to ensure that this problem is not repeated in 1990 and beyond.   The
External Resources Department in the Ministry of Finance has already begun a
review of implementation problems for foreign-aid financed projects and the
results of the review are being discussed with the Ministry of Policy Planning
and Implementation as well as donors. This exercise will define the budgetary
allocations necessary to ensure the timely executions of projects included in
the Public Investment Program. If these budgetary allocations exceed the fiscal
targets indicated in the PFP-SAF, there will be no option but to eliminate some
projects from the Public Investment Program. This elimination will be guided
by an exercise recently completed whereby the Ministry of Policy Planning and
Implementation, in discussions with the sectoral ministries, has formulated a
priority ranking of all projects. This exercise provided the basis of a core-
public investment program that will be protected in the case of revenue short-
falls or any other unexpected negative fiscal development. An essential part
of this exercise was to ensure adequate provisions for maintenance, particularly
for roads, an area neglected in the past.
Conditions of Second Tranche Disbursement
59.   The second tranche would be disbursed in Jansary 1991 after satisfactory
progress is achieved in implementing the administrative reform and restructuring
the Public Investment Program. In assessing performance in the implementation
of the administrative reform, IDA will examine whether: (i) the total staff-
strength of the central and provincial administrations is reduced by 15,000-
20,000 by end of 1990; for maximum clarity, the base population from which this
reduction will come is defined as employees in central ministries and departments
(including casual staff and staff paid from Advance Accounts funds); employees
of central government ministries and departments in provincial and district sub-
units; and employees of provincial public services; as of January 1, 1990 this
base population consisted of 527,000; in addition the September 1990 census of
public servants has been completed and an expenditure control system for the



-23-
Provincial Councils has been established; (ii) a target for retrenchment in 1991
is agreed upon during 1990 and incorporated in the 1991 budget; (iii) a plan for
identifying and reducing overstaffing in decentralized units of government is
agreed upon by end-1990--part of this plan is the completion of the Paddy
Marketing Board's (PMB's) restructuring now on-going; (iv) legislation has been
approved by the Cabinet establishing an independent Commission to oversee
recruitment, promotion and discipline throughout the public sector; (v) the
legislation for converting the EPF into the EPS is completed and enacted,
provided the actuarial update proves that the pension scheme is financially
viable and imposes no financial obligations on the Government; and (vi) the
government's pension fund has been reviewed by end-1990 and an action plan to
reduce its fiscal cost has been agreed upon with IDA and measures to reduce its
cost have been incorporated in the 1991 budget. Assessment of performance in
restructuring the Public Investment Program will be based on agreeing on an
action plan to address the problems discussed in para.58, including the
definition of a core program, and the incorporation of the plan's recommendations
in the 1991 budget.
C. Private Sector Development
60.   The ERC would also support the two-pronged approach the Government is
pursuing in developing the private sector. On the one hand, the Government is
changing the overall regulatory and incentive framework in ways that will
facilitate and support private sector initiatives and, on the other, it is making
room for the private sector by gradually transferring wherever possible and
feasible, assets and activities now being managed by the Government.
Past Improvements in the Regulatory and Incentive Framework.
61.   Since liberalization in 1977 there have been five major improvements in
the regulatory and incentive framework. The first was the liberalization of
international trade.   All quotas and bans on imports of non-agricultural
commodities have been eliminated and, with a few exceptions, so were all import
licensing requirements. In addition, tariffs have been gradually reduced and
the maximum nominal rate on non-agricultural imports is now 60?.   Foreign
exchange controls were also reduced in the process.   All importers  are
automatically granted the amount of foreign exchange they require, except in very
few exceptional cases.
62.   The second is the liberalization in the investment regime.  Regulations
for foreign investment became increasingly liberal in the last ten years and the
free trade zones have proven an excellent vehicle to attract export-oriented
foreign investors. In November 1989, the 1002 tax on transfer of equity shares
between foreigners was eliminated. In late 1988, the Government also disbanded
the Local Investment Advisory Committee, a legacy of the years of the controlled
economy, which had to approve all new domestic investments. At about the same
time, the Government also abolished legislation from the 1970's enabling the
expropriation of any private concern if this was considered by the Government
to be in the country's interest (The Government Business Acquisition Act).
63.   The third is the liberalization of domestic trade of agricultural products
as well as of inputs for agriculture, particularly fertilizer. Until the late



-24-
1970's the marketing of rice was a government monopoly, as were the import and
marketing of fertilizer, sugar, rice and wheat, but this situation has
considerably changed since the early 1980's. The Paddy Marketing Board's (PMB's)
monopoly was abolished and its functions are now that of a purchaser of last
resort. Its total purchases in the domestic market have been gradually declining
and are now at less than 5? of total domestic production while the remainder is
being handled by private traders. Likewise, in the case of fertilizer (which
is entirely imported; the only domestic fertilizer producing plant was closed
in 1985 because of the heavy subsidies it required from the budget), the state
import- and trade-monopoly were abolished and private and public sector importers
now compete on equal terms in importing and marketing fertilizer. Finally, since
1988, imports of sugar have been liberalized and the import monopoly of the Food
Commissioner abolished. Thus, since 1989, the private sector has been importing
most of the sugar not produced locally. Wheat is the only commodity for which
imports and marketing are still handled by state agencies, mostly because: (i)
a large share of wheat imports is financed by aid; and (ii) in the early 1980's
the Government signed a 20-year contract with a private foreign miller
guaranteeing a minimum amotmt of wheat-grain per year to be processed at that
mill for a fee fixed in real terms.
64.   The fourth, is the recent introduction of market-determined mechanisms to
determine freight rates. The Central Freight Bureau (CFB) which was in charge
of allocating both domestic and foreign cargo to shipping lines and regulating
freight rates was dismantled in December 1989 and freight rates have declined
by 40? since then. In addition, a high level committee has been established to
examine whether Air Lanka is constraining in any way the development of air
freight or distorting rates. The recommendations of this committee should be
known in a few months and will be implemented before the year-end.
65.   The fifth is the liberalization of financial and insurance markets. Since
the early 1980's, entry in these markets has become essentially free (insurance
markets since 1986) with the result that the number of private banks (both
domestic and foreign) has now increased to 22 while, since 1986, two new private
insurance companies have begun to compete with the two state-owned insurance
companies.  Interest rates have become increasingly market determined as the
Central Bank has reduced its role in the Treasury Bills primary market.  In
addition, special (subsidized) lines of credits have become a relatively
unimportant component of total credit and the system of setting indicative credit
*targets--still in effect in the mid-1980's-- at the sector level for the entirety
of the banking system has been entirely abolished.
66.   Further Deregulation.  In spite of these substantial measures the business
community feels its activities are still excessively constrained by cumbersome
and time-consuming bureaucratic procedures.   To address this problem,  the
Government has appointed a high level committee, chaired by a private sector
representative, which aims at facilitating the dialogue between the Government
and the private sector and at examining and proposing remedies for private sector
grievances.   This committee should issue its first report shortly and its
recommendations will be implemented during 1990.
67.   Tariffs.  The level of effective protection has been already considerably
reduced over the last ten years, particularly in the last two years when the



-25-
maximum nominal tariff on non-agricultural commodities was reduced from over 1002
to 60Z, the minimum tariff was increased to lOS, and most import licensing
requirements that could not be justified on health or security grounds were
eliminated. In the 1990 budget, the Government has already made progress towards
introducing a four-band system with four basic rates, but, allegedly to protect
industries against dumping, a number of effective duties had been enacted, the
tariff equivalent of which is well above 602. An IDA financed study is now
reviewing this problem and, during 1990, through the 1991 Budget, the Government
will reduce the maximum nominal tariff rate to 50S and take steps to introduce
a system with four tariff rates for non-agricultural products, whereby goods
within the same category are dutied at the same rate. In this new tariff system
specific duties vill not be a disguised form of keeping effective protection at
high levels but will be only used for documented cases of dumping. This system
will be in effect until the time an anti-dumping legislation is enacted.
68.   The ERC will also support steps aimed at further increasing the role of
the private sector in the marketing of rice and fertilizer. In the case of rice,
with the liberalization of domestic distribution, the role of the PMB has lost
its significance. Yet, the Government feels that there is still a need for a
small-scale purchaser of last resort for a limited number of paddy surplus area
during the harvest season. It has thus decided to limit PMB's role to purchasing
rice in these areas, storing and selling it. By the end of 1990, PMB will reduce
it staff to the level of about 450 employees (from about 1,600 at present),
divest most of its milling facilities and about half of its storage capacity.
During 1990, the Government will also test the feasibility of hiring authorized
agents for rice purchase and sales on behalf of PMB, and employ a system of
bonded warehouses so that PMB can divest its remaining functions to the private
sector at a later date.
69.   In the case of fertilizer, subsidies were entirely eliminated as of January
1, 1990, a radical departure from a policy in effect for several decades. The
public sector is still excessively involved in importing and marketing
fertilizer, however, mostly because state-owned enterprises are responsible for
marketing aid-financed import of fertilizer which in recent years accounted for
over half of total fertilizer imports. On the other hand, since there are few
participants in the market, due care has to be paid not to create the conditions
for a monopoly or an oligopoly to emerge. Before the end of 1990, the Government
will agree with IDA on a plan to increase the role of the private sector; the
main options being considered at the moment are making available on equal terms
to both private and public sector importers, aid-financed imports of fertilizer
and privatizing the public sector firms that import and market fertilizer.
Making Room for the Private Sector.
70.   The ERC would also  support  the Government's  initiatives  aimed  at
transferring to private enterprises assets and activities where there is no need
for public sector involvement. This is a process that was started in the early
1980's and which is only now gaining momentum. Until 1987, sixteen state-owned
enterprises with about 7,000 employees, had been closed down or sold to the
private sector.   During 1987, a Privatization Commission appointed by the
President, selected three enterprises for privatization during 1988 (United
Motors, Ceylon Oxygen and State Distilleries).   Because of the uncertainty



-26-
brought about by the elections and the deterioration in the investment climate
in 1988, however, these sales were delayed. In 1989, United Motors (with about
800 employees) was sold through a public offering of shares, while a textile mill
(Thulhiriya, with about 1,500 employees) vas sold directly to a foreign investor.
The sale of a small restaurant-hotel (Hotel de Buhari with slightly over 100
employees) is being negotiated with unions and should be completed in a few
months time.
71.   Direct foreign equity participation is now being negotiated for Ceylon
Oxygen (450 employees) and State Distilleries (2,000 employees). More generally,
with IDA's assistance, the Government is formulating a strategy to privatize
wherever possible, and commercialize where not, the entirety of public
enterprises in the manufacturing sector (about 40) as well as a few in the
trading sector. This plan should be ready towards mid-1990 and could form the
basis for a second IDA supported adjustment operation.  In addition to this
process, the ERC would support reforms in two other sub-sectors: (i) bus
industry; and (ii) tree-crops.
72.   Bus Sector.  For the majority of people in Sri Lanka, bus transport is the
only available form of mechanized transport.   In mid-1988, there were only
150,000 private cars and 227,000 motor-cycles in a country with a population of
over 16 million and approximately 3.5 million households. Hence, over 90Z of
families are unlikely to have access to a motorized vehicle of their own. The
only other major public transport mode is the railway. However, its role is
limited; it is a provider of suburban transport in the greater Colombo area and
an inter-city carrier.   In 1987 there were only 60 million passenger-trips on
the railway compared to more than 2 billion on the combined bus fleets of the
private and public sectors.
73.   In 1954, the 73 private bus companies then operating in the country were
nationalized and bus transportation became a monopoly of the Central Transport
Board (CTB), an entirely state-owned enterprise. In 1979, however, following
the liberalization of the economy, the Government decided to free the entry to
private bus owners but no changes were made to allow the CTB to compete more
effectively with the private sector. Public sector purchasing and personnel
rules were retained and fares were controlled. This omission brought about a
gradual deterioration in CTB's services while the privately owned buses
prospered.
74.   Within 10 years, the private sector registered more than 12,000 (mostly
small) buses and it now provides more than half the passenger-miles supplied by
the bus industry in the country. At the same time, the CTB's (mostly large)
buses effectively in service every day declined from 6,500 in the early 1980's
(out of a fleet of 7,500) to 3,500-4,000 at present (thus making redundant 20,000
of CTB's 52,000 total employees). This deterioration in CTB's service is the
result of fares which have been frozen since 1983 (they were also frozen to the
private operators); overstaffing; and government interference in management which
prevented CTB from operating as a commercial concern. Since 1985, CTB has been
operating at a loss which has been covered by subsidies and, as these proved to
be inadequate, by the non-payment of bills. At the beginning of this year, the
CTB had accumulated debts amounting to more than US$35 million on an annual
turnover of about US$60 million. The most significant liabilities are those owed



-27-
to the Employees Provident Fund, (US$30 million), the state Tire Corporation
(US$4.5 million), and the state oil company (US$0.75 million). In addition, the
freeze on fares has constrained the expansion of private bus operators and with
the decline in CTB buses in operation, this has meant a gradual and serious
deterioration in the services provided by the country's most important means of
transport. In December 1989, the Cabinet endorsed a plan to: (i) de-regulate
bus fares; (ii) create a new bus regulatory authority with only passive powers
to restrict operation of new or additional services; (iii) introduce a voluntary
retirement scheme for staff-surplus, followed by a compulsory retirement scheme
if the redundancy target of 20,000 is not met; (iv) discontinue operations of
the Central Transport Board; and (v) transfer the assets of the Board to the
remaining employees so as to create new companies centered around existing
depots.
75.   The proposal agreed by the Cabinet in December 1989, has since been refined
by consultants financed by IDA. An action plan has been prepared and will be
implemented beginning in June 1990. Between now and then, the value of the
Transport Boards' assets and liabilities is being appraised and a detailed plan
is being prepared for their disposal. The CTB's assets will form the basis of
new companies, relatively small (i.e., with an average fleet size no larger than
100), owned by the workers and to be formed once the retrenchment of 20.000
surplus staff is completed. Workers who are not in the retrenched 20,000-group
will be required to put the equivalent of the compensation package as their
contribution to the equity of the newly formed companies. Whenever the value
of the assets transferred to a company exceeds the value of the workers' equity
contribution, the balance will be transformed into a loan to be repaid over a
4-6-year period. The Government has decided to keep the asset value of the new
companies to a minimum by: (i) privatizing facilities, such as the s,?ecialized
workshops and the driving schools; and (ii) transferring to the appropriate local
authority any town center bus terminals owned by the CTB.
76.   Between now and June 1990, the Government will complete the retrenchment
of 20,000 surplus staff; prepare the list of new companies specifying the assets
of each company; and the list of workers associated with each company.  The
number of companies, the financial structure, their size and the number of
workers associated to each company will be discussed and agreed upon with IDA
before implementation begins in June. The implementation process is expected to
be completed by March 1991.  In the meantime the Government:  (i) in January
1990, raised fares for private operators by 502 for short distances, and 25? for
longer distances; as the companies emerging from the dismantling of CTB are
formed starting in June 1990, they will be automatically granted a similar
increase; this would be the first step towards the total deregulation of fares
to be implemented by December 1990; and (ii) in mid-February 1990, announced the
terms of the voluntary retirement scheme.
77.  An important component of the program is the creation of a new regulatory
authority within the Department of Transport to ensure that the system operates
on a competitive basis. This authority would be responsible for: (i) issuing
route licenses; (ii) enforcing safety standards; and (iii) ensuring the servicing
of uneconomic routes in the rural areas by auctioning such routes. Technical
assistance is to be provided to help structure this new organization. Additional
technical assistance will also be provided to help the new companies establish



-28-
themselves. Part of this may be financed through an existing UNDP project with
the CTB which is administered by the ILO.
78. Tree Crops. The Government has also decided to improve the performance
of the tree-crops sector possibly through an increase in the role of the private
sector. As a result of nationalization during the 1970's, about 500 estates
producing mostly tea and rubber but also coconut have been transferred to two
state-owned corporationst the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) and the
State Plantations Corporation (SPC).   These two corporations now own about
110,000 ha of land under tea (half of the country's area under tea), 60,000 ha
of land under rubber (30S of the country's area under rubber); and 12,000 ha
under coconut (2.41 of the country's area under coconut). They employ close to
one-half million people and their total revenues are at about US$100 million
each. Taking into account the linkages with the rest of the economy, the well-
being of well over I million people is dependent on the performance of these two
corporations.
79.   In spite of substantial support from IDA as well as other multilateral and
bilateral institutions since the early 1980's, the financial performance of the
two corporations has been dismal and, by the end of 1989, they were technically
insolvent with large debt overhangs which are a threat to the solvency of some
of the major coumercial banks and many commercial suppliers. The deterioration
in the two corporations' performance is the result of three factors. The first
is the insufficient level of investment since the 1950's -- in anticipation of
a nationalization which was announced almost twenty years before it actually took
place in the 1970's, and after nationalization, because the government did not
make sufficient resources available to the sector. Foreign-aid helped to improve
the situation in the 1980's, but this improvement was modest in comparison with
the large investment needs in the sector. The second is the excessive government
and political interference in the management of the two corporations which
prevented them from operating as commercial concerns. Finally, the third is
costly labor agreements with the unions which transformed daily paid workers into
de facto monthly paid ones; prevented the free mobility of labor from one estate
to the other; and granted wage increases which bore no relationship with
productivity increases or the level of tea- and rubber-prices in world markets.
80.   In 1989, mostly as a result of excessive wage increases granted in 1988,
the two corporations were in violation of all the financial covenants in loan
agreements with IDA and other lenders and could only continue operating by
increasing overdrafts in commercial banks. To address the two corporations'
financial crisis, the Government appointed a high level Core Group to identify
the problems and prepare a program of action in consultation with IDA and other
lenders.
81.   Most of the recommendations of the Core Group have now been implemented.
The short-term financial crisis was addressed by (i) negotiating increased
management flexibility in the use of labor and reduced labor costs; and (ii)
reducing taxes on tea and rubber.  The financial situation was also improved by
the large devaluation of September 1989 and the increase in the international
price of tea. These measures are short-term in nature, however. A long-term
solution requires far reaching reforms in the way the two corporations are
managed. As a first step the Government has introduced a reorganization of the



-29-
two corporations aimed at reducing the over centralization of management in
Colombo; improving management's autonomy; and increasing accountability. The
502 JEDB and SPC estates were grouped on a geographical basis in 82 clusters -
- which are now run as independent operational and financial units -- in turn
grouped in 12 zones. While it is too early to assess how effective this new
system will be -- it began operating on January 1st, 1990 -- the first results
seem to be encouraging.
82. In the longer term, the public sector involvement in the tree-crops sector
should be reduced, but this is a decision which may prove politically difficult
to take. The government has requested IDA to finance a study of privatization
options to analyze the feasibility, merits and costs of each available option.
A group of experts under terms of reference that have been agreed upon with IDA
should begin work in June and the study should be ready toward the end of the
year. Based on a joint review of the conclusior of the study by the Government
and DAA an action plan will be agreed upon by the end 1990 to increase the role
of the private sector, if the study concludes that this is a feasible option.
Whether privatization will consist of sales or lease of assets to the private
sector or be restricted to the privatization of management through management
contracts is a decision that can only be taken after the completion of the IDA-
financed study. In any case, the recommendation of the Core Group to dispose
or convert to other uses (including forestry) estates which are inherently
unviable, will be implemented before the end of 1990. Following a recommendation
of the Core Group, these estates have already been identified during 1989.
Conditions for Second Tranche Disbursement
83.   The second tranche would be disbursed in January 1991 after satisfactory
progress is made in improving the regulatory and incentive framework and in
making room for the private sector. In assessing performance, IDA will examine
whether by the end of 1990: (i) air freight operations have been deregulated;
(ii) the maximum nominal tariff has been reduced to 502 and steps to introduce
a four-band tariff system with the characteristics outlined in Para. 67 have been
taken; (iii) the PMB has been restructured as outlined in Para. 68; (iv) the role
of the private sector in importing and distributing the fertilizer has been
increased as described in Para. 69; (v) 20,000 CTB employees have been retrenched
and the CTB restructuring plan outlined in paras. 74-77, including the total
deregulation of fares and the creation of a regulatory agency, has been
implemented; and (vi) a plan to restructure the tree-crops sector with a view
to increasing the role of the private sector has been agreed upon and the
inherently unviable estates have been converted to other uses.
D. Poverty Alleviation
84.   Recent poverty surveys (the last one available is based on 1985-86 data)
indicate that Sri Lanka's poverty situation (in terms of the number of people
below the poverty line) has improved throughout the 1980's, in spite of the slow-
down in economic performance in recent years. Social indicators such as infant
mortality, crude death rate and population growth rate have, likewise, continued
to improve. In addition, Sri Lanka has maintained its historically outstanding
performance in providing health and education services to practically the
entirety of the population. Declines in the quality of the services brought



-30-
about by declining budgetary allocations for operations and maintenance
throughout the mid-1980's are being corrected (see para.57) partly with the
support of two recent IDA-financed operations (one in 1988 and one in 1989) which
inter-alia, focus on improving the management of the health and education
delivery systems. These achievements notwithstanding, it is also clear that Sri
Lanka has a serious poverty and nutrition problem. According to the 1985-86
survey about 202 of the population was living in poverty. In a nutrition and
health survey carried-out in 1987, about 252 of the pre-school children were
found to be stunted (low height for their age) from malnutrition while about 102
were found to be acutely malnourished (low weight for their height).  These
problems could be exacerbated by the removal of subsidies on wheat-flour, rice,
fertilizer and bus-fares. The complete removal of subsidies on wheat-flour for
example, would imply a 852 price increase in relation to January 1989, while the
complete removal of the subsidy on rice already implied a 252 increase. These
increases are well above inflation, as well as past and expected wage increases.
According to the most recent (1986-87) Consumer Finance Survey, one-fourth of
the poorest 202 of the population's total expenditure is on rice (202) and wheat-
flour and bread (5%). Increases in these prices, together with those for bus-
fares, price of sugar, and the general effect of the devaluation on the cost of
living. could reduce the overall consumption levels of the poorest 202 of the
population from 82 of GDP before the beginning of the adjustment program to
around 6.52 -- under the extreme assumption that incomes of the poor are not
adjusted for inflation. This potential 202 reduction in consumption levels is
large for households at the border line of survival; it could lead to serious
hardship and increased malnutrition.
85.   To address this problem,  the Government is following a two-pronged
approach. First, subsidies are being removed gradually. The elimination of the
subsidy for rice for example has been stretched over six months, while in the
case of wheat-flour, by the time it is entirely eliminated in June 1990, it would
have taken almost one year. This gives time for households to adjust their
consumption patterns more smoothly, mitigates the impact on prices of subs' itutes
such as maize and sorghum (grains widely consumed among the poorest groups) and
also, to a certain extent, gives an opportunity for incomes to adjust.
86. Second, the Government has established the policy that the equivalent of
3.0-3.52 of GDP should be set aside every year from the budget and earmarked to
increase the living standards of the poorest 202 of society. Once this policy
is fully implemented, their consumption levels should increase from 82 of GDP
before the beginning of the adjustment program to about 9.0-9.5X. Putting this
policy into effect, however, requires a restructuring of the main anti-poverty
programs now in the budget -- the Food Stamp Program; the Mid-Day Meal; and the
Jana Saviya Program (JSP) -- so that they more effectively reach the poor. This
restructuring is a difficult one, both administratively and politically.
The Food Stamp Program
87. The Food Stamp Program (FSP) was devised in 1979 to transfer income
supplements to a targeted section of the population. Since its inception and
up to the present, the FSP has been providing income transfers to approximately
one-half of Sri Lanka's population. About 1.9 million households were receiving
food stamps benefits during 1989 out of about 3.5 million households in the



-31-
country. Under the current food stamp scheme, all households having a total
family income below Re 700 per month are eligible to receive food stamps with
benefits based an a sliding scale of income.

88.   Several studies have shown that the FSP has been providing a substantial
amount of benefits to non-intended beneficiaries since its inception. In 1981-
82, the bottom 20? in the disposable income range (theoretically the sole
beneficiaries of the scheme) received only 38Z of the total food stamp payments.
During 1986-87, nearly 50? of spending units in the third income quintile having
monthly incomes between Rs 1500 and Rs 2000; over 30? having monthly incomes
between Rs 2000 and Rs 3000, as well as 9? earning over Rs 3000 per month, were
recipients of food stamps. Further, survey data also indicate that an income
level of Rs 700 per month corresponded to the average income of the bottom 20Y
of the spending units in 1986/87. Hence, everything points to a substantial
leakage of benefits and the ERC would support the government's decision to
eliminate this leakage and make the FSP a more efficient and viable program thus
making it possible for the truly in need to receive larger benefits.



-32-
89.   The main purpose of restructuring the FSP is:  (i) to reduce by the end
of 1990 the present number of beneficiaries to one million households, which is
the number of truly needy families plus a reasonable number to account for the
practical impossibility of achieving perfect targeting; and (ii) increase the
benefits to households remaining in the program. The total budgetary allocation
for the FSP will remain at Rs 3.8 billion in 1990 and be Rs 3.8 billion or less
in the 1991 budget. The selection of beneficiaries will be performed at the
hamlet level using comnunity participation to the maxiaum extent through teams
of facilitators, selected from the community itself. A range of operational
selection criteria will be used to make identification of beneficiaries as
objective as possible. This criteria is being defined and tested based on field
work and will be discussed with IDA before the retargeting process begins in
July 1990. Likewise, the increase in benefits once the number of families under
the program is reduced to one million will also be discussed with IDA before it
is implemented.
The Jana Saviya Program
90. The Jana Saviya Program is the centerpiece of the Government's effort aimed
at alleviating poverty in Sri Lanka. It started as an ambitious program with
a budgetary allocation of Rs. 6.8 billion in the 1989 budget (Rs 4 billion in
1990).  As indicated earlier, and as initially conceived, the JSP aimed at
transferring Rs. 2,500 per month to each household in poverty during a two-year
period. It became quickly evident, however, that such a program would put unduly
high pressures on the budget. In addition, while the JSP contains some positive
features--such as improving the poor's access to productive resources--it
suffered from several shortcomings: (i) the selection criteria were too loosely
defined; (ii) it provided to families benefits which were large compared to
income levels prevailing in the country, thus creating strong disincentives to
work and conversely, strong wage pressures in the labor market; (iii) its
benefits were unrelated to the beneficiaries' income thus introducing strong
inequities; (iv) it was limited to two years while poverty is a long term problem
with complex roots which cannot be resolved over a short-period of time; and (v)
it failed to provide a safety net, i.e., families falling into poverty after the
selection process was completed would not benefit from the JSP.
91.   The Government's decision to restructure the JSP during 1989 has avoided
the serious budgetary and economic pressures, as well as the social tensions,
that the large scale implementation of the JSP would have inevitably brought
about. There are three essential elements to this restructuring. The Government
first decided to phase the JSP over a long period of time and to implement it
in about 10-12 rounds. Thus, in the first round, which began in October 1989,
only 188,000 families were declared eligible for the JSP benefits. Out of these
188,000 families, only 165,000 actually applied and became entitled to the JSP
benefit, i.e. about one-fourth of the estimated number of poor families in Sri
Lanka. Second, as far as the investment component is concerned, the Government
decided that families with viable investment projects would be assisted in
formulating such projects and in submitting them to the regular banking channels
or non-formal credit institutions as they become ready, without requiring the
prior disbursement of the investment component in a savings account. Third, the



-33-
Government decided to transform the JSP into a more production-oriented and
sustainable program.
92.   Transforming the JSP into a more production-oriented and sustainable
program is the most important and difficult aspect of the restrticturing. The
Government has requested IDA's assistance to design a poverty alleviation project
that could be sustained over the longer run. Preparatory work has already begun
and a project will be formulated in 1990 for implementation in the second half
of 1991 consisting of several components including: (i) a micro-enterprise
program that would include credit lines to the poor, technical assistance, and
an entrepreneurial development scheme; (ii) a nutrition program; and (iii) a
rural works program aimed at providing a minimum number of days of employment
per year to families i poverty. The implementation of the project will be done
through a newly established National Development Trust which would have minority
representation of the Government on its Board. The nutrition component of the
project will be targeted to children under three years of age and lactating
mothers and will be based on a pilot-prograr now being conducted by the Ministry
of Health with IDA's financial assistance. The results of this pilot program
should be ready in late 1990 and form the basis for a well-targeted nutrition
program under the Ministry of Health which would replace in 1991, at a smaller
coat, the mid-day meal now in operation.
93.   Meanwhile, the Government has agreed not to launch a second round of the
JSP unless the benefits it provides as well as its content and objectives are
consistent with the project to be financed by IDA. More specifically, were
there to be a second round of the JSP, it would not consist of a payment of Rs
1,500 per month to each selected household. In addition, before implementing
a second round of the JSP, its benefits, as well as its content and objectives
will be discussed and agreed upon with IDA.   The main alternatives being
considered by the Government at present (i) introducing a program -f financial
incentives to private sector firms to train and employ members of Jana Saviya
families; and (ii) developing a portfolio of labor intensive projects for
irrigation and road maintenance. Before either alternatives is implemented, the
Government will have a detailed estimate of their fiscal cost and, in any
circumstances, it will be within the Rs 4.4 billion allocated in the 1990 budget
for the JSP of which only Rs 2.9 billion will be necessary to cover the cost
associated to the families selected in the first round. Finally, the allocation
for the JSP in the 1991 budget to be presented to Parliament in November 1990
will be consistent with the target of allocating 3.0-3.52 of GDP to the FSP, JSP
and Mid-day Meal Program.   Included in the JSP budget would be the budget
allocation for TDA financed poverty alleviation project.
The Mid-Day Meal Program
94.   The Mid-Day Meal Program (MDMP) was launched in the beginning of 1989 with
a budgetary allocation of Rs 2 billion (i.e., over US$50 million at the exchange
rate prevailing at the time) with a view to providing one meal a day to all
children enrolled in primary and secondary schools in the country. In time, it
became evident that, in addition to being costly, the program was not achieving
the nutritional improvements it aimed at since it failed to reach the population
which is most nutritionally at risk, i.e., pre-school children. As indicated
earlier, with IDA's assistance, the MDMP will be replaced in 1991 by an island-



-34-
wide nutritional program focusing on pro-school children and lactating mothers.
The Government has decided to discontinue the progrsm entirely in its current
form after the conclusion of the school year, and the budgetary allocation for
1990 for the Mid-Day Meal program was thus substantially reduced to Rs 500
million, which is the amount necessary to continue the program until the end of
the school-year.   The Government is, however, analyzing the feasibility of
reviving a parallel program while improving its targeting. A pilot project is
now underway in four sub-districts (out of about 160 in the island) to provide
an additional food-stamp sufficient to purchase a meal of about 600-800 calories
(instead of the mid-day meal) to each school-going child belonging to poor
families. The Government would carefully asses the fiscal cost and reach an
agreement with IDA before ezpanding this new scheme. In any circumstance, the
additional cost of any new initiative should not exceed Rs 1 billion (0.42 of
GDP).  The Government would finance this additional fiscal cost out of tax
revenues which (as a result of rapid improvements in the security situation in
early 1990) are expected to be higher than envisaged when the 1990 budget was
prepared.   Were this not to be the case, the Government would introduce
compensatory cuts either to the KDMP or to the JSP.
Welfare Expenditures
95.   In addition to restructuring the anti-poverty programs along the lines
indicated above, the Government will also carry-out a comprehensive review of
all the welfare programs now being financed out of the budget with a view to
formulating a global polioy for alleviating poverty. Included in this review
will be an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of each program in the budget,
as well as an analysis of the need for new initiatives such as special education
and health programs targeted to the poor. The results of this work should be
ready by end-1990 and will be discussed with IDA.
Conditions for Second Tranche Disbursement
96.   The second tranche would be disbursed in January 1991 against satisfactory
performance in restructuring the main anti-poverty programt the FSP, the JSP
and the Mid-Day Meal Program.   In assessing performance, IDA will examine
whethers (i) the target of one million households for the FSP has been achieved
and the PSP has been restructured as outlined in para. 89; (ii) the JSP has been
restructured as outlined in paras. 92 and 93; (iii) the Mid-Day Meal Program has
been restructured as outlined in para. 74: and (iv) the overall budgetary
allocation for the these programs is kept within Rs 9.7 billion in 1990 and to
no more than 3.0-3.5Z of GDP in 1991.
E. Risks and Justification
Risks.
97.  The poor will xz X be the only ones affected by the measures under the
program. The middle-class will suffer from the removal of the fertilizer subsidy
(which is mostly used by the large and medium-sized farmers); from the general
increase in prices under the adjustment program; from the retargeting of the Food
Stamp Program; and from retrenchment. While compensation packages will provide
a cushion for those who are retrenched, there is no compensation for those who
will suffer from the other measures and this constitutes the primary political



-35-
risk of the program. The risk of policy slippage is therefore high, particularly
given the prevailing sensitive political and social environment. There are a
number of factors limiting the extent of this risk, however.  First, as the
measures tacen so far indicate, the Government is strongly committed to
implementing the program supported by the ERC. Second, essentially all of the
structural reforms supported by the ERC have been articulated within the
Government or by special official committees. There is thus a strong support
for the program within the administration. Finally, there is a growing awareness
among politicians that unless the economy is fundamentally restructured, the
country will not be able to emerge from its current economic and political
problems.
98.   The security situation is the second risk associated with the operation.
Were the security situation to deteriorate, reforming the economy would become
a low priority item on the Government's agenda, as it was amply demonstrated
during 1988 and first half of 1989. A deterioration in the security situation
would also put new pressures on the budget and undo most of the gains in
stabilizing the economy achieved in the last few monthk. Structural reform would
be undermined and most of its benefits negated. Fortunately, several current
developments suggest that the security situation is improving. These include
fewer incidents in the North and East accompanied by India's agreement to
withdraw its troops by March 1990, and a redoubled effort by the police and the
army to pursue the core of the leftist terrorist groups' leadership.   Since
October 1989, there have been no disruptions in Colombo and the central and
southern districts--the ones most seriously affected in 1988 and 1989--while
tourists as well foreign investors are gradually returning. In addition, the
Government has decided to take compensatory fiscal measures -- were there a need
to increase defense expenditures beyond what is envisaged in the 1990 budget -
- to protect the core investment program and the fiscal adjustment now underway.
Finally, even though there may be potentially serious risks associated with the
security situation, improving the economic situation is a pre-requisite for
lasting political stability and the ERC plays an important role in that respect.
Justification.
99.   In the last ten years,  Sri Lanka has made substantial progress  in
developing the basic institutional and legislative framework as well as the
incentive regime necessary for the efficient working of markets and private
sector expansion. At the same time, the country has continued to develop the
social sectors and programs that provide some relief to the poorest segments of
society.    In addition  to measures  aimed at supporting the Government's
stabilization measures, the proposed ERC would support the Government's effort
in addressing the major stumbling block remaining in Sri Lanka's development
path: the size of the public sector and its inefficient use of resources.
Financing the balance of payments over the next few years is an essential
condition for this program to succeed. Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserve
situation is such that without these resources, the adjustment program could not
proceed. The IDA resources provided through the credit will supplement those
already provided by the IMP under the SAP. In addition, the ERC will play a
major role in mobilizing additional resources from bilaterals.



-36-
F. Administrative Arrangements and Financing Plan
Credit Amount and Borrower
100.   Of the proposed Credit of US$90 million equivalent, US$85 million would
finance the foreign exchange cost of general imports; and US$5 million would
finance the technical assistance (TA) program (para.102). The proposed Credit
would be made to the Government of Sri Lanka, which would make US$85.0 million
available to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to administer and disburse the funds
against eligible imports. Of the remaining US$5 million, US$0.4 million would
be utilized to refinance the Project Preparation Facility and the balance would
be administered by the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation.   The
portion of the credit used to finance imports would be available for disbursement
in two tranches. The first tranche of US$42.5 million would be available upon
credit effectiveness; the second tranche of US$42.5 million, upon fulfillment
of the second tranche release condition (Annex VII), which is expected eight
months after the release of the first tranche. Of the remaining US$5 million,
US$0.4 million would be utilized to finance the Project Prepraration Facility
and the balance would be disbursed against the programs to be administered by
the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation.
101.  Financing.   The financing gap assumes the successful negotiation of a
third-year PFP-SAP in 1990. Even with such support the gap is particularly large
in 1990 and 1991. For 1992 and beyond, the financing gap is relatively more
modest and its financing should not be a problem assuming satisfactory
implementation of the adjustment program. Financing the gap in 1990 and 1991
relies ons (i) two AsDB adjustment operations, one on-going and the other planned
later in the year; (ii) the proposed ERC; (iii) an IDA Public Enterprises
Restructuring Credit under preparation; and (iv) future assistance presently
under discussion with bilateral agencies to cofinance the ERC. It is important
to note, once again, that the build up of reserves is modest and gross official
reserves would still be at about only two months, of imports by the end of the
adjustment period.

Technical Assistance
102. A technical assistance program is included in this operation to help the
Governments (i) implement the administrative and private sector reforms; (ii)
review and restructure the welfare programs; and (iii) prepare the studies
necessary to the devolution of power to the provinces and the implementation of
financial regulations for the new administrative systems. The terms of reference
for technical assistance and their timing has been agreed upon. About USS 2
million would support the implementation of tax policy and tax administration
reforms. The IMF would be the supervising agency for this component.
Procurement
103. The portion of the proposed loan to be administered by the Central Bank
of Sri Lanka would finance imports of all goods except for those in a list of
excluded goods ("negative list"), such as military or para-military items, luxury
goods, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, nuclear reactors and parts, and uranium.
Imports financed by other sources or valued at under US$10,000 would not be
eligible for IDA financing.   Contracts for the procurement of goods (and
services) estimated to cost the equivalent of $5.0 million or more each would
be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines. Contracts for the procurement of good estimated to cost less than
US$5.0 million equivalent shall be awarded; (i) for public procurement, on the
basis of the standard procedures of the purchasing institutions; and (ii) for
other purchasers, in accordance with standard commercial practice--but whenever
feasible, quotations from eligible suppliers from at least two countries should
be obtained.    Subject to IDA's prior approval,  certain commonly  traded
commodities may be purchased through price quotations available from organized
international commodity markets following procedures acceptable to IDA. The
minimum requirements for supporting documents to be submitted to IDA with
withdrawal applications and replenishment requests under Special Accounts are:
(i) purchase order or contract; (ii) invoice; (iii) evidence of receipt of goods
and services; and (iv) payment authorization. Consultants and experts to be
financed under the Credit would be selected and hired in accordance with IDA's
guidelines.
104. Retroactive financing of up to US$18 million equivalent would be provided
to cover eligible expenditures made prior to the signing of the proposed Credit
but after February 15, 1990. The domestic currency equivalent of the Credit
disbursements would be deposited into the Treasury account in the Central Bank
of Sri Lanka. The Central Bank would administer the proceeds of the Credit and
would be responsible for the coordination and collection of relevant
documentation from the commercial banks and submission of withdrawal applications
and supporting documentation to IDA.  For expenditures against contracts or
purchase orders of less than US$0.2 million equivalent, statements of expenditure
would be used. Related documentation, including invoices, would be retained by
the Central Bank for periodic review by the Association. Full documentation
would be required for all other expenditures above the US$0.2 million limit.
The C- it Closing Date is June 1994.



-38-
105. To expedite disbursement, the Government will open a Special Account in
a commercial bank through the Central Bank in U.S. dollars on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA.  Upon effectiveness, IDA would make an initial
deposit into the IDA Special Account of US$10.0 million. The Special Account
and the statements of expenditure would be audited every six months by
independent atuditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would include a
statement verifying the amount disbursed against statements of expenditures were
used for the purpose they were intended for. The auditor's report should include
an opinion on whether satisfactory procedures were in operation at the Central
Bank of Sri Lanka regarding the use of Statement of Expenditure.
Implementation
106. The implementation of the policies outlined in this letter has been given
the highest priority by the Government.   Several teams led by senior civil
servants have already been working on the implementation of the policy objectives
supported by the ERC under an Implementation Committee (IC), chaired by the
Secretary of State, Ministry of Policy Planning and Plan Implementation. This
Committee was formed in October 1989 to monitor the implementation of the
policies supported by the ERC as well as those in the second-year PFP and
operates as the technical secretariat of a Steering Committee, chaired by the
Secretary to the Ministry of Finance.  The Steering Committee includes the
Secretaries responsible for the areas related to the policies outlined in this
letter, i.e., the Secretaries to the Ministries of Administration, Provincial
Councils and Home Affairs, and Transport. The Steering Committee meets every
six-weeks to review progress in implementing the program while the IC meets as
frequently as necessary.
IV - Country Assistance Strategy and World Bank Group Operations
107. Since the first loan in 1954, the World Bank group has had a long and
productive relationship with Sri Lanka. In addition to the lending program, the
main building blocks of this relationship have been the (i) the Aid Group
Meetings held every year since 1964 through which the Bank was able to mobilize
substantial volumes of foreign aid and gave the Bank a leading role in aid-
coordination; and (ii) the economic and sector work based on which the Bank was
able to structure an economic dialogue covering the country's most pressing
policy issues.
108. Prior to the advent of the new Government in 1989, however, Bank assistance
to Sri Lanka was marked by large fluctuations both in terms of the content of
the policy dialogue and the volume of lending. The 1977 liberalization with its
emphasis on market forces and incentives to the private sector met with increased
Bank assistance mainly to the agriculture, transport and energy sectors. In
the next two years, because of the country's macroeconomic problems, the country
assistance strategy will focus on complementing the IMF's efforts to stabilize
the economy by addressing the structural causes for Sri Lanka's recurrent
external and domestic imbalances, while continuing our programs in developing
the country's infrastructure, sector policies and institutions. Thus, for the
first time, adjustment lending will have a prominent place in overall lending
to Sri Lanka through two operations: the proposed ERC and a Public Enterprise
Restructuring Project which is now being prepared to accelerate the structural



-39-
adjustment process in the manufacturing area, with particular attention being
given to the public manufacturing enterprises. In addition to the objectives
to be reached through adjustment lending, IDh's lending program for Sri Lanka
concentrates resources on the agriculture, industry, energy and infrastructure
sectors. In agriculture, the priority so far has been to rehabilitate the tree
crops subsector, which is an important source of foreign exchange, and promotion
of irrigation infrastructure to assist the Government's strategy of reaching near
self-sufficiency in rice. During the next few years, the emphasis would be to
improve efficiency of the tree crops subsector and remove bottlenecks by
strengthening agricultural extension services and research to expand and
diversify agricultural production. In the industrial sector, the emphasis has
been to promote outward-looking policies and provision of credit for viable small
and medium-scale industries. In the social sector, as indicated earlier, the
Bank is preparing a Poverty Alleviation Project, aimed at assisting the
Government to restructure its existing poverty program with a view to improving
its targeting and efficiency, and reducing its burden on the budget. Beyond
this, two projects in health and education has been recently approved and follow-
up projects are envisaged in about three to four years time. In energy, IDA has
provided financing for a number of power projects for generation, transmission
and distribution. The thrust of future operations will be to promote energy
conservation by improving efficiency of the distribution systems.   In the
transport sector, future investments would be to improve institutional and
operational efficiency as well as to continue rehabilitating and upgrading the
road network.   Another priority for the Government is to reconstruct areas
affected by the civil conflict and ehabilitate rundown infrastructure, and
expand the existing capital stock through new investments to support expanded
economic activity, particularly in the private sector. The Bank is assisting
the Government in this effort through an emergency reconstruction credit.
109. As of September 30, 1989, the World Bank has approved 12 loans totalling
US$143.2 million (net of cancellations) and 51 credits totalling US$1,125.3
million (net of cancellations) since the beginning of its operations in Sri
Lanka in 1954. About 422 of World Bank assistance has been for agriculture
(irrigation, tree crops, and rural and dairy development), 192 for power, 162
for industry including telecommunications and development finance company
operations, 132 for transportation and the remaining 102 among education, urban,
a program credit (involving the import of raw materials for industry), and water
supply.
110. The IFC has made a total investment in Sri Lanka of US$3.3 million
equivalent in equity and US$35.8 million equivalent in loans (gross commitments).
Investments have been made so far in two textile industries, one polypropylene
bag industry, one equipment-leasing company, one hotel, one private insurance
company, and two IFC lines of credit, one of which has been extended to the
Government-owned Bank of Ceylon for term loans to medium-sized industries.
V. Country Relations with the IMF
111. Following the implementation of the Government structural adjustment
program, a SAF arrangement was approved by the IMF Board in March 1988 for an
amount of SDR 142 million over a three-year period together with an SDR 109
million under the Compensatory Finance Facility (CFF). The second-year program



-40-
under the SAF arrangement, approved by the IMF Board in October 1989, was
developed in conjunction with the preparatory work for the ERC.  While each
institution is taking the lead in their particular area of expertise (e.g. tax
reform for IMF and expenditure rationalization for IDA), consistency and
coordination have been ensured through joint missions and preparation of the PFP.
112. Sri Lanka's outstanding purchases of the Fund's general resources as of
end-January 1990 are SDR 160 million and the outstanding SAF is SDR 112 million.
The outstanding Trust Fund Loans amount to SDR 2 million. Debt service payments
to the IMF are SDR 55 million in 1990; SDR 80 million in 1991 and SDR 65 million
in 1992.
VI.  Rectumendation
113. I am satisfied that the proposed flsvelopment Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.   I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Development Credit.

Dear Mr. Conables
Over the last two years we have been discussing with the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund an adjustment program for Sri Lanka which is
outlined in the first and second-year Policy Framework Papers (PFPs).  Since
early 1988, in support of this program, we have also been discussing the nature
and content of an IDA adjustment operation. The content of this operation and
the policy reforms to be supported by the ERC are outlined in the attached Letter
of Development Policy.

LETTER OF DEVELOPKENT POLICY
Dear Mr. Conable:
I. Measures Implemented to Date
1.    The Government formed after the Presidential and Parliamentary elections
of December 1988 and February 1989, was confronted with the formidable task of
addressing the country's serious macroeconomic imbalances, halting the rapid fall
of foreign exchange reserves, reviving the economy, and restoring political
order. With the social conflict escalating to an unprecedented degree in the
first half of 1989 we -laced our priority on civil and price stability, and opted
to maintain subsidized prices for wheat flour, bread, rice, fertilizer, railway
and bus fares even though we fully realized that adjustments of these prices were
necessary to arrest the deterioration of the economy.
2.    The 1989 budget also introduced a sizeable new poverty alleviation program
with the hope that, by alleviating poverty, social tensions would be reduced.
Two of its main components were the Jana Saviya Program (JSP), an anti-poverty
program based on income transfers to all families below a certain income
threshold, and a mid-day meal program aimed at distributing free meals to all
students in primary and seeondary schools. Partly because of the cost of these
programs and partly because of the legacy of decisions taken in 1988, the 1989
budget envisaged expenditures at 37Z of GDP --i.e. 3Z of GDP above the already
high level of expenditures reached in 1988 -- leading to an overall deficit of
14 of GDP.
3.    By July 1989, it becam  evident that without a major stabilization effort
a balance of payments crisis was ivminent and that the fiscal deficit could
exceed the budgetary targets because of a hlgher than expected cost of subsidies
and revenue shortfalls brought about by the security situation. The prospect
of further fiscal deterioration at a time when the balance of payments problem
was becoming acute prompted us to embark on a stabilization program that entailed
several important stepss (i) a sharp depreciation of the rupee from Re 35 per
US dollar in July to Re 40 by mid-Septembers  (ii) postponement of the Jana
Saviya program until October, and a change In its scope with a view to reducing
its cost; (iii) curtailing subsidies on fertilizer, wheat flour and rice through
a series of price adjustments starting in August and increasing the price of



-51-                               Arnex V
Page 3 of 19
petroleum in September; (iv) sharp reductions in non-wage non-interest government
expenditure in the last four months of 1989s and (v) tightening monetary policy
by increasing short-term interest rates and sharply reducing Central Bank's
holding of Treasury bills. These measures increased the cost of living and
reduced real incomes but, as they were introduced gradually, their political
impact could be contained.
4.    The stabilization measures formed the basis of a second-year PFP-SAP
arrangement and produced encouraging results with performance exceeding
expectations in many important respects. Tightened expenditure controls and
improving revenue flows in the last few months of 1989 kept the overall deficit
within the PFP target of 12.52 of GDP (the original budget was 13.72 of GDP).
Even though foreign financing fell short of expectations, domestic financing was
on target and bank financing was marginally negative.  The balance of payments
responded strongly and immediately: the current account deficit for 1989 is now
estimated to have been 8.72 of GDP, no larger than in 1988, and 1.62 of GDP below
what was envisaged when the PFP targets were set in July. Inflation, however,
is one area where the stabilization program has not been successful yet. In
spite of tight monetary policies, and partially as a result of the devaluation
and reduction in subsidies combined with a short-fall in food supplies, inflation
accelerated in late 1989 and early 1990; the Colombo Consumer Price Index
increased by 3.82 in December, 2.51 in January and 1.6X in February. We believe
that this acceleration in inflation is temporary, however, and that with
continued restrictive fiscal and monetary policies inflation should be moderate
in mid-1990.
II. Priorities and Policies for the 1990's
5.    At the heart of the 1989-92 adjustment program outlined In both the first-
and second-year PFP are reforms focusing on the public sector, its efficiency,
its size, its claims on resources and its use of such resources. We have become
increasingly aware that the inefficient use of public sector resources is a
fundamental cause for the country's inability to achieve and sustain high rates
of economic growth. Sri Lanka cannot afford another decade of foregone growth
and the Government is committed to taking every step necessary to ensure that
the 1990's not be lost in terms of development. With this objective in mind,
we are determined to Mi) reduce the size of the public sector and improve its
efficiency; (ii) take steps to develop the private sector; and (iii) reduce
poverty. The first priority is, however, to build upon the solid start of the
1989 stabilization program and to strengthen efforts to reduce the country's
unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances by adhering to the targets specified in
the second-year PFP and, where possible, improving upon them. This should provide
a good basis for requesting a third-year SAP arrangement with the IMP towards
the middle of this year.
A. Macroeconomic Eolicies; Stabilization and Pricing Issues
6.    Fiscal Objectives and Policies.  As indicated in the second-year PFP, the
Government intends to reduce the fiscal deficit from 12.5Z of GDP in 1989 to
10.42 of GDP in 1990, 92 in 1991 and 8S in 1992, mostly through a reduction in



-52-                              Annex V
Page 4 of 19
current expenditures -- from 22.92 of GDP in 1989 to 19.72 in 1992.   The
reduction in current expenditures will be brought about by a further reduction
in subsidies in the short-run and, in the more medium-term, by: (i) reduction
in staffing levels in the public sector; (ii) lower interest rates as the
Government's domestic borrowing needs are gradually reduced as indicated in the
second-year PFP -- from 9.52 of GDP in 1988 to 6.82 in 1989; 4.12 in 1990; 2.62
in 1991; and 1.42 in 1992; and (iii) hopefully, lower defense expenditures as
the security situation improves.
7.    Subsidies and Price Adiustments.   Subsidies for the Sri Lanka Central
Transport Board (CTB), fertilizer, and rice have already been entirely
eliminated, while that for wheat-flour has been substantially reduced. The main
subsidies remaining in the budget are thus those for wheat flour, railways, and
sugar producers. During 1990, the policy begun in September 1989 of gradually
increasing the price of wheat-flour by 8-92 a month will be continued until the
subsidy is entirely eliminated, probably by May-June, 1990.  In the case of
railways, a restructuring plan is now under discussion with the World Bank and
several bilaterals. As the plan is drawn-up, measures to reduce costs and
increase revenues will be gradually implemented with the objective of reducing
in 1991 the railways subsidy to two-thirds of the amount in 1990, i.e. to Rs 350
millions or less. The last increase in electricity tariffs was in January 1988
and with the cost escalations that have occurred since then a substantial
increase became necessary.   The Cabinet has thus approved a 352 increase,
effective April 1, 1990.
8.    In the case of sugar, we are seeking solutions to reduce the tariff on
sugar imports necessary to afford protection to the domestic sugar industry.
As a first step, we have decided to suspend all the Government-sponsored projects
aimed at expanding capacity in the sugar industry. Next, with the assistance
of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), a study has just begun to examine whether
or not there are technical, managerial, or policy decisions that could, in the
next year or two, help to reduce production costs to a level reasonably close
to the international price of sugar, i.e. to no more than 10-252 above the
long-run c.i.f. price. This exercise should be completed by May-June 1990 and
will be the basis of an action plan to be agreed upon with IDA and the AsDB to
restructure the sugar industry. The plan will aim at bringing, within two or
three years, the domestic price of sugar to levels reasonably close to the c.i.f.
price at which Sri Lanka can import sugar.
9.    Taxation Policy.  At about 212 of GDP, the overall level of taxation is
high for a country at Sri Lanka's income level. As part of the stabilization
effort, our first priority is to ensure that this level of taxation is maintained
and several measures were introduced in the 1990 budget for that purpose. In
the more medium term, our objective is to broaden the tax base, improve its
elasticity and reduce its regressiveness. A high level Tax Commission has been
appointed to review the tax system and make recommendations for change by the
end of 1990. After review and discussions with IDA and the IMP, a plan to
implement these recommendations will be agreed upon with IDA and the first phase
of such plan will be incorporated in the 1991 budget to be presented to the
Parliament in November 1990.

10.   Monetary Policies.  Continued restrained monetary and credit growth, in
effect since mid-1989, will be essential in stabilizing the economy.   As
indicated earlier, the Central Bank has been mopping up liquidity by reducing
the proportion of outstanding Treasury bills it holds, initially raising interest
rates considerably.   This policy will be continued during 1990, adjusting
interest rates as necessary. The reduction in the size of the fiscal deficit,
improved financial conditions in the corporate sector (both private and public)
and stronger export performance, are expected to facilitate the realization of
the money and credit growth targets necessary to achieve the PFP's balance of
payments and inflation targets.
11.   Exchange Rate Policy.  Maintenance of a competitive exchange rate policy
would be crucial to the macroeconomic and structural reform objectives of the
second-year PFP-SAF program. Financial policies and a low inflation environment
will be key to its achievement. Toward this end, under the SAP arrangement, we
have also undertaken to review and adjust the exchange rate as necessary, in
consultation with the IMF. The conduct of exchange rate policy is monitored
under the SAF arrangement with benchmarks for net official reserves and indices
of the real effective exchange rate vis-a-vis trading partners and export
competitors.
B. Public Sector Rationalization
12.   Most of the policies discussed in this letter will, directly or indirectly,
help establish a better and more efficient public sector and reduce public
spending but there are three areas which will merit special attention in that
regards (i) the administrative reform; (ii) welfare programs; and (iii) the
public investment program. Regarding the administrative reform, in addition to
the section below, an attachment to this letter provides a more detailed account
of our objectives and actions in this area.
Administrative Reform.
13.   We believe we urgently need to re-establish a public service which meets
the best international standards, as was the case before 1972. Sri Lanka needs
a smaller, more efficient, fairly paid and highly motivated public service, one
which provides a better standard of service to the population and more effective
project implementation. Thus, while reducing overstaffing and the fiscal cost
of the civil administration is an important objective of the administrative
reform, there are also three other equally important ones.
14.   The first is to establish rules and procedures ensuring that recruitment
and promotion are based on merit and well known transparent criteria. With this
objective in mind, the main job bank was disbanded in 1989 and, during 1990, we
will eliminate the last job bank still in existence in the country: the one
operating in the free trade zone.   The second is to develop a management
capability within the public service to tackle areas such as career development,
training, staff inspection, organization and methods studies, management audit,
and cadre review. The third is to improve our reward and motivation policies



-54-                              Annex V
Page 6 of 19
including salary and benefit levels, pensions, and leadership and morale
building.   Finally, linked indirectly to the administrative reform is the
conversion of the Employees Provident Fund, for those employed in the private
sector, into a Pension Scheme with a view to making more comparable the
employment conditions in the public and private sector. More generally, to
implement the recommendations of the Administrative Reform Conmmittee we are
currently formulating a project for which we will welcome donors' assistance.
The final formulation of the project should be ready by June-July 1990. We will
give priority to the implementation of this project and it will be included in
the core program of the Public Investment Program (PIP) discussed in para.34.
15.   Staffing Levels.  One of the main recommendations of the Administrative
Reform Committee appointed by the President in 1986 was to reduce the number of
ministries and departments, and to reduce the number of public servants by about
a fifth. In March 1989 the number of Cabinet Ministers came down from 28 to 22
and the number of ministries from 45 to 24. The program of closing departments
has started with the elimination of four departments and severe reduction of a
fifth one. By the end of March 1990 the 2,800 staff to be retired from these
five departments had been taken off the payroll and paid their end-of-service
benefits. Staff to be transferred to other departments had also been transferred
to the payrolls of the new employing agencies. The residual functions will be
kept under review to ensure that inessential activities are eliminated.
16.   We reiterate our view that overstaffing may be as high as 80,000 to 90,000
in the central and provincial governments. This is in spite of the staffing
needs of the new provincial councils.   The target reduction by end-1990 is
15,000-20,000 (including the staff from the five departments above). For maximum
clarity the base population from which this reduction will come is defined as
follows:
(i)   employees  of  central  government  ministries  and  departments
(including casual staff and staff paid from Advance Account funds);
(ii) employees of central government ministries and departments in
provincial and district sub-units;
(iii) employees of provincial public services.
We estimate that as of January 1, 1990 the total of these employees was 527,000.
We will ensure that cuts in staff numbers are not cancelled out by undue
increases in overtime, consultancies or similar related expenditure. For 1991
and beyond, some 46,000 staff have already been identified even without detailed
studies of the largist ministries or departments (education, health, defense and
railways). By the end of 1990 we shall have completed our preliminary studies
and prepared a plan for achieving the necessary cuts over a 3 to 4 year period.
17.   To ensure these planned reductions are met, the Plan Implementation
Division of the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation introduced in
January 1990 a census of public servants covering all the public sector,
including the provincial council services and the public corporations. This



-55-
Annex V
Page 7 of 19
will be repeated in September 1990 and again each September until a full
personnel information system is established. The results of this exercise will
be shared and discussed with IDA.   This 'headcount'  information will be
complemented by the existing monitoring of personal emoluments expenditure each
month by the Accounts and Payments Division of the Ministry of Finance. The
Ministry of Public Administration will monitor and compare both these sets of
information to ensure progress is maintained through 1990 and for the future in
reducing both staff numbers and salary expenditure.
18.   In addition to containing wage increases in the public sector, the
recruitment freeze arrangements will be continued. All new recruitment will
require the approval of the Plan Implementation Division (although in time it
may be convenient for this role to pass to the Ministry of Public
Administration). Some exceptions will be needed to allow for recruitment of
essential skills and also to ensure that age structures of the Sri Lankan
Administrative Service and similar professional career services are not unduly
warped. This recruitment will consist of a few hundred technical staff at most
and will not affect the reduction target set for 1990 in Para. 16. At lower
levels recruitment will continue to be very tightly constrained. Provincial
Governors will be expected to respect Government policies in this area although
it is recognized that some new provincial posts may have to be filled by
recruitment where transfers are not possible. The Plan Implementation Division
will monitor carefully each of the provincial services.
19. We reconfirm our objective of reducing the staffing levels in the
decentralized units of Government. While detailed studies are required we shall
aim at a similar cut of 202 in staffing over the four years 1990 to 1993; by the
end of 1990 we will agree with IDA on a precise target and how to conduct the
process.
20.   Recruitment and Promotion. The Government intends to establish by the end
of 1990 a powerful independent Commission to oversee recruitment, appointment,
promotion, transfers, dismissal and discipline in the public service.   This
Commission will cover central government, provincial governments and
parastatals.  An instruction on recruitment has recently been issued by the
Ministry of Public Administration which re-introduces the principle of open
competition and prescribe ethnic ratios which will govern staffing decisions.
For the central government service, the first step is to withdraw
administratively the existing delegation of powers from the Public Service
Commission to ministries; the delegation from the Cabinet to the Public Service
Commission will remain. In the longer term the integrity of staffing decisions
will be ensured by legislation which is currently being drafted. His Excellency
the President will appoint the new Commission's Chairman and Members of
independence, experience. judgement and managerial skills from a range of
backgrounds.   The work of this new Commission -- as for the administrative
reform process in general -- will be assisted by the Salaries and Cadres
Committee, created in 1988 to provide high level policy advice and an
independent forum for considering pay and grading anomalies as they arise.



-56-
Annex V
Page 8 of 19
21. The Commission will be charged with implementing selection procedures
which are as objective as feasible. In the short term we believe we should rely
heavily on written examinations to test academic and intellectual merit with
limited use of interviews to assess personal qualities. In the longer term we
shall seek to develop selection methods which, while remaining objective, can
assess other qualities which are essential for development administration (such
as management skills, leadership and practical performance on the job).
22.   Under Act No. 42 of 1987 each Provincial Governor may appoint a Provincial
Public Service Commission, to which he may delegate his powers of appointment,
transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the provincial
public service. It is the intention of the Government that by the end of 1990
all the Governors shall have delegated their powers in this way and that the
Provincial Public Service Commissions should operate on the same lines as the
all-island Commission described above.
23. We believe that a public service in which personnel management is governed
by the "merit principle" and by the approach of "fair and open competition" for
vacancies will be better able to contribute to the country's development. We
also believe that the reinforcement of these traditional values will lead to an
Immediate improvement in the morale of the public service.
24.   Developing Management Capability.  We are concerned that undue attention
should not be focused on staff cuts exercises. 'While these have a role to play
in the current circumstances, we believe a more meaningful objective is to
enhance the public service's contribution to Sri Lanka's development through
cost effective delivery of high quality services and efficient project
implementation. In that respect, the newly established Policy Division of the
Ministry of Public Administration will have a key role to play in:   (i)
strengthening our human resource development policies and procedures for staff
appraisal, career development, manpower planning, and identification of training
needs and succession planning; and (ii) strengthening our management audit and
efficiency improvement capability for cadre review, organizational and methods
studies, management services, policy review, and use of information technology.
25. One requirement to support all these changes is an adequate system of
personnel information. We are conscious that at present management is dependent
on ad-hoc exercises such as the 5 yearly census of public sector employment
(last carried out in 1985) and the head-count returns now being instituted. In
the course of 1990 the Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of
Policy Planning and Implementation (which is responsible for the range of
information collated by the National Operations Room) will review the future
personnel records needs of the public service and define a strat .gy for meeting
these in the medium-term.
26. In the medium-term we also recognize the desirability of revising our
financial management and control systems to parallel changes being introduced
in other countries using Vote Accounting systems. We shall need to move towards
effective means of linking inputs (in terms of financial and other resources)



-57-
Annex V
Page 9 of 19
to outputs (in terms of programme delivery to defined standards). Included in
this exercise would be the establishment of reporting and monitoring systems for
Provincial Council expenditure, similar to those now in existence for central
government expenditure. We would propose to begin to implement during 1990 the
recommendations of a recently completed study of our existing financial
management and control systems and will welcome the chance to discuss with IDA
a technical assistance program to support the necessary changes.
27.   Motivation.  The effectiveness of the public service depends critically
on the commitment and energy of public servants at all levels.  We have already
implemented a salary increase during 1988-89 in response to the recommendations
of the Administrative Reform Committee. This increase aimed at improving the
wage structure which until then underpaid higher level staff and overpaid lower
level staff. The re-establishment of the merit principle, the elimination of
unproductive workers, better human resource management and appropriate training
opportunities should of themselves improve morale.
28.   To complement these and other initiatives described above we propose to
take the following steps to create a service which is fairly, but not
excessively paid, within Sri Lanka's circumstances:
(i)   as part of our comprehensive review of taxation, review by end 1990 the
policy under which public servants do not pay income tax;
(ii)  respond to the USAID funded study of the public service pension scheme and
by the end of 1990 carry out an actuarial review of the projected future
costs of the scheme and of possible alternatives; more specifically, we
will review by the end of 1990 the retirement age of civil servants and
the number of years needed to qualify for full pension benefits - with a
view to reducing the fiscal cost of the government pension scheme;
(iii) carry out during the first half of 1991 a study of public service
remuneration (including base salary, allowances, holidays, pensions,
housing, and other benefits) as compared with a range of comparable
private sector employers and corporations; this review will look
particularly at the relative pay in different sectors of different levels
of staff in the light of the belief that lower level public servants are
well paid relative to the private sector while more senior staff are
relatively underpaid; the study will cover employers outside Colombo as
well as in the capital; and
(iv)  consider reducing the number of public holidays in Sri Lanka.
29.   Employees Pension Scheme.   The Cabinet approved in March 1989 the
conversion of the Employees' Provident Fund for employees in the private sector
into the Employees' Pension Scheme. This is a contributory scheme actuarialy
valued in 1984 by the International Labor Organization which imposes no
financial obligations on the Government. Provided the update of the actuarial
study proves that the new scheme is financially viable and imposes no financial
obligations on the Government, the necessary legislation will be drafted and



-58-
Annex V
Page 10 of 19
approved by Cabinet during 1990 to enable an early start to be made on the
technical preparations required for the introduction of the scheme in 1991.
The new scheme will ensure the transferability of pension rights between the
public and private sector. The creation of the Employees' Pension Scheme will
thus help to make employment conditions in the private sector more comparable
with those in the public sector and will also facilitate the transfer of staff
who are retrenched, or otherwise wish to leave pensionable posts, in the public
sector, to move to the private sector.
30.   Progress towards the envisaged reductions in the fiscal deficits in the
early 1990's will enable consideration to be given to lowering the Treasury's
borrowing requirements from the Employees Pension Scheme. This will open the
way for a review of the scheme's financial system and a liberalization of the
investment policy for the reserve funds now entirely invested in Government
securities and bills. Such changes are needed for several reasons, including
the desirability of a reduction in employees' pension costs, and of the
introduction of further improvements in employment conditions in the private
sector through the gradual development of the system of social security
protection based on contributory self financing principles.
Welfare Expenditure.
31.     In 1989, in addition to a variety of already existing welfare programs,
the Government introduced the Jana Saviya Program and the Mid-day Meal Program;
at the same time, the benefits under the Food Stamp Program were doubled and its
coverage increased significantly.   Targeting has been a problem with all of
these programs. In addition to the steps aimed at improvlig the targeting and
efficiency of the existing anti-poverty programs (see paras. 51-56 below) the
Government also intends to carry out a review, to be completed in late 1990, of
all the welfare programs now being financed by the budget and of whether new
initiatives, targeted to the poor, in health and education are warranted. The
main objective of this review is to formulate a global policy aimed at reducing
poverty, improving social mobility, raising the productivity levels of the
poorest segment of society, and coordinating existing programs. The review
should also provide inputs for our overall objective of improving the targeting
and efficiency of poverty programs while reducing their fiscal cost. We are
committed to maintaining the cost of all welfare programs at no more than 3.0-
3.52 of GDP for the time-being but we will consider reducing this amount in the
future as overall economic conditions improve and the retargeting of existing
programs is completed.
Public Investment Program.
32.     The Public Investment Program has been declining gradually to 10-112 of
GDP in recent years and we intend to keep it at 9-1OZ for the foreseeable
future. This is a level we should be able to finance through foreign aid and
public savings -- thus reducing the Treasury's domestic borrowing requirements
to a negligible amount in the mid 1990's.



Annex V
Page 11 of 19
33.   Corrective measures have also been taken regarding sectors which have been
neglected in the past. In the case of transportation, we have identified a
comprehensive rehabilitation and investment program covering all transportation
modes. This program has already begun to be implemented and is being financed
by IDA as well as several multilateral and bilaterals. It envisages fundamental
institutional changes, such as the comercialization of the railways (now a
Government department) as well as a variety of investment projects. Similarly,
in the case of health and education, capital expenditures had fallen to less
than 1S of GDP in the mid-1980's. This has been increasing gradually since then
and capital expenditure in health and education have risen to a more appropriate
level of 1.52 of GDP in the last two years and we will maintain it at that level
in the future. Together with the expansion of assets related to health and
education, we are also taking steps to improve the quality of services and the
efficiency with which assets are being used in the two sectors.
34.   The Government is also taking steps to ensure that the implementation of
foreign-aid projects does not suffer from lack of counterpart funds in 1990 and
beyond.   The External Resources Department in the Ministry of Finance has
already begun a review of implementation problems for foreign-aid financed
projects and the results of the review are being discussed with the Ministry of
Policy Planning and Implementation as well as donors. This exercise will define
the budgetary allocations necessary to ensure the timely execution of projects
included in the Public Investment Program.   In order to limit the negative
consequences of unexpected financing shortfalls the Govermment has identified
a core investment program which amounts to about 70? of the total public
investment program.   An essential part of this exercise will be to ensure
adequate provisions for maintenance, particularly for roads, an area neglected
in the past. We will keep IDA informed of and discuss with Bank officials the
results of this work around June-July 1990 before they are fed into the 1991
budgetary process.
C. Private Sector Development
35.   We will follow a two-pronged approach in developing the private sector.
On the one hand, we will change the overall regulatory and incentive framework
in ways that will facilitate and support private sector initiatives and, on the
other, we will make room for the private sector by gradually transferring
wherever possible and feaslble assets and activities now being managed by the
Government. 
Improvements in the Re8ulatory and Incentive Framework.
36.   Since the early 1980's,  there have been major improvements  in the
regulatory and incentive framework.   Most restrictions on international and
domestic trade have already been removed; the investment regime has been
liberated substantially both for domestic and for foreign investors; freight
rates have been deregulated in late 1989. In November 1989 the 100? tax on
transfers of equity shares between foreigners was eliminated. During the course
of 1990, we will also examine the feasibility of removing the 100? tax that
remains on equity transfers between Sri Lankan citizens and foreigners.   In



-60-
Annex V
Page 12 of 19
spite of these substantial measures, the business community feels its activities
are still excessively constrained by cumbersome and time-consuming bureaucratic
procedures. To address this problem, we have appointed a high level committee,
chaired by a private sector representative, which aims at facilitating the
dialogue between the Government and the private sector and at examining and
proposing remedies for private sector grievances. This committee should issue
its first report shortly and its recommendations will be implemented during
1990. In addition, we intend to take several other steps to improve the
regulatory and incentive framework.
37.   Tariffs.  The level of effective protection has already been considerably
reduced over the last ten years, particularly in the last two years when the
mAximum nominal tariff was reduced to 60Z, the minimum tariff was increased to
10Z, and most import licensing requirements that could not be justified on
health or security grounds were eliminated. In the 1990 budget, the Government
has already made progress towards introducing a four-band system with four basic
rates, but, in the hope of protecting domestic industries against dumping, a
number of specific duties have been enacted, the tariff equivalent of which is
well above 502. A study is now reviewing this problem and, through the 1991
Budget to be presented to the Parliament in November 1990, we shall take steps
to introduce a four-band tariff system for non-agricultural products, whereby
goods within the same category are dutied at the same rate. Through the 1991
budget, the maximum nominal rate for non agricultural products will also be
reduced to 50X. We will ensure that specific duties are not a disguised form
of keeping effective protection at high levels but are only used in documented
cases of dumping. This system will be in effect until the time we decide on the
appropriateness of enacting anti-dumping legislation.
38.   Investment Promotion.  Since November 1989, instead of two organizations,
foreign investment promotion work and approvals have been handled by one body,
the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC), which now operates as a 'one
stop center'. During 1990, we will publish investment guidelines which will
specify the areas where approvals will be automatic, as well as procedures and
guarantees to be afforded foreign investors. Fiscal incentives to encourage new
investments will be used selectively and sparingly and will be approved only
after the conclusion of detailed studies estimating (i) their potential fiscal
cost in terms of foregone tax revenues; and (ii) the cost of distortion in the
economy these incentives may introduce.
39.   Trade of Agricultural Products and Inputs.  We intend to take further
steps to deregulate imports and marketing of rice and fertilizer.   This
objective will require a number of policy and institutional changes.  In the
case of rice, we are encouraging private sector imports by complete
liberalization. Import licenses will be granted automatically upon request and,
as has been the case in the last few years, there will be no ad-hoc or
systematic exchange control for any private rice importer. To avoid potential
negative impacts on paddy producers, we intend to offset large short-term price
fluctuations in the international market through appropriate changes in import
tariffs on rice.   The Presidential Tariff Commission will  recommend,  in
consultation with the National Food Policy Committee, a suitable level of tariff



-61-
Annex V
Page 13 of 19
to protect domestic producers by end-June 1990.   The National Food Policy
Committee will keep this tariff under review and make recommendations for change
as the need arises.   In  addition, with  the  liberalization  of domestic
dimtribution of rice, the role of the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has lost its
significance. Yet, there is a need for a small-scale purchaser of last resort
for a limited number of paddy surplus areas during the harvest season.
Therefore we have decided to restructure the PMB so that its function will be
limited to purchasing rice in these areas, storing it and selling it. PMB will
restructure its management as needed; retrench its staff to the level at which
it can operate on a viable basis, this level is expected to be about 500
employees (from 1,600 at present); and divest most of its milling facilities and
about half of its storage capacity during 1990.   To increase further the
efficiency of PMB, we will test the feasibility of hiring authorized agents for
rice purchase and sales on behalf of PMB, and employing a system of bonded
warehouses. This reorganization of PHI will be implemented by the end of 1990.
40.   Subsidies on fertilizer were entirely eliminated as of January 1, 1990.
This was a radical departure from a policy in effect for several decades. We
now intend to focus on institutional changes which will ensure a more
competitive environment for importing and marketing fertilizer.   For that
purpose, we are making aid-financed imports of fertilizer (54Z of total imports
during 1985-1987) available on equal terms to both private and public sector
importers and com ercializing during 1990 (with a view to prioritizing later on)
the largest public sector firms that import fertilizer. As there are only a few
participants in the market, we have to be careful not to create the conditions
for a monopoly or an oligopoly to emerge. Nonetheless, we believe that there
is scope to increase the role of the private sector.  During 1990, we will
define, analyze and discuss with IDA the options available and begin their
implementation.
Makina Room for the Private Sector.
41.     The second prong of our approach in developing the private sector is to
transfer to private enterprises assets and activities where there is no need for
public sector involvement.       During 1989 United Motors   (with about 800
employees) was sold through a public auction, while a textile mill (Thulhiriya,
with about 1,500 employees) was sold directly to a foreign investor. We are
planning shortly to sell a restaurant-hotel (Hotel de Buhari with slightly over
100 employees). During 1990 we will also reach a decision regarding the more
sizeable Ceylon Oxygen and State Distilleries where we are now negotiating
direct foreign equity participation. More generally, we are in the process of
formulating, with IDA assistance, a strategy to privatize wherever possible and
commercialize where not, the entirety of public enterprises in the manufacturing
sector under the Ministry of Industry, Textiles and Housing and Local Government
(aibout 20) as well as a few in the trading sector. We expect this plan to be
ready towards mid-1990 and to form the basis for an IDA supported adjustment
operation-- the Public Enterprise Restructuring Project. In addition, we also
have specific plans for two other sub-sectors: (i) bus industry; and (ii) tree
crops.



-62-                             Annex V
Page 14 of 19
42.   Bus Sector.  For the majority of people in Sri Lanka, bus transport is the
only available form  of mechanized transport.  After the Central Transport
Board's (CTB's) monopoly on bus transportation was abolished in 1979, the
private sector grew rapidly. It nov provides over half of all bus services in
both rural and urban areas.  The freeze on fares in effect since 1983 has
constrained the expansion of private bus operators; while in the case of CTB (in
addition to the recent political disturbances which led to the destruction of
several hundreds buses) the freeze on fares as well as serious financial and
managerial problems have led to a decline of almost one-half in the number of
CTBh9 buses effectively in service every day.  This has meant a gradual and
serious deterioration in the country's most important means of transport.
43.   Current Proposals. In mid-1989, we recognized that there was a very urgent
need to find a long term solution to the problems of bus transportation and we
decided to privatize the operations of CTB or otherwise dispose of the Board's
assets. In December '989, the Cabinet endorsed a plan to implement the following
measures:
{i)   the complete de-regulation of bus fares;
(ii)  the creation of a new bus regulatory body with only passive powers
to restrict operation of new or additional services;
(iii) a voluntary retirement scheme to be introduced for surplus staff,
followed by a compulsory retirement scheme if the redundancy target
of 20,000 is not met;
(iv) the Central Transport Board will cease to exist;3
Cv)   the assets of the Board will be transferred to the remaining
employees of the new 'peoplised, companies to be created, centered
around existing depots; facilities such as workshops, the bus
assembly plants and driving schools may be sold directly to the
private sector;
(vi)  all employees will be paid a cash gratuity, those who are made
redundant will be compensated for denied services.
44.   The proposal, agreed by the Cabinet in December, has since been refined
by consultants financed by IDA.  An action plan has been prepared and the
implementation process will have begun by June 1990. Between now and then, the
value of the Transport Boards' assets and liabilities is being appraised and a
detailed plan is being prepared for their disposal. The Government has decided
to reduce the cost of this operation to a minimtm and to sell off, lease or
transfer assets such as surplus land and equipment. The remaining CTB assets
will form the basis of new companies, relatively small (i.e., with an average
fleet size no larger than 100 around existing depots), owned by the workers and



-63-
Annex V
Page 15 of 19
to be fonmed once the retrenchment of 20,000 surplus staff is completed.
Workers who are not in the retrenched 20,000 group vill be required to put the
equivalent of the compensation for denied service as their contribution to the
equity of the newly formed companies.   Whenever the value of the assets
transferred to a company exceeds the value of the workers' equity contribution,
the balance will be transformed into a loan. The Government has decided to keep
the asset value of the new companies to a minimum bys (i) privatizing
facilities, such as the specialized workshops and the driving schools; and (ii)
transferring to the appropriate local authority any town center bus terminals
owned by the CTB.
45.   Between now and June, the Government will also implemeni. the retrenchment
of 20,000 surplus staff; prepare the list of new companies specifying the assets
of each company; and prepare the list of workers associated with each company.
The number of companies, the financial structure, their size and the number of
workers associated to each company will be discussed and agreed upon with IDA.
The implementation process is expected to be substantially completed by the end
of the year. Meanwhile the Government: (i) raised in January 1990 fares for
private operators by 50? for short distances in the Colombo area, and up to 30?
for longer distances; as the companies emerging from the dismantling of CTB are
formed starting in June 1990, they will be automatically granted a similar
increase; this would be the first step towards the total deregulation of fares
to be implemented by December 1990; and (ii) in mid-February, announced the
terms of the voluntary retirement scheme. We are also committed to ensuring
that no Government-owned bus companies will be created at the central or
provincial level and that no new barriers to competition will be created.
46.  An important component of the program is the creation by the end of 1990
of a new regulatory body within the Ministry of Transport and Highways to ensure
that the system operates on a competitive basis with adequate safety standards.
'We will exchange views and agree with IDA on the terms of reference of this new
agency and the enabling legislation establishing it. Technical assistance is
to be provided to assist this new organi.ation. Additional technical assistance
will also be provided to help the new ctApanies establish themselves.  Part of
this will be financed through an existing UNDP project with the CTB which is
administered by the ILO.
47.   Tree Crops.  Two state-corporations, the Janatha Estate Development Board
(JEDB) and the State Plantation Corporation (SPC) own half of the country's area
under tea and one-third of the country's area under rubber. In    spite    of
substantial IDA support as well as support from other multilateral and
bilaterals since the early 1980's, the financial performance of the two
corporations has been dismal and, by the end of 1989, they were technically
insolvent with large debt overhangs which are a threat to the solvency of some
of the major commercial banks and many commercial suppliers. To address the two
corporations' financial crisis, the Government appointed in 1989 a high level
Core Group to identify the problems and to prepare a program of action in
consultation with IDA and other lenders.



-64-
Annex V
Page 16 of 19
48.   Most of the recommendations of the Core Group have now been implemented.
The short-term financial crisis was addressed by (i) renegotiating labor
contracts in a way that increased management flexibility in the use of labor and
reduced labor coats; and (ii) reducing taxes on tea and rubber. The financial
situation was also improved by the large devaluation of September 1989 and the
increase in the international price of tea. We recognize that the short-term
measures do not address the weakness in the two corporations' financial
structure, however, and we are aware that a long-term solution to the problems
of the sector requires far reaching reforms.
49.   As a first step we have already introduced a reorganization of the two
corporations aimed at reducing the over centralization of management in Colombo:
improving management's autonomy; and increasing accountability. The 502 JEDB
and SPC estates were grouped on a geographical basis in 82 clusters -- which are
now run as independent operatioval and financial units -- in turn grouped in 12
zones. While it is too early to assess how effective this new system will be -
- it began operating on January 1st, 1990 -- the first results are encouraging.
The decentralization of decision making seems to have increased staff motivation
to a great extent and production levels seem to be on the rise.
50.   We are of the view, however, that the longer term solution is to reduce
the ptublic sector involvement in the treecrops sector. We have requested IDA
to finance a study of privatization options and advise us on the relative merits
and costs of each option. The group of experts who will carry out the study
should be appointed by June and the study should be ready for joint review by
the Government and IDA toward the end of the year. Based on this review, an
action plan will be agreed upon with IDA early in 1991 to increase the role of
the private sector, if the study concludes that this is a feasible option.
Whether privatization will consist of sales or leasing of assets to the private
sector or be restricted to the privatization of management (e.g. through
management contracts) will be considered after the completion of the study. On
the recommendation of the Core Group, heavily loss-making estates have been
examined to identify those which are totally unviable. We will begin to dispose
of or convert to other uses (including forestry) such estates before the end of
1990.
D. Poverty Alleviation
51.   It is evident that the economic expansion that followed the liberalization
of the economy in 1977 did not improve the living standards of the poorest
segments of the population significantly and that a more direct attack on
poverty is necessary. Poverty reduction is one of the most important objectives
of this Government and we will take every step necessary to ensure that this
goal is achieved. We are aware that two programs launched during 1989 -- the
Mid-day Meal Program and the Jana Saviya Program (JSP) -- have serious
shortcomings in term  of their effects and costs.   Our primary goal is to
improve the targeting of these programs so that transfers to the really poor can
be increased without additional costs to the budget. While we are taking steps
to improve these programs and have limited their combined cost to 3-3.5? of GDP



-65-
Annex V
Page 17 of 19
for 1990 we have also undertaken a review of all the welfare programs now being
financed out of the budget with a view to defining an overall policy aimed at
achieving lasting and cost effective reductions in poverty. This should help
us formulate a comprehensive strategy towards poverty alleviation and examine
whether special health and education programs tailored to take into account the
needs of destitute families should be created. In parallel, we have requested
IDA to formulate and finance a poverty alleviation project focusing on improving
the living standards of the poor. These two activities have already started but
will not produce results before the beginning of 1991. In the meanwhile, we are
taking steps to restructure the three main poverty programs now in existence:
the Mid-day Heal, the Food Stamps, and the Jana Saviya.
The Mid-day Meal Program
52.   The Mid-Day Meal Program was launched at the beginning of 1989 with a
budgetary allocation of Rs 2 billion (i.e., over US$50 million at the exchange
rate prevailing at the time) with a view to providing one meal a day to all
children enrolled in primary and secondary schools in the country. In time, it
became evident that, in addition to being costly, the program was not achieving
the nutritional improvements it aimed at.   In addition to improving the
targeting of the Mid-day Meal Program, the Government is also aware that it has
to strengthen support to pre-school children, the ones most nutritionally at
risk.   For the latter group, an island-wide nutritional program (hopefully
supported by IDA) focusing on pre-school children and lactating mothers will be
implemented beginning in 1991.   In addition, the Government has decided to
restructure the Mid-day Meal program so that it can reach children belonging to
poor families. Under this restructured program, school-going children belonging
to poor families would be given food stamps instead of a meal as is done at
present.   We are at the moment testing alternative targeting and selection
procedures in four areas of the country.   The results of this exercise are
expected to be evaluated by the end of May 1990.   If the results are
satisfactory, we would consider expanding the program to the entire island at
the beginning of the 1990 second term school session. We will carefully assess
the fiscal cost of any new initiative in this area and reach an agreement with
IDA before a new initiative is taken. In any circumstance, the cost of any new
initiative should not exceed Rs 1,500 million during 1990.
The Food Stamp Program
53.   The main purpose of restructuring the Food Stamp Program is:  (i) to
reduce by the end of 1990 the present number of beneficiaries to one million
households, which is the number of truly needy families plus a reasonable number
to account for the practical impossibility of achieving perfect targeting; and
(ii) increase the benefits to households remaining in the program. The total
budgetary allocation for the FSP will remain at Rs 3.8 billion in 1990 and be
Rs 3.8 billion or less in the 1991 budget. The selection of beneficiaries will
be performed at the hamlet level using community participation to maximum
extent, through teams of facilitators selected from the community itself. A
range of operational selection criteria will be used to make identification of
beneficiaries as objective as possible.  This approach is being defined and



-66-                              Annex V
Page 18 of 19
tested based on field work and will be discussed with IDA before the retargeting
process begins in July 1990. Likewise, the increase in benefits once the number
of families under the program is reduced to one million will also be discussed
with IDA before it is implemented.
The Jana Saviya Program
54.   The Jana Saviya Program is the centerpiece of the Government's effort
aimed at alleviating poverty in Sri Lanka. It started as an ambitious program
with a budgetary allocation of Re. 6.8 billion in the 1989 budget. As initially
conceived, the JSP aimed at transferring Rs. 2,500 per month to each household
in poverty during a two-yeaz period. It became quickly evident, however, that
such a program would put tmduly high pressures on the budget.
55.   Our decision to restructure the JSP during 1989 has avoided the serious
budgetary and economic pressures, as well as the social tensions, that the large
scale implementation of the JSP would have initially brought about.   The
restructuring took place in three different directions. We first decided to
phase the JSP over a long period of time and to .mplement it in about 10-12
rounds. Thus, in the first round, which began ia October 1989, only 165,000
families were selected for the JSP benefits. Second, as far as the investment
component is concerned, families with viable investment projects will be
assisted in formulating such projects and in submitting them to the regular
banking channels or non-formal credit institutions as they become ready, without
requiring the prior disbursement of the investment component in a savings
account. Third, we have decided to transform the JSP into a more production-
oriented and sustainable program. In defining these new alternatives we will
make every effort necessary to maintain expenditures on the JSP to a level
consistent with the overall target of 3.0-3.5? of GDP mentioned earlier for the
combined cost of the FSP, the JSP and the Hid-Day Meal Program.
56.   Meanwhile, we will not launch a second round of the JSP unless the
benefits it provides as well as its content and objectives are consistent with
the project to be financed by IDA. More specifically, were there to be a second
round of the JSP, it would not consist of a payment of Rs 1,500 per month to
each selected household. In addition, before implementing a second round of the
JSP, its benefits, as well as its content and objectives will be discussed and
agreed upon with IDA. The Government is considering several alternative or
complementary measures for the JSP program.   The main alternatives being
considered by the Government at present are: (i) introducing a program of
financial incentives to private sector firms to train and employ members of Jana
Saviya families; and (ii) developing a portfolio of labor intensive projects for
irrigation and road maintenance. Before either alternative is implemented, the
Government will have a detailed estimate of their fiscal cost and, in any
circumstances, it will be w,ithin the Rs 4.4 billion allocated in the 1990 budget

REORIENTATION OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE
I. Introduction
1.    Sri Lanka's public service has grown since Independence, not only to cover
an intensification of law and order functions, but as instruments for the
delivery of welfare services, including health and education and also as a
significant participant in economic development, both as a facilitator as well
as directly managing economic assets.
2.    In the management of the public service only two structural innovations
were introduced since Independence. The first was the establishment of public
corporations in the early 1950's, strongly supported by the World Bank. The
second was the introduction of the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System
(PPBS), strongly supported by the United Nations. Despite these innovations
and the extra responsibilities reposed on it, the public service in the main,
functioned in the traditional bureaucratic mode of being concerned with inputs,
processes and procedures, ratheL than outputs, efficiency and effectiveness and
results. The result was that public services were over administered and under-
managed.
3.    The Government has given active thought to the reorientation of the public
service, adopting two approaches:   (i) change it from a bureaucracy to a
management service; and (ii) equip it to support and implement the policies
which will be formulated for Sri Lanka to come to terms with the 21st century.
4.    In respect of the former, the Government wishes the public service to be
concerned with demarcating, segmenting, targeting and servicing different markets
and publics, in the most efficient possible manner. The public service and its
personnel will be judged by (i) performance, which assumes a pre-determined set
of performance criteria; (ii) the minimizing of the inputs of money, men and
material; and (iii) maximizing outputs and ensuring the construction of a
responsive delivery system and organization.   In respect of the latter, the
public service should be equipped to come to terms, to facilitate and manage the
emerging information age of the 21st century. To do so the public service will
have to be formed into small organizations supported by technologically intensive
information bases.  The public service has to be well selected and highly
motivated to enable Sri Lanka to be successful in the 21st century. The drive
is to managerialize the public service. A number of steps have already been
taken to achieve this aim.
II. Steps Already Taken
A. Devolution
5.    In terms of the Provincial Councils Act No. 42 of 1987, and the 13th
Amendment to the Constitution, the management of matters purely of local interest
to regions, have been devolved to the newly created Provincial Councils.

B. Administrative Reforms Commission.
6.    An Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) was set up.  It has submitted
10 reports with a number of recommendations.   A large number of these
recommendations have been or are being implemented. The Government is giving
active consideration to the rest.
C. Ministerial Structure.
7.    The political structure of Ministries has been managerialized.  The number
of Ministries has been reduced from 45 to 24. There are now three different sets
of Ministerial structures. The first consists of Apex Ministries, responsible
for resource planning.   They are the:  (i) Ministry of Policy Planning and
Implementation responsible for overall resource planning; (ii) Ministry of
Finance, responsible for the input of finance and its efficient and effective
use; and (iii) Ministry of Public Administration, responsible for the input of
human resources and their efficient use.  The second consists of Ministries
responsible  for policy management.    These are the remaining 21 Cabinet
Ministries.  The third consists of State Ministers Officers responsible for
implementation. The responsibilities of the last two, in terms of management
functions, are shown in Table 1.
D. Revision of Public Service Codes.
8.    The Financial Regulations (FR) and the Establishment Code (Esta Code) are
rules and regulations which determine actions of public servants in the financial
and human resources areas.
9.    The Ministry of Finance has undertaken a revision of the FR.  The terms
of reference are being discussed; they should be finalized by June 1990.
10.  The Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs
has undertaken a revision of the Establishment Code. The terms of reference for
this review are:
ti)      incorporate the experience gained in the past;
(ii)      include changes warranted to modernize the regulatory system required
for professionalized management of personnel in the public sector;
(iii)      consider regulations on Personnel Administration in other countries,
which could be adapted and adopted for Sri Lankan conditions;
(iv)      simplify  rules  and  regulations  to  improve  public  personnel
management;
(v)      exclude what is unnecessary and include what is required for
improving public personnel management in Sri Lanka.

11.   The revision of both the FR and the Establishment Code are meant to provide
guidelines to the public service, with a view to providing a stimulus for
efficient, effective and market responsive activity rather than be a restriction
on it.
E. Consultancy Studies.
12.   Consultancy studies have been undertaken.   They cover a variety of
organizational requirements ranging from cadre studies to offering suggestions
on systems changes. Every one of these consultancy studies will be used as a
base for the organizational studies to be discussed later.
F. Managing Numbers in the Public Service.
13.  A troublesome feature in the growth in the public service is that numbers
have increased both in an uncoordinated fashion and untied to specific
performance. There have been an increase in quantity without much attention to
quality. To initiate the process of introducing managerial concepts into the
public service:
(i)      a head count of the personnel was undertaken by the Ministry of
Finance;
(ii)      a recruitment freeze was introduced, any fresh recruitment to
existing vacancies now require the approval of the Ministry of Policy
Planning and Implementation;.
(iii)      five departments have been closed and 2,800 staff retrenched;
(iv)      general policies on retrenchment have been developed.
G. Establishment of Management Development and Training Units (MDTU).
14.   The organization is the one best equipped to determine its own problems
and find solutions to them. By this means it would own the problem and find
solutions.  The support of external agencies like consultants would be to
supplement the efforts of the organization and not be a substitute for them, if
durable results are to be achieved.   With this in mind MDTU's have been
established for each Ministry, large department and provincial councils. A MDTU
will look into organizational problems as well as personnel upgrading, training,
career development, etc.
H. Training.
15.   The following measures have been taken:
(i)      a statement on wlational Public Service training Policy, has been
issued;
(ii)      four institutes have been demarcated for dealing with the training
requirement of different markets.  They are: (a) the Sri Lanka



Annex V
-72-
Attacbment
Page 5 of 11
Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA), to deal with
managerial cadres in both the central and provincial services;
(b) the Post-graduate Institute of Management (PIH) to provide
academic long, medium and short tern courses in Public
Administration; (c) the Public Service Training Institute (PSTI),
to deal with non-managerial cadres in both central and provincial
services; and (d) the Rural Development Training and Research
Institute (RDTRI) to deal with non-managerial cadres in provincial
councils working at the field level.
I.    Policy Division in Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils
and Home Affairs.
16.   A Policy Division has been formed in the Ministry of Public Administration.
1II. Action Program
A. Background
17.   Once the Government's privatization program is completed, there will yet
remain a core of functions which will have to be performed by government
departments and Advance Accounts. As indicated earlier, both have, over the
years, grown in an uncoordinated fashion. It is now appropriate to take a fresh
look at each of their mandates, always keeping in mind whether its entirety or
parts of it cannot be undertaken by the private sector. Once this demarcation
is made, a fresh mission statement (the philosophy of the organization) has to
be offered; the aims (what the agency will be in a pre-determined period of time)
defined; its goals (its specific ends) drawn up; indicators of performance and
tactics determined. The organization is the vehicle through which all these are
achieved.  The organizational structure, its processes, information systems,
staffing patterns will then have to be adjusted as a consequence. Each of these
will be unique solutions for an individual organization, for they have separate
missions, aims and goals to achieve. Out of this exercise will emerge wasteful
use of inputs of men, material and money. While material and money could be
redeployed for more productive use, human resources may need to be out-placed
requiring innovative approaches. It is expected that every government department
and advance account will have to undergo an organizational development effort.
B. Organizational Development
18.   Over the years, government departments have been profligate in the use of
resources, whether of money, materials or men.   In respect of money and
materials, this was due primarily to the lack of management orientation, there
not being a clearly laid down mission, aims, goals, the associated performance
indicators, and the non-adoption of office technology to improve productivity.
The same considerations apply for the wasteful employment of human resources,
but this element was complicated by external political pressures for the forced
employment of specific numbers, and their retention, irrespective of need or
performance. The remedy is not to adopt the adverse political tactic of a forced
reduction by a particular number, but induce a managerial approach, by which



Annex V
-73-
Attachment
Page 6 of 11
numbers of retrenchment in terms of grades, skills, needs, etc., will emerge out
of an Organizational Development (OD) process consultancy.  This will be in
concert with the management process pervading Sri Lanka.
C. Global Numbers
19.         The global numbers which lend themselves to an OD exercise, out of
which retrenchment will emerge, are as follows:
Total Cadre                                                 527,882
less  (a)   Read 1 - 20                     3,382

(c)  Ministry of Foreign Affairs        903
(d)   Telecommunication Department    8,885
(e)   Railway Department             26,727

(c)   Others                         38,432     274,912
46,077
Total number to be retrenched
(already identified)                          46,000
D. Phases of the OD Exercise
20.   The approach to OD will be in 3 phases, which in time may be concurrent
or coalesce.
(a)  Phase I    - General Services: May 1990 - September 1993
This activity will start immediately with the Apex Ministries
i.e. Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation; Ministry
of Finance; and Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial
Councils and Home Affairs. This selection will not only offer
credibility when an OD exercise is extended to other
departments but these ministries offer a better possibility
of introducing office technology, thereby reducing personnel
dealing with routine work, and retaining a small group of
highly skilled motivated professional employees;

Page 7 of 11
(b) Phase II    - Provincial Services:  October 1990 - September 1992;
(c) Phase III   - Defense Servicess  January 1992 - December 1992.
E. OD Approaches
21. The OD exercise will be based on process consultancy starting with a
Performance Improvement Programme (PIP) developed by the ILO.   The process
consultancy will ensure that the entire organization participates in the self
improvement method, the role of the OD consultant being to raise issues and
provoke fresh innovative search for solutions. Implementation is also undertaken
concurrently by the participants. The exercise will concentrate on eliminating
activities which do not fall into a redefined mission and aims, transfer to the
private sector any activities which the later could perform, and down size its
organization to develop large number of small sub-units, which are tied to the
main organization by information relationships rather than power and hierarchy,
thus enabling deconcentration and delegation to take place. One specific area
that would be developed is the concept of internal markets and internal
competition. Public departments very often. because they are natural or tariff
monopolies, have no competition. The result is that market signals are either
ignored or the administration functions as a surrogate market signaller. An
internal market will have self contained activities comparable on the basis of
common denominators like costs etc. This would enable a degree of internal
competition  among the  staff  leading  to higher productivity  and visible
performance which may be rewarded with bonuses.
F. Information Technology
22. For the OD exercise to be successful, information is the key. Information
in the 21st century world will be a resource. As such, the speedy availability
of processed data is essential to respond to emerging trends, and the
rectification on a negative feedback. This will be supportive of decision making
and increased office productivity. The Computer and Information Technology
Council of Sri Lanka (CINTEC) has prepared a OStudy to Develop Plans for
Information Systems in the Public Service using Computer and Information
Technology'. It is a comprehensive study covering the information needs; supply
and demand of the central ministries; provincial councils; divisional
secretaries; the flow of information; the hardware and software required and the
staffing and training to be provided. The government will give its earnest
consideration to the recommendations of this report.
23. One aspect which will be given early attention is the information demand
and supply from the provincial councils.   At the moment the bulk of their
monetary needs are provided to the provincial councils, through the Ministry of
Provincial Councils.   Monies are spent and work done at the Divisional
Secretaries Office where original records are kept. Thus, the keeping of records
and the accounting system with the associated information flows, to and from the
Divisional Secretary, Provincial Council, Ministry of Provincial Councils and
the Treasury, with the system approach and training requirement needs urgent
attention.

Page 8 of 11
G. Reduction in Cadre
24.   It is surmised that at the end of the 4-year period of OD effort, the
cadre would be reduced by 60,000. The rough and ready annual figure would appear
as follows.
Period                              Numbers
May 1990 - April 1991         -      20,000
May 1991 - April 1992         -      20,000
May 1992 - April 1993         -      20,000
H. Outplacement
25.  Some experience has been gained in developing financial packages for easing
the departure of retrenched personnel. It will be necessary to develop non-
financial options, like taking an active interest in placing these personnel in
private sector or public service vacancies; re-training them to fit into
available slots; equipping them to be entrepreneurs to parlay their gratuities
into productive assets; negotiating with the banks for supplemental debt or
equity support, etc. The Ministry of Public Administration will be establishing
a unit in the Policy Division to be in charge of all aspects of outplacement.
X. Legislative Institutions
26.   Sri Lanka is a democracy, with vigorous parliamentary institutions. These
Institutions have also to be equipped to view their roles in the context of the
managerialization process. There are two main parliamentary institutions: (i)
the Public Accounts Committee which deals with performance evaluation; (ii) the
Consultative Committee on Public Administration which deals with planning and
monitoring.   Both will be drawn into the change process, primarily through
education programmes.
J. Personnel Development
27.   The two prongs of the managerialization of the public  service are
Organizational Development and Personnel Development.  Personnel Development
will cover, recruitment, reward system, career development, training, super
annuation.
28.   Recruitment and Disciplinary Control.  A wide variety of experiments
concerning institutional and personnel arrangements have been tried out in Sri
Lanka since Independence. Benefitting from the experience of these experiments
there is a wide conse.asus that managerialization should be the future approach.
Accordingly, merit is to be the dominant consideration in the selection,
appointment and career development of public service personnel.   To give
institutional support to this principle, the Public Service Commission will be
reconstituted both at the center and in the Provinces, either by a change in the
Constitution, failing which by administrative means, to manage the recruitment,
disciplinary and dismissal aspects of personnel development.



Annex V

29.   Salary. In the first half of 1991, a study of public service remuneration
including basic salary, allowance, holidays, pensions, housing and other benefits
as compared with comparable private sector employees and corporations will be
undertaken. This study will look at pay in different sectors of different levels
of staff in the light of the belief that lower level public servants are well
paid relative to the private sector, while more senior staff are relatively
under-paid.
30.   Superannuation.   The USAID funded study of the public service pension
scheme will be used as a basis to carry out, by the end of 1990, a review of
the projected future costs of the scheme and possible alternatives to reduce
such costs.
31.   Training and Education.   In the area of training and education, six
institutions have been designated. They are:
(1)   The Sri Lanka Institute of Developmental Administration (SLIDA).
The clientele of the SLIDA will be drawn from managerial cadres.,
both in central departments and provincial councils. Its range of
work will cover the induction of junior managers into a
familiarization of political and administrative processes, and
executives to policy formulation and implementation. The political
and administrative executive (Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers,
Public Accounts Comittee, Consultative Committee, Secretaries, State
Secretaries, Heads of major Departments) has preoccupied itself with
policy formulation concerns, without too much attention being paid
to the implementability of the policies. When such policies do not
show the promised results, the administrative mechanisms is readily
blamed for failure.   While there may be some truth  in this
apportionment, the failure may also be due to false assumptions,
inadequate attention to the mechanics of implementation etc. SLIDA
will develop courses for this so far untouched clientele. For this
group, SLIDA has to think through new concepts of teaching and
learning, based on cognitive learning theories, concepts and models
in the trainees mind, rather than adopt the traditional courses
concerned with terminal behavioral objectives. The training and
learning processes should be organized for concept learning and
application of concepts in practical and concrete situations.
2.    Post Graduate Institute of Management (PIM).
The PIM has started post graduate two-year courses in public
administration for serving officers. Intakes will be made every
year, and also medium and short term courses developed.
3.    Public Service Training Institute (PSTI).
The PSTI was established recently fcllowing specific recommendations
of the ARC. Its clientele will be drawn from non-managerial cadres,
both in central departments and provincial councils, going down to



77-                                Annex V
Attachment
Page 10 of 11
grades working at the divisional levels. It is estimated that its
total clientele will be about 85,000. This clientele slotted in
different grades, is a vital component in administrative reforms,
for it is the equivalent of the Foreman in the manufacturing process.
Because of the large numbers involved their training has to be
decentralized in the first instance to the 8 provincial capitals,
where each canter will be the retailer of training, while a small
head office in Colombo will be responsible for the production of
training materials, overseeing their distribution and evaluating the
results.
4.    Rural Development and Training Institute (RDTI).
Its clientele will be drawn from non-managerial cadres at the sub-
divisional field levels of provincial councils (it has another
clientele which deals with the upliftment of the village as a whole,
and that of NGI's but this group will not be covered in this paper).
This is the group that will directly interface with the people at
the village level in their different markets viz inputs markets
(supplying labor, raw materials); producer markets (cultivators,
small artisans, etc.); and output markets (consumers). In addition,
they will be responsible for isolating and developing entrepreneurs.
Before the introduction of provincial councils, interventions at the
village level were by differentiated departments with their own
specialized  cadres.    With  the  decentralization  process,  one
individual, a Grama Niladhari (village officer) is responsible for
all activities in a village or a group of 250 families. He or she
will have tb develop polyvalent skills.   There are 14,000 such
vUllage officers recruited from existing specialized cadres. Their
tunnelled visions and skills will have to be widened to cope with
the decentralizing change. The primary responsibility of the RDTRI
is to introduce this change through training programmes.   These
training programmes will be chanmelled through the infrastructural
facilities offered by the PSTI.
5.    Distance Education.
The approaches so far suggested are through institutions using
traditional training methodologies. Since the public service has
about 500,000 personnel, the overwhelming number being at the lower
levels, these traditional approaches may be costly both in time and
funds.   Thus, simultaneously with the institutional efforts at
training, a distance education mode is suggested, concentrating on
markets where knowledge transfer and skill development are paramount.
For this purpose all three routes of transmission namely, the post,
radio and television will be used.

6.    Provincial Councils.
A part of the administrative reform package, is the devolution and
decentralization of powers to provincial councils. This is a totally
new institutional form which has arisen in the public administration
of Sri Lanka. and it has to be nursed and developed.  For this
purpose 3 support units have been set up in the Ministry of Public
Administrationt the Programme Support Unit, the Institution Support
Unit and the Legal Support Unit. Administrative Systems, specially
In the financial and information fields have to be introduced
concurrently with training programmes covering a cross section of
the organization. This is particularly required at the top level
of the political and executive bureaucracy, which now could either
not be bold in their initiatives or be over-bold in excess of the
powers granted them.
32.  Career Develoment.  A systematic programme of career development based
on training will be developed.
K. Implementation.
33    The implementation of this activity will be overseen by a Committee chaired
by the Ministry of Public Administration, having in its composition
representatives from the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Policy Planning
and Implementation. It will report to the Steering Committee overseeing the
implementation of the reform program, chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury.
L. Conclusion.
34.   The reorientation of the public service has two basic approaches.  First
to change it from a bureaucratic service to a management service, the second to
equip it to support political initiatives meant to take Sri Lanka into the 21st
century. Once the changes outlined in this paper are introduced, Sri Lanka
should have a merit selected, highly trained, well motivated public service
equipped with the knowledge, skills and attitudes required for the 21st century.

' Conditions for Seconid Tranche Release                  4
(Expected by January 1991)
A. Stabilization and Macroeconomic Policies
Satisfactory progress in implementing the stabilization program would
be a condition of second tranche release. In assessing performance, IDA will
examine whether:
(i) by end-1990, in addition to the subsidies for rice, fertilizer and CTB
which have been eliminated already, the Government will have eliminated
the subsidy for wheat-flour by continuing to increase the price of wheat-
flour by 8-92 per month (para. 36);
(ii)   by end-1990, the Government will have agreed with IDA on a restructuring
plan for the sugar industry aiming at reducing within a two-to-three-
year period the domestic price of sugar to levels not higher than 10-
252 above the price at which Sri Lanka can import sugar from
international markets (para. 37);
(iii)   a plan to implement the recommendations of the Tax Commission will have
been reviewed and discussed with the IMP and IDA and the first phase of
such plan will have been incorporated in the 1991 budget to be presented
to the Parliament in November 1990;
(iv)   the macroeconomic framework outlined in the second-year PFP  as been
implemented and the exchange rate policy stated in the Letter of
Development Policy has been adhered to; this assessment will take into
account the IMP's recent assessment of Sri Lanka's macroeconomic
performance and policies, including the size of the fiscal deficit; the
domestic financing of the fiscal deficit; exchange rate management; and
inflation.
B. Public Sector Rationalization
Satisfactory progress in rationalizing the public sector would be a
condition of second tranche disbursement. In assessing performance, IDA will
examine whether:
(i) the total staff-strength of the central and provincial administrations
is reduced by 15,000-20,000 by end of 1990; for maximum clarity, the
base population from which this reduction will come is defined as
employees in central ministries and departments (including casual staff
and staff paid from Advance Accounts funds); employees of central
government ministries and departments in provincial an, district sub-
units; and employees of provincial public services; as of January 1, 1990
this base population consisted of 527,000; in addition, the September
census of public servants has been completed and an expenditure control
system for the Provincial Councils has been established;

(ii)   a target for retrenchment in 1991 is agreed upon during 1990 and
incorporated in the 1991 budget to be presented to Parliament in November
1990;
(iii)   a plan for identifying and reducing overstaffing in decentralized units
of government is agreed upon by end-1990 and incorporated in the 1991
budget to be presented to the Parliament in November 1990--part of this
plan is the completion of the Paddy Marketing Board's (PMB's)
restructuring now on-going aimed at reducing PHD's staff strength from
1,600 at present to less than 500;
(iv)   legislation has been approved by the Cabinet establishing an independent
Commission to oversee recruitment, promotion and discipline throughout
the public sector by the end of 1990;
(v)   the legislation for converting the EPF into the BPS is completed and
approved by the Cabinet by the end of 1990, provided the actuarial update
proves that the pension scheme is financially viable and imposes no
financial obligations on the Government;
(vi)   the government's pension fund has been reviewed by end-1990 and an action
plan to reduce its fiscal cost has been agreed upon with IDA and
incorporated in the 1991 budget to be presented to Parliament in November
1990; and
(vii) the government and IDA will have agreed on an action plan to address the
problems related to the Public Investment program discussed in para.58
and the plan's recommendations are incorporated in the 1991 budget to
be presented to Parliament in November 1990.
C. Private Sector Development
Satisfactory progress in taking measures to develop the private sector
would be a condition of second tranche disbursement. In assessing performance,
IDA will examine whether, by end-1990:
(i)   air freight operations have been deregulated;
(ii)   the maximum nominal tariff has been reduced to 502 and steps to introduce
a four-band tariff sy3tem with the characteristics outlined in Para. 67
have been taken;
(iii)   the PMB has been restructured as outlined in Para. 68;
(iv)   the role of the private sector in importing and distributing fertilizer,
has been increased as described in para. 69;
(v)   20,000 CTB employees have been retrenched and the CTB restructuring plan
outlined in paras. 74-77, including the total deregulation of fares and
the creation of a regulatory agency, has been implemented; and

(vi)   a plan to restructure the tree-crops sector with a view to increasing
the role of the private sector has been agreed upon and the inherently
unviable estates have been converted to other ones.
D. Poverty Alleviation
Satisfactory progress in taking measures to alleviate poverty, would be
a condition of second tranche disbursement. In assessing performance, IDA will
examine whether, by end-1990O
ti)   the target of one million households for the FSP has been achieved and
the FSP has been restructured as outlined in para. 89;
(ii)   the JSP has been restructured as outlined in paras. 92 and 93;
(iii)   the Hid-Day Meal Program has been restructured as outlined in para. 94:
and
(iv)   the overall budgetary allocation for the these programs is kept within
Rs 9.7 billion in 1990 and to no more than 3.0-3.5Z of GDP in the 1991
budget to be presented to Parliament in November 1990.
