I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Background
1.01      The construction of water production and distribution facilities
for Douala and Yaounde, partly financed by Bank Loan 604-CAM (US$5 million),
was successfully completed in 1974. There was no immediate follow-up to
this project and development of the sector in subsequent years was hampered
by failure of the sector institutions to continue their growth and to gen-
erate funds for expansion in Douala and Yaounde and extension of service to
other centers. The Bank/WHO cooperative program carried out a sector study
in 1974 to identify new projects and sector development constraints. An IDA
technical assistance credit (673-CAM) of June 15, 1977, included financing,
inter alia, for (i) the feasibility studies for 13 centers, and (ii) expa-
triate staff to strengthen the planning capabilities for the water supply
and power sectors in the Ministry of Mines and Energy's Directorate of Energy
and Water. This second project provides for construction of systems in the
13 centers, expansion of the systems in Douala and Yaounde, improvement in
the operations of Societe Nationale des Eaux du Cameroun (SNEC) and related
studies and technical assistance.
1.02      Cameroon has a population estimated at 7.6 million (1976 census)
and an aenual average growth rate of 2.3%2 The average population density
of 16/km over a total area of 475,000 km (size of Spain) is deceptive,
since the regions with the highest population concentration--the western
plateau, the savannah areas of the northern plains, and the Yaounde-Douala
axis--are separated by vast areas with low population densities. The aver-
age per capita income is US$300, compared to an absolute urban poverty level
estimate at US$225 per capita. In the early 1970's, growth of real GDP was
slow (approximately 3% p.a.). GDP growth during the Fourth Plan (1977-81)
is expected to average 6% p.a.
1.03      The rainfall pattern and height of terrain are the primary factors
in determining patterns of vegetation and population. Cameroon has a hot
tropical climate, which varies from a very wet season in the tropical rain
forests near the coast (average rainfall of over 4,000 mm/year) with a one-
month dry season, to a sub-arid climate in the sahelian plains in the north
(an average rainfall of about 600 mm/year), and six to seven months dry
season (see Map IBRD 12168R1). Virtually all rivers in the six southern
provinces carry a heavy flow for most of the year, while rivers in the
northern province where long dry seasons occur have major seasonal fluctua-
tions in volume. Shallow ground water is available in limited quantities
in most of the country. Deep ground water is used by some industries in
Douala; the possibility of ground water use for the Douala public water
supply is being investigated.



-2-
Water Supplv Sector Organization
1.04      Since the creation of SNEC in 1967, the sector's basic responsibi-
lities have been allocated as follows:
(i) the Ministry of Economy and Planning (MINEP) provides general
investment guidelines and seeks sources of external financing
for the investment program;
(ii)  the Directorate of Energy and Water (DEW) of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy (MINMEN) has general responsibility
for urban water supply, in particular for overall planning,
design and supervision of construction of new water supply
systems, operation of small provincial systems and the
"tutelle" of SNEC (see para 1.06);
(iii) SNEC has been entrusted with the planning, design, construc-
tion of extensions and, operation of the 20 major urban water
supply systems under Concession Contracts; and
(iv)  the Directorate of Rural Engineering and Community Develop-
ment in the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for rural
water supply.
1.05      This sector organization set-up is logical and is expected to
improve as MINMEN delegates more of its responsibility for design, construc-
tion supervision and operations to SNEC. The viability of the service to
the urban areas depends to a great extent on the dynamism of SNEC. Failure
to obtain needed tariff increases in the past, and inadequate staffing due
to the elimination of expensive expatriate personnel, have weakened SNEC.
As a result, SNEC has not extended its systems in keeping with urban growth
and has failed to assume a leading role in the development of the water supply
sector.  This is in contrast to the power sector where SONEL, well staffed
and -ina_.ced, has been able to successfully develop its primary and new
secc iary centers power supply systems. The DEW had assumed some of the
responsibilities, normally to be carried out by SNEC. However, DEW suffers
also from understaffing and lack of experienced engineers and planners. One
expatriate water supply engineer (full-time) and one senior engineer/economist
(part-time) were selected in December 1978, however, recruitement has been
delayed till more office space will become available for MINMEN (financed by
IDA Credit 673-CAM), to assist the DEW.
1.06      The ambitious sector goals (see para. 1.11) make it necessary to
reinforce SNEC substantially. The major Government decisions to achieve
these goals include:
(i) to entrust SNEC with the responsibility for the design,
construction and operation of all urban water supply systems;
(ii) raising the water tariffs so as to guarantee SNEC's financial
viability (see para. 4.13);



(iii) reinforcing SNEC's staff with expatriate experts (see
para. 5.30); and
(iv) emphasizing staff training and the recruitment of qualified
Cameroonians (see para. 5.34).
Details about the principal executing agency, SNEC, are given in Chapter V.
Sanitation and Storm Drainage Organization
1.07      The Ministry of Equipment and Housing (MINEH), through its Direc-
torates of Urbanism, and Housing and Construction, is responsible for storm
drainage. The responsibilities for sanitation remain ill defined, and for
this reason little attention is given to collection and disposal of sewage
and solid wastes. While MINMEN nominally has countrywide responsibility,
MINEH has been carrying out sewerage planning and construction activities
for Douala and Yaounde because they were linked to other urban infrastructure
such as road and drainage canals. MINEH does not plan to retain these plan-
ning activities once its first five-year plan is approved. The allocation
of responsibilities for this sector will be examined under sanitation and
drainage studies, for which financing is proposed under this project.
Rural Water Supply
1.08      The Directorate of Rural Engineering and Rural Development (Genie
Rurale) completed a national inventory of the village water supply situation
in 1975 with the assistance of a WHO sanitary engineer. At that time it was
estimated that 22% (about 1.1 million people) of the 4.6 million total rural
population were adequately served with safe water. This inventory served as
the basis for establishing the objective for the Fourth Plan to double the
access to safe water for the rural population so that 50% would be served by
1981. Agencies such as UNDP, UNICEF, Swiss Technical Assistance (SATA),
French Agency for Cooperation (FAC), the Danish Government, and the Bank have
been active in well drilling, construction of small multi purpose dams, supply
of equipment, and in the training of well drilling teams and sanitarians. The
Cameroon Government has supported the Genie Rurale through budget allocations
and the rural development fund which in part is supported by the Caise de
Compensation which derives its funds from the marketing of agricultural
products. The Bank's Rural Development Fund project, in four departments of
the Northern Province, has allocated 60% or $5.1 million of the total project
costs for the construction and operation of 50 small dams, rehabilitation of
600 wells, and the sinking of 400 new wells. In the ZAPI rural project in the
eastern region, $248,000 is allocated for improving 82 water points, sinking
of six wells, and studies for 13 small village water systems. Bank funds from
the Rural Development Fund project loan also supported the continuation of a
UNDP project to survey ground water resources.
Present Service Levels - Urban Water Supply

with piped water systems (34 out of 118 centers over 5000 population), only

10% has access via house connections and 33% via standpipes. The remaining 57%
1.4 million people) uses water from shallow wells and surface water sources.
The breakdown of access to water supply service is shown in the table below:

in Douala and Yaounde, a large backlog exists in system extensions and the
number of working standpipes has declined, e.g. in Yaounde from 94 in 1969
to 49 in 1978. Consequently the percentage of the population with access
to potable water 1/ is diminishing. Presently sewerage is limited to a few
middle and high class new development areas in Douala and Yaounde (an old
system in Douala is completely rundown). Elsewhere sewage disposal is by
septic tanks, emptied by private contractors, and pit privies. Most towns
have embryonic storm drainage systems, usually in the form of unlined ditches
without protection.
Recent Investments
i.10      The Government has started construction of water supply systems
in 17 secondary centers, 8 of which are financed through a KfW loan (DM 30
million, US$15.0 million) and most of the local cost by the national budget
(approximately CFAF 1 billion, US$4.5 million). These projects should have
been completed during the past five-year program (1971-1976), but have been
delayed due to slow administrative procedures; they are now expected to
become operational in 1978-79. Construction in five centers at a cost of
2.0 billion CFAF (US$9 million) was completed in 1977, with financing by the
Italian Government.
Sector Objectives under the 1976-1981 Plan
1.11      The Government's current 5-year plan (1976-1981) allocates CFAF 13.5
billion (US$61.4 million) for development of water supply systems in urban
1/   Defined here as those with private connections, served by compound
(yard) taps, or located within 200 meters of a public standpipes.



- 5 -
centers including the investments mentioned in para. 1.09, and about CFAF 4
billion (US$18.2 million) for sewerage and drainage in Yaounde and Douala.
The Government based this estimate on the assumption that approximately
two-thirds of investments would be financed through external sources. The
priority of projects to be included was defined following the discussion of
the Bank/WHO sector study.
1.12      The Government objectives for the water supply sector under the
Plan are:
(i) correcting remaining deficiencies in the existing urban
water supply systems and providing supply to all pre-
fectorates and subprefectorates by 1981 (about 70 centers).
This objective would ensure an 80% access to safe supply
for the urban population;
(ii) increasing the water supply facilities in rural areas to
cover about 50% of the rural population; and
(iii) completing studies that would lead to implementing water
supply systems in smaller administrative centers during
the succeeding plan and thus to reaching a 100% service
level target in urban centers by 1986.
1.13      For the sanitation and drainage sector, the objectives are to:
(i) prepare and update studies for major centers, with possible
implementation for the largest and neediest centers of
Douala/Yaounde, and to a lesser extent Victoria and Maroua;
and
(ii) implement first-phase and localized drainage operations in
parts of downtown Yaounde and Douala where drainage problems
create health hazards.
1.14      The above objectives are ambitious and less than half is likely
to be achieved by 1981. Project preparation remains most important for the
sector, because rational investment cannot be initiated prior to the avail-
ability of urban master plans as well as water supply and sewerage/drainage
master plans. Increasing unsanitary conditions in urban areas have resulted
in a higher incidence of malaria. Major malaria control programs have never
been made in West Africa, because of lack of infrastructure to execute these
programs. However, it is highly advisable that an effort should be made by
engineering (e.g. drainage), chemotheraphy and incidental insecticide spray-
ing to control malaria in the urban areas. The disposal as waste of the
water supplied by the project facilities would not substantially increase
the breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes, because (i) much of the safe
water to be supplied under project will simply substitute for polluted water
currently used by the population, and (ii) standpipes to be built under the
project will be designed to provide positive drainage of spilled water. The
health education component to be financed under the project (paras 4.02-4.03)
should also lead to improved sanitation.



-6-
Revised Sector Objectives
1.15      During preparation of the proposed project, it became apparent
that the objective of providing 100% access in all urban centers by 1986
was unattainable. The appraisal mission, in cooperation with the Govern-
ment, prepared a revised investment program with the objective of 100%
access by 1990. The attainment of this objective would depend not only
on the construction of 84 new systems and the rehabilitation of 14 exist-
ing systems, but also on the acceptance of standpipes as an essential means
of providing access to about half of the 1990 population. The Government
correctly recognizes the inherent problems in the use of standpipes. Stand-
pipes require regular maintenance and most municipalities are reluctant to
pay for standpipe consumption. However, despite the planned introduction
starting in FY80 of low cost yard connections which could serve 20% of the
urban population by 1990, it is unlikely that SNEC could provide house and
yard connections at a sufficient rate to supply all of the population.
There is therefore no choice but to increase the number of standpipes if
the desired service levels are to be met.
1.16      The urban population is projected to grow at an average rate of 7.5%
p.a., from 2.2 million in 1976 to 5.9 million in 1990. The national urban
population forecast is shown in Figure 1.1, together with the population
served based on the mixture of service types as shown in para. 1.16. Details
of population growth and service levels in the project areas are given in
Chapter II.
1.17      The following mixture of types of service would make it possible
to provide 100% access to service by 1990, taking into account financial
and project implementation constraints:
Regular           Yard
Center                                House Connections  Connections  Standpipes

1/   1978 level in parentheses.
The total urban population having access to piped water service would increase
from 985,000 at present to 5,910,000 in 1990, i.e., at an average growth rate
of 13.7% p.a., or nearly double the average urban population growth rate.

1.18      It is estimated that implementation of the above program would
involve the following investments:

1/   To be operated by SNEC.
Priorities for equipping centers presently unserved remain as established
by the 1974 sector study and are based on a weighting scheme. This takes
into account population, distance to, and quality of, the raw water source,
per capita cost, etc. The proposed loan includes financing for master plan
studies for the provision of least-cost water supply and sewerage/drainage
services to Douala and Yaounde, as well as the feasibility studies for exist-
ing secondary centers water supplies, to make it possible for SNEC and the
Government to plan regular expansion of this infrastructure.
Preparation for the 1980-1990 Water Supply and Sanitation Decade
1.19      The United Nations has designated the period 1981-1990 as the
International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade. All developing countries
have been asked by the U.N. Water Conference in 1977 to prepare by 1980
detailed investment plans, including identification of necessary financial
and manpower resources to provide all people with access to safe drinking
water and, to the extent possible, with sanitation by 1990. The investment
plans and financial and human resources needed would be reviewed by 1980
by a special meeting of the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations (ECOSOC) which would also submit a plan to mobilize these resources.
The sector objectives and preliminary investment program prepared during
appraisal of this project provide the basis for such a plan for Cameroon.
The technical assistance to DEW (para. 1.05) will assist the Government to
complete a more detailed document for the ECOSOC Conference.
II. POPULATION, SERVICES AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT AREAS
The Project Areas
2.01      The proposed Bank project is concerned with the expansion of pro-
duction and distribution facilities in the major centers of Douala and Yaounde,
the rehabilitation and expansion in 11 secondary centers ranging in population



- 9 -
from 2,000 to 33,000, and the construction of new systems in two centers
(Mbengwi and Njinikom) with populations of about 3,000 and 9,000 respectively.
See Map IBRD 14236 for locations.
Development Prospects in Project Areas
Yaounde and Douala
2.02      The economy of Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, will continue to
be based on Government administrative activity. Douala, being the primary
port, is the industrial, commercial and transportation center of the country.
One of the major handicaps for orderly urban development in Yaounde and
Douala has been the lack of urban planning and organized development. The
preparation of an Urban Development Project for Douala and Yaounde for FY80,
is expected to lay the foundation for an improved urban development program
and major improvements in the institutions managing these cities. The tech-
nical assistance credit 673-CAM provides funds for technical assistance to
the Ministry of Equipment and Housing (MINEH) to help prepare the urban
project. The loan for the proposed water supply project includes funds for
additional studies and technical assistance for the urban development program,
including the water, sewerage and drainage master plan studies, which have not
been provided for under the 673-CAM technical credit or in the preparation of
the urban project.
Secondary Centers
2.03      The secondary centers are mainly located in the North West and
South West Provinces whose major centers are Buea and Victoria. Economic
activity in Victoria declined rapidly with the closing of the port in 1972.
Growth has recently accelerated, particularly in connection with the con-
struction of a 30,000 bbl/day oil refinery to be commissioned in 1981.
The remaining secondary centers included in the project are administrative
centers (prefectures and sous-prefectures) which also serve as agricultural
service centers providing markets, transportation and other goods and ser-
vices for the hinterland. Coffee is the primary product of the area which
also has some plantation agriculture (oil palm, hevea) carried out by the
Cameroon Development Corporation around Tombel.
Present Service Levels
2.04      Access to service by house connections in Douala and Yaounde has
been limited to the middle and upper income groups, primarily because of the
high cost of house connections (approximately 60,000 FCFA or $275), but also
because of insufficient investment in distribution facilities. The present
ratio of length of distribution network per capita is 0.5 and 0.8 m/capita in
Douala and Yaounde respectively, whereas it should be at least 1 m/capita to
reach most of the urban population. There is little evidence of sharing
of a house connection by several families. Assuming that 10 people are
served per house connection, about 20% and 33% of the population in Douala
and Yaounde respectively have access to service via house connections.
2.05      Access to standpipes has declined from about 50% in 1972 to 39%
in 1978, because the installation of standpipes has not kept up with the
growth of population, particularly in the low income areas of Douala and
Yaounde. In the Nylon area, for example, there are two standpipes per



- 10 -
50,000 people and, as a result, some residents walk up to 5 km to obtain
potable water. The only other source of water for these people is shallow
wells which frequently are adjacent to unlined ditches which carry sullage
water and sewage. In the secondary centers with lower population density,
the use of wells does not pose such a severe health hazard and surface water
streams are less polluted. However, these water sources are limited during
the four-month dry season.
Population Forecast
2.06      The population forecasts for the project centers are shown graph-
ically in Figure 2.1 and detailed in Annex 2.1. These forecasts are based on
the 1976 census and average growth rate assumptions as indicated in Annex 2.1.
Growth in the secondary centers is forecast to continue at the present rate of
5% p.a., while in Douala and Yaounde, the expected growth rate is 10% and 9%
p.a. respectively. These rates are reasonable. The population to be served
by SNEC depends on the schedule of the take-over of existing systems and the
work program as shown in para. 3.08.
Consumption Forecasts
2.07      Detailed forecasts for individual centers are in the Project File.
Major assumptions are summarized below.
Domestic Consumption
2.08      Domestic consumption forecasts are based on estimates of 10 persons
per regular house connection and the assumption of 30 persons per yard con-
nection with specific per capita consumption of 90 and 30 lcd respectively.
Standpipe consumption is based on 15 lcd which is the estimated minimum
requirement for basic water needs in the project areas. The number of house
and yard connections is estimated on the basis of growth required to achieve
the service objectives as discussed in para. 1.14. The number of standpipes
is based on the assumption that an equal number of standpipes would be added
each year to provide 15 lcd to serve 30% of the population at 600 persons per
standpipe by 1986 in Douala and Yaounde declining uniformly from the present
levels of 850 and 1,000 persons per standpipe respectively.
Industrial Consumption
2.09      Consumers using more than 5,000 m /year are classified as indus-
trial.  All industrial/commercial consumers using less than 5,000 m /year are
included in the regular house connection category. No specific new major
industrial consumers have been identified for Douala and Yaounde; and, the
growth in industrial consumption is expected to continue at its present aver-
age growth rate of 10% and 8% respectively. Industrial consumers are not
likely to develop much in secondary centers of less than 30,000 population.
Administrative Consumption
2.10      Administrative consumption includes Government buildings, schools,
hospitals and clinics. In Douala and Yaounde, administrative consumption is
forecast to grow from its present adequate level at rates of 6.5% and 5.9% p.a.
respectively, in line with the expansion of public services. The requirements

of existing administrative services in the project's secondary centers are
based on reasonable estimates of current consumption and an average growth
rate of 14% p.a. is expected till 1990.
Water Consumption Forecasts
2.11      Figure 2.2 shows the past and future trends of total urban water
consumption and the relative importance of the project centers in the total.
Details of the consumption (sales) forecast for all SNEC centers, used as
the basis for the financial forecasts, are given in the project file. In
1981, water sales in the project centers would be about 69% of total SNEC
sales, and by 1991 would rise to 73% of total, due to the above average
growth rate in Douala and Yaounde.  Total SNEC sales are forecast to grow from
the present volume of 26.5 million m3/yr to 47.6 million m3/yr in 1983 at an
average rate of about 16% p.a. This rapid increase is considered reasonable
because the present low service levels will be substantially improved during
the project period.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Preparation
3.01      The project stems from the recommendations of the sector study
made by Bank/WHO cooperative program in 1974-75 and the dialogue which
followed with the Government. The 13 secondary centers included in project
were selected from the priority listing of the water supply sector study.
The feasibility studies for these centers were carried out by the consultants
SCET-International and financed with proceeds from the IBRD Technical Assis-
tance Credit (673-CAM). The studies for the urgently needed improvements
to the Douala and Yaounde systems were made by an engineer seconded to SNEC
by Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), a French water supply company. A Bank
consultant, Mr. Wagner, made an in-depth assessment of the Douala and Yaounde
water treatment facilities in July 1978. Urban poverty aspects were researched
by Mr. A. Cooperstock, Bank consultant, in May 1978. The present project
was appraised in October 1978 and a follow-up post appraisal mission visited
Cameroon in January 1979.
Objectives
3.02      The proposed project will be the first major step towards achieving
the general sector program objective of providing 100% potable water service
for the urban population (para. 1.14) in 1990. The specific objectives are to:
(i) provide 13 secondary centers with a reliable potable
water supply, to be managed by SNEC;
(ii)  extend the distribution systems so that potable water will
be available in all urban areas of Douala and Yaounde by
1983 when 75% of the population will be served. This will
mean an increase in population served by 700,000 people
over the estimated 400,000 served in 1978. Particular
attention will be given in serving the low income areas,
which cover about 40% of both cities;

(iii)  lay the groundwork for an organized sanitation and drainage
sector for Douala and Yaounde by providing a technical
solution as well as financial and managerial studies;
(iv)  in order to ensure that the public health benefits which
should derive from the project are actually realized,
initiate a pilot public health education project. The
public health education is intended to lead to a country-
wide effort to make the population aware of the health
benefits of public potable water supply and proper
excreta disposal and drainage and of the measures to be
taken to achieve these benefits; and
(v) strengthen the organization of the Cameroon water supply
sector; in particular the daily management and operations
of the water supply services by SNEC.
Project Description
3.03      Location of the systems to be constructed under the project is
shown on Map IBRD 14236.
A.   Water Supply Facilities
(i) Water supply systems for thirteen secondary centers (see
Table 3.1) having an average population of 12,000 in 1978.
The works will include 9 treatment plants with capacities
ranging from 30 to 250 m /h9ur, 10 treated water reservoirs
ranging from 260 to 1,500 m and transmission and distri-
bution pipes of about 300 km;
(ii)  Reinforcement and expansion of the water distribution,
transmission and storage facilities for Douala. Pre-
liminary design has indicated the necessity of the
supply and construction of about 220 km of distribution
pSpes, treated water reservoirs of about 1,000 and 3,000
m and improvements of the treatment and transmission
facilities;
(iii)  Reinforcement and expansion of the water distribution,
storage, treatment and pumping facilities for Yaounde.
On the basis of preliminary design, it was concluded
that Yaounde needs the supply and construction of about
50 km of distribution pipes, two treated water reservoir
of about 2,000 and 3,000 m each and improvements of the
treatment and pumping plant; and
(iv) Construction of public standpipes and the introduction of
a social house connection program.

B.   Studies and Technical Assistance
(i)  Design and construction supervision of the water supply
and operating facilities outlined above;
(ii)  Master plan studies for water production, transmission
and distribution of Douala and Yaounde (para. 1.17);
(iii) Sewerage and drainage urban master plan studies for Douala
and Yaounde (para. 1.07);
(iv)  Additional urban development studies for Douala and Yaounde
to provide a basis for the water supply, sewerage and
drainage studies (para. 2.02);
(v)  Feasibility studies for future extensions to the other SNEC
secondary water supply systems, including possible ground water
research and standardization of equipment (para. 1.17);
(vi)  Provision of about 18 man-years of training and management
advisors for SNEC (para. 5.30); and
(vii) Consultant's services for promotion of local civil works con-
tractors and manufacturers for the water supply and sanitation
sectors.
C.   Management and Operations Improvement Program (MIP)
A program of specific actions (paras. 5.27-5.34) to be undertaken
by SNEC to strengthen its management and organization to ensure effi-
cient operation of its facilities, improve project implementation and
upgrade the level and quality of its services.
D.   Public Health Education
(i)  Consulting services (4 man-months) for the purpose of
defining the elements of a national public health educa-
tion program for the realization of full health benefits
from the investment in water supplies; and
(ii)  Consulting services (12 man-months) for the detailed
design of, and vehicles and equipment for a pilot public
health education campaign aimed at modifying unhygienic
practices related to the use of water and to encourage
the use of yard connections, to be carried out in selected
project centers in coordination with the physical works
(paras. 4.02 to 4.03).

Cost Estimates
3.04      The total estimated cost of the project is CFAF 11.3 billion
(US$51.4 million) exclusive of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange
component of CFAF 7.9 billion (US$36.0 million), representing 70% of the
total cost. The summary cost estimate is shown in Table 3.2. It is the
practice not to charge SNEC with taxes and duties on investments for water
supply works. It is expected that this practice will be continued. The
cost estimates of the supply of equipment and civil engineering were estab-
lished by consultants on the basis of preliminary design. Unit costs were
obtained from similar works under construction in Cameroon and have been
adjusted to price levels of March 31, 1979. The cost of the proposed studies
and technical assistance was estimated on the basis of recent consultancy
proposals for the water master plan studies and Bank experience with similar
studies and technical assistance in Western Africa. The 600 man-months for
consulting services and technical assistance are estimated at an average
equivalent total cost of US$9,900 per man-month excluding contingencies. The
foreign exchange component of the project cost was estimated assuming that all
pipes and equipment would be imported; Cameroon being a net importer of these
materials.
3.05      Physical contingencies of 15% were added as a security for unfore-
seen works. To provide for price escalation during the project execution,
average annual inflation rates of 10% have been assumed for civil works,
equipment procurement and consultants' services through the project execution
period. These inflation rates for foreign and local are about the same and
are based on recent experience in Cameroon for similar contracts. This recent
trend is expected to last for the project execution period of the next four
years.
Project Financing
3.06      A Bank loan of US$21.0 million is proposed, of which US$18.1 million
will be onlent on the same conditions by the Government to SNEC; US$2.9
million will be used by the Government for the water supply, sewerage and
drainage master plan studies, urban planning and public hygiene education
studies. The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) has in principle
agreed that it will cofinance the project with joint financing arrangements,
with a loan directly to SNEC. The CDC loan would be for an amount of US$15
million. Application of these loans to the project elements is shown in
detail in Table 3.2. The remaining financing requirements of about $14.2
million will be met by SNEC from internal cash generation, and $1.2 by the
Government. Signature of the loan agreement with CDC would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
Project Implementation
3.07      The project will be carried out by SNEC, except for the sewerage and
drainage, urban and public health education studies, which will be implemented
by the Ministries of Mines and Energy, Equipment and Health respectively.

3.08      Proposals for final design for the 13 secondary centers were
received in late November 1978, and the selected consultant is expected to
start work in May 1979. Final design for the Douala and Yaounde project ele-
ments will be executed, as part of the master plan studies for these cities
by French consulting firms BCEOM-BRGM, whose selection was approved by the
Bank. Bidding for the major components is expected to start by the end of
1979. A bar chart of the work program is shown in Chart 3.1.
3.09      For construction supervision, SNEC would be assisted by engineering
consultants who would provide in-service training to SNEC's staff. One
expatriate engineer is currently advising SNEC's management, and five more
expatriate training, technical and financial assistants are expected to be
recruited by SNEC under the technical assistance component of the project
(see paras. 5.27-5.33). During negotiations SNEC agreed that it will hire
consultants acceptable to the Bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank, to assist SNEC in construction supervision. The project is
expected to be completed by mid-1983.
Procurement
3.10      Goods and services for the major components will be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Civil works for the standpipes may be carried out on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally, in accordance with local procedures satisfactory
to the Bank, or on force account by SNEC. Equipment and materials for the
hygiene education campaign may be procured on the basis of contracts nego-
tiated after solicitation of price quotations from at least three suppliers.
To the extent possible, bidding documents would group civil works, the laying
of pies and supply of equipment and pipes into lots which would attract both
local and international bidders. Procurement will be in two stages for the
thirteen centers sub-project and in one stage for the Douala and Yaounde sub-
projects. Supply for, and construction of, social connections and standpipes
will be partially executed by the successful bidders for the above-mentioned
works at the same time as the construction of the distribution system. The
major part of the social house connection program will have to be executed
by SNEC's own qualified labor force under force account or by qualified small
local contractors. SNEC's administrative services are properly staffed to
handle the cost accounting thereof. The amount for the connections executed
under force account is expected not to exceed US$300,000. There is a possi-
bility of local supply of plastic pipe as an extrusion plant is under con-
struction by a major French pipe manufacturer, Pont-a-Mousson, and a local
small plastic pipe extrusion plant exists; however, quality of the pipes
cannot yet be guaranteed. Foreign but locally established contractors are
expected to win most civil works contracts. These contractors rely exten-
sively on imported equipment and expatriate technical and management staff.
The proposed loan includes financing of studies to identify possibilities
for promotion of local contractors, principally for pipe laying, and local
manufacturing of water supply, sewerage and storm drainage materials and
equipment.

Prior Contracting and Retroactive Financing
3.11      The water master plan studies for Douala and Yaounde, the final design
studies for the 13 centers sub-project, and expatriate technical assistance
are expected to be contracted before May 1979, because these services are
urgently needed to implement the project without undue delays. The amount of
the advance contracting proposed is estimated to be about US$2 million, with
retroactive financing for an amount not to exceed US$300,000. SNEC and the
Government have agreed to prefinance the above contracts for which the first
payments was made in May 1979.
Disbursement
3.12      The proposed Bank and CDC loans of US$21.0 and US$15 million respec-
tively would be disbursed against the estimated foreign exchange cost, net of
tax, of items financed by the Bank and CDC as follows:
(i)  the Bank 38% and CDC 32% of the cost of all plant,
equipment and pipes for SNEC;
(ii)  the Bank 38% and CDC 32% of the expenditures for
pipe laying and civil works contrats for SNEC;
(iii) the Bank 38% and CDC 32% of the expenditures for
consulting services and technical assistance for SNEC;
(iv)  the Bank 70% of expenditures for consulting services
for the Government; and
(v)  the Bank 70% of the costs of procurement of equipment
and materials by the Government.
The total allocation for the loan to different types of expenditures is shown

Monitoring Criteria
3.13      Annex 3.1 shows the key indicators which would be monitored during
the project execution to measure the achievement of the technical, finan-
cial, administrative and training goals set for the proposed project. SNEC
has the capacity and systems needed to carry out this monitoring. During
negotiations, the targets set for each item to be monitored were discussed
and an understanding reached with SNEC that it will submit, until project
completion, quarterly reports on these monitoring indicators. During super-
vision missions, SNEC's performance will be discussed with its staff and
evaluated on the basis of these indicators.
IV. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
4.01      The primary benefit of the project would be the provision of an ade-
quate safe water supply to 1.2 million people. This benefit could be realized,
however, only in conjunction with the institution building components of tech-

4.02      Health benefits, although unquantifiable are expected to result from
a reduction in water borne disease and would lead to increased productivity
through a reduction in time lost from work and as well as a reduction in
direct medical costs. Full health benefits can be realized from improved
water supply, however, only when users employ the water in a proper, hygienic
manner. Problem practices such as incorrect handling of water drawn from
standpipes, incorrect disposal of wastewater, or inattention to domestic and
personal hygiene would reduce the possible benefit of the project, especially
among the lower income groups. In order to maximize this benefit, provision
is made in the project for the financing of consultancy services to assist the
Government in assessing the need for preparing, implementing, and evaluating a
hygiene education program related to water use.
4.03      The study would examine current problem practices of the target
population, the adequacy of existing health education activities, and the
feasibility of alternative strategies of public health education. The study
would be executed by the Ministry of Health which has a Public Health Educa-
tion Section, in coordination with MINMEN and SNEC. A detailed proposal would
be submitted for the execution of a pilot public health education campaign in
selected project centers, in coordination with improvements in the water dis-
tribution system. Terms of reference for such a study are given in Annex 4.1.
The proposed loan will finance vehicles and supplies for the pilot education
campaign. The Government agreed during negotiations that it will cause its
Ministry of Health to implement recommendations of this study which are agreed
by the Government and the Bank.
Least Cost Solution
Secondary Centers
4.04      The technical solution chosen for production facilities is the
least cost solution based on appropriate design standards and feasible alter-
natives. In most instances, however, there was only one solution possible.
The consultant preparing the feasibility studies has proposed designs which
make the maximum use of existing facilities and gravity flow rather than
pumping where possible. Treatment plant designs provide for the minimum of
automated equipment and the minimum treatment necessary to meet WHO standards
of quality for potable water. For the most part, facilities have been designed
to meet the needs to 1990, which is an appropriate design horizon for these
relatively small centers.  This principle has been varied, however, where a
different design horizon has been dictated by the capacity of available source
of supply or the type of facility such as intake pipe or regulating dam where
a horizon of 15-20 years, as necessary, has been used.
4.05      In the few cases where technically feasible alternatives existed
such as the construction of a gravity pipeline to avoid pumping from a nearer
source, the least cost solution was determined using an economic evaluation
with a 10% discount rate, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Cam-
eroon, to compare the present value of total investment plus operating and
maintenance costs of alternatives.



- 24 -
4.06      It is expected that final design will result in further cost-
reductions. Low population densities for Bali, Nkambe, Kumbo, and Abong Mbang
lead to higher than average length of distribution network per capita which
likely can be reduced without significantly reducing the number of people
served. Pumping costs are high in Buea because the town is situated on the
side of Mount Cameroon, while the raw water source is at a lower elevation
with an average pumping head required of about 250 m. It may be possible,
however, to increase production at the existing higher level raw water sources
and this will be confirmed prior to final design.
Douala and Yaounde
4.07      No detailed economic comparison of alternatives was required for
Douala and Yaounde as the upgrading of existing production and the reinforce-
ment of existing transmission facilities were shown by expert studies to be
clearly less costly than the construction of facilities at any new site.
Return on Investment
4.08      A minimum estimate of the internal economic rate of return (IERR)
for each subproject (Table 4.1) has been calculated as the discount rate which
equalizes the present value of all incremental capital and operating costs,
net of taxes and duties, and the present value of incremental revenues to SNEC
derived from sales of water supplied by the project fa5ilities. Revenues
based on the current average SNEC tariff of 115 CFAF/m provide the minimum
estimate of economic benefits as they do not reflect consumer surplus or
unquantifiable health benefits. The rates of return have been determined
both in domestic and efficiency (shadow) prices; however, application of the
standard conversion factor of 0.93 to the local cost and benefit components
does not significantly alter the results. The overall IERR for all centers is
about 7% when calculated in domestic prices and about 6% in efficiency prices.
The overall IERR decreases by about 2 percentage points with increases in the
present value of total costs of 10%. Details of the IERR calculations are
given in the project file and the results in domestic prices are shown in
Table 4.1. The existence of a uniform national tariff (para 4.13) precludes
the demonstration by consumers of a greater willingness to pay for water;
hence, rates of return in the secondary centers where costs are higher than
average are generally low (para. 4.10). The inclusion of these centers in
the project and their subsidization by the national tariff reflect the
Government's social policies.

4.09       The IERR is higher (20%) in Douala than 3in Yaounde (7%), because
of the lower incremental capital investment per m required to distribute
the incremental water attributable to the project. The existing production
facilities will be upgraded and the transmission system reinforced in Douala
immediately prior to the project, thereby providing sufficient capacity to
about 1985. These capital investments have been treated as sunk costs in the
IERR analysis; however, they have been included in the average incremental
cost analysis for pricing considerations (para. 4.11).
Secondary Centers
4.10      The IERR for the secondary centers is generally low, with an overall
average of 2% and ranging from -7% to 10% because of the low population den-
sities and the large initial capital investments needed to rehabilitate and
establish the systems. The rates of return could improve as a result of cost
reductions in final design (para 4.06).

Average Incremental Cost of Water Supply
4.11      The average incremental cost (AIC) 1/ of water supplied to final
c-rsi-mers has been estimated for each of the project centers at various
discount rates as shown in Table 4.2, in order to assess the degree of cross-
subsidization within the sector and to provide a basis for evaluating pricing
policy. Taxes and duties have been excluded to give the economic costs to
the national economy of supplying water in these centers. The AIC of water
has been computed in domestic and in efficiency (shadow) prices, with details
given in the project file. Labor has not been shadow priced as the market
wage rate for the skilled labor for construction and operation of the facili-
ties represents its economic cost and little unskilled labor would be employed.
4.12      The AIC of supplying industrial customers in Douala and Yaounde is
less than for domestic customers, because of the economies of scale in the
distribution network associated with serving high volume customers generally
from the existing sub-transmission, secondary network. Roughly 50% of the
total incremental distribution network investment in Douala and Yaounde is
for the tertiary network composed of small diameter higher unit cost pipe
(per m distributed) serving only domestic consumers. The remaining 50% is
a joint investment required to serve both domestic and industrial consumers.
The investment associated solely with domestic consumption has, therefore,
been deducted from the total incremental investment program to determine
the AIC 2/3of industrial supply which is estimated to be about 100 and
133 CFAF/m in domestic prices in Douala and Yaounde respectively.
Tariff Structure and Level
4.13      The current uniform SNEC tariff structure and level shown below
were introduced as of January 1, 1979, following recommendations made during
project preparation and appraisal.3 The appraisal mission recommended an
average tariff level of 125 CFAF/m  together with the elimination of the   3
regressive structure for industrial consumers and the introduction of a 5 m'/
month social block. This volume for the average family would provide about
15 lcd which is adequate to meet basic water supply needs. For political
reasons, however, the Government did not follow the Bank's recommendations
on the elimination of the regressive industrial taiiff (para. 4.15). On
average, the tariff level was raised to 115 CFAF/m as shown below.
1/   The AIC was calculated as the present value of all capital, operating
and replacement costs of facilities to satisfy demand to 1990 divided
by the present value of total consumption over the life of the facilities.

Curreni tariffs in centers operated by MINMEN and the municipalities are 75
CFAF/m , albeit for poor quality water and inferior service, and would be
increased to the uniform tariff following rehabilitation by SNEC.
Pricing Considerations
4.14      In 1972, the Government introduced the uniform national tariff
policy for centers operated by SNEC, with the result that consumers primarily
in Douala cross-subsidize those in smaller centers where the AIC of water
supply is higher than the tariff. This policy may be appropriate in Cameroon
as a means of redistributing income from this industrialized center to the
agriculturally based secondary centers where incomes are generally lower.
Demand is not expected to be unduly stimulated above levels required for basic
needs nor is wastage in the small centers likely to be encouraged by pricing
at less than long-run marginal cost because the uniform tariff represents a
higher proportion of average family income in the smaller centers. Sensi-
tivity analysis (Table 4.2) indicates that the AIC in all centers would
diminish with an accelerated growth as the present value of increased con-
sumption more than offsets the increased present value of costs caused by
advancing future investment for system expansion.



- 29 -
Regressive Industrial Tariff
4.15      Although the industrial tariff in some centers is set below the AIC
and decreases with increasing volumes of consumption this is acceptable at
present. In Douala, the principal industrial center, the tariff for all indus-
trial consumption is above the 100 CFAF/m AIC of supply. About 15% of
Cameroon's toSal industrial consumption occurs in YaoundS at a price (125
to 105 CFAF/m ) which is less than the AIC of 133 CFAF/m ; however, continua-
tion of the regressive tariff is not likely to lead to a misallocation of
resources because other factors, such as transportation, play a more important
role in causing industries to locate in Douala.
Affordability of Water
4.16      No reliable estimates of household income are presently available
in Cameroon. About 50% of the population of Douala and Yaounde are estimated
to have incomes less than the urban poverty threshold of US$225/capita/year,
although recent survey information suggests that a greater percentage of popu-
lation may be above this th 5eshold. At the estimated urban poverty threshold,
households could obtain 9 m /month at the current tariff by spending 4% of
monthly income on water. This percentage is considered to be the maximum
affordable for water in West Africa. The volume thus purchased, about 50
lcd for a family of 6, is more than sufficient to meet basic water supply
needs. The water needs of the population below the urban poverty threshold
would be satisfied by standpipes or shared yard connections.
4.17      Farm cash incomes in the secondary centers of the project are esti-
mated to be in the range of 150-200,000 CFAF/year (US$700-900/year), while
for coffee and cocoa growers they are estimated to be 200-250,000 CFAF/year
(US$900-1,100/year). As farm incomes are generally lower than incomes of
salaried workers in urban centers, the limit of 150,000 CFAF/year (US$700/
year) is considered to be the lower limit for the 50% of thS population likely
to take house or yard connections. The social block of 5 m /month would
therefore amount to a maximum of 4% of monthly income for the target popula-
tion for house or yard connections.
4.18      Affordability of monthly water bills is also indicated by comparison
with the current situation in the electric power sector. At present, about
35% of the total urban population is served by house connections to the elec-
tricity network (compared with 10% in the water sector) and the average
monthly bill for domestic electricity consumption is about 6,000 CFAF.
Consumers using electricity for only lighting and small appliances (29% of
total urban population) pay an average bill of 4,000 CFAF/month. The popula-
tion having lighting and small appliance electricity connections would be
the target population for yard connections. The cost of an electricity
connection is about 25,000 CFAF while the proposed price for a yard connection
for3water is about 20,000 CFAF.  With 3the introduction of a social block of
5 m /month, the monthly bill for 15 m /month (about 60 lcd for a family of 8)
would be 1,725 CFAF or less than half the average monthly electricity bill;
thus, water from house connections is affordable by the population with
electricity connections.



Urban Poverty Impact
4.19      Based on the limited information available, approximately 300,000-
350,000 people or roughly half the population of Douala, are in the absolute
poverty category 1/. Up to 200,000 persons could receive 15 lcd from the
existing 229 standpipes; however, their geographic distribution is such
that only 100,000 people could be considered to have reasonable access, i.e.
within 200 m of their houses. The situation in Yaounde is similar. One half
of the population or approximately 200,000 people are estimated to be in the
absolute poverty category; the existing standpipes could provide 15 lcd to
at most 90,000 people. The quantification of the urban poverty group in
secondary centers is more difficult because of the greater percentage of non-
monetary income obtained from cultivation and other traditional sources of
production for own use. For the purposes of water demand forecasting, it has
been assumed that 50% of the population in secondary centers could not afford
house or yard connections and would require standpipes to ensure access to
safe water.
4.20       In Douala and Yaounde, the major cause of deterioration of access
to service by the urban poor has been the lack of extensions of the distribu-
tion networks into the rapidly growing slum areas together with the de facto
policy of the municipalities to restrict the number of standpipes in service.
The project would provide for a significant expansion of the distribution net-
work; however, this work cannot be done without a minimum level of basic urban
planning to define roads and drainage routes so that pipes can be laid without
the danger of a need for later relocation. The urban master plan and drainage
master plan studies for Douala and Yaounde to be financed by the proposed loan
would give priority to the squatter areas in order to permit the rapid expan-
sion of the water distribution network in these areas. As an interim measure,
standpipes would be installed where water mains exist or where later reloca-
tion is unlikely. The Government has accepted in principle that most squatter
areas in general should be regularized, if at all practicable, rather than
demolished. The risk of subsequent demolition of water distribution facili-
ties is slight.
4.21      The project would provide for the construction of 225 standpipes
in Douala and 165 in Yaounde, providing access to water to about 290,000
people in both cities or about 40% of the 1983 urban poverty group of 710,000
as shown in the table below. In addition, present standpipe users would
benefit from reduced queuing and rehabilitation of existing standpipes, so
that about 58% of the 1983 urban poverty group would benefit from the project.
4.22      In the secondary centers, the urban poor constituting about half the
population are presently served by standpipes but generally with untreated
water. Many existing standpipes would require rehabilitation or relocation
considering the increased availability of house and yard connections. The
improvements in standpipe service and the provision of safe treated water

would be of direct benefit to the poverty group in these centers. The remain-
ing 40% (320,000 people) of the 1983 poverty group in all centers would be the
target group for future projects.
4.23     The Government gave assurances during negotiations that it would
enforce existing legislation to ensure regular payments by the municipalities
to SNEC for standpipe water in order to ensure the improved and continuing
access to safe water for the urban poor (para. 5.17).
4.24     Of the total $43.8 million for project works in all centers, about
10% would directly benefit the urban poor; thus, $1.6 million of the $21
million (8%) proposed loan is poverty lending.

V. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
Introduction
5.01     The Borrower will be the Government of Cameroon.  The principal
beneficiary will be SNEC, to which the Government will on-lend US$18.1 million
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. US$2.9 million will be used
by the Government to finance the water supply, sewerage and drainage master
plan studies, and, urban and public health studies.  CDC will lend US$15
million directly to SNEC.
Organization and Management
5.02     Although SNEC is a public company, it is basically managed as an
autonomous Government entity. SNEC was created in 1967 to operate the water
supply operations of: (1) Douala, Yaounde and 3 smaller systems operated by
an association of two foreign firms, the Societe d'Eau et d'Assainissement



- 32 -
(SOCEA) and the Caisse Centrale de Distribution d'Electricite et d'Eau (CCDEE)
for the Government entity "Societe Provisoire des Eaux du Cameroun" (SPEC);
and (2) 6 smaller systems managed by Electricite du Cameroun (EDC). At that
time, EDC was renamed SONEL. Established as a national water entity, SNEC
has the long-term goal of gradually assuming the responsibility for all piped
water supply operations, after it had established itself firmly in Douala,
Yaounde and the nine secondary centers. Since 1970, SNEC has progressively
enlarged its activities by adding nine more systems. For 1979-80, SNEC plans
to assume the operating responsibility for the 11 secondary systems to be
improved under the proposed project, and at present operated by the municipali-
ties or the DEW-MINMEN. The Government intends that SNEC take over the design,
construction and operation of all urban piped water systems. The development
program of SNEC is thus synonymous with the national program for the urban
water sector. As a result of the revised program, the secondary centers to be
operated by SNEC would then be as follows:

During the proposed project implementation period (1979-1983), the increases
for SNEC would be: from 18 to 48 secondary systems, from 30,000 to 65,000
connections, and from 700 to 1,600 standpipes.
5.03       SNEC is subject to the "tutelle" (guidance and supervision) of
MINMEN, which must approve tariffs and investment programs. Many decisions
such as tariff increases and investments are in reality decided upon by the
principal ministers involved, namely, the Prime Minister, and the Ministers
of Planning, Finance and Energy and Mines.
5.04       SNEC original share capital was CFAF 100 million.  It has since been
increased to CFAF 250 million and was doubled in FY78 to CFAF 500 million.
The original shareholders have retained their percentage of ownership: SONEL
(67%), the Government (20%), Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
of France (11%), and the municipalities (2%). Because the Central Government
holds 80% of SONEL's share capital, it effectively owns 74% of SNEC's stock
and controls directly 87% of the votes. Dividends at the rate of 5% of share
capital have been paid in some years (para. 6.14).



- 33 -
5.05       SNEC operates under a concession system similar to that used in
France and in several French speaking countries of West Africa. Under this
system, the concessionnaire is granted the right, for a fixed period, to con-
struct new facilities and to operate these and all facilities in existence
at the beginning of the Concession, to levy agreed tariffs, and to recover
its capital at the end of the Concession. However, most of the fixed assets--
usually the entire transmission and distribution system and the production
works--remain the property of the State, and must be returned or made good by
the concessionaire (even if it has financed all or part of their cost) when
the concession expires. From the Government point of view, the concession
system has the advantage that while facilities remain the property of Govern-
ment, they can be operated on a commercial basis.
5.06       SNEC currently operates under four separate concession contracts:
Douala, Yaounde, Garoua and secondary centers. New systems transferred to
SNEC are incorporated into the secondary centers contract by means of addenda.
One major deficiency of these contracts is that they do not specifically
hold SNEC responsible for the continuous expansion of the systems for which
it is responsible, so as to be able to meet the increasing demand in those
centers and to expand service to all, including the poor. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained from SNEC that this responsibility will be
added to the concession contract and agreement was reached that the Government
will provide or cause to be provided through tariffs, equity or loans, the
financial resources necessary for SNEC to fulfill this responsibility.
Agreement was reached with the Government that it will, by June 30, 1980,
review the existing concession contracts with a view to regrouping and simpli-
fying these as necessary and will consult with the Bank before the final texts
are adopted.
5.07       SNEC's Board comprises 12 members, elected by the shareholders.
Eight are Central Government members, representing the Presidency, the Prime
Minister, the Parliament and the Ministries of Planning, Finance, Mines and
Energy, and Equipment. One member represents the municipalities, one the
Economic and Social Council, and two CCCE, while SONEL has no board member-
ship. Major decisions are made at the presidential and ministerial level.
CCCE does not actively participate in the decision-making process.
5.08      SNEC's organizational structure is shown in Chart 5.1.  Changes in
this organization will be introduced following studies by SNEC (paras 5.27-5.32).
All major decisions are made in Douala; only the decisions for the day-to-day
operations are made at the regional and system levels. The SONEL regional
delegate acts also as SNEC's regional delegate (see para. 5.09). All planning,
design, supervision of work, major maintenance and repair and administrative
services are stationed and directed from Douala.
5.09      Under the existing service contract between SNEC and SONEL, dating
from 1967, SONEL handles all commercial/administrative matters for SNEC out-
side of Douala. This includes staff supervision of regional operations, as
well as all meter reading, billing, collection and data processing. At
present, 52 SONEL staff work on a part-time basis for SNEC. In FY78, SNEC
paid CFAF 185 million to SONEL for these services, including CFAF 56 million
for data processing. The SONEL regional delegate is supposedly the official

link between the regions and SNEC's headquarters, and SNEC's technical field
staff should report to him. In reality, SNEC's technical personnel in the
regions responds directly to SNEC, while SONEL's commercial personnel, who
are responsible for both power and water meter reading and billing, only
account to the SONEL hierarchy. This organization is unsatisfactory since
SONEL's regional delegates are not particularly interested in water supply.
It is one of the main reasons for the fairly high level of unaccounted-for
water and the somewhat unsatisfactory billing and collections situation in
the water sector. SONEL's charges are high and verification of time and
expense allocation is virtually impossible. Since the service contract can
be cancelled at the request of either party, SNEC has decided to phase out
this arrangement over a period of five years, beginning with the secondary
centers and ending with Douala and Yaounde. Costs to SNEC are not expected
to increase, while direct supervision of regional staff should lead to an
improved billing and collection performance (paras. 5.15-5.17).
5.10      In the past, SONEL's data processing services have not been satis-
factory to SNEC. There have been delays of up to several months in billing
and in the preparation of management information and financial statements but
SNEC's scope of operations does not warrant having its own computer. SONEL
is installing a new computer system and is reviewing SNEC's data processing
requirements. Improved data processing services are essential for an improve-
ment in SNEC's overall performance. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from SNEC that it will take all such measures as may be necessary to
reduce delays in billing and other data processing requirements to one month.
In case SONEL cannot provide this improved service, SNEC would have the option
of engaging the services of a commercial data processing firm, as recommended
by the recent SAUR management study.
Personnel
5.11      SNEC's three senior managers are appointed by the Minister of Mines
and Energy. The present management is competent, but somewhat overloaded
with the responsibilities of a rapidly expanding company. Only one technical
and one financial advisor remain as direct support to the management.
5.12      SNEC's management is experiencing a difficult period of adjusting
to the departure of the expatriates in top managerial and technical
positions.  Since June 1975, SNEC's top executives have been Cameroonians.
Only about ten expatriates (including the two mentioned in para 5.11) still
occupy advisory and middle-level management positions. SNEC's staffing has
remained reasonable in numbers, with some overstaffing at the Douala and
Yaounde centers. About 576 people were employed in 1978, roughly equally
divided between headquarters, the Douala system, the Yaounde system and other
systems in the interior. Staffing excludes personnel for meter reading,
billing, collection and computer services, as these services are performed by
SONEL. SNEC still relies on contractors for some of the house connection
works.
5.13      SNEC will see a significant increase in its activities in the near
future (a tripling of water sales by 1985). In addition, it will take on



- 36 -
the operation of new centers, most of which are in poor condition. The total
separation of SNEC from SONEL is expected by 1985. SNEC therefore must
increase its human resources considerably; its staff will have to increase
from 576 in 1978 to 900 by 1985 for operations alone. In order to cope with
these additional duties, it will undertake a manpower and training program
(see para. 5.34).
Operations and Maintenance
5.14      SNEC's production and distribution facilities are managed by in-
telligent young engineers who have only a few years on-the-job experience
and no specialized training in the field of water supply operations. Water
production facilities in Douala and Yaounde are not well maintained and oper-
ated. A Bank consultant has made an analysis of these installations as well
as specific recommendations on improvements and personnel training. As few
extensions to the distribution system have been constructed over the past
years, the staff is well familiar with it. However, little preventive main-
tenance is carried out. Staff training and implementation of the Management
Improvement Program are expected to correct this situation.
Billing
5.15      Meter reading, billing and collection are currently performed for
SNEC by SONEL (para. 5.09). Meters are read on a monthly basis. One bill
is issued for power and water jointly, but the charges are shown separately.
Both meter reading and distribution of bills (by other meter readers) are on
a rotating basis. Consumers are expected to pay within 10 days after pre-
sentation of the bill. In case of non-payment, both water and power should
be cut off. This policy has been applied with some consistency with regard
to the private sector (para. 5.16), but not with regard to the public sector
(paras. 5.16-5.17). Billing has gradually decreased from 74% of total water
produced in FY74 to about 70% in FY78. The situation is better than average
in Douala and Yaounde but below average in some of the secondary centers,
notably in Garoua (50%). SNEC is expected to be able to improve this grad-
ually as it acquires its own commercial staff (para. 5.09) and gets access
to better data processing services (para 5.10).
Collections
5.16      Collections from domestic consumers and industry are satisfactory;
accounts receivable in these categories amounted to 2.5 and 2.7 months of
billing respectively as of June 30, 1978. This is acceptable, especially
considering the frequent delays in billing (para. 5.15). However, the Govern-
ment and the municipalities are usually considerably in arrears.
5.17      The situation with regard to the Government's payments procedure
remains unsatisfactory. Accounts receivable from Government average about 6
months of billing. Government does not budget adequately for actual water
consumption and, consequently, at the end of each fiscal year special budget
allocations need to be obtained from the Ministry of Finance. As far as the
municipalities are concerned, accounts receivable (primarily for water con-
sumed at standpipes) averaged the last few years about 10 months of billing.



- 37 -
In view of the expected increase in the number of standpipes, from 713 at the
end of FY78 to about 2,000 by FY86, a satisfactory solution to this persistent
problem is necessary. Only the Central Government is able to impose and
implement a solution in this respect, since the present level of municipal
arrears appears to be more the result of administrative shortcomings rather
than a lack of funds. An analysis of available information indicates that
positive Treasury balances exist for Douala and Yaounde and many secondary
centers. During negotiations, (i) agreement was reached with the Government
that it will henceforth: request adequate budget appropriations, based on
actual and estimated consumption and (ii) settle its water bills within
three months of billing. Agreement was also reached with the Government that
it will cause the municipalities to settle their water bills within three
months of billing. Assurances were obtained from the Government that it
would, to this end, use all regulatory powers available to it, notably ex
officio payment orders by the Prefets in their capacity as Ordonnateurs of
the Municipal budgets. Furthermore, assurances were obtained that the
Government will cause settlement of all existing municipal arrears in excess
of three months of billing at the latest by December 31, 1979.
5.18      In accordance with Article 4 of the existing Concession contracts,
the Government should have made grants of at least CFAF 240 million to SNEC
as a contribution to the cost of taking over the present 20 centers. This
has not been done and, so far, no action has been taken by either party to
settle this question. Agreement was reached that the Government will deter-
mine by December 32, 1979 the amounts due to SNEC and settle these by June 30,
1981.
Accounting
5.19      Until recently, SNEC's accounts were reasonably well kept by an
accounting staff of 19 people at headquarters. Over the last few years,
however, a gradual deterioration in the enforcement of internal control
procedures has been observed. Improvements are primarily required in keeping
the fixed assets registers completely up-to-date, calculation of the depreci-
ation charges and valuation and control of inventories. SNEC is aware that
systems and procedures in these areas need to be improved and enforced. As
part of the proposed MIP (paras. 5.27-5.34) training will be provided for
the accounting staff and an accounting expert will be recruited (para. 5.33).
5.20      SNEC presently distinguishes several categories of fixed assets
which fall under three headings: (i) private assets (office furniture, air
conditioners, cars, etc.) owned by SNEC and financed by shareholders and oper-
ating revenues; (ii) Concession assets financed by SNEC from operating
revenues; and (iii) Concession assets by the Government and consumers (the
latter bear the cost of connections and extensions). As of the end of FY78,
the total acquisition value of these assets was about CFAF 11.5 billion. Pri-
vate assets constituted 4% of this total, revenue financed Concession assets
42%, and other Concession assets 54%.
5.21      Separate fixed assets registers are kept by SNEC for each of these
three categories of assets. Private assets (para. 5.20 (i)) are subject to
straight-line depreciation over their useful life on their gross acquisition



- 38 -
value ("technical depreciation"), while the two categories of Concession
assets (para. 5.20 (ii) and (iii)) are subject to straight-line depreciation
over their useful lives on their gross current value ("renewal provision").
It should be borne in mind that the Concession assets financed by the Govern-
ment and consumers are not carried on the books of SNEC, whereas the remain-
ing categories are carried at their acquisition value. Furthermore, a second
depreciation, the "Amortissement de Caducite", is charged to operations each
year for an amount equal to the net acquisition (i.e. gross value minus the
accumulated amortissement de caducite) value of the concession assets financed
from revenues (para. 5.20 (ii)), divided by the number of years left in the
Concession (presently 29).
5.22      The "Amortissement de Caducite" is mainly intended to compensate
SNEC's shareholders at the end of the Concession contract period (2008)
for investments made by them for extensions in centers which they operate.
However, since SNEC is virtually wholly owned by the Government, this pro-
vision is unnecessary and should be eliminated. At the same time, the
Government should take the opportunity of reviewing the concession con-
tracts (para. 5.06), to regroup all accounts within SNEC, without, however,
changing other interesting features of the Concession contract, particu-
larly its basic private enterprise character. During negotiations, agreement
was reached with SNEC and the Government that: (i) all three categories of
assets will be carried on SNEC's balance sheets; and (ii) the Amortissement
de Caducite will be abolished so that only one depreciation charge on the
gross current value of all assets will be used, effective FY79/80. The
index presently used by SNEC for annual asset revaluation for the purpose of
calculating the renewal provision (the French Gross Industrial Price Index)
is acceptable to the Bank. While it would be preferable to carry fixed assets
at current value on the books, a decision to this effect would be left to
SNEC.
Internal Audit
5.23      As part of the proposed MIP (paras. 5.27-5.34) and to ensure that
all accounting systems and procedures are correctly and consistently applied,
the duties and reporting relationship of the existing Service Controle should
be redefined to become that of an internal auditing unit of adequate size.
During negotiations, SNEC agreed that it will create an internal auditing
unit by December 31, 1979. This unit would report directly to the Managing
Director of SNEC. The current Chief of the Service Controle is acceptable to
the Bank for the position of Chief of the internal auditing unit.
External Audit
5.24      The existing external auditing arrangements (Societe d'Expertise
Comptable Fiduciaire de France) are satisfactory. Delays in the actual pub-
lications of the auditor's report were reduced to two months for the 1977/78
report. During negotiations, SNEC agreed that it will continue to employ
external auditors acceptable to the Bank and that it will arrange for the
auditor's report and related documents to be submitted to the Bank within
six months after the close of the fiscal year.

Financial Planning
5.25       SNEC re-instituted for FY79 the budget preparation process that had
been discontinued since FY77. At this stage, the system concentrates solely
on expenditures and expenditure control. Following discussion with the
appraisal mission, SNEC recognizes that short-term financial planning should
include a complete set of financial statements. During negotiations, SNEC
agreed that, as part of the Management Improvement Program it will prepare
and submit to the Bank by June 30 of each year forecast financial statements
over a 5-year period to test the rate of return covenant (para. 6.16). SNEC
has the in-house expertise to prepare such financial forecasts.
Insurance
5.26      The existing asset and liability insurance arrangements are satis-
factory. SNEC insures with the state-owned Societe Camerounaise des Assurances
et Reassurances. The amount of insurance coverage required is revised annually
on the basis of estimates prepared by technical experts.
Management Improvement Program
5.27       SNEC's management is well aware of the need to improve its opera-
tions and administration. Its essential objectives are:
(1) to improve its present technical, administrative and finan-
cial management;
(2) to assume direct responsibility for all activities at present
carried out by SONEL, gradually before 1985;
(3) to prepare for the rapid expansion of its operations, i.e.
growth of its large systems Douala and Yaounde and the
assumption of the operations of a large number of new
systems in small secondary centers over the next ten years;
and
(4) to pursue more actively its sector objective to attain the
100% service goal by 1990 (para. 1.14).
5.28      To achieve these objectives, it will be necessary to:
(1) re-organize part of SNEC (para 5.29);
(2) recruit technical assistants (paras. 5.30-5.33); and
(3) organize a substantial training program (para. 5.34).
Details of the Management Improvement Program were discussed during negotia-
tions and assurances obtained that it will be undertaken by SNEC as outlined
in paras. 5.29-5.34 with the support of Government.



- 40 -
5.29      Based on a management study made by the consultants SAUR in 1978 and
further consultations with Bank missions the following major changes in SNEC's
organization and practices are to be implemented:
(1) to increase its operating regions from three to four;
(2) to appoint its own regional managers instead of using SONEL's
personnel;
(3) to broaden responsibility to its regional managers, to reflect
the geographical distances between its regional headquarters
and Douala;
(4) to create its own commercial department and discontinue using
the services of SONEL for billing and collectiSn;
(5) to revise accounting systems and procedures;
(6) to create an internal auditing unit of adequate size to
ensure consistent application of accounting systems and
procedures; and
(7) to prepare annual 5-year forecasts of its financial status
(para 5.25).
5.30      The technical assistants to be employed by SNEC would include:
(1) an operations manager, as assistant to the director of operations
(4 years);
(2) a supervisor to assist in the take-over of new centers (2 years);
(3) a commercial department manager (4 years);
(4) an accounting expert (4 years); and
(5) a manager for the training center (4 years).
The foreign exchange cost of this technical assistance is included in the
proposed loan, except for the manager for the training center who will be
financed by the C.C.C.E. The experts would be employed in accordance with
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
5.31      The operations manager to be recruited by SNEC would be a senior
well-experienced engineer who would be responsible for the operations of
SNEC's water supply operations and would be stationed at headquarters. He
would report to SNEC's director of technical operations. In particular,
he would introduce organizations and methods which will enable SNEC to meet
its objectives. The supervisor who would take care of the take-over of
new centers would be an experienced but younger field engineer. He would
have responsibility for taking over existing systems from Government or
municipalities and putting these as well as new systems into operations.



- 41 -
These two technical assistants would work closely with the training engineer
and the personel recruitment officer, so as to ensure that SNEC systems will
be manned by qualified staff.
5.32      In view of the large increase in the number of secondary centers
to be taken over by SNEC (para. 1.17), the gradual take-over by SNEC staff
of the commercial functions now exercised by SONEL (para. 5.09), and the need
to promote water sales through private and yard connections, a Commercial
Department will be created within SNEC as part of the MIP. The functions
of the new Commercial Department would be: (i) meter reading and billing;
(ii) processing of requests for service, disconnection and reconnection;
(iii) promotion of water sales through the use of private and yard connec-
tions; (iv) installation and replacement of meters; (v) maintenance of cus-
tomer files; and (vi) tariff studies. Since a suitable Cameroonian candidate
for the position of Commercial Director could not be identified, it is pro-
posed to finance this position from the proceeds of the proposed loan for a
period of four years. The Commercial Director would be expected to provide
staff training and to ensure that a qualified Cameroonian successor will
eventually be able to take over.
5.33      SNEC would recruit an accounting expert from the proceeds of the
proposed loan, for a period of four years. The function of this expert would
be, inter-alia, to: (i) design an analytical accounting system for SNEC on
the basis of the recently completed SAUR study, and supervise its initial
implementation; (ii) assist the Chief Accountant in setting up satisfactory
accounting systems for the old and new secondary centers; (iii) revise pro-
cedures for maintaining the fixed assets registers, calculating depreciation,
and valuating and controlling inventories (para. 5.19); and (iv) train the
accounting staff in the implementation of these new procedures.
5.34      SNEC's management has become increasingly aware of the entity's
training needs and is showing great interest in its manpower and training
requirements. However, it has little expertise in this field and would hire a
well experienced manager who would direct training activities and run SNEC's
training center in close cooperation with SNEC's operational staff, including
the other technical assistants to be employed. SNEC's training facilities are
located within the substantial, long established, SONEL training center in
Douala. The water sector training facilities are of good quality. They have
a capacity for 20 trainees and comprise:
(a) a well-equipped classroom, complete with display charts and
sectionalized models of pumps and water meters;
(b) a water treatment and examination training laboratory
equipped with a working scale model of the rapid gravity
filtration process;
(c) outside practical facilities for pipe laying and jointing,
under pressure ferruling and service connections; and
(d) facilities for public standpipe installation and maintenance.
The facilities are situated next to SNEC's major reservoirs and pumping
facilities. SONEL has agreed in principle that when it vacates its present
training center in 1981, to move into its new facilities, SNEC will be able
to take over SONEL's present training facilities as well.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
General
6.01       This chapter first deals with the past and present financial perfor-
mance of SNEC as it relates to the 20 centers that constitute at present the
Concession (paras. 6.02-6.09). Subsequently it reviews the future financial
performance of the urban water supply sector as a whole because: (i) by
the end of the project implementation period, SNEC will be responsible for
operating close to 100% of all urban water supply systems; and (ii) the
proposed financial covenants would cover the entire sector.
Past and Present Financial Performance
6.02      Under the terms of the first water supply loan (604-CAM), SNEC
should have achieved a 10% rate of return on the current value of net fixed
assets in operation at the beginning of each year, including Government assets
not kept on SNEC's books (para. 5.21). These rates were generally achieved
until FY73, when the project was essentially completed. Rates of return since
then have varied from 0.6% in FY75 to 3.4% in FY77. Net internal cash genera-
tion during the period FY74-FY78 financed 55% of SNEC's construction and
working capital requirements; this 55% corresponds to about 29% of total
sector requirements, i.e. including investments made by the Government and
consumers in the 20 centers operated by SNEC. The debt limitation covenant,
according to which no additional debt could be incurred unless net revenues
covered maximum future debt service 1.5 times, was adhered to. Annual debt
service coverage during the period was well in excess of 2.0. Key financial
indicators for the period are shown below:

6.03      SNEC's income statements of the past five years are summarized below
(in FCFA million):
FY74     FY75      FY76      FY77      FY78
Water Sales                     1,212      1,324    1,685    1,985    2,208
Reimbursable Works etc.            347       662       612       735       877
Total Revenues             1,559      1,986    2,297    2,720    3,085
Operating Expenses              1,078      1,471    1,537    1,708    2,106
Depreciation Expenses             397        468       514       701       664
Operating Income              84         47       246      311       261
Interest Expense                  112        108       142       187      193
Net Income                   -28        -61       104       124       68
6.04      SNEC's financial performance during FY78 deteriorated in comparison
with the two preceding years because it did not get permission to increase
tariffs during FY's 77 and 78 (para. 6.07). However, the Corporation remained
financially viable. Dividends (para. 6.14) were declared during this period
only over FY77, the year with highest net income. The large proportion of
depreciation charges as a percentage of total operating expenses (about 25%)
results from the application of three different depreciation charges as
explained in para. 5.21.
6.05      During the period FY74-78, investments made by SNEC consisted
primarily of extensions to its existing systems. SNEC's gross fixed assets
increased from FCFA 2.9 billion in FY74 to FCFA 5.3 billion in FY78. Com-
parative balance sheets for FY's 74 and 78 are summarized below:

/a   Not including assets and work in progress financed by Government and
consumers, nor the corresponding debt and/or equity. Assets financed
by the Government and consumers as of the end of FY78 constituted 54%
of all assets used by SNEC (para 5.20).
/b   At acquisition values.
6.06      The balance sheets show a generally satisfactory position.  SNEC's
debt as a percent of long-term capitalization decreased from 52% in FY74 to
42% in FY78. The current ratio decreased over the same period from 2.5 to
1.8. Accounts receivable increased sligthly from 3.7 months to 4.2 months of
billing. Government and the municipalities accounted for 51% of this as of
the end of FY78 (para. 5.17). SNEC's cash position as of the end of FY78 was
below one month of cash operating expenses, which is sufficient since SNEC
has ready overdraft facilities.
Tariffs
6.07      Tariffs were increased on average by 5% during FY75 and by 22%
during FY76. Effective FY77 (July 1, 1976) uniform tariffs were introduced
for all centers, which resulted in a de facto average price increase of 5.5%.
Following the appraisal of the proposed second water supply project, the
Government allowed SNEC to increase tariffs on3average by 28%, raising the
average price from about FCFA 90 to FCFA 115/m , effective January 1, 1979.
The current tariff schedule is shown in para. 4.13.



- 45 -
6.08      According to Article 16 of the four different Cahiers de Charges
under which SNEC operates (see Project File), tariffs should have been
adjusted regularly on the basis of multi-parameter adjustment formulas.
Basically, these formulas should compensate SNEC for variations in price
levels of major categories of operating expenditures. The weight of the
parameters within the formulas should be modified periodically to reflect
changing operating conditions. In practice, however, the formulas have not
been applied. Significantly, the latest tariff increase (para. 6.07) was
based on a annual rate of return requirement for FY79 as proposed by the
appraisal mission.
6.09      Should SNEC and the Government wish to maintain the principle of
multi-parameter tariff adjustment formulas, then they should introduce one
formula to reflect the fact that there is now a nationwide uniform tariff.
Also, Article 16 sub(c) should be expanded to allow tariffs to be adjusted
on the basis of annual rate of return and cash flow requirements. At present
the only additional reasons for revising tariffs are: (i) a 5-year lapse
since the last tariff increase; (ii) sharp variations in the price of water
based on applicaton of the tariff adjustment formulas; and (iii) variations
in interest rates on SNEC borrowings. During negotiations an understanding
was reached with the Government and SNEC that the existing Articles 16 of
the Cahiers des Charges will be modified in the sense proposed by the Bank.
Transfer of Secondary Centers
6.10      During the project implementation period, the Government is expected
to transfer the operating responsibility for water supply systems of at least
30 secondary centers to SNEC. Of these, 13 would be partly financed by the
proposed Bank loan, 11 by the German Government and 6 by the Italian Government.
Water supply systems for other secondary centers with more than 5,000 inhabit-
ants are planned starting about FY82/83, with possible financial assistance
from the Belgian and Danish Governments.
Debt and Investment Limitation Covenants
6.11      The debt limitation covenant of the previous Loan Agreement, provid-
ing for net revenues to cover maximum future debt service requirements 1.5
times, has been maintained. During negotiations, agreement was reached to
modify the investment limitation covenant (old Section 5.08) as follows:
(i) Section 5.08 (b), which imposed limitations on annual investments in
excess of $500,000 after project completion, was eliminated and (ii) the
threshold for capital investments other than the project was raised from
$250,000 to $1,000,000 per annum (Section 5.08 (a)). Agreement was also
reached that SNEC will not undertake investments in excess of that amount
unless tha Government and the bank have reached an understanding on such
investments.
Financing Plan
6.12      The sector's financing plan for the project implementation period
FY79-84 is shown in Table 6.1. Total funds requirements of FCFA 47.5 billion



- 46 -
(US$215.9 million) include capital expenditures of FCFA 10.4 billion for
the proposed project; FCFA 12.7 billion for other centers to be transferred
to SNEC; FCFA 20.1 billion for extensions, improvements and connections,
and for about FCFA 4.3 billion in working capital increases. SNEC does not
capitalize interest during construction.
6.13      During the project period FY79-84, SNEC's net internal cash genera-
tion would finance 37% of total sector requirements, borrowings 40% and
Government and consumer contributions 23%. The terms of the proposed Bank
loan would be 7.9% interest and a final maturity of 20 years, including a
5-year grace period, while those of the CDC loan would be 8.5% interest and
20 years, including 3 years of grace. Borrowing terms for the 1975 KfW loan
are 2% over 30 years, including 10 years of grace; the same terms have been
assumed for the proposed supplementary KfW loan. Future borrowings have been
assumed to have an 8% interest rate over 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
Government contributions are either budgeted for (FY79) or represent firm
commitments from the Central Government. Consumer contributions are equal to
the estimated cost of connections and extensions to be made.

Dividends
6.14       SNEC last declared cash dividends of CFAF 12.5 million over FYs 73
and 77. With the recent doubling of share capital (para. 5.04), dividends
could go up to CFAF 25 million per annum (5% of share capital). As most of
the dividends would go to the Government understanding was reached with
the Government that it will reinvest into the urban water supply sector any
cash dividends received during the project implementation period.
Taxes
6.15      SNEC is subject to a variety of taxes.  The major sales taxes are
a 3.1% tax on works performed by SNEC for consumers and a 9.7% tax on works
done by contractors for SNEC. Water sales are tax exempt. Under the exist-
ing tax regime, SNEC is in principle also subject to a 30% tax on net income.
However, it does not have to pay this tax as long as net income is com-
pletely reinvested. The existing tax regime, dating from 1955, will expire on
December 31, 1979. Following negotiations, however, the Government extended a
new preferential tax regime to SNEC.
Future Financial Performance
6.16      The sector's projected Income Statements are shown in Annex 6.1.
With appropriate tariff increases, SNEC is expected to operate profitably and
achieve annual rates of return on the current value of average total net fixed
assets in operation of about 4.5% in FY80 and in excess of 5% in FY81 and
thereafter. The rate of return calculation has been modified slightly com-
pared to Section 5.07 of the previous Loan Agreement, namely: (i) connections
and extensions financed by consumers are included in the asset base; these
amount to less than 10% of total assets and, in fact, become SNEC's property
after five years; and (ii) the asset base is the current value of average net
fixed assets in operation, instead of the amount at the beginning of the
fiscal year. During negotiations, the Government and SNEC agreed that tariffs
will be increased as necessary to obtain rates of return (after taxes) on the
current value of average net fixed assets in operation of at least 4% in FY80,
5% in FY's 81-83, 6% in FY84, and 7% in the years thereafter. In achieving
this covenant SNEC would finance a high (37%) percentage of sector investment
requirements through internal cash generation (para 6.13). As assets are
expected to be put into service quite gradually and SNEC's operating ratio is
forecast to improve from 90 in FY79 to 74 in FY84 (para. 6.18), the rate of
return covenant would not result in sudden large tariff increases. The
average price per m of water sold is forecast to increase by about 12% each
year, which would keep tariffs approximately constant in real terms.  The
average tariff would increase from about FCFA 115/m  at present to FCFA 205/mi
in FY84.
6.17      Projected Funds Flow Statements and Balance Sheets are shown in
Annexes 6.2 and 6.3. A summary of the key financial indicators for the
projection period follows below:

6.18      The forecasts show that the current value of average net fixed
assets would increase at an average annual rate of about 25% through FY84,
assuming an annual asset revaluation of 10%. Debt as a percent of debt and
equity would increase from 21 in FY79 to 27 in FY84. This relatively low
percentage is primarily due to asset revaluation and the incorporation of
assets financed by Government and consumers into SNEC's balance sheets.
The current ratio would decrease slightly from 2.7 to 2.5. The annual debt
service coverage ratio would increase from 2.2 to 4.6. The operating ratio
would improve pari passu with the rate of return and decrease from 90 to 74.
Assuming that tariffs are adjusted as required, SNEC's financial position
would be satisfactory throughout the period.
VII. SUMMARY, AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      At present only 55% of the population of Douala and Yaounde is
served, while the 11 project secondary centers have unrealiable service and
the two remaining centers none at all. Under the proposed project, over one
million people would acquire some form of access to reliable and potable water
supply, including over 400,000 of the urban poor target group in Douala and
Yaounde alone. SNEC, the national water supply company, would be considerably
strengthened in terms of organization, staff and financial performance as a
result of the proposed project. The water supply, sewerage/drainage and urban
studies are the first steps of a long-term program to provide the organization
and infrastructure required for orderly expansion of the two major growth
centers, Douala and Yaounde.
Project Risks
7.02      There are no significant technical risks associated with the proposed
project. Of concern are the need for training of Cameroonian personnel and



- 50 -
possible delays in project implementation. Training assistance provided
under the project will be successful to the extent that it has the committment
of SNEC's management. SNEC's top management is competent and well motivated.
During project preparation the Government agreed that SNEC would implement
the project. Project implementation is expected to remain on schedule as long
as SNEC is not subject to undue bureaucratic delays by the Government depart-
ments with supervisory authority over SNEC. The maximization of the project
benefits is also dependent on how quickly a public health education program
can be mounted. Motivation for the execution of a long-term health education
program has to be high to be successful, as such a program is expensive and
results are only apparent after a considerable time. Medical personnel
associated with public health education programs have in general the tendency
to adopt the methods of curative medicine. However there is interest among
some individuals in the Ministry of Health to adopting the proposed approach.
Agreements        Reached
7.03      During negotiations, it was agreed that:
A.   The Government will:
(i)  cause the Ministry of Health to implement the recom-
mendations of the study on health education (para. 4.03);
(ii)  review SNEC's concession contracts (para. 5.06);
(iii) request adequate budget allocations for water consumption
and settle water bills within three months after billing
(para. 5.17);
(iv)  cause the municipalities to settle their water bills
within three months of billing (para. 5.17);
(v)  settle the take over cost of 20 systems by June 30,
1981 (para. 5.18);
(vi)  modify SNEC's concession contract to include tariff
adjustments to be based on annual rate of return and
cash flow requirements (para. 6.09);
(vii) reinvest in the sector any cash dividends received
(para. 6.14); and that
(viii) allow SNEC to increase tariffs as necessary to achieve
the agreed rate of return (para. 6.16).
B.   SNEC will:
(i)  hire consultants for construction supervision (para. 3.09);
(ii)  monitor the technical, financial, administrative and
training achievements (para. 3.13);



- 51 -
(iii)  reduce delays in billing (para. 5.10);
(iv)  carry all three kinds of assets on its balance sheets
(para. 5.22);
(v)  abolish the Amortissement de Caducite (para. 5.22);
(vi)  create an internal auditing unit (para. 5.23);
(vii)  continue to employ qualified external auditors (para.
5.24);
(viii)  prepare annually forecast financial statements over
a 5-year period to test the rate of return covenant
(para. 5.25);
(ix)  continue to adhere to the debt limitation covenant
of the previous loan (para. 6.11);
(x)  not proceed with additional projects costing over US$1
million annually unless the Government and the Bank
have reached an understanding on such an investment
(para. 6.11); and
(xi)  obtain rates of return of at least 4% in FY80, 5%
during FY's 81-83, 6% in FY84, and 7% in each fiscal
year thereafter (para. 6.16).
7.04      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan are the signature
of the loan agreement with CDC (para. 3.06) and the subsidiary loan agreement
with SNEC.
Recommendations
7.05      Subject to the above conditions, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$21.0 million at the current rates of interest and commitment fees
to be repaid over 20 years including a 5-year grace period.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR HYGIENE EDUCATION IDENTIFICATION STUDY
The identification study financed under the project would:
(i)    Problem practices
review the project population's practices of water collection,
transportation, storage, use and disposal; human waste or solid
waste disposal and collection practices, and other practices
relating to food preparation, house-cleaning, domestic animal
management, etc.
(ii)   Reasons for problem practices
review population beliefs, values, customs, history, and their
resource constraints, to try to explain the reason for their
problem practices, thereby also laying a basis for both feasi-
bility analysis and for later design of the content of hygiene
education;
(iii) Hygiene education for adults
review the focus, timing, outreach, and effectiveness of major
existing or planned activities of non-formal adult hygiene
education programs of the Ministry of Health and other public
or private agencies (e.g. Ministry of Education, community
development organizations, religious organizations, and
education radio programs);
(iv)   Hygiene education for children
review theoretical and practical teaching about health and
hygiene within the school system in the project areas (par-
ticularly Primary Schools), with attention not only to the
content of the curriculum as officially defined, but also
what is actually taught in the classroom and demonstrated by
practical example of teachers and school sanitation facilities;
(v)    Effect of new service levels
predict the extent to which the undesirable health consequences
of problem practices will be mitigated or exacerbated by the
improvements in distribution system with particular attention
to the role which may be played by yard connections;



- 55 -
ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
(vi)   Feasible approaches
evaluate main alternative approaches within the hygiene
education area for dealing with the problems, indicating
*                  any which have been tried or are presently being tried
within the country, and need to be assessed in terms of
their effectiveness, together with a rough estimation of
costs (capital and operating) for each alternative; and
(vii) identify any major constraints or other factors likely to
have an impact on the successful design or implementation
of such components, with particular attention to the appro-
priate institutional arrangement for the execution of a
project-coordinated hygiene education campaign.
