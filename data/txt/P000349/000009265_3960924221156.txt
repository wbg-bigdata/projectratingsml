PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Water
Supply Project in Cameroon, for which Loan 1753-CM in the amount of US$21 million
was approved on September 6, 1979.   The loan closinig date was extended by
slightly over two years to September 30, 1986. It was fully disbursed and the
last disbursement was on November 5, 1986.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Occidental and Central Africa Department of the Africa Regional Office based on
the Staff Appraisal Report, supervision reports, legal documents, project
correspondence files and other documents relevant to the project.
Following standard procedures, OED sent ccpies of the draft PCR to
the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

PROJECT CCNPLRTIOI REPOBT
EVALUhLTIOE ,SUIRY
1.        The project was designed to meet the recomwndations of a sector study
carried out in 1974 under a Bank/WHO Cooperative program whose objective was to
better define the sector goals under the Fourth (1976-1981) and the Fifth
(1981-86) 5-Year plans. The major goal under these plans was to accelerate
creation of water supply systems in major urban centers. In this context, the
project's objective was to provide water systems in 13 secondary centers, extend
the distribution systems in Douala and Yaounde, the two largest cities, and
strengthen the Cameroon water sector organization, particularly the daily
management and operation of SNEC, the urban water utility. The total cost of the
project was estimated at $51.4 H, of which IBRD would finance $21 Ii and CDC would
cofinnce UKl6.75 M ($lS M equivalent).
2.        The physical scope of the project was enlarged during project
implementation to include water systems in three more secondary centers. All the
physical components for the centers ware executed under the project. In Douala
and Yaound6, it was intended in part to rehabilitate and lmprove the treatment
stations.  However, SNEC preferred to extend the plants.  Apart from this
modification, all the physical components were also completed.
3.        The total cost of the project as implemented amounted to $S3.4 X, about
96 percent higher in CPA terms than the appraisal estimate but only 25 percent
higher iL CPA terms than the costs of the revised project (i.e., inclusive of
three more secondary centers).  The cost overrun was easily absorbed by the
higher average exchange rate prevailing during the course of the project (415 CFA
instead of 220 CFA/US$ at appraisal).
4.        Procurement differences between Cameroon and the Bank over particularly
the 16 center contract caused an 18 month delay.   Together with a late
effectiveness of 18 months, altogether a three-year delay affected the timely
completion of the project.
5.        The poor financial performance of SNEC is attributed to much delayed
and few tariff increases (one in 1982 and another in 1986) and excessive arrears
from both Government and private consumers. The late arrival of the financial
advisor (in 1986) did not help SNEC in addressing the poor financial situation
earlier.
6.        The major covenants that were not met are (a) the review of concession
agreements between the Borrower and SNEC; (b) settlement of bills relating to the
Borrower's department and services within three months; (c) annual adjustment of
tariffs; (d) generation of rates of return on fixed assets as specified; and
(e) the preparation of five-year financial forecasts.



- vi -
7.        The overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is now
estimated at five percent, to be compared with a seven percent rate expected at
appraisal.   On a sub-project basis, ERRs achieved in the individual centers
proved to be more volatile, due to cost overruns and excessively optimistic
consumption forecasts for the secondary centers. As a consequence, the need for
cross-subsidization between the two major cities and the secondary centers has
increased.    The  adoption of appropriate  technologies.  such as  slow sand
filtration plants, will, however, allow to keep operation and maintenance costs
in the smaller towns at a minimum and enhance the sustainability of project
benefits.



REPURLIC OF CAERLON
SECOII WATER SUPP  PROJECT (LOP  1753-CN)
PROJKC.T COHPLEION REOR
I. IDUCIgON
1.01      This report reviews the Second Water Supply Project in Cameroon
(Loan 1753-CM) for which an IBRD Loan of $21.0 M was approved on September 6,
1979 and signed on December 11, 1979. The Project was completed on June 30, 1986
and the Loan closed on September 30, 1986. The Borrower is the Government of
Cameroon with re-lending in the amount of $18.1 M to the Soci6td Nationale des
Eaux du Cameroun (SNEC), the major executing agency and principal beneficiary.
Joint financing was provided in the amount of £6. 75 M ($15. 0 H equivalent) by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC).
1.02      At the time of appraisal, sector organizations and responsibilities
were as follows:
(a)  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Planning  (MINEP)  provided  general
investment guidelines, and sought external financing for investments;
(b)  The Directorate of Energy and Water (DEW) of the Ministry of Hines and
Energy (MINMEN) was in charge of overall planning, design and
construction supervision of new urban watar supply systems, and
operation of small urban water supply systems; it also assumed the
tutelle" of SNEC;
(c)  SNEC was entrusted with planning, design and construction supervision
of extensions and operation of major urban water supply systems: and
(d)  The Directorate of Rural Engineering and Community Development of the
Ministry of Agriculture was responsible for rural water supply.
There has been no major change during project execution in the sector organiza-
tional set-up, except that construction supervision is now mostly entrusted to
SNEC.
1.03      Sector goals under the Government Plan (1976-Zsl) were as follows:
(a)  provide water supply by 1981 to about 70 major urban centers;
(b)  increase water  supply  facilities  in rural areas to cover about
50 percent of the rural population;
(c)  complete studies that would lead to Q'Iplement water systems in smal'l
centers in the suicceeding plan so as to reach a 100 percent service
level target in urban centers by 1986; and
(d)  in the sanitation and drainage sectors, prepare and update studies for
major centers, particularly Douala and Yaoundd, and implement
emergency drainage works in Douala and Yaound6.
At the end of 1985, 50 major urban centers were operational. Another 46 were due
to be comnissioned end of 1986 (at this moment it is not known how many have



- 2 -
actually been comissioned).  By then, about half of the major urban centers
would be equipped with modern water systems. Over a hundred small semi-urban
centers are also equipped with packaged treatment plants. Because of the absence
of cost recovery and poor institutional framework, SNEC has refused to take over
operation of these systems which were implemented by MINMEN. Rural water supply
level still lingers around 20 to 25 percent. DraLiage and sanitation studies
have been carried out, either under Bank financing or the National Budget, and
major drainage work proposed under the IB4D-financed Douala Infrastructure
Project appraised in March 1985 are to be executed.
1.04      Urban water subsector issues identified at appraisal comprised the
following:
(a)  inadequate senior management staffFng, due to hasty elimination of
expatriate personnel, and inadequate tariff levels in the past greatly
impaired SNEC's effectiveness;
(b) to increase service levels, SNEC ought to be entrusted design and
construction supervision responsibilities mostly vested to the
Ministry; and
Ic) DEW suffered from lack of appropriately trained personnel.
SNEC*s management has somewhat improved through injection of better local
qualified staff in the years since appraisal.   Tariffs have been increased
(para. 5.03). Although the organizational responsibilities remained the same on
paper, in1 practice. SNEC now asaumses almost total responsibility for construction
supervision and shares responsibility with LEW for design of major urban systems.
DED still remains understaffed particularly at engineering level.
1.05      SNEC is a public enterprise with ownerehip as follovs:   Soci4t6
Nationale d'Electricite du Camneroun (SONL) }/ (67 percent), Government
(20 percent), Caisse Centrale de CoopEration Economique, France (CCCE)
(11 percent) and municipalities (2 percent). It was created in 1967 and operates
under a concession syster. By 1979, it operated 20 urban centers, including
Yaoundd and Douala, the two largest cities in Cameroon. It is under the tutelle
of MINMEN which must approve tariffs and investment programs. SNEC's Board
comprises 12 members elected by shareholders, eight being Government members, two
from CCCS, one from munic.palities and one from the Economic and Social Council.
There has been no change in SNEC's ownership or status.
1.06      The project's main objective was to provide the major stepping stone
towards achieving 100 percent potable water service for the urban population by
1990, or more specifically under the project:
(a) thirteen secondary centers were to be provided with a reliable potable
water supply to be managed by SNEC;
(b) distribution systems of Douala and Yaound6 were to be extended so that
by 1983, 70 percent of the population would be serviced. with
1/ Government owned 80 percent of SONEL; Government's share in SNEC was
therefore effectively 74 percent.



particular attention to low income areas which covered about
46 percent of the two cities;
(c) the groundwork for an organized sanitation and drainage sector for
Douala and Yaoundd would be laid by carrying out technical and
financial studiess
(d) a pilot public health education project would be initiated to increase
public health awareness and to materialize potential health benefiti
that could be derived from the project; and
(e) the Cameroon water sector organization would be strengthened,
particularly the daily management and operations of the water services
of SNEC.
1.07      The project has been instrumental in part for resolving sector issues
and achieving sector goals. The number of urban water supply systems has more
than doubled with about half constructed by the project. Tariff increases of
around 100 percent were implemented in 1982. but these restored SNEC's financial
situation to a satisfactory level only for PY ending 1982.   Construction
supervision capabilities were developed by SNEC staff. Drainage studies have
also been carried out enabling the identification of major drainage works under
the proposed Douala Infrastructure Project.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin
2.01      The First Water Supply Project (Loan 604-CM) was completed in 1974.
As there was no immediate follow-up to that project, continuity and growth of
sector institutions, and thus generation of funds for expansions in Douala,
Yaound6, and secondary centers was interrupted. Therefore, Government requested
the Bank/WHO Cooperative Program to carry out a Sector Study in 1974 to better
define sector goals under the Fourth (1976-81) and the Fifth (1981-86) 5-Year
Plans.   The identification of the Second Project was both the result of
recommendations of the Sector Study and the continuing sector dialogue with the
Government.
S. Pro1ect Preparation and Appraisal
2.02      The project was prepared jointly by HIIMEN, SNEC and the Bank.  The
feasibility studies of the 13 secondary centers, identified from a priority list
established by the Sector Study, were carried otut by a consultancy firm, and
financed under an IDA Technical Assistance Credit (Credit 673-CM). Studies for
the urgently needed improvements to the Douala and Yaoundd systems were conducted
by an engineer seconded to SNEC by a foreign water supply company.   Bank
consultants made in-depth assessments of the Douala and Yaoundd treatment plant
facilities and urban poverty aspects.
2.03      Appraisal of the project took place in September/October 1978.  The
components appraised remained essertially the same as identified and prepared.
However, although the Bank consultant who reviewed the treatment facilities in
Douala and Yaound6 recommended that rehabilitation would increase production to



- 4 -
desired levels and would be the least cost solution, SNEC preferred to build new
facilities rather than optimize existing ones.
2.04      The project as appraised was costed at $51.4 M, with a foreign
component of $36.0 M. (A detailed project description is at Annex I.) This cost
included the rehabilitation of the Douala treatment plant as it was recommended
by the consultants. It became, however, already apparent during appraisal that
SNEC/Government preferred an extension rather than a rehabilitation for the
treatment plant. This, the only major technical issue, was never really resolved
until implementation of the project (para. 3.06).
C. Negotiations
2.05      Started on May 4, 1979, with representatives  from both SNEC and
Government, it soon became apparent that two issues, hitherto thought manageable,
became major stumbling blocks and caused negotiations to be suspended a week
later on May 10, 1979:
(a) The delegation reserved Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement and
the draft letter referring to this Section, which requires Government
to revise the current concession contracts with SNEC, and provide that
SNEC and the Government are responsible for providing all the urban
population with reliable and potable water by 1990, with particular
emphasis on low income populations who would be provided with
standpipes and social house connections.
(b) Another important reservation was made by the delegation on Sec-
tion 4.03(b) (i) of the Loan Agreement, whereby it is required for the
Government to guarantee the future timely payment of municipal
arrears.   (Without this, the financial viability of SNEC would be
compromised.)
2.06      Between July 1-5,  1979, negotiations were completed by telex and
issue (ii) was resolved by Government agreeing to pay arrears beyond three
months' billing.  No mention could, however, be found in the files about the
Cameroonian's position regarding issue (i). The Loan Agreement on the other hand
contains a watered down consultation clause about the subject (Sec-
tion 4.03(b) (ii)).    Section 4.02 was  incorporated  in the  Loan Agreement
unchanged.    An  additional  point  that Government  brought  up  in the past
negotiation correspondence was its desire to onlend to SNEC at Bank terms without
the envisaged two percent spread.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and Covenants
3.01      On March 11, 1980, the effectiveness date was postponed for the first
time as Government/SNEC had not yet provided the Subsidiary Loan Agreement and
the Legal Opinion.   It took four more three-month extensions until these
documents were finally produced and the project became effective on May 12, 1981,
18 months after signing and 21 months after Board approval of the Loan.



3.02      The L/A and P/A had a combined total of 19 specific covenants besides
the standard ones for this type of project, pertaining mostly to financial
targets and review of concession contracts. A complete description is given at
Annex III. The borrower and beneficiaries have performed poorly in meeting the
agreed-upon goals and targets. The most important ones that were never really
met are:
(a)  review by June 30, 1980, or such other date as may be jointly agreed
upon, existing concession agreements between the Borrowers and SNEC
(Section 4.02, LIA);
(b)  Borrower shall cause its departments and services to pay to SNEC,
within not more than three months after billing, all charges for water
consumption (Section 4.03);
(c)  adjust annually water tariffs to achieve financial targets  (Sec-
tion 4.03 b. LIA);
(d)  SNEC undertakes to manage its finances in such a way as to generate a
rate of return on fixed assets of at least five percent until June 30,
1983, six percent for FY84, and seven percent thereafter (Sec-
tion 4.04 P/A); and
(e)  SNEC prepares and submits to the Bank annually,  not later than
June 30, a five-year financial forecast (Section 4.07 P/A).
3.03      It is important to realize that covenants (a) and (b) already created
a bottleneck during negotiations (para. 2.05) and it can be assumed safely, that
Government merely yielded during the post-negotiation telex exchange in order to
get the project to the Board, fully aware that both covenants were unrealistic
in the Cameroonian context. Indeed, discussions with the Bank about simplifying
concession contracts never got underway. Today, the contracts are essentially
unchanged. Similarly, arrears on account of public services and enterprises were
never lower than at least five months' billing:

3.04      Moreover, as SNEC took over billing of private consumers from SONEL in
1983-85, arrears started to augment as customers realized that SNEC does not
possess the necessary infrastructure nor the political authority to cut off
services. These arrears, combined with Government's slow response in adjusting
tariffs, contributed principally to SNEC's negative results over the years under
the review. In addition, the lack of timely tariff adji' tments caused SNEC to



- 6 -
never meet the rate of return targets set under PIA Section 4.04 (see
para. 3.02(d)).
3.05      In addition to the unexpected problems created by inadequate tariff
revisions, SNEC experienced other problems in meeting covenants. The rate of
return calculation proved elusive, as SNEC lacked -- and continues to lack -- the
sophisticated accounting techniques for the revaluation of assets which are
clearly beyond the scope of SNEC staff. Moreover, although a cost accounting
system has been established, it is not sufficiently refined to provide data for
each of the 16 centers, Yaoundd and Douala so as to analyze costs and benefits.
Last but not least, the five-year financial forecast required annually has been
prepared but once during project implementation (Section 4.07 PIA). This can
also be attributed to lack of skilled, experienced personnel. Moreover, in
fairness to SNEC, it has to be said that not all data necessary to prepare a
meaningful projection has been forthcoming from Government as it continued to
contract bilateral and multilateral aid to finance water supply systems in
secondary centers without asking questions about sustainability. This problem
is discussed in more detail in para. 5.02 (c).
B. Revisions
3.06      Owing to the delay in effectiveness and over procurement issues.
project costs were revised upwards to CFAF 17.7 billion from CFAF 11.3 billion
at appraisal. This cost revision was done during a May 1981 supervision and the
major contributing elements, besides inflation, were the inclusion of four
additional secondary centers at Batibo, Fundong, Mundenba and Nguti. 2/ These
centers were added to the project at the request of Government on the clear
understanding that any surplus costs would have to be paid by Government.
However, given the strong appreciation of the US$ over the implementation period,
additional costs were easily absorbed by the Loan. Towards the end of the major
contract disbursement period, in November 1985, it became actually necessary to
increase civil works and equipment disbursement percentages to 90 percent from
38 percent in order to make full use of loan proceeds. This rise was justified
since SNEC's own cash generation fell short of projections and, thus, also its
contribution to project cost.
C. Project Implementation Schedule
3.07      Overall, the execution of the physical components suffered a three-year
initial delay, partly because of late effectiveness (para. 3.01) and partly
because of procurement differences  (para. 3.08).   On the other hand,  the
contractor executed these components in reasonable time despite difficult
logistic conditions which impeded mobilization and start-up particularly in the
sixteen centers. Generally, all physical components have been completed within
previously planned execution periods.
D. Procurement
3.08      Adherence to Bank procurement guidelines required strenuous effort and
perseverance on the part of Bank staff because of a multitude of inadequacies
relating to advertising, incorporation of Bank comments in final tender
documents, bid evaluation criteria, bid opening and bid evaluation.  The fact
21   Of the new total 17, one center was eventually dropped.



-7-
that the Direction Centrale des March4s (DCM) had the authority and the
responsibility to intervene and review contract processing compounded the
problem. The DCM consistently referred to Cameroonian regulations regardless of
the requirements of the Loan Agreement and Bank guidelines.
3.09      Contract award for the 16 center components, however, became the major
issue of procurement differences between Cameroon and the Bank, that eventually
caused an 18-month implementation delay. The bid evaluation criteria set out in
the tender documents were unclear.  Despite Bank requests for modifications,
changes were not always made. Subsequently, bid evaluation reports prepared by
SNEC and DCM did not propose any contract award.  SNEC's view was that the lowest
bidder did not provide in its bid a treatment process that guaranteed acceptable
water quality. The Cameroonians then decided to re-bid on their understanding
that the bidders could alter their unit prices. The Bank insisted on reviewing
all original bids and came to the conclusion that the lowest evaluated bid was
indeed a responsive bid. The Bank objected to the re-bidding and insisted that
the contract be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder (original bid).   The
treatment equipment percentage cost was small compared to the overall cost and
as there was a substantial difference between the lowest and second lowest bids,
the Bank advised that negotiations be carried out in good faith with the lowest
bidder and that SNEC could therefore ensure during negotiations alternative
satisfactory treatment processes. The resolution of this issue took a long time
after various exchanges but Cameroon finally agreed with the Bank's position.
E. Proiect Costs and Disbursements
3.10      A detailed comparison of project costs at appraisal compared with those
at completion is at Annex II. These costs can be summarized as follows:

/b This Includes same 2,600 million CfA of additional works directly negotiated between MINMEN
and the contractor without SNEC's involvement. The Bank did not participate In the financing
of these works.
3.11      Owing to a substantial  revision in project  scope,  comparison of
completion costs to appraisal costs is not relevant. Completion costs should be
compared with costs of revised project scope. Cost overrun calculated on this
basis is, consequently, approximately 25 percent.



- 8 -
3.12      A comparative disbursement  schedule  is at Annex IV.   Given the
18 months' delay in effectiveness as well as the initial procurement problems,
actual disbursements lagged substantially behind Appraisal estimates. Thus, the
first major disbursement of some $5 H equivalent did not take place until year
five (1984) after Board approval. Start-up expenditures were financed out of
SNEC's cash generation as follows:
Year Ending June 30:
1979     1980      1981     1982      1983
CFAf Million        325      51.       438      1639     2472
3.13      CDC's co-financing share of £6.75 M corresponding to $15 H equivalent
at appraisal was disbursed in two lump sum payments during the earlier years of
project implementation. Using the average exchange rate of the IBRD Loan, CDC's
share only amounted to approximately $9.4 M due to a smaller appreciation
exchange rate of the £ sterling. This shortfall contributed in part towards the
increase in the Bank's disbursement percentage from 38 to 90 towards the end of
the project in November 1985 (para. 3.06).
F. Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.14      The distribution systems of the Douala and Yaounde components were
designed and their construction supervised by the same consultants. SNEC was
generally satisfied with their performance. The treatment plant of Douala was
planned to be rehabilitated, following the recommendation of a Bank consultant
(para. 2.02).   However,  SNEC preferred to carry out an extension and thus
financing for this component was excluded from the IBRD Loan. Final design of
the 16 center component was contracted out by HINMEN and was carried out by a
different consultant other than the ones who did the feasibility studies. SNEC
was not happy about the change in consultant.   Eventually,  supervision of
construction was assigned to a project. coordinator recruit3d from a third
consulting firm, backed by a few engineers from the consultants who did the
feasibility studies and Cameroonian site engineers posted on each construction
site. Several design changes had to be undertaken during construction, caused
partly by unforeseen terrain conditions, interference from the local inhabitants
in some cases and by less than sufficient detailed design contributed by the
change in consultant.
3.15      SNEC was satisfied with contractor performance on the Douala and
Yaound4 components. On the sixteenth center component, mobilization and start-up
problems arose which had a direct impact on construction quality.   The wide
geographical spread of the construction sites, together with difficult logistic
conditions required extensive efforts on the part of the contractor.  The fact
that the contractor was sufficiently backed up with a considerable pool of
manpower and equipment resources enabled the contractor to overcome the initial
problems within reasonable time and construction improved to a satisfactory level
until completion.



IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Water Produced and Sold
4.01      The following table indicates that both water production and water
billed have increased on average about 8.5 percent per year from FY78 to PY85 in
comparison to 13.5 percent per year forecast at appraisal.

Unaccounted for water on average was satisfactory throughout, with the exception
of FY84 when billing responsibilities were being transferred from SONEL (The
Cameroon Electric Company) to SNEC.   Forecast at appraisal was more or less
correct.
B. Metered Connections
4.02      The average percent annual increase in metered connections has been
quite impressive (13.5 percent) although not as much as that forecast at
appraisal (16 percent).

C.  Operation and Maintenance and Productivity
4.03      In general, quality of operation and maintenance level of SNEC is
satisfactory. The total number of centers operated by SNEC has increased more
or less as forecast at appraisal.   Productivity as measured by number of
connections/staff has, however, fallen wal1 below expectations (see table below),
a decrease from 57 to 43 compared to an increase from 57 to 101, forecast at
appraisal.

4.04      A positive aspect of the project as regards operation and maintenance
has been the execution of slow sand filtration plants in 8 of the 16 secondary
centers.  As there has been a general reluctance and unfamiliarity with this
appropriate technology for surface water treatment, it is hoped that their
existence in Cameroon would convince other Western African countries of their
suitability to minimize operation and maintenance constraints, particularly in
secondary centers.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      SNEC's Finances.   Although SNEC complied with the covenant  (P/A
section 4.01 (a)), statements as per Annex V are not sufficiently representative
of the financial position to permit a test of the financial covenants
(para. 3.02). Principal reasons for that aret
(a) Since 1981/82, Audit Reports have consistently mentioned that
concession assets operated by SNEC are not properly reflected in the
Balance Sheets. The 1984/85 Audit advances, for the first time, the
figure of CFAF 9.0 billion ($28.7 M) as an estimate of such assets
that are not accounted for.
(b) Exchange rate adjustments due to the US dollar and £ Sterling
fluctuations are accounted for on the total outstanding U.S./fixed
assets  in 1985,  rather than stretched over payment years.   The
Auditors indicate that assets are therefore over-valued by some
CFAF 200 million ($0.6 M).
(c) Inventory control or lack thereof, a continued source of criticism on
the part of the Auditors, renders SNEC's total value of stocks too
high by some CFAF 60 million ($0.2 M) at June 30, 1985.
5.02      Nevertheless, an attempt to calculate the rate of return on average net
fixed assets in operation during FYs ending 80 through 85 yielded the following
results:



- 11 E
Rat. of Return (U) on Average Value of Net Fixed Assets
Yesr:  9/86   80/81   81/82   82/88   88/84    8/
Appraisal Estimate            4.7      4.8     6.8      6.1     6.6       6.8
Actual                        1.0      0.1     2.4      3.1    -2.8      -0.2
This comparison clearly demonstrates that targets were never met.  Other reasons
for the shortfalls were:
(a)  Revenues from water sales rose substantially less than anticipated
during appraisal with 1984/85 actual figures only reaching 66 percent
of estimates.   The adverse result was compounded by the fact that
operating, as well as non-operating, costs rose faster than estimated
and by 1984/85 exceeded estimates by CFAF 1.9 billion ($6 M) or
15 percent. This indeed resulted in a net loss of CFAF 134 million
($0.4 M) against a forecasted net income of CFAF 3.9 billion
($12.5 M).
(b) Through no fault of its own, SNEC was forced to finance a considerable
amount of public arrears (para. 3.03) which, by 1985 and 1986, reached
CFAF 3.7 billion ($11.8 M) and CFAF 7.5 billion ($23.9 M), respec-
tively. It did so mostly through revolving short-term line of credits
with  local banks.   Given the prevailing high interest rates on
short-term bank overdrafts of 18 percent in 1986, this practice
imposed an unusually heavy interest charge of some CFAF 650 million
($2.1 M) on its income statement.
(c) Last but not least, owing to SNEC's parent Ministry's commissioning of
bilaterally financed urban water schemes in numerous small towns
without the required customer base to render the schemes financially
viable, SNEC's maintenance costs rose disproportionately to revenues.
5.03      Equally devastating proved Government's reluctance to annually adjust
tariffs in line with prevailing inflation (para. 3.02 (c)).  Indeed, the only
tariff adjustment during project implementation took place in October 1982, when
it was finally decided to raise average tariffs from CFAF 120, to 220/m9.
Commensurate with Government's informal policy to freeze tariffs for four years,
the latest tariff adjustment occurred in October 1986, to CFAF 242/mn3, with yet
another freeze in effect until 1990.  Meanwhile, inflation alone should have
driven up tariffs by some 70 percent over the period under review.   The
Commercial Department undertook a study in early 1986 to determine tariffs
required to cover operating costs, including debt service for 1985. The result
suggested an average tariff of FCFA 420/r3 ($1.34/r3) nationwide; variations
ranged from a low of FCFA 202/m3 in Yaounde with a high of FCFA 2304/mi  ($7.34)
in Ebolowa (South Province).
5.04      This uneven performance of SNEC per population center led to annual
injections of capital on the part of Government, the majority shareholder, as
follows:

/I Shown as Subventions in tho financial statemnts; was, however, used to
finance capital expenditures.
These capital flows were required to maintain an acceptable debt/equity ratio
over the years under review as SNEC increasingly financed its operations by
short- and long-term credits. By financing watcr supply installations through
outright subventions which appeared in SNEC's net worth, Government obviously
took care of Section 4.06 a) of the Loan Agreement.   There is no doubt that
SNEC's managerial and financial capacity sorely lags its accumulation of
technically sophisticated installations nationwide; what needs, therefore, an
answer, is: how much longer is Government going to be in a position to inject
sufficient capital to sustain SNEC's operations at an acceptable level? It is
safe to conclude the chapter by stating that the project as conceived neglected
to sufficiently address the institutional side of SNEC thereby leaving
installations which cannot be sustained by operating cash generation.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND STAFFING
6.01      An improvement program was recommended at appraisal to improve SNEC's
organization and management. More specifically, changes recommended were that:
(a) operating regions would be increased from three to four with greater
responsibilities given to regional managers recruited from SNEC rather
than from SONEL's staff;
(b) SNEC would create its own Commercial Department and discontinue using
SONEL for billing and collection services;
(c) SNEC would revise its accounting systems and procedures;
(d) an internal audit unit would be created; and
(e) annual five-year forecasts of its financial status would be prepared.
Operating regions have been increased to four with greater responsibility given
to SNEC's regional managers. SNEC has taken over totally billing and collection
services from SONEL. While billing has improved, collection on the other hand
has deteriorated (see para. 3.03). Its accounting systems and procedures remain
inadequate and its new audit unit not performing satisfactorily (see para. 5.07).
Annual five-year forecasts have not been prepared on a regular basis (see
para. 3.02).
6.02      Para. 4.03 stated the substantial increase in personnel, in fact more
than double the appraisal forecast (see table below). Large numbers of staff
were particularly recruited in the semi-skilled and unskilled categories. There



-13 -
is no sign of abatement in the continuing recruitment process. Such overstaffing
will no doubt have an adverse effect on overall operational costs.

6.03      The implementation of the Management Improvement Program required that
SNEC would be reinforced by a team of technical assistants in operations, in
accounting, commercial activities and training. At the time of appraisal, it was
considered that the departure of expatriates which formed part of an overall
Cameroonisation program was too hasty.   Indeed,  their number decreased but
however picked up again as the need to assist SNEC in its ever increasing
activities became necessary as shown by the table below.

The financial advisor was only recruited in 1986 much later than necessary as
evidenced by the poor financial performance of SNEC (see para. 5.01).  Technical
operations however were well backed up throughout the project implementation
period.
6.04      Very little training was carried out between 1979-82.  Indeed, during
that period, only 11 technicians and 3 administrative officers followed training
courses. However, between 1983-86, an intensive training program was put into
effect following the arrival of the training officer, a total of 396 staff
followed a training course, out of which there were 29 technicians, 36 adminis-
trative officers, 211 skilled and semi-skilled personnel and 120 junior
administrative staff.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
7.01      Project objectives were largely met in terms of completed works. Piped
water systems were substantially expanded in five secondary centers. Inadequate
water systems previously operated by MINMEN were fully rehabilitated and expanded
and new systems were installed, thus providing safe water in 11 other centers.
The technical option retained will also warrant low-cost and sustainable
operation and maintenance of the production facilities in the smaller centers
(para. 4.04).   In addition, secondary and tertiary distribution networks and
storage capacities were increased by 16 percent in Douala and Yaound4.
7.02      Studies contemplated within the Project were only partially carried
out.   The drainage studies allowed to identify the major works required to
eliminate acute flooding problems in Douala. The Hygiene Education identifica-
tion study which would have provided guidelines for a health education pilot
project was not launched, due to a continuous lack of interest on the part of the
Health Ministry.
Service Levels
7.03      It is estimated that 220,000 additional people have benefitted from the
project, which is substantially lower than the 700,000 expected at appraisal.
A 100 percent service level objective has been achieved in secondary centers, but
service levels in Douala and Yaounde amount, respectively, to 52 percent and
49 percent compared to SAR estimates of 75 percent. SAR forecasts were based on
(a) the implementation of a shared yard connection program, allowing to install
11,000 yard connections serving on average 30 people; and (b) a dramatic increase
in the number of standpipes, particularly in low-income areas. To that effect,
provisions were included in the L/A (a) to cause Government and SNEC to revise
existing concession contracts in order to incorporate obligations to ensure a
full coverage of urban areas by water service (Section 4.02(a)); and (b) to
ensure timely payments of water bills by municipalities for standpipe consumption
(Section 4.03(a)).
7.04      As  stated in para. 3.03,  both covenants were unrealistic  in the
Cameroonian context and were never met. Government was reluctant to authorize
tariff increases which would have allowed SNEC to expand the service and SNEC
proved to be lukewarm in promoting yard connections.   A pilot program was
initiated in 1986 in secondary centers but is devoted to conventional connections
and has yet to be extended to the major cities.   Only 121 standpipes were
installed in Yaounde and Douala during the project (vs. 390 forecast in the SAR),
and the total number of standpipes in operation continued to decrease along the
trend observed before. As a result and although SNEC's performance in installing
private connections has been satisfactory (para. 4.02), the present service
levels in Douala and Yaounde are almost identical to those prevailing in 1978.
(A detailed comparison of SAR and actual estimates is provided in Annex 6-1.)
7.05      It appears that the major constraint to the development of water
service has been the rapid growth of slums and squatter areas in Douala and
Yaounde.   However, the project allowed to finance a minimum level of urban
planning and to identify and prepare an urban project aiming at the restructuring
and provision of basic infrastructure services, including water supply in low



- 15 -
income areas. This project is currently ongoing in Douala and would provide a
comprehensive solution to an issue which proved to be beyond the capabilities of
the water utility alone.
Rates of Return
7.06       The  economic  rate  of  return  (ERR)  of  each  sub-project has  been
calculated using incremental revenue der-ived from water sales as a p!rC'  of
benefits.  Detailed calculations are prov..ded in Annex 6-2.  A comparison of ERR
estimates in the SAR and after project completion is given in the following
table.

/b Centers added to the project after the appraisal stage
7.07       The overall ERR of the project is now estimated at 5 percent which
compares  with  the  7 percent  ERR  contemplated  in  the  SAR.    However,  on  a
sub-project basis, ERRs achieved in the individual centers proved to be more
volatile. Contrary to SAR estimates, the Yaounde sub-project is now forecast to
be more profitable than the Douala sub-project, which reflects lower unit costs
of network expansion in the former city. In the secondary centers, results have



- 16 -
been modified for two major reasons.  First, capital costs were often higher than
expected in a number of centers. Actual expenditures were, for instance, three
times as high as forecast in the SAR in Bali, Jakiri, Mbengwi, and Tombel. In
addition, although the overall present consumption is close to SAR estimates for
the whole of the secondary centers, demand forecasts, particularly in terms of
service connections, failed to materialize in Bafang, Njinikom and Nkambe. The
four towns added to the project generate negative ERRs, which is attributable to
the small size of the centers, each of them regrouping less than 5,000 inhab-
itants.
Average Incremental Costs
7.08      The Average Incremental Cost (AIC) is normally considered as a proxy
for long range marginal cost (LRMC).  Due to the limited scope of the works
executed in Douala and Yaoundd, which were exclusively devoted to distribution
and storage facilities, AICs have not been calculated for those cities.
Individual AICs of the secondary centers have been reestimated and are given in
para. 7.06. Expressed in mid-1978 interior prices, AIC is on average 50 percent
higher than forecast in the SAR, with more substantial variations in Bafang,
Mamfe, Tombel, Mbengwi, Njinikom and Nkambe. AIC values are highly correlated
to the size of the centers. AIC in the range of CFAF 200 to 250/rn are observed
in the towns regrouping more than 15,000 people, with the noticeable exception
of Bafang while the smallest centers are over the CFAF 500/r3 threshold,
equivalent to CFAF 1,000l/rn in 1986 prices.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE, CONCLUSiON AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      Differences on procuremnent between Cameroon and the Bank greatly
affected the  early years  of project  implementation.    The Bank  correctly
maintained a firm position throughout in order to adequately adhere to the Loan
Agreement and Bank guidelines.   On the Douala and Yaound6 components,  this
position was undermined by the mere fact that Cameroon having then a fairly sound
financial footing decided to finance themselves the subcomponents whenever they
disagreed with the Bank.
8.02      Cost overruns particulirly on the sixteen center component were
substantial.   Appraisal estimates were, on the one hand, overly optimistic.
Delays in start-up, difficult terrain conditions, intervention of DEW for
consultant recruitment and for contract negotiation for additional works,
substantial redesigning and interference of local inhabitants all contributed
also to the overruns.
8.03      In correctly advising the Canteroonians on the introduction of slow sand
filtration plants, the Bank has contributed in a significant way in encouraging
the use of suitable  technology.   Most West African countries  are either
unfamiliar or reluctant to utilize this technology.   It is hoped that their
existence in Cameroon will convince other West African countries of their
suitability to minimize operation and maintenance constraints, particularly for
secondary centers.
8.04      On average there were two supervision missions per year. Most missions
consisted of three staff.  Over the seven year supervision period, there have
been four different engineers, four different financial analysts, and two



- 17 -
different  economists.   Greater continuity,  particularly  for the financial
analysts (three changes during 1984-86) might have enabled better handling of
financial problems during ii'plementation. It can be spe lated with the benefit
of hindsight that more intensive financial supervision during the latter years
of implementation might hat;e resulted in correcting some of the problems on the
financial perfornwqnce of SNEC,, but no conclusion on this aspect would be
objectively supportable.
8.05      Numerous covenants were included in the Loan and Project Agreements.
It appears that the number of covenants and the content of them were rather
ambitious from the beginning.  About two thirds of them were met.  Amo.-; those
that were not met (a) payment of administration bills within three months'
billing proved difficult to realize in practice; (b) review of Concession
Agreements was not done and seemed in fact not necessary; and (c) annual
adjustment of tariffs proved also rather difficult to implement as Government
commitment to cost recovery is half-hearted.
8.06      It can be safely concluded that the project was successful on technical
aspects.    Institutional  development was hampered particularly  due to the
intervention of MINMEN, thus reducing SNEC's autonomy. Financial performance was
unsatisfactory.   Delay in the recruitment of the financial advisor proved
particularly bad for SNEC's financial situation. Accumulation of arrears, much
delayed response to tariff adjustments, and increased recurrent costs all
contributed to the adverse situation.  It is hoped that in the years to come
SNEC's financial rehabilitation could start in the proper direction for a
recovery.   It will be necessary to carry out in the near future a sector
investment review particularly for recurrent expenditures and corresponding
revenues. It will be also necessary to reprioritize future sector investment
programs. End of 1986, an almost equal number of centers as the number existing
were to be ccmmissioned which will adversely increase recurrent expenditures.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN 1753-CM
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Economic Analysis
A. General
ERR calculations have taken into accounts
(i) as benefits, the additional revenues accruing to SNEC from
incremental consumption generated by the project;
(ii) as costs, project's capital costs and the additional operating
costs corresponding to the incremental consumption.
Calculations are carried out over a 30 year period after commissioning of the
facilities. Renewal of equipment (excluding civil works and pipes) is expected
to take place 15 years after this date. A discount rate of 10 percent has been
used in the present worth calculations required to determine AIC.
B.  Incremrental Consumption
Douala and Yaounde
The incremental consumption derives from the potential number of new
customers connected to the network. This number is assumed to be in proportion
with the length of distribution pipes laid under the pro4ect.
Secondary Centers
In the five centers (Bafang, Buea, Limbe, Mamfe, Tombel) where an
adequate network existed before the project, the incremental consumption in 1986
is assumed to be in proportion with the share of the number of connections
installed under the project in the total number of connections.   In other
centers, the 1986 consumption has been estimated using an average yearly
consumption  of  240m3/connection  and of 2,500m31standpipe.    Consumption  is
expected to grow at 8 percent rate. The growth of the incremental consumption
is limited by the production capacities installed under the project.
C. Capital Costs
Capital costs are investment costs of works executed under the project.
The following deflators have been used to calculate costs at mid 78 prices:

D.  Incremental Operating Costs
Variable costs (electricity and chemicals) and personnel costs have
been estimated from SNEC 1985/86 budget for Douala, Yaoundd and the five existing
centers.  A cost of CFAF 10/m3 (at mid-78 prices) has been charged to the eleven
other centers where personnel costs are assumed to be CFAF 5 million/year.
Yearly maintenance ccsts amount to one percent of the capital cost of civil works
and pipes and 3 percent of equipment installed.
E. Results
Results of the ERR and AIC calculations are provided by the following
table, along with the net benefits st-eams for each center.
