i.       The Government of Tunisia has asked the Bank and the Governmenti of
Sweden to assist in financing a project which comprises the major portion
of a nationwide program of water supply investments to be executed in
1968-73. The Program has been developed from a study prepared by Societe
Generale des Techniques Hydro-Agricoles (SOGETHI), which outlined investment
requirements of the sector to meet demand over the next 15 years, and it
reflects suggestions made by Bank staff during several missicns.
ii.      The 1968-73 Program consists of three elements:
a.   A group of high priority works to be compleLed be-
tween 1968 and 1973, which is identified as the
Bank/Swedish Project;
b.   A group of works, identified in broad terms but not
yet precisely defined, to be executed during 1971-73
which will be called the Second Project; and,
c.   Other minor works, mainly works in progress and re-
newals which will be executed and financed by the
Borrower over the 1968-73 period.
tThile all of these works are related in the sense that they are part of the
national Program, they are in many cases physically inde-andent of each
other in that they involve urban systems that are not interconnected~ The
Project has been designed so that it can stand alone; none of tlh other
works in the Program are vital to the functioning of the Project (except
minor works defined in paragraph 4.03 (I) and (2) ). However, the sales
projections, financing plan, etc., are based on the assumption that tne
entire Program will be completed as scheduled.
iii.     The Project consists of improvement and expansLon of the supply
and distribution systems of the two most heavily populated and economically
important regions of Tunisia - Tunis and the Sahel (Sousse) Regions and als^
of Nabeul and Hammamet, in a rapidly growing tourists area. Management and
technical assistance for a new national water supply organizaticn are also
included. Preliminary engineering is largely ccmpleted and detailed
engineering is under way.   The first contracts are expected to be called
for bids in late 1968. The Bank and Swedish loans would be disbursed
partly against the foreign exchange cost of imported items and partly as
a percentage of expenditures under other internationally bid contracts.
More than 99% of the total expenditures will be under internationally bid
contracts.



- ii -
iv.     The 1968-73 Progran is exoected to cost D31oB million (US$61.0
million), of which D17.1 million (US$32.8 million) is for the Project,
including interest during construction; D9.6 million (US$18.4 million)
is for the Second Project; and D5.1 million (US$9.8 million) for other
wqorks. The financing plan ircludes a Bank loan of US$15 million, a
Swedish loan of US$5 million equivalent, permanent capital contributed
by the government and a large amount (D8.2 millicn) of net cash generated
from operations.  The Bank would   finance 46% of the Project (25% of the
Program) including interest during construction, and Sweden would finance
15% of the Project (8% of the Program). The foreign exchange cost of the
Project is estimated to be US$1607 million (US$31-3 million for the
Frogram).
v.      The government has establis'hed an autonomous government-o-.neo
organization, Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distributi:n des BauŽ.2
(SOIEDE), which will be the Borrower. It is responsible for all water
supply activities in the country, which were being carried out by a lcocely
organized government department designated as the Regie des Eaux (RDE).
Consultants prepared an organizational plan and are installing a new
accounting system. Staffing requirements have been studied and th-e senior
staff have been appointed.
vi.     SONEDE has engaged technical consultants to assisit with the ex-
ecution of the project and management consultants wo help implement the
new organizational plan and accounting systeiL. This work is already under
way.
vii.    The government and SONEDE have agreed during negotiations to take
the measures necessary for proper execution of the project and for develoQo-
ing a sound water supply operaticn. The project provides a suitable basL.
for a Bank loan of US$15 million with a term of 25 years; including 5-1/2
years grace.

APPRAISAL nF THE
TUNISIA 'NATICNAL W!ATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.  INTRODUCTION
lOl     In 1966, the Government of Tunisia asked the Bank and the Govern-
ment of Sweden, represented by the Swedish International Tbvelopment
Association (SIDA), to assist in financing certain water supply works. In
November 1966, a Bank/Swedish mission (Messrs, Bowering and Geli from the
Bank and Mr. Gustaf3on from SIDA) visited Tunisia to identify worlcs whi-h
might be suitable for financing.   As a result of this mission,- the Tunisi.3n
Government engaged Societe dtEconomie et de Mathlematiques Appliquees (SEIVIA
to preDare a plan for reorganizing the Regie des Eaux (RDE), a secticn of
the Ministry of Agriculture which is responsible for urban water supply,
and to make a study of water rates, Technical consultants, Societe
Generale des Techniques Hydro-Agricoles (SC(ETHA), were engagod to develop
a program which would provide some basis fcr considering proiorities and
financial requirements. This program was reviewed in June 1967 by Mr. Thy.;
of the Bank. After discussion with the government, it was substantially
reduced, and the consultants were instructed to complete the preliminiary
engineering studies for the most needed elements. In the meantime, work
on the organization plan and the rate study was continuiingo
1.02     A Bank/Swedish preappraisal mission consiting of Messrs. Jennings
Thys and Miller from the Bank and Messrs. Wfillen, Gustafson and Heineman
from SIDA visited Tunisia in November-December 1967, to investigate the
program, the organizational arrangements and the financing plan. During
the mission, further progress was made in refining the prog arn and icent,L-
fying the works which were ready for financing. The organizational plan
and the rate study were also reviewed in detail and the government started
preparing a draft of the law which would establish a government enterpr-.e
to take over all potable water supply activities in Tunisia.
1,03     During the appraisal mission of March-April 1968 (Messrs0 Jennings,
El-Fishawy and Thys for the Bank, and Mr. Sandberg for SIDA), the final
definition of the 1968-73 Program and the Project proposed to be financed
by the Bank and Sweden were agreed and a final draft of the law was pre-
pared. A number of other arrangements concerning rates, the financing
plan, technical and management assistance for the new organization, etc.,
were-also agreed, subject to approval by the Bank.
1.04     Negotiations took place August 19-30, 1968. During negotiations
the Tunisian delegation announced that the law creating the Societe
Nationale dtExploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE) had been
passed on July 2, 1968, that all of the se:nior management positions had
been filled and that SONELE was beginning to function,, SON'EDE will have
a large degree of financial and administrative autonomy and sound publir,
utility policies.  Its organizational structure and accounting systems



- 2 -
have been prepared by consultants and accepted by the government and the
Bank, It will assume responsibility for all potable wiater supply
activities of Tunisia, and will execute the 1968-73 Program0
lrO5     This report, which describes the Program, the Project, and the
related arrangements in detail, has been prepared by Messrs. Jennings
and Thlys within the broad outlines agreed with the Swedishl representative
during the appraisal mission0

2. TKE SECTOR
2.01     All potable water supplies have been operated or supervised by
RDE, which is a part of the division of "Hydraulique et Equipemernt Rural"
(HER) of the Department of Agriculture (see Annex 1). Societe Tunisienns
de ltElectricite et du Gaz (STEG) has a contract with RDDE to operate the
distribution system of Tunis. All water resources of Tunisia were under
the control of RDE.
2002     Water is a scarce commodity in Tunisia. The limited water re-
sources available for urban, industrial and agricultural use are further
dimninished by the salinization of surface waters as they flow towards the
sea. The salt content of most ground water resources makes them unfit for
human consumption, and difficult to use for irrigation. Most fresh water
sources are found some 100 km inland in the mountains; only limited amounts
are found in the coastal areas where the population is concentrated,   Theic-
fore expensive dams and long transmission lines are required to serve the
population centers. This means that potable water will always be relatively
expensive in Tunisia.
2,03     Potential sources of fresh water in the North are limited, If
large scale irrigaticn projects are implemnented in that area, all known
fresh water scurces could be fully utilized by about 1985. To meet in-
creasing needs for urban, industrial and agricultural water after that
time, it may be necessary to resort to desalination, an extremely oeJpnsivc
source of water. Before this point is reached, a plan for optimum develop-
ment of all existing and potential sources should be prepared. The govern-
ment, with the aid of bilateral technical assistance, has gathered a weal.ti
of hydrological data. This data needs to be systematically reviewed and
organized to lay the basis for preparation of the development plan. WOin
completed, this plan will affect investment decisions in the urban watar
supply sector in the 1980s.
2.O4     In 1967, RDE supplied water to 246 centers with a total populatico
of 2.17 million (h8% of the population of Tunisia) (see Annex 2)0 The re-
maining 2.4 million (52%) live in scattered villages and farms, generally
not large enough to warrant establishment of a public water supply and
their needs are met by water from wells, irrigation systems. cisterns, or
from public taps of the nearest center, The three major systems, which
supply 112' centers with a total population of about 1.35 million, are Tunis
(35 centers, population 815,000), Sahel (64 centers, population 335,000)
and Sfax (13 centers, population 195,000).   In Tunis about 75% of the
population have water in the house.  In Sfax about 50% have house connec-
tions, in the Sahel 30%, and in the rest of the country only 25%, according
to RDE estimates. Water for the Tunis system ccmes from the Ben Metir dam
in the northwest of Tunisia, from several ground water sources, and the
Kebir dam south of Tunis. The Sahel is supp'lied by aquifers located west
of Kairouan (see Map 1); Sfax is supplied by springs and wells located near
Kasserine (Map 2).



2.05     Prior to 1956, the systems supplied only the large urban centers
and those with a sizeable European population.  Tunis, the capital
accounted for more than two-thirds of the ccnsumption. After independence
(1956), large investments of about D15 million were made to supply the
smaller cities, and in 1961 interest free loans for the installation of
private house connections were granted by the government to new customers.
As a result, the increase in sales and customers after 1961 was consider-
able (see Annex 2), each increasing by 63% over the last five years. The
increase in sales was particularly evident in the northern pr'ovinces and
in the Sahel.
2,O6     In 19667 RDE, with the assistance of SOGETHA, prepared an outline
for technical development of the water supply sector based on the estimatC'.'.
water needs of the population in 19820  From this outline, a five-.ye.ar pro--
gram to rehabilitate and expand the existing systems was preparedn  It wa2
reviewed by the Bank and subsequently modified to form the present 1968713
National Water Supply Program.
2.07     The Natio-.nal Water Supply Program consists of three e]emc%-ts;
a. A group of high priority works to be cormpleted in
the 1968-73 period and which is identified as "The
Project";
bo A group of works called "The Second Project" which
includes works not yet ready for appraisal, and
some small'er projects whooe justification will have
to be substantiated later by more factual data0
These works would be started in 1971; and,
co  Other minor works, mainly work in progress, renewals,
and major repairs which will be execubed and financed
entirely by the Borrower over the 1968-73 period.
In general, the Program emphasizes supply works in the early years because
of the need to relieve shortages, and emphasizes distribut-'on works in the
later years to improve the quality of service in areas alread.y served and
to extend service to adjacent areas, The 1968-73 Program will meet the
most important needs until about 1982, when new sources of supply will 'or
needed for Tunis and the Sahel. It will improve the water supply of more
than one third of the people of Tunisia.



3   TI. BO'RRC;ER
3,01     The borrower of the Bank loan will be SONEDE     a government
owned, autonomous water supply organization having the form of a public
utility enterprise. The organization was legally created by a law passed
July 2, 1968. The activities which it will take over have been carried
out by the management and staff of a section of the Ministry of Agriculture
called the Regie des Eaux (RDE)O All RDE employees have been transferred
to SONEDE, although there will be a number of changes of responsibilities
and functions, mostly at the management level, to conform to the new
structure. The senior staff of the RDE, along with representatives of "he
Ministries of Finance and Agriculture have been responsible for the arrarg -,
ments leading to the creation of SONEDE, and for preparation of the Progran
and the Project.
3.02     While SONEDE has little structural resemblace to RDE, the poople
are largely the same, and it will take time to charge patter-)s of thikcing
developed over many years of operatio-^ as a part of governmsnt0  The RDE's
past operations and some of its problems are described briefly belcw, in
order to provide a background against which tlhe probable success of the
Project and the importarnce of the various changes recoinmended can be
measured.
A, Background
3.03     The organization chart of RDE is shown in Annex lo   As a relatively
obscure section of a governrient department, RDE suffered from lack of good
management, inadequate revenues, an.d fragmentation of its activities.  For
example, the distribution system of Tunis, the largest in the country, is
operated by a department of the national electricity organization, (STEG).
STEG collects water bills in Tunis but f;equently failed to turn over the
cash collected to RDE. (The government has agreed to guarantee that STEG
will remit promptly to SONEDE all funds collected in tile future.) Large
civil works have frequently been executed by another section of the Ministry
of Agriculture called Grands Travaux, which is completely outside the control
of RDE. Although the RDE has about 1,850 employees, there has been a short-
age of qualified engineers and almost all of the design and planning has
been done by two expatriate engineers and by consultants. Planning has
suffered from lack of coordination between the two regional subdivisions of
RDE, the lack of detailed financial information, poor sales and production
statistics, etc.
1/    The borrower of the Swedish credit will be the Government of Tunisia
and the proceeds will be relent to SON.EDE.



- 6 -
3.o4     Operating details of RDEts most important systems are shown in
Annex 2. The Tunis system is by far the most important, with about 45%
of total sales, and other important urban systems are found in Sfax,
Sousse and Bizerte. Technical operations of the various systems have
been reasonably good, but there is room for many operating improvements
of the kind which can be quickly made once the restraints of money anId
technical skills are eased.
3.05     The financial affairs of RDE, a government department, have been
administered by the Treasury. Operating and capital budgets were prepared
in a complicated form required by government regulations, and did not yield
the kind of information needed for efficient management of a water supply
organization.  The accounting system was completely inadequate.   Useful in-
formation about revenues and expenses was difficult to assemble and there
was practically no fixed assets accounting. The RDEts financial objective
was to achieve a balance between cash revenues and cash expenditures, but
this objective was observed more in form than in fact, since various kinds
of expenditures related to the operations of RDE were not charged to RDE'S
budget, e.g. debt service. Pro forma income statements had to be prepared
by the Bank and are shown in Annex 3. The statements show that there has
been a rough balance between cash operating revenues and expenses.   Depre-
ciation has not been covered and debt service was not taken into account.
About the only conclusion that can be drawn from these statements is that
billings and cash receipts, and expenses, have steadily increased, and
that tarif's have boen much too low. The RDE had no balance sheebs.
3.06     The rate structure below was in effect from 1961 until October 1,
1968, and was uniform throughout the country.

This structure produced average revenues for water consumed of about 32
millimes per m3 (US$0.23 per 1,000 US gal.).
3.07     The system of collections used by RDE has been reasonably
efficient in some respects and very poor in others. The main problem has
been the five to six months lag between the time meters are read and the
bills issued. Once the bills were issued, the RDE was fairly effective
in collecting from individual consumers. Records show; about 8050 has been
collected within six months of issuing the bills and more than 90% has
been collected within 12 months. The performance concerning government
accounts has been much worse. The collection record .s shown in Annex- It,



- 7 -
3.08     The government was aware of the RDE's operating deficiencies, and
SOTEDE's structure and policies, which reflect most of the suggestions made
by their consultants and the Bank missions, are designed to overcome these
def ic ienc ies e
B. SONEDE
3,09     SOMEDE was created by a new law-r passed by the National Assembly on
July 2, 1968.   A draft of the law was reviewed and found acceptable to the
Bank. While it eatablishes "a public entity of an industrial and commercial
nature, possessing juridicial status and financial autonomy", it also pro-
vides that the government, as sole owner, will have close control over all
policy matters.  This is in line with legislation covering existing govern
ment and semi-government companies. The governnment has in&icated thzat
SONEDEts management will be free to deal with all normal operational matters-
In fact, the ministers seem to be eager to relieve themselves of these
details. In view of the government's attitude and the satisfactory Bank
experience with the Port Authority, which has somewhat more restrictive
statutes, the assurances given during negotiations, that the government will
not unduly interfere with SONEDE's management, should be sufficient to assure
reasonable autonomy,
3.10     The law does not specify the structure of SONEDE below the Isvol
of the Board of Directors. However, an organizational plan has been pre-
pared by SEMA, under a contract with tho government. SEMA worked on the neiw,
organization for more than one-year and produced detailed organization
charts, an analysis of staffing requirements, job descriptions, detailed
manuals of procedures, flow charts, etc. Annex 5 shows the new organization
chart. The four key positions are the general manager and the three depart-
ment heads. Senior staff of the RDE have been appointed to those positions,
except for the financial manager, who was recruited from a similar pcsition:
with a large semi-government building supply companyt With the technic.1l
and management assistance to be provided, these men are capable of managing
SONEDE satisfactorily. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
these four key positions will be held only by fully qualified people and t-hat
no changes will be made without prior consultaticn with the Bank.
3.11     SONEDEts basic structure will be in effect from the beginningl/ but
the details of the plan will be put into effect gradually over about
two years.  The new systems will require skills not available in RDE (e0g.
accountants), SEE4A estimates that about 20 positions (out of 43) in the
first three grades will have to be filled from outside RDE by the time all
1/    One important structural change will be the take over of operations of
the Tunis distribution system from STEGO This is expected to take place
sometime during 1969.



- 8 -
of the systems are in operaticn. In connection with their contract for
implementing the organization plan and installing the new accounting systems,
SEMA is helping to recruit competent people for these positions. SEMA be--
lieves that there can be a reduction of 300-h00 unskilled employees (eog.
drivers, manual workers), This reduction would be accomplished over a
period of time by transfer to other government departments, att,ition and
upgrading. The Borrower has given assurances during negotiations that the
people needed to fill out SONEDEts staff will be recruited promptly.
3.12     The importance of the SEMA work on the accountirg system cannot be
over-emphasized, The new system itself is relatively simple, yet it will
produce a great deal of useful informationo As the system is installed, ith
SEMA people will train SONEDE emp'loyees in its use and they will remain 'e1,0
enough to assure that it is working smoothly. The system is adapted from
the French Plan Comptable Genera', a standard accounting system used by
commercial and industrial firms in.France, which can be tailored for use by
almost any kind of organization.   SEMA (and the Bank) belie-es that any
disadvantages arising from the use of a sy-stem which is not designed specL-
fically for a water supply operaticn will be more than offset by the fact
that all accountants available to SONEDE will be thoroughly familiar wzith
the basic system and will only need a minimum of retrainirg. Assurarnces
were obtained during negotiaticnd that SEi4A will remain as lo;ig as necessa y
for proper operation of the system.
3.13     The governmnernt has agreed that SONEDE will have an annual audit  !
its accounts by an independent commercial auditor acceptable to the Banks
3 .L4    To ensure that the managament will be able to deal with the liage
number of problems arising from simultaneously undertaking   a large projec.
and establishing a new organization, the government has agreed t iat all
necessary technical assistance will be provided, In addition to SEIHA
technical consultants will be employed for the Projectt these arrangeioents
are discussed in Section 4. The governmenat requested E:lectricite de France
to provide, as advisor to the General Manager, a qualified and exper.enced
public utility manager under a technical assistance agreement0   Electrici.>:
de France (EDF) agreed, and made available a man who appears to be well
qualified particularly on the financial side. His proposed terms of
reference and conditions of contract were discussed during negotiations.
The final contract has now been signed and he is on the job.
3.15     Financial arrangements for the changeover from RDE to SONEDE were.
kept as simple as possible. SONEDE will receive all fixed assets, supplies.
mobile equipment, etc,, but will not take over RDE's accounts receivable,
SONEDE will be entitled to receive for its own account only revenues from
consumption after April 1, 1968. It will continue to collect old bills bl'
these funds will go to a special liquidation account io the Treasury. SCi'LDE
will take over RDE's accounts payable as of July 2, 1968, in order to re--
establish good relations with local suppliers. These arrangements are dit-
cussed more fully in Section 6 and Annex 15.

3,16     The Bank believes that the proposed organization and management
arrangements are satisfactory in concept, and the governrment has agreed to
take the actions required to put them into effect. These agreements aze
confirmed in the loan documents, in the form of the various assurances
mentioned above and in Section 7.

4. THE PRnJECT
A. Description of the Project
4.01     The Project, which represents about 52% of the 1968-73 Program,
will reduce shortazes and satisfy growing water' consumption in ll0 ities
and villages located in the northern and eastern parts of Tunisia.-    It
will include Tunis and the densely populated and important touristic areas
of the Sahel (Sousse) region and Nabeul-Hammamet. The Project is based on
engineering and feasibility studies prepared oy RDE/SONEDE and two French
consultants, SOGETHA and SCET-Cooperation. These studies were reviewed,
modified and expanded following discussions with the Bank/Swedish missions:
The Project (described in detail in Annex 6 and Map 1) is estimated to coo;
US$32.8 million, including interest during construction, and is divided in-
to four sub-projects.
1. The Tunis project, whose cost is estimated at
US$21,4 muilion, provides for construction of a
123 km pipeline from Oued Kassab Dam to the out-
skirts of Tunis. These works will almost double
the supply capacity of Greater Tunis and 34 other
centers served along the pipeline and will satisfy
demand until about 1982. The distribution system
of Tunis will be extended and reconditioned.
Some minor improvements to existing ground water
supply facilities will also be included, Com-
pletion is scheduled for early 1973;
2. The Sahel project will develop ground water sources,
double the existing pipeline supplying the coastal
area, construct sections of trunk pipelines feeding
63 cities and municipalities, and rehabilitate and
extend distribution systems in Sousse, Kalaa Kebira,
and Msaken. Works are designed to meet demand urntil
1978, and will be completed in 1972. Total cost is
estimated at US$6.7 million;
3. The Nabeul-Hammamet   project i3 designed to meet the
immediate needs of a fast developing resort area.
It consists of new wells, reservoirs, and an inter-
connection between the distribution systems of the
two cities, to be completed in 1970  The cost is
estimated at US$1.12 million; and,
1/    It will supply more water to about 60% of the population served by
SONEDE.



- 11 -
4. The supply and installation of metering equipment
in all systems to improve efficiency of operations
and provide factual data to prepare for future ex-
pansion. The cost is estimated at US$0.52 million.
B. The Second Project
4.02     The Second Project will consist of certain works which had boen
proposed for the 1968-70 period but were postponed for financial and ad-
ministrative reasons. It will also include works which have been identi-
fied but not yet thoroughly studied and justified, along with the bulk of
extensions, malor repairs and renewals during 1971-73. It is estimated tc
cost about US$18.4 million. Since it will have a large foreign exchange
component, it has been assumed that the works would be financed in part
by a foreign exchange loan equivalent to 55% of the total cost.
C. Other Works
4.03     Works programmed for 1968-73 but not included in etW'or cro-ect
are estimated at D2.02 million in 1968-1   D2.8 million in 19659-70, and LV,'9
million in 1971-73. These works outside the Project consist of:
1. Tunis:   Completion, by the end of 1969, of the Gdir
el Goulla treatment plant (partly financed by US.-AID),
which will treat water conveyed by the Oued-Kas3eb -
Tunis pipeline;
2, Sahel:   A 15.5 km section of the Sahel pipeline under
construction will provide 40 l/s additional capacity
to reduce the summer shortages until the Sahel project
is completed; and,
3. Extensions and urgent renewals of several small systems
to relieve existing shortages.
4.04     Since completion of works under 4.03 (1) and (2)   is necessary to
functioning of pipelines to be constructed under the Project, assurances have
been given that these facilities will be completed prior to the end of 1970c
D. Cost of Project
4.05     The total cost of the Projegt is. estimated at about D17J1 millior
(US$32.8 million), including interest during construction on the proposed
Bank and Swedish loans.  The remainder of the Program, including the Second
Project and all other capital investments during the period is estimated to
cost D14.7 million (US$28.2 million).  However, except for the Bank/Swedisa
lT Dl.3 million after creation of SCN7DE.

project, the works in the Program are not precisely defined, and the cost
estimate will no doubt be changed from time to time during the period. It
is not likely that the estimate would be raised, but it could be lowered
(or the Program could be stretched out) as SONEDEts investment planning is
refined,
4.o6      Cost estimates for the Project, summarized below, are given in
detail in Annex 7, along with estimated yearly expenditures during the con--
struction period and the assumptions used for foreign exchange cost eval--
uation.

about 15% on civil engineering works and 2% on supplies. Tnh project sbo!ulA
he completed in five years. The construction schedule, which is realistic.
is shown in Annaex 8.
E. DEs ign and Supervision
4.08      SONEDE will need enginieering assistance in the execution of the
Project. SOGETHA, which did most of the prelimirary engineering will prcepare
detailed engineering, tender documents, analyze bids, exercise general su;er-
vision of construction, including schedules and cartify all expenditure.s
The terms of the SOCETHA-SONEDE contracts are satisfactorya    The engineer.--g
works will be done primarily by engineers from SOGETHA s Tunis office anr :e
general supervision works will be done by a team from the home office in
Grenoble.



- 13 -
4.09      Detailed supervision of construction will be done by SOTEDEts
engineering department, strengthened by additional engineers and by experi-
enced pipelaying supervision teams from Grands Travaux. A satisfactory agrea-
ment has beeni signed between SONEDE and Grands Travaux describing the methods
and conditions for this assistance.
4.10      These arrangements should provide for adequate maii?gament of the
project while ensuring that Tunisian engineers play an active role and benefit.
from the consultants1 experience. The loan documents contain assurances that
SONEDE will employ adequate engineering services for all phases of tho con-
struction program.
Fo Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      Procurement of more than 99% (based on value) of goods and servic&c
covered by the Project would be through international comspetitive bidding TIre
local pipe manufacturing industry is we'll established and should be able t.:-
compete for certain kinds of pipe. The prestressed concrete pipe indu3try i:
particularly competitive. Large contracting firms established in Tunisia are
mostly subsidiaries of foreign construction companies. Purely local firms a,e.
not excpected to be competitive for large contracts, but may compete for some
of the smaller distributic:a works.
4.12      The margin of Fvoference for local manufacturers will be lmite3 to
the amount of the applicable import duty, or 15%, whichever is the low.,er0
Tunisian custom duties for most of the goods to be imporcted for the project
vary from 5.5% to 11%. However, for concrete pipes the duty is 30%.0
h4J3      Procurement procedures to be followed by SONEDE h2vs been es tab-
lished by a decree. The provisions of the decree will not inter2fere with p10-
curement procedures normally required for Bank projects.
4.14      Licenses are  reouired for import of all goods into Tunisia. Doe
to lack of foreign exchange, long delays are common, The government has   -
assurances that imported goods for use in the project will be granted licer!;es
without delay. The guarantee agreement states that '.he government will, at,
the request of SONEDE, issue promptly all import licenses required for the
Project, including licenses for local suppliers if certified by SONEDE.
4.15.     Land expropriation procedures can be lengthy when normnal procedurv-
are followed. The government can decree accelerated procczdures which re&dcc
delays required to occupy the land. Assurances that these procedures will ba
used if requested by SONEDE are obtained in the Guarantee Agreement.
4.16      It is recommended that disbursement of the Bank and Swedish loans
be on the basis of:
a. The actual foreign excharige cost of imported goods
and of consultants services;



- 14 -
b.  Forty-eight percent of civil works contracts, and
goods fabricated locally and procured after inter-
national bidding; and,
c. Fifty-six percent of goods procured locally but
fabricated abroad.
(The amounts under (c), if any, will be very small; (See Article 2.03 and
schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement.) All disbursement requests will come to
the Bank,and the Bank having approved the request, the amounts to be dis-
bursed will be divided betweQn the Bank and Sweden on a three to one basis.
This procedure will also apply to charges for interest and fees during the
grace pericd, even though the two loans have different interest rates. If
any surplus funds are available after completion of the project, and if
SOMEDE so requests, it is recommended that consideration be given to finan-
cing additional pipes and related fittings for the distribution systems,
subject to an evaluation of the situation existing at that time byr a supe;-
vision mission,

5. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The proposed Project is the most urgent part of the 1968-73 nationa
water supply Program. It will relieve shortages and meet growing water needs
of important economic areas. Improved financial policies (particularly rates"
new management techniques, and better sector planning associated with the
Project will help to ensure efficient use of scarce resources in the future.
After 1972, capital contributions to this sector, which have been a burden on
the national budget in the past, should no longer be needed.
5.02      The population of Tunisia grew from 3.94 million in 1956 to 4.46
million in 1966. In the same period, the number of people living in areas
supplied by RDE (this includes almost all population centers) increased from
1.35 to 2.09 million despite an emigration of some 250,000 inhabitants.
Future population growth is estimated at 2 to 2.5% per year. The population
served by SONEDE is expected to increase at a rate of b% per annum (see
Annex 11).
5.03      Water demand during summer already exceeds the reliable capacity of
present sources. RDE had to restrict water use in residential and commercial
areas to provide sufficient amounts to the tourist areas. Additional supply,
transmission and distribution facilities are now required. The additional
capacity created by the proposed program (1968-73) would meet needs until
about 1982.
5.oh      Annexes 12 and 13 show projected sales. The average increase from
1966 to 1977 is 5.5% per annum. This seems conservative in view of the re-
corded increases of the last five years (10.2% per annum) and in light of
the widespread shortages of the past few years. It has been assumed that an
increase in rates to about double the present level would have no significant
effect on consumption because most of consumption is by customers for whom
water costs represent only a small part of their total expenditures.
5.05      The Project will benefit areas which are producing most of the in-
crease in economic activity in Tunisia. Tunis, the main population, business
and commercial center, has about 50% of all of Tunisia's industrial
production and 25% of its tourist trade.   The Sahel and Nabeul-Hammamet are
being spurred by the tourism boom.  Most of Tunisia's textile industry is also
in the Sahel. Tunis and Sahel can provide a large skilled labor force
(population 1 million and 0.5 million, respectively) in a 50 km radius, easy
access to imported raw materisl (ports of La Goulette, Tunis, Sousse), an
important infrastructure (power production, roads and airports of Tunis and
Monastir), all banking and business services and the tourist resorts. These
areas naturally attract a large portion of the capital investments made in
Tunisia.
5.06      Tourism, the fastest growing industry in Tunisia (see Annex 9),
accounted for 17% of all exports of goods and services in 1967 as opposed to
1% in 1960, according to the latest economic report. Tunis, the Sahel and
Nabeul-Hammamet have accounted for 75% of foreign exchange earnings due to
tourism. An adequate supply of water is vital to the operation of tourist



- 16 -
facilities. All three areas have expereinced water shortages at the height
of the tourist season in recent years. If shortages are allowed to cohtinue
and become worse, the Tunisian industry's reputation for quality may be
damaged.
5.07      The various elements of the Project have been selected after a care-
ful technical and economical evalution of alternatives. The mission reviewed
several studies prepared by RDE and its consultants, as well as results of
ground water studies prepared by FAO, US-AID and HER. These studies show:
a. That no ground water sources can economically supply
Tunis and that the Oued Kasseb system is the only
source available to satisfy demand during the next
decade;
b. That the Sahel and Nabeul-Hammamet ground water
sources are the only fresh-water sources available
in these regions;
c. That these works should be started as soon as
possible to avoid major year-round restrictions in
1972; and,
d. That the pipeline diameters selected are the most
economical, using discount rates of 8 to 20%.
5.08      The internal rate of return of the national Program (1968-73) is
11%, calculated by taking into account only additional revenues resulting
from water sales and service charges. Other benefits, such as the pre-
vention of economic losses due to fire, the contribution of water supply to
development of tourism and of industry, should be particularly significant
in Tunisia since no other economic sources of water are available in the
urban areas.
5.09      Wfater borne enteric diseases are responsible for high morbidity
rates in developing countries. An analysis of the Tunis health statistics
indicates that the incidence of enteric diseases is four time higher among
persons living in poor environmental conditions than those who do not.
Trachoma and other eye infections are also widespread in Tunisia and their
transmission can also be controlled by good personal hygiene for which water
supply is basic. Improvements of sanitation in the outlying areas, through
provision of safe and adequate water is considered by the World Health
Organization as fundamental to the development of a sound public health
program.

6. FINANCING PLAN AND FINANCIAL OUTLCOK
A. Financing Plan
6.o0      Capital requirements for the Program are discussed in paras. 4.05
to 4f.07. These requirements will be met by a combination of the Bank and
Swedish loans, capital contributions by the Government of Tunisia, by a
foreign exchange loan for the Second Project, and by internal cash generatic:n.
The  requirements and sources of funds during the construction period are
shown in Annex 17 and summarized below:

- 18 -
6.02      While the capital requirements for the Project are believed to be
realiable estimates, the amount provided for other capital investment is con-
siderabley less certain. The Second Project from 1971 to 1973 accounts for
the bulk (D9.6 million) of this amount. It will be planned in detail between
now and 1971 using improved operating data generated by SONEDE. It is not
likely to be larger than estimated, but could be smaller and/or could be
spread over a longer period. Since it is important that the Bank have an
opportunity to comment on SONEDE's future investment program, agreement was
reached during negotiations that, until 1980, the Borrower will not make in-
vestments decisions involving commitments of more than D250,000 for a single
investment and more than Dl million in aniy year without prior consultation
with the Bank.
6.03      An amount has been provided for transfer to government for the
service of outstanding debt related to water supply facilities to be used by
SONEDE. Details of these debts, which are mostly bilateral foreign aid loans,
are shown in Annex 14.   The provision for working capital is unusually large
because of the need to replenish inventories of supplies and materials; be-
cause of a reduction in accounts payable of RDE, which will be assumed by
SONEDE; and because of a large increase in accounts receivable in the early
years of the project.
6.04      The government has agreed to provide whatever funds are needed to
finish the Project; and has agreed to provide the necessary funds to carry
out the Program as now defined. The actual amount of the government capital
contribution will be affected by the size and financing plan of the Second
Project, which is not yet precisely defined; by variations in the cost of the
Bank/Swedish project; by variations in the amount of internal cash generation,
etc. It has been agreed that the government will make the funds available to
SONEDE quarterly, the amount in each quarter to be based on a statement by
SONEDE setting out its net cash needs for the following quarter, after taking
account of all sources and requirements for that period.
6.05      The proposed US$15 million Bank loan and US$5 million Swedish loan
would cover 61% of the total cost of the Project and 30% of the cost of the
Program. The estimated foreign cost of US$16.6 million for the Project would
be covered by the combined loans; the foreign cost of the Program outside the
Project would be covered partly by the assumed foreign exchange loan for the
Second Project, and partly by the government's own resources. Neither the
Bank nor Sweden are committed to a loan for the Second Project, although it
is expected, in the normal course of events, that the government will consider
them as potential lenders. The terms of the Bank loan have been assumed to be
25 years including 5-1/2 years grace, an interest rate of 6-1/2% and a committ-
ment charge of 3/4%. Sweden has offered the terms used by IDA. The Swedish
loan will be made to the government and relent to SONEDE on the same terms, in
accordance with an agreement between the government and SONEDE.
6.06      The US-AID loan is the undisbursed portion of loans to the government
totalling about US$2 million which were made for certain improvements to the
Tunis and Sfax distribution systems and for the Gdir el Goulla reservoir and
treatment plant.



- 19 -
0.7       r.ternal cash generat2on depends on the validity of a large numbor
of assumptions listed in Annexes 13 and 15. The government agreed to an
initial rate increase from a average of about 32 millimes per m3 to an
average of 60 millimes per m . The increase has been in effect from October
1, 1968.
6.CU      SOMED2 has adopted the following rate schedule in ordor to achieve
an average rate of 60 millimes/m3.
Millimes/m3      /1,000 US Gal.
Domestic and Commercial         63                49
Public                          30                22
Agricultural                    34                24
Large Industry                  45                32
The new rates amount to a 70/S0 increase for the domest'Lc cate.-nr. 2rd large:
percentage increases in the others (See para. 3.06). SONEDE Sand t.-.e governv-
ment) has agreed to maintain an average rate of 60 millimes/m through 1970.
If necessary, the above schedule will be adjusted to produce that average.
The rate covenant commits SONEDE to produce a rate of return on net fixed
assets of not less than 5% through 1973 and not less than 6/O thereafter), t*
has been assumed that small rate increases in 1971 and 1974 will be necessary
in order to meet the terms of the rate covenant.
6.09      Improved management practices associated with the project are ex-
pected to produce much better statistical and financial data on which more
rational rate policies may be based. Rates have traditionally been uniforrrm
throughout the country, and this policy will be continued, at least for the
present. In many cases such a policy would produce inequitites because cos;s
are normally higher in small centers than in large cities where there are
economics of scale.  Ibwever, this is not necessarily true in Tunisia where
the large population centers are far from the sources of fresh water and
require expensive gathering and transmission facilities. The data necessary
to make a useful analysis of this question are not available at present, but
will be produced by SONEDEts new accounting system when it is in full
operation. If large differences in costs are revealed at that time, it is
expected that SONEDE will wish to adjust the rate structure to reflect these
differences.  However, these adjustments are likely to be modified to some
extent by political considerations.
B. Financial Outlook
6.10      Projected income statements, cash flows, aid balance sheets, for
SONEDE are shown in Annexes 16, 17 and 18 respectively. The assumptions
underlying these projections are listed in Annexes 13 and 15.

6.11      SONEDE's financial outlook, with the assumed rate increases and
operating expenses, is good. It will be able to finance internally a
portion of the 1968-73 Program, and at the end of this period will be pro-
ducing about D2.5 million per year in net cash generation available for
further investments. At this time, about 35% of revenues would be available
for investments, and SONEDE should be able to finance internally about two-
thirds of investment requirements after 1973. Borrowing would be needed only
for an occasional large project. A low debt equity ratio and debt service
coverage approaching three times, indicate a solid financial foundation for
any borrowing that would be necessary.
6.12      Expressed in terms of the financial rate of return as normally used
by the Bank, SONEDE's expected financial performance is adequate. The rate
of return hovers around 5% during the construction period and around 6% in the
three years following the construction period. However, it will improve
steadily, without any further rate increases, as the facilities approach
capacity operation in the early 1980s. The return at that time should be
around 8%. It should be noted that the rate base reflects the estimated
current value of fixed assets based on a study made by SEMA as of the end of
1966. If the value of these assets were taken as original cost less depre-
ciation, the financial rate of return would be considerably higher. The
expected financial return correspondsto an internal (discounted cash flow)
rate of return of about 11% on the investment in the 1968-73 Program.

7. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The proposed Project is a vital part of a sector program needed to
sustain and increase economic activity in the most populous and economically
important areas of Tunisia. The tourist industry, in particular, depends on
the adequate supply of water which the Project will provide. The Project has
been well prepared and no unusual technical problems are anticipated. The
proposed organization is satisfactory; management, with the assistance to be
provided, is capable of carrying out the Project and the reforms needed to
produce a sound water supply operation. The financing plan is adequate and
the government is committed to sound financial policies in the future. The
government was aware of the management, structural and financial problems of
the RDE and is in full agreement with the steps necessary to correct them.
Cooperation by both the government and SONEDE staff in preparing the Project
has been excellent.
7.02      All of the measures necessary to properly execute the Project and
to achieve a sound water supply operation have been agreed during negotiations.
The most important of these are:
a. Establishment of an autonomous organization which is
responsible for all potable water supply activities
in Tunisia;
b.  New management techniques and a new accounting
system designed and installed by consultants;
c.  Strengthening of the permanent technical staff and
provision of the necessary engineering assistance for
executing the Project; and,
d. A substantial rate increase.
7.03      The Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$15 mil-
lion, with a term of 25 years, including five and one half year grace.

TUNISIA NATIONALr WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Description of the Project
1.        The project will satisfy the growing water consumption in 101
cities and localities in the north and eastern parts of Tunisia. It will
include Tunis, the capital, all cities between Beja and Tunis, and densely
populated areas of the province of Sousse (Sahel) and the touristic area
of Nabeul-Hammamet. The water supply of over 60% of the population served
by SONEDE will be improved0 Measuring equipment, to reduce losses in all
water supply systems of Tunisia, will also be provided.
2.        The project is subdivided in four sub-projects:
a . Tunis
i. A 123 km. pipeline from the Oued Kasseb Dam (under
construction) to the Gdir el Goulla Reservoir (out-
skirts of town) will be constructed. This pipeline
was designed by SOGETHA and has the following
characteristics:
1.  Section I    : From Oued Kasseb to the junction
with existing Ben Metir-Tunis
line, 1505 km. diameter 1,100 mm;
2. Section II    : Follows about the same route as
the existing line until Medjez
el Bab.
Diameter 1,250 mm for 49. h km
Diameter 1,600 mm for 3.7 km
for passage of mountain passes
and tunnels; and
3. Section III : From Medjoz el Bab to Gdir el
Goulla 53ol km. diameter 1,100 mm.
4.  Sections I and II will be linked to the existing
lower section of the Ben Metir pipeline, Section
III with the upper section. This will reduce the
static pressure on the existing lower section and
will hopefully reduce the numerous breakages which
occur on this section.
5. Peak flcw capacity         l,465 1/sec.
Safe yield of dam    :    38 million m3/year

The pipe will be prestressed concrete. Civil works
will include: 1) a receiving basin from the hydro
plant; 2) an open channel; 3) a siphon under the
Cued Kasseb stream; 4) a head water basin at the
Cued Kasseb Dam site; 5) 12 surge towers from Kasseb
to Gdir el Goulla; 6) bridges over the Medjerda
River (74 m); and, 7) the Cued Chefrou (13 m),  In
Section III, there will be downstream control equip-
ment, some of it patented products. All high and
low points will be equipped with air vents and drain
valves.
ii. Improvements to the sources of supply south of Tunis
1. Replacement of three sections (5,ooo m) of heavily
corroded pipe on the "S550 south" main;
2. Construction of five new tube wells (3 in Kebir
Valley, 1 in Khledia, and 1 in Djouggar);
3.  Supply and installation of pumping units; arid,
4.  Construction of small well pumping stations.
iiit  Transmission pipelines inside Greater Tunis:  The con-
struction of the mlain feed3r line froti Gdir el Gouila
reservoir to Rastabia Reservoir.

2. Improvements, renewals, and extensions to the
Greater Tunis distribution network. These
works will consist in the supply and installation
of asbestos cement and cast iron pipe. The works
represent half of the program for the rehabili-
tation and expansion plan of the system. The re-
maining works will be completed in 1971-73.
b. Sahel
i. The Sahel region extends 100 km, along the coastal
region of the Sousse province from Hergla (north of
Sousse) to Mahdia (see Maps), It receives water from
the 60 km. Sahel pipeline which conveys water from the
existing ground water aquifers of Haffouz-Cherichea.9
to the west of Kairouan. At its terminal point at El
Onk, this main is subdivided into trunrk pipelines
known as: 1) "Sahel North", ahich supp1'.e- Sousse,
Msaken and Kalaa Kebira;  2) "Sahel Central"', which
supplies Monastir and El Djem; and, 3) "Sahel. South",
serving Mahdia. The project designed to satLsfy the
wator requirements until 1978 include6
1. The construction of a 39.7 km0 trar.smi.ssion line
made of prestressad concrete pipe (300 mm) and
constituting pha,se ~Ibll of the doubli..g of the
existing line 1/;
20  Davelopment of additional ground water sources
in the Cherichera area to increasa capacity to
695 1/sec., including the installation of the
caning for 7 tube wells, 7 pumping statl.o:ns,
installation of 10 km. of 800 mm pipe.ir.ne and
of 10.1 kvn. of smaller diameter feeder lines;
and,
3, Doubling of certain sections of trunk pipe-
lines of Sahel North. Work will include t!.e
following:
V/    A section known as phase  "c" will be constructed beginning 1968,
by RDE outside the project.  Phase "a" will be implemented about 1975.

Foreign Exchange Component of Project
le        The foreign exchange of the project has been computed from:
a.   An analysis carried out by SOGETHA on the com-
position of costs for water supply projects in
Tunisia; and,
b.   Assumption made by the mission on whether con-
tracts would be awarded to foreign or local
suppliers or contractors.
The foreign exchange component of contracts awarded to foreign suppliers
was calculated on the base of the c.i.f price. For supplies produced
locally (prestressed concrete pipes) the estimated foreign exchange
element of the net cost of production was assessed.
2.        For civil engineering contracts:
a.   Imported materials were assessed at 10%5 of im-
ported cost, net of duty;
b.   Materials produced domestically and for which the
country is a net importer were taken at 100% of
the net cost of production; and,
c.   For materials produced locally, for which the
country is not a net importer the estimated
foreign exchange element of the net cost of pro-
duction was taken.

Long-Term Debt
1.        Long-term debt has been raised by the government in past years
from various sources, for construction of water supply facilities to be
used by SONEDE. The mission has assumed tnat the debt still outstanding
will be serviced by SONEDE, even for those facilities which will not be
the property of SONEDE (for example, the Cued Kasseb Dam)> When this
subject was discussed during the appraisal mission, the government agreed
in principle but, at that time, the total amount of debt service implied
by this policy was not known. Information now received shows it to be
D500-600,000 per year beginning in 1969, and the government may have
second thoughts in view of this relatively large amount. In any case,
the mechanics of the transfer of interest and principal payment froi,m SON)iEI
to the government or directly to the various lenders will have to 'De worked
out. Details of amounts outstanding are as follows:

TUNISIA NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Statements
Income statements
1l        Production and sales of water in cubic meters are according to
detailed projections shown in Annex 13.
2.        In addition to revenues based on consumption) it has been assumed
that charges equiva'ent to D3 per connection/per year will be added to the
bills. These othler charges are for such items as maintenance of the con-
nections, maintenance and repair of the meters, etc., and presently amount
to about 13% of total revenues.
3,        Rate increases to an average of 60 millimes per cubic meter in
October 1968, 65 millimes in 1971 and 75 millimes in 1974h, have been assunicd.
The government has agreed only to the first increase.
4.       It has been assumed that 10% of total revenues in 1969 will be un-
collectable, reducing to 5% in 197h4 This relatively good performance for
collections is possible because the government has agreed that 100%' of
"administration" bills (abcut 40% of the total) will be paid within 120 days
of the date of issue.
5.        Operating expenses for 1967 are according to the RDE budget ad-
justed slightly downwrard0 Beginning in 1968, operating expenses reflect tre
estimated level of expenditures which would be incurred if the RDE were
adequately staffed and operating on a sound basis. Since all of these cbang-,
are not expected to take place in 1968, operating expenses for the fi-st two
years are probably overstated to some extent. Expenses have been calculated
including the activities now done by STEG, and no paymeint to STEG is shov:n
after 1968. The payment of D45.,000 in 1968 reflects the estimated differenv;F
between STEG7s actual cost and SONEDEts payment, i,e, STEG?s profit on water
activities.
6.        The projection of personnel costs is based on a calculation by
SEMA of personnel requirements for the new organization and reflects a de-
crease in the total number of employees but an increase in upper staff levels.
It also reflects a fairly substantial overall increase in the level of
salaries to bring them in line with salaries paid by comparable institutioas
in Tunisia. After 1968, personnel costs are increased at about 5% per year
to reflect normal increases in salaries and the addition of a few lower leve3
staff to maintain and operate the new facilities which will be put into
operation during the construction period.
7e        Energy costs are based on 1966 costs and are increased proportion-
ately to increases in sales region by region to take into account the dif-



A-MlEX 15
Page 2
ferent energy costs for different systems. No basic change in the cost of
power has been assumed.
8.        The cost of chemicals is based on 1966 consumption, slightly re-
duced to reflect the anticipated operatinig improvements.  wVenty percent
of chemical costs are assunmed to be for chlorine and these costs are in-
creased in proportion to the total production. The remaining 80% is in-
creased in proportion to production for the Tunis system oily, since only
the Tunis system has treatment plants. Proper operation of the treatment
plants should substant-ally reduce the cost of chemicals; on the other
hand, experience in Tunisia indicates that the unit prices of chemicals
increase rapidly and not in relation to general price levels. One factor
should tend to balance the other,
9.        Maintenance expenses have been increased substantially in 1968
and 1969 to reflect the cost of a proper maintenance program whaich the
RDE does not now have, After 1969, maintenance costs ars incr'ea.ed in
proportion to the number of connectioas.
10O.      General expenses, which cover management costs and gene.cal over-,
heads, are increased substantially in 1968 and 1959 to take account of the
newJ accounting, billing and. collecting systems and other li3vJ activLties of
the new organization. Thereafter, costs are increased in proportion to the
number of cornections.
ill       Depreciation rates are assumed to be 2% (as an average) of the
adjusted replacemenit value of assets existing as of the end of 1967, and 2/O
for new assets.

and expenses for 1968, and other financial arrangements for the ch.ango-
over from RDE to SONEDE have been made according to a plan agreed between
the Bank and SONEDE. SONEDE is entitled to all irevenues arising frcm con-
sumption after March 31, 19630  All revenues related to consumption prior
to that date will go to the Treasury, even if collected by SO01EDE in the
futuree  The goverimenit made an initial contribution of capital of Dbi50,r)
to provide SOiNEDE with working cash. Furthaer contributions will be made
in 1968, according to SONEDE's cash needs:
Balance Sheets
149       Under the above arrangeirents, accouInts receivable iwould be zero
in the opering balance sheet.   The amount for 1968 year enid has been
estimated on the basis of current collection rates. For future years, tne
normal level is assumed to be four months sales, with a max.lmum of .
r2,Q0OOO.   Accounts payable for RDE (both operating and capital expenses)
amounted to D851,000 as of July 2, 1968, Of this amcunt, D471,000 has b'eeu
sent to the Treasury for paynient and the government has agreed to pay these
bills promptly,  The remaining D380,000 will appear as accounts payable on



ANNEX 1l
Pge J
S0NEDE2s opening balance sheet, and the government capital contribution
for 1965 will include an amount to settle these bills. Accounts payable
equivalent to one monthts operating expenses have been assumed for the
projected balance sheets of SONEDE.
150       The gross replacement value of fixed assets, according to a
study made by SEAL, was D59.6 million at the end of 1966. The calculation
was on the basis of an invertory of RDE assets expressed in physical
quantities (meters of various diameters of pipe, cubic meters of reservoir
capacity, etc.) multiplied by the present unit costs of the same items.
This method does not produce a realistic valuation, since the system woulci
never be rebuilt in exactly the same way, and many of the facilities are
so old that they would have been long since fu'ly depreciated under any
normal accounting procedure.  We have adjusted this book value using a
co-efficient which attempts to reflect technological change and the prese..;'
physical arrangement of the system. This produces an adjusted gross value
of D42.7 million0 After taking into account the age of tLe various assotcs
and using realistic depreciation rates, the present book vallie relatii.T to
the adjusted gross value above is D2306 million at the end of 1966, T.'ie
value of fixed assets shown in the opening balance sheet of SONEDE refloctE,
in addition, the value of investments made in 1967 and the first par' of
19605  The SONEDE law establishes a commission which wil' set a value for
the assets transferred frot' RDE to SOITEDE. The commission has been
appointed and will begin its work shortly0 Since it will be using the same
basic data as SEMA, the results are likely to be about the same. In ary
case, the Bank has the right under the Loan Agreement to approve the
valuation method used for ca'culation of the rate base.
160       SONEDE will make payments to the government in zioLrrits equivalent
to interest charges and repayment of all outstanding dobt re'ated to the
facilities whlch SONEDE will take over, including service of the debt .or
the Oued Kasseb Dam, which is not an asset   of SONEDEo Details of the ou--
standing debt and interest and amortization charges are shown in Annex 14-
17e       There are two minor influences of SONEDE vs finances not fully r&-
flected in the projections. The first is the cash income from tle payniwnt
of the cost of connections by new customevs,, Certain classes of customers
must pay the full amount in advance, others are extended credit (without
interest) over a ten-year period.   Records cf the RDE do not show how much
has been received from these sources in past years. Some portion appears
in income as charges billed in addition to consumption charges, but the
RDE was unable to give a detailed explanation of the amount shown or of the
amounts (if any) not included in the income account. Ths amount taken irnTo
income for 1966 was D128,808.   This factor has been taken into account from
the income statement point of view, since it is included as a part of the
fixed charges related to each connection. It has not been segregated in
the balance sheets s,nce it becomes a part of the permanent capital of
SONEDE and, in fact, has approximately the same effect as an equivalent
amount of charges related to consumptionO   The second factor is a sales ta~..
charged on water bills and collected by SONEDEo Since the proceeds of this
tax are immediately turned over to the government, there is little or no
effect on SONEE'Es finances.
