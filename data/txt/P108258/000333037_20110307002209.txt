                   DPL1 supports the government's objective of increasing access to online
                   services by citizens in their locality. It will do this through supporting policy
                   and institutional actions that place higher emphasis coordination and
                   increase outreach to citizens.
Program
Development        The loan aligns well with the Country Strategy (CAS) for India covering
Objective(s) and   FY09-12. The DPL will contribute to the CAS' third pillar in which the
Contribution to    WBG commits to support improvements in the organization and delivery of
CAS                publicly-financed services. It will contribute to the CAS' cross-cutting
                   focus on enhancing governance as a pre-requisite for inclusive growth and
                   poverty reduction. By making affordable public services available to
                   citizens, the proposed series of operations can also contribute to the first
                   CAS' pillar of making growth inclusive.


                   The main risks that need to be mitigated are:
                   (i) The percentage of budgetary support by the proposed series of DPLs
                   being very small could impede its leveraging power to establish critical
                   policy and institutional actions ­ mitigated by counterparts in government
                   readily acknowledging that critical institutional actions and policies, rather
                   than financing, is the main gap of the NeGP.
                   (ii) Actions agreed under Pillar 2, and particularly increased participation of
                   users and service orientation of public officials could generate lower results
                   than expected. This risk is mitigated by the success of implementation of
Risks and Risks    Right to Information Act, 2005, which suggests that citizens--once
Mitigation         introduced into NeGP's implementation--will play a strong role.
                   (iii) NeGP's decentralized implementation arrangements make it difficult
                   for any one department, such as DIT, to coordinate across such a wide range
                   of implementing agencies. This risk is mitigated by existing mechanisms to
                   coordinate among these implementing agencies and oversight of the
                   program's implementation by the Prime Minister's Committee on NeGP
                   and the Apex Committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary. The DPL
                   supports coordination of the NeGP and monitoring of MMPs utilizing
                   indicators that generate information relevant to the level of decision-
                   making.

                                        I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This Program Document proposes policy-based budget support to assist the Government of
India (GoI, "the government") in implementation of its National e-Governance Plan (NeGP). The
ambitious goal of this government-wide initiative is to make all government services accessible to the
common man (citizen) in his locality, through common service delivery outlets and ensure efficiency,
transparency and reliability of such services at affordable costs to realize basic needs.

2.       NeGP is the GoIs flagship e-governance initiative to radically transform service delivery
across the country. The backbone of NeGP is the introduction of a massive new IT infrastructure with
State Data Centers in all states / UTs, State Wide Area Networks (SWANs) co nnecting all levels of
government down to the block level (India is made up of about 600 districts and each district is sub -
divided into blocks) and 250,000 IT enabled Common Services Centers (CSCs) providing one-stop access
to e-services virtually at the doorstep of most Indian villages. India's rapidly growing mobile phone
network will also be used to further expand the access of citizens to various e-services. NeGP has
identified 27 priority projects to be transformed using e-delivery, with each one designated as a Mission
Mode Project (MMP) owned and spearheaded by a relevant ministry/agency of the national and / or state
government with concrete service level targets, timelines, process reengineering plans, and project
implementation teams.

3.       NeGP is designed to target the most basic points of interaction between citizens and the
state including birth and death registration, tax filing, land records, driver's licenses and vehicle
registration, passports and visas, agricultural extension services, and a wide range of municipal and
panchayat services. It will also enable much wider access to a number of critical private sector services
such as banking, insurance, and trade. Initiatives like e procurement and e office are designed to increase
efficiencies within the government. The goal of the program is to increase the efficiency, equity and
transparency of services by reducing the burden of physical visits to separate agencies, providing ready
access to information about the availability of services, and reducing the discretion of officials in the
delivery of those services.

4.       NeGP was approved in May 2006 as a national program, coordinated at the Cabinet level,
to replace an ad hoc array of e-governance initiatives across individual agencies and states that had
developed throughout the 1980s and 1990s. NeGP introduced a comprehensive common strategy for
the expansion and integration of e-services. It laid the plans for a common IT infrastructure to
significantly widen citizen access to e-services. It also set out common standards, specifications, and
policies to ensure that individual e-services fit together, allowing sharing and cross-referencing of
information across services (inter-operability). Most importantly, NeGP was intended to increase the
momentum fuelling the expansion of e-governance through a nationally recognized initiative coordinated
and monitored at the highest level of government. The multi-year program is well-funded with an
indicative allocation of around $9 billion so far. It also relies on a strong component of partnership with
India's dynamic IT industry in the private sector, recognizing the need to tap into their financing,
innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

5.       The program is expected to have significant social benefits for the poor through expanded
access, and improved citizen engagement in e-services. The e-District MMP provides services related
to social welfare schemes, pensions, certificates, dues and recovery, PDS related services for food and
essential items, rural health, compensation and relief packages, grievance services, RTI etc. The e-
Panchayat MMP aims at improving governance at the grassroots level, and providing various e-services
at the village level. The Employment Exchange MMP aims to provide e-services and information to
employers and employment seekers. The Agriculture MMP aims at providing information regarding farm
practices, market trends, and technical know-how to the farming community. The CSCs will function as

                                                    1
front-end delivery points for the delivery of public and social services in an integrated manner, to rural
and remote areas. The goal of providing one CSC for every six census villages will enable the scheme to
reach remote villages, and allow the rural population to access e-service. Higher internet penetration
rates, especially in rural India, and utilization of mobile phones for delivering e-services will benefit rural
and remote communities. In order that even less literate people in villages can access services, facilitators
will be available at the CSCs to provide assistance.

6.       Unique identity numbers (UID), currently under development, will assist citizens access to
online services. The government has established the Unique Identification Authority of India to develop
and implement the necessary institutional, technical and legal infrastructure for issuing unique identity
numbers to Indian residents. The unique identity numbers will be used for efficient delivery of welfare
services and to monitor implementation of various government programs and schemes, notably those
focusing on poverty-reduction. UID-based access to government systems will only reach its full potential
after a critical mass of 600 million citizens has been registered by the end of 2014. Until that time, online
government services will use other electronic authentication methods. The government plans to utilize
UID to better target kerosene, cooking gas and fertilizer subsidies to the poor.

7.      Though NeGP has made substantial progress since its adoption, implementation l ags behind
the GoIs expectations. A majority of citizens in rural areas still do not have access to e-services: only
89,000 of the 250,000 panchayats have facilities where rural users can access public services online. The
government wants to increase pace at which public services are offered on-line: this will happen when
more states are implementing their e-governance projects. Instead of accessing services in the locality, a
person seeking a public service still has to travel long distances to public offices because only the local
public official can definitely identify him. Even for services being offered online, users are
inconvenienced because the government's computer applications are not inter-operable. The potential of
e-services to improve governance is not fully realized as most online services have so far been driven by
technology inputs rather than users' convenience. Although overseen at the highest level, NeGP's
monitoring has not generated information to compare achievements across agencies and states, or whether
an online delivery is achieving its service improvement targets.

8.       GoI recognizes that the uneven progress of NeGP has not been primarily due to funding
constraints or the absence of specific investments, but rather to cross-cutting policy and
coordination issues at a program level. Government policies still need to be formulated and
institutional actions taken in such key areas as government process re-engineering, the use of mobile
phones in accessing services, citizen engagement in the design of e-services, and the framework for PPPs
in public service delivery. Technical standards need to be developed and deployed in the areas of system
inter-operability and security. A comprehensive program of institutional strengthening is needed to
address the uneven progress in specific states and agencies as well as to re-orient officials to new ways of
interacting with citizens. A stronger methodology and implementation framework for monitoring and
impact assessment is required to track progress, to ensure coordination, and to focus central assistance in
areas requiring additional support.

9.       Given the nature of these implementation constraints, GoI has requested programmatic
support from the World Bank for NeGP. The Bank has maintained a six-year engagement with the
Department of Information Technology (DIT) on the development of NeGP, which initially began as
preparation for a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) that eventually proved unnecessary to cover the
intended investment requirements. However, the partnership formed between the Bank and DIT led to
requests for additional Bank engagement to use programmatic IBRD assistance to leverage the policy
changes, institutional actions and cross-government coordination necessary to accelerate the NeGP's
implementation. Preparation for a results-focused series of Development Policy Loans (DPLs) has helped
identify government-wide policy and institutional gaps and coordination issues hindering progress in the

                                                      2
implementation of NeGP. The multi-year nature of the proposed programmatic support has led to the
identification of outcomes and intermediate benchmarks to be used jointly by the government and IBRD
to track implementation progress. As a result, the proposed DPLs will be used by the GoI as a focal point
to convene the associated departments and levels of government around a concrete reform agenda.

10.      The development objective of the proposed series of DPLs is ,,to increase access to online
services by citizens in their localities." thus supporting a major part of the NeGP's overall goal. It will
assist the government do this through supporting policy and institutional actions that constitute a higher
emphasis on coordination in the NeGP, and increased outreach to citizens. GoI is requesting a series of
two single tranche DPLs: in IBRD's FY11 and FY 13. This document focuses on the first operation of the
series, referred to as DPL1, within the broader programmatic framework. The government's Letter of
Development Policy is attached in Annex 1. The direct implementing partner is the Department of
Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology which serves as the
secretariat for NeGP's Apex Committee. Policy actions will engage all relevant ministries and states
implementing MMPs under NeGP. As the Apex Committee monitors the implementation for all NeGP -
funded MMPs, there is a leveraging mechanism to promote the adoption of the specified policy actions,
standards, and capacity support across the participating ministries and state governments. The GoI budget
will also provide additional support for the coordination functions of DIT in the implementation of NeGP.

11.      To increase citizens access to e-services, this programmatic series specifies a range of
concrete results. The outcomes will focus on improving the implementation of the various MMPs which
will affect the number, quality and accessibility of e-services. The program does not target specific
services per se (e.g number of passports or drivers' licenses issued on line), but policy improvements that
will affect all services. It includes policy and institutional actions to assist the GoI to reach its target of
250,000 CSCs. It will enable more services to be delivered through mobile phone networks. It will
enhance the number of e-services that are developed with common standards of inter-operability and
security to ensure greater integration across different e-services and across levels of government. It will
address the uneven pace of NeGP implementation by ensuring more coordinated central support to low-
capacity states and agencies thus increasing the number of services offered in those areas. It will ensure
that more e-services are developed with citizen participation to encourage more user-friendly applications
and greater user satisfaction. It will encourage the adoption of government process re-engineering and re-
training of officials to make sure that the technological advances actually change the customer experience
in obtaining more efficiently, more equitably and with greater transparency. The full Operation Policy
Matrix defining the expected results and indicators is attached in Annex 5.

                                   II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

                      A. RECENT ECONOMIC D EVELOPMENTS IN INDIA

12.      The Government of India has made conscious policy decisions to contain the effects of the global
crisis on the Indian economy. The effect of the crisis on economic growth was therefore relatively mild,
and India's economy has since recovered relatively quickly. The budget 2011-12 has reinforced the
inclusive growth orientation of the government. It emphasizes restoration of GDP growth to 9 percent
while making growth more broad based and ensuring supply-demand imbalances are better managed. The
Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-2012) - with its emphasis, inter alia, on inclusive, sustainable growth and
delivery of public services - provides the overall strategic thrust for economic policy for the next two
years. Adjustments in macro-economic management policies and targets to address the effects of the
global crisis are consistent with this framework.

13.     The recovery of the Indian economy appears robust. GDP growth (at factor cost) reached
close to 9 percent in the latest two quarters (April to September 2010) as compared with 7.4 percent in

                                                      3
fiscal year (FY) 2009-10. The recent quick estimate of output growth put out by the government raises
the full year estimate for FY10 to 8 percent (up from the earlier estimate of GDP at factor cost of 7.4
percent); for GDP at market prices, the estimate has been raised from 7.7 percent to 9.1 percent. On the
expenditure side, a resurgence of investment contributed to the recovery, but private consumption growth
is now also picking up. On the production side, the agricultural sector grew very slowly in FY 2009-10
due to failure of monsoons, but a strong rebound in the first half of FY 2010-11 materialized as expected.
The industrial sector registered double-digit growth for the three most recent quarters.

14.      Wholesale price inflation has been steadily declining in recent months on the back of a
favorable base effect and declining food inflation. The WPI inflation rate dropped to 7.5 percent in
Nov 2010, but resurgence in food prices in November and December has reignited concerns over food
inflation. Additional concerns stem from the recent increase in energy and mineral prices in the world
markets.

15.      The merchandise trade deficit seems to have peaked in August 2010 and is moderating.
A rising merchandise trade deficit pushed the current account deficit to its largest value ever (in US$
terms) in FY2009-10. The trade deficit continued to widen initially in FY2010-11, as imports recovered
more strongly than exports from the slowdown and the great trade collapse during the global financial
crisis. The trade deficit reached US$13bn in August 2010 but has come down to US$9.4 billion in
September-October. Regarding capital inflows, portfolio inflows have been strong, with net inflows of
$52.6 billion during April-October 2010. While FDI held up well during the global crisis, recent numbers
showed a decline for the April-October 2010. Loans from external sources have recovered strongly and
now constitute the biggest item in the capital account. With the significant inflation differential between
India and its trading partners, the rupee's real effective exchange rate (REER) strengthened.

16.      Indias macroeconomic policy framework has been adequate to respond to the global
financial crisis and set the stage for a return to high growth rates. Monetary policy was eased
significantly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 with a reduction in policy rates by
more than 400 basis points, and liquidity injections through lower prudential ratios and open market
operations. The fiscal deficit widened by 3.5 percent of GDP through tax reductions and expenditure
increases in FY2008-09 compared with the previous year, and some further expansion in FY2009-10.
Government demand supported GDP growth in the second half of FY2008-09, when private demand
slumped. Monetary policy rates were tightened significantly in steps starting in October 2009. Overall,
the RBI has raised the Repo and Reverse Repo rate by 175basis points and the statutory Cash Reserve
Requirement by 225bps since the lows of the global financial crisis. The rates (Repo at 6.25 percent and
Reverse Repo at 5.50 percent) are still well below the peaks reached during the global commodity price
boom in 2008 (9 and 6 percent, respectively).

17.      In the fiscal area, the budget for FY2010-11 cautiously rolled back some of the stimulus
measures adopted in the second half of FY2008-09. It targets a fiscal deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP in
FY2010-11, down from an estimated 6.8 percent deficit in the previous year (6.9 percent when off-budget
financing of subsidies is included). The government received a massive windfall revenue of close to Rs.1
trillion (US$20 billion, equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP) from auctions of wireless spectrum. Tax
revenue collections during the first quarter of FY2010/11 show an increase of 28.6 percent over the same
quarter in the previous year. The government has stressed its intention to return over the next two years
to a fiscal deficit level that is consistent with the requirements of the F iscal Responsibility and Budget
Management Act.

               B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

18.      Over the medium term, strong economic growth is likely to be sustained in India. GDP
growth for FY2010-11 and FY2011-12 is likely to be around 9 percent. Uncertainty about the outlook
comes from the fact that the high growth of the last two quarters appears to be a rebound from the low
levels of a year earlier, and resulted partly from restocking and execution of purchases that had been
postponed. Growth could, therefore, appear somewhat weaker in subsequent quarters. A renewed surge
in international commodity prices, especially food and fuel, also cloud the outlook.

19.      While overall inflation is expected to moderate, higher food prices spilling over into non-
food inflation is a concern. WPI inflation is projected to fall to 6.5 percent by end-March 2011 and 4-5
percent by the end of FY2011-12. Inflation is now mostly driven by second-round effects of the food
price pressure on non-food inflation. There is a risk that this core inflation will become entrenched as it
spills over into formal wage settlements, but the spread effects are likely to be small as formal sector jobs
are only about 15 percent of total employment. A renewed increase in international food and energy
commodity prices could also lead to a renewed price spiral in India, similar to what was observed in
FY2007-08.

20.    On the balance of payments front, growing services surpluses and net transfers have
compensated for rising trade deficits in the past. However, the picture now looks less benign.
Extrapolating from the trends in merchandise trade, services and transfers, the remainder of the current


                                                               6
fiscal year would produce a current account deficit of around US$40-50 billion for FY2010-11, an
increase from the record deficit recorded in FY2009-10.

21.      Capital inflows are expected to continue to be strong but risks remain. Portfolio investments
will likely remain at levels similar to those observed recently, although volatility could be high. At current
levels of inflows, the capital account surplus would be sufficient to cover the current account gap.
However, renewed shocks to the global financial system could quickly change investor perceptions and
lead to another flight to safety.

22.      The RBIs reserves remain high and could be deployed to cushion any sudden stop in
capital inflows in the short term. The RBI has shown during the global financial crisis that it can deploy
reserves quickly to cushion sudden devaluation pressure on the rupee, while it has also shown its ability
to smoothen volatility stemming from sudden spikes in inflows. During the capital inflow boom in late
2007 and early 2008, the RBI also sterilized money created by its foreign exchange interventions, but was
later able to unwind these operations. Therefore, it is not hampered in its polic y implementation by these
earlier operations. The monetary policy space is therefore open. However, the RBI has demonstrated its
commitment to a floating exchange rate in principle, so there is a likelihood that the burden of managing
economic fluctuations, even shocks, will be borne in a balanced manner among the macroeconomic
instruments available to the government.

23.      The fiscal consolidation targeted in the Union Budget for the FY2010-11 and beyond has to
take place in an environment of rising demand for government services and infrastructure
financing. With the buoyancy in tax revenue so far, the central government deficit target is likely to be
achieved despite the additional spending bills. Important reforms of fertilizer and fuel pricing should
reduce the burden of subsidies going forward. However, two additional spending bills, amounting to 1.7
percent of GDP, were recently authorized by the Parliament. This will result in additional expenditure of
0.9 percent as the balance would be met out of re-appropriation of savings from already authorized
expenditures. -Requirement of food subsidies may increase depending on how the contours of the
proposed new food security bill finally develops. Apart from reforms to subsidies and under-recoveries
of costs of provision of services, improved efficiency in service delivery is needed to free up resources for
an expansionary consolidation as envisaged by the 13th Finance Commission. The roll-out of services
to underserved areas will facilitate the e-governance approach supported by this operation. The
government's fiscal consolidation effort during FY2010-11 is expected to result in a deficit of 5.1 percent
of GDP, against a target of 5.5 percent. The government's budget for 2011-12 targets a fiscal deficit of 4.6
percent of GDP. The Government has, in the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement laid before
Parliament on 28th February, 2011, announced its intention to carry on fiscal consolidation to target a
fiscal deficit of 4.1percent of GDP in FY2012-13 and 3.5 percent in FY 2013-14.

24.      Both World Bank and IMF assessments conclude that the macroeconomic framework as
well as growth prospects is adequate for medium-to-long term debt sustainability. While the debt-to-
GDP ratio has traditionally been high in India, it is projected to decline significantly over the next few
years. India has never faced debt distress despite high debt compared with its peers. This is partly due to
the fact that external public debt is only about 5 percent of GDP and high statutory reserve requirements
provide a captive market for government securities. The medium-term consolidation path, as
recommended by the 13 th Finance Commission, targets an explicit debt ceiling of 68 percent of GDP by
FY2014-15, as compared with 75 percent in FY2009-10.

  III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

25.     The NeGPs activities follow two main streams:
        Selection of public services that most affect the lives of citizens and transforming government
processes to enable these services' delivery via electronic channels; and
        Establishing a nation-wide infrastructure that can allow information to be shared electronically
between different agencies and levels of government.

26.      Within this first stream, Mission Mode Projects                      Box 1. Income Tax MMP
(MMPs) have been established to transform public services.
The government first selected high priority services, which          This MMP enables all income tax payers

have different objectives, expected service levels, and are at
varying stages of implementation--as summarized in Annex 2. Table 2 below lists the MMPs along with
year of approval, funds allocated and utilized.

27.      The second stream of NeGP comprises IT infrastructure to transmit electronic information.
This includes:
         State Wide Area Networks (SWANs), which are the backbone network for data, voice and video
throughout for states and UTs. Within a state, the SWAN connects the state headquarters with all district
headquarters, and each district headquarter with all block headquarters. SWAN also connects offices
within each of these levels -- allowing communication between 20 offices at the state level, 10 at district
level and 5 at block level with bandwidth of up to 2 Mbps.
         State Data Centers (SDCs) in all states/UTs provide the common secure IT infrastructure to host
state-level e-government applications and data. SDCs are functioning in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Tripura,
and are under implementation in 14 other states.
         Common Services Centers (CSCs) are ICT enabled service delivery points at the village level to
provide citizens with access to public and private services through a one-stop shop facility. NeGP plans to
create 250,000 CSCs across the country, of which 89, 000 are currently functioning. The growth of CSCs
has been limited by the low level of broadband connections (10 million connections in India as compared
with 260 million in China).
         The National e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway, along with State e-Governance Service
Delivery Gateways, are part of the core IT infrastructure for achieving standards-based interoperability
and exchange of information between various departments and different levels of government. The
national gateway is at National Informatics Data Center in Delhi with a Disaster Recovery site at
Hyderabad.

30.     NeGP enjoys strong ownership at the highest levels of central and state governments. At the
Center, while Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure (CCI) takes programme level policy decisions, the
Prime Minister's Committee on NeGP (with representation drawn from relevant ministries/departments,
Planning Commission, Industry experts etc.) provides leadership, prescribes deliverables and milestones,
and monitors the implementation of NeGP. A National e-Governance Advisory Group headed by the
Minister, Communications & Information Technology, with representatives from state governments, line
ministries, industry and academia solicits views of external stakeholders, provides inputs for policy
decisions and advises government on strategic interventions necessary for accelerating introduction of e-
governance across central and state government ministries and departments.

31.     The overall program implementation is coordinated by an Apex Committee of Secretaries headed
by the Cabinet Secretary, with DIT functioning as the secretariat. In the states, an Apex Committee,
headed by Chief Secretary, provides overall implementation oversight and inter-departmental
coordination. Leaders of NeGP's mission mode projects comprise a council that discusses implementation
issues and its collective recommendations are transmitted to the Apex Committee. This helps coordination
amongst the agencies implementing MMPs. This mechanism, along with States' IT ministers serving on
NeGP's National Advisory Group helps communicate implementation issues to the Apex Committee.

32.      Implementation of the NeGP involves several central ministries/departments and state
governments with well defined roles and responsibilities of each involved agency :
         Line ministries/departments are responsible for the implementation of the assigned MMPs or their
components.
         State governments are responsible for implementing State Sector MMPs, under the overall
guidance of respective line ministries. DIT is the facilitator and catalyst for the implementation of NeGP
and provides technical assistance to various ministries and state governments. In addition, it oversees
implementation of the cross-cutting infrastructure and technical components, implements pilots and
special projects, and provides capacity support to other implementing agencies.
         Department of Administrative Reform, Pensions & Grievances provides general guidance on
process re-engineering and change management. For each MMP, however, implementing agency is
primarily responsible for carrying out the required process reengineering and change management. The

department and DIT also promote initiatives for human resource development, training and awareness
building.
        Planning Commission and Ministry of Finance allocate funds for NeGP through Plan and Non-
plan budgetary provisions and lay down appropriate procedures in this regard.

33.      NeGP was developed through extensive consultations. NeGP was formulated in 2006 on the
basis of extensive consultations that included central government ministries and departments, states' IT
secretaries, industry representatives, civil society groups, and academia. Prioritization of the 27 MMPs
emerged from this consultative process. At the central level, NeGP was deliberated in both the legislature
and the executive through the Parliament's Standing Committee on IT (2005-06) and the Committee of
Secretaries (March 2006).

34.      DIT continues an interactive process to engage with various stakeholders on NeGP. Funds
allocated to implement these consultation / outreach activities amount to about Rs. 470 million over 2010-
12 under the Awareness and Communication component of NeGP.
         E-governance workshops are organized annually. Five regional consultation workshops have
been held in 2010 with participation from 21 states and

common branding strategy for all services that come online has been approved to ensure that more
citizens recognize the NeGP's e-service brand.
         DIT regularly seeks the views of civil society groups on NeGP implementation. It organizes
conferences and exhibitions with industry partners, including NASSCOM, Manufacturer's Association
for Information Technology, Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, Confederation of
Indian Industry and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. DIT has developed a
comprehensive website providing information on NeGP and its implementation, details on various
services provided by the MMPs, and services accessible to citizens and businesses. There are separate
pages on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter - for CSCs and NeGP where citizens can provide
feedback.

35.     However, user participation in the design and evaluation of projects has not been sufficient.
Despite these consultations and awareness building activities, the government's 2008 and 2010 Impact
Assessments of NeGP projects found that projects have suffered on account of insufficient user



                                                     12
involvement in design and evaluation. Currently, there is a limited citizen input into the design of MMPs
and their feedback on service quality is not sought systematically.

36.      Despite some impressive achievements in individual projects, the overall access and quality
of e-services are still modest. Improved IT only constitutes part of the solution. Such improvements need
to be matched by re-engineered government processes that make the most of IT enhancements. At the
same time, public officials need to change their attitudes towards addressing the needs of their clients
rather than internal procedures.

37.      NeGPs "centralized initiative, decentralized implementation" character is well-suited to the
countrys administrative structure, but also presents challenges. Only half of the MMPs have started
delivering services. State MMPs have made less progress than central ones. Of the 299 different types of
services targeted by NeGP for online delivery by 2014, only 48 have been made available and only in
some of the states. E-readiness assessments of states undertaken by The National Council for Applied
Economic Research continue to find significant disparity across states. States have uneven capacity to
prepare and implement their own projects. Moreover, many states do not have sufficient expertise in the

                                   Box 4. Transport MMP: variation across states

 Online services are related to vehicle registration, licenses and permits for operating commercial vehicles on
 designated routes. Standardized software is being implemented by all Road Transport Officers in the country, but
 the pace of implementation of this MMP varies between states. A 2010 impact assessment commissioned by DIT
 found: In one state, users' perceptions of service quality have improved significantly, though the cost has not
 changed. The average waiting time at the service delivery point has gone down from 128 minutes to 76 minutes.
 The status of applications can be seen on the internet and applicants receive text messages on their cell phones
 when their cases are ready. One percent reported paying bribes.

 In another state, the transport department's computerized centers are still managed by agents who, at many times,
 do not even allow the actual users to go near the counters. There are serpentine queues of agents standing in front
 of the counters. Most users did not even know that a computerized system was in place.

types of PPP arrangements that are so critical for tapping private sector technical expertise and financing.
The monitoring of NeGP in such a decentralized structure has also proven challenging.

38.      Through detailed stakeholder consultations and review of NeGP at various levels, DIT has
identified 8 major impediments which are affecting the accelerated rollout of e services. The identified
impediments are listed in Table 3 below.

             IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                                A. LINK TO COUNTRY STRATEGY

39.      The loan aligns well with the Country Strategy for India (Report No. 46509 -IN), covering
FY09-12. The objectives of the operation fit directly under the CAS' third pillar of improving public
service delivery. In the strategy, the WBG commits to support improvements in the organization and
delivery of publicly-financed services. The emphasis is on strengthening institutional arrangements and
implementation procedures. Support to the NeGP's vision of making all government services accessible
to citizens in their locality, and ensuring efficiency, transparency and reliability of such services at
affordable costs will, therefore, contribute directly to the goals of this pillar. In addition, the CAS
includes a cross-cutting focus on enhancing governance as a pre-requisite for inclusive growth and
poverty reduction. The proposed DPL is in line with third pillar of the CAS, while directly contributing


                                                     14
to the cross cutting theme of improving governance. By making affordable public services available to
citizens, the proposed series of operations can also contribute to the first CAS pillar of making growth
inclusive.

40.     The Country Strategy includes support through programmatic DPLs, built on dialogue and
underpinned by analytical work. The CAS recognizes that DPLs can address systemic issues and
support cross-cutting reforms in selected areas, including governance. The WBG plays an important role
in building dialogue and capacity through DPLs. While the discussion on DPLs is focused on low
income states, the CAS explicitly articulates the rationale for a DPL in support of India' national e-
Governance Plan.

                  B. COLLABORATION WITH IMF AND OTHER DONORS

41.     The Bank and the IMF consult regularly on key economic and institutional issues. Growth
projections and macroeconomic forecasts -- some of which are presented in this program document --
are discussed regularly between the two institutions. The Bank was informed of the IMF's Article IV
assessment discussions in 2009-10. The IMF's Public Information Notice for Article IV consultations
with India is attached at Annex 3.

42.     DITs program managers and the Bank team have closely worked with the UNDP, which
had actively supported e-governance initiatives in India under its ICT4D program. During 2003-07,
UNDP provided support for 10 pilot projects under the NeGP program--including the very successful
urban citizen services in Bangalore, agri-business centers in Kerala, integrated planning and monitoring
by panchayats in West Bengal, village information kiosks in Gujarat, and e-procurement in Karnataka.

43.      Collaboration with other development agencies was also achieved through InfoDev (a
partnership of international development agencies, coordinated and served by a Secretariat housed at the
World Bank) supporting about a dozen pilot e-governance initiatives in India. The first e-Readiness
Assessment Study in 2003 was supported by Infodev. Consultations with other main donors (such as
UK's Department for International Development and USAID) on e-services in education, health and other
sectors have been ongoing.

                        C. RELATIONSHIP WITH BANK OPERATIONS

44.      The Bank is implementing 19 e-governance initiatives in India through ICT components of
investment projects in different sectors (listed in Annex 4) such as education, health, urban and rural
development, irrigation, and social welfare. These project components aim to improve government
effectiveness and public service delivery in different sectors and thematic domains. These and other
NeGP initiatives will benefit from common service delivery policies, supporting legislative framework,
citizen and stakeholder consultations, shared ICT infrastructure, technology standards, technical
assistance, monitoring and organized knowledge sharing networks.

                                      D. LESSONS LEARNED

45.     The current operation benefits from lessons learned during preparation of the previous SIL
operation. These include the understanding of the critical importance of political support and extensive
stakeholder consultations, particularly with target beneficiaries, the key role of public private
partnerships, the need for sustainable business models and sound contracting, and the consequent need for
well conceived knowledge management initiatives to nurture, motivate, train and retain key human
resources.


                                                   15
46.      It draws upon advice from leaders of the most innovative and successful e -government
projects in the country. The e-Choupal project demonstrated that ICT could be harnessed to re-define
the agriculture supply chain and directly benefit farmers through access to market information. The
Bhoomi project demonstrated the tremendous potential of computerized land records to improve small
and marginal farmers' access to finance. E-Sewa and other projects based on citizen service centers
provided valuable lessons on ways to provide more efficient, easily accessible public services through the
use of information technology solutions and innovative public- private partnerships.

47.     This operation benefits from lessons learned from many countries on broad e -governance
policy and institutional reforms with the goal of improving delivery of services and particularly
coordinated management of IT and e-services across sectors and levels of government, and integrating the
use of mobile phone networks as outreach mechanism. These lessons were learned through experience
with more than 12 Bank-financed e-governance operations under implementation and preparation - in
Armenia, Bangladesh, Eastern Caribbean, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Moldova, Morocco, Rwanda, Sri
Lanka, Tunisia, and Vietnam. Lessons were also drawn from Bank-supported knowledge exchange with a
group of leading government Chief Information Officers from the governments of Australia, Canada,
Estonia, the European Union, India, Singapore, the UK and the US.

48.      The design of the operation also benefits from lessons learned from the Banks extensive
portfolio of DPLs.
         Ensuring strong ownership at the highest levels of government as well as at the technical level is
essential for increasing commitment to the project development objectives and facilitating
implementation.
         Capacity can constrain reform efforts, especially when officials have other significant
responsibilities. Progress is generally strongest where adequate capacity either already exists or can be
mobilized effectively.
         Reforms work well in a programmatic framework. This allows continuity of support to a
medium-term program of reforms that can leverage stronger reforms over a period of time. Using
successive single tranche loans is an effective way to assist structural reform, provided it is linked to an
agreed medium-term reform program with broadly defined milestones and transparent triggers per
subsequent operation.
         Identifying good indicators to gauge progress can be difficult, especially in a program for
institutional strengthening. Wider DPL experience shows the difficulty in finding suitable indicators of
progress when attribution is difficult. Also, it can be problematic to identify outcome indicators on which
data is available within the relatively short timeframe of a DPL series.

                                E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

49.      The policy agenda of this operation has been informed by the wide-ranging set of analytical
work undertaken by the government. The design of this DPL has been influenced by the consistent
messages from the analyses: the main focus in e-governance must be on governance reforms with
technology being used as a tool for transformation of governmental processes, adoption of a step-by-step
approach, completing re-engineering of government systems and procedures, constant monitoring and
evaluation, use of local languages, bringing government and its services closer to citizens, and promoting
accountability, transparency and responsiveness in government functioning. All eight policy areas
prioritized under the proposed DPL are among the 17 actions recommended by Second Administrative
Reforms Commission in their 11th report, Promoting e-Governance ­ The Smart Way Forward 2008.
This was based on an exhaustive analysis of the nature, progress, principles, implementation strategies,
resources, legal framework, and results of e-governance initiatives in India and the world. Earlier, the
design of the NeGP's institutional framework at center, ministry and state levels had been guided by


                                                    16
Assessment of International Practices ­ Program and Fund Management for e-Governance Initiatives,
(PricewaterhouseCoopers) commissioned in 2004 which summarizes experience of 23 countries in
designing and implementing program management institutions and fund management systems for
promoting e-governance.

50.      The design of the DPL has relied on a number of assessments of existing e-governance initiatives,
including:

                               V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                  A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

52.      The overarching development objective of the proposed DPL series is increasing access to
online services by citizens in their localities. It will do this through supporting policy and institutional
actions in two pillars:
         Higher emphasis on coordination. This will contribute to government's push for providing
more services online; and
         Increased outreach to citizens which will pull a greater number of services online.

53.     The proposed operations will support specific policy measures within the government's overall e-
governance reform agenda that have been mutually agreed as critical to the program. The next section
describes the individual actions within the broad framework that form the legal basis for disbursement of
the proposed DPL1. All the prior actions for DPL1 have already been met. Moreover, since the
operation is the first in a new programmatic series, the Bank and the government are identifying some

                                                    17
indicative triggers for a possible follow-on operation through a process of mutual consultations. It is
expected that DPL2 will be processed on the basis of the strength of the overall program and once the
relevant indicative triggers are met. DPL2 triggers will be further developed and refined in consultation
with the government.

54.     GoIs macroeconomic policies are fully conducive to IBRD support via a DPL as has been
elaborated earlier in Section II B of this program document. An earlier SIL had set out to provide IBRD
support to investments in IT infrastructure and capacity building through training initiatives. However,
GoI came to the conclusion that Bank support for specific IT investments would not provide the leverage
for more systemic policy and institutional actions across several departments and levels of government.
As implementation of NeGP progressed, policy and institutional gaps became more pr ominent as an
impediment to progress than the financing gaps for specific investments. Though the SIL was abandoned,
GoI requested a new operation to reflect the changing implementation priorities. Good practice principles
for conditionality have been followed in this DPL and are summarized in Annex 6.

                                          B. POLICY AREAS

55.      The following policy areas will be supported by the proposed DPL under its two pillars .
This section summarizes--by policy area--the description, challenges faced by the government, actions
undertaken or planned by the government as part of the DPL, and the expected results. The methodology
for selecting indicators for results of the program is explained in Annex 7.

                               Pillar 1. Higher emphasis on coordination

                           1.1 Strengthen states' institutions in e-governance.

56.     Description: Slow implementation of NeGP is of concern to the government: only one sixth of
funds allocated to central MMPs and one-twelfth of funds to state MMPs have been spent. The
government's e-readiness assessments have confirmed uneven capacity in states and departments, which
has become a significant barrier to progress especially in the area of PPPs critical to access private sector
financing and technical expertise.

57.     Challenge: Some states and agencies are facing capacity constraints in preparing the Detailed
Project Reports required for NeGP funding or for PPP arrangements. They need to be able to identify the
demand for e-services, build a viable business model, plan and execute complex procurements, negotiate
financial and legal arrangements. There are examples of successful PPPs (e.g. MCA 21, e-passport and e-
procurement in Karnataka), but they are a relatively small number compared with the scale of NeGP.

58.      Government actions to address the challenge: DIT has established a dedicated National e-
Governance Division (NeGD) to house the NeGP's program management team that provides guidance
and support to implementing agencies. Since mid-2010, key positions in the National e Governance
Division have been filled--including the position of CEO. DIT has developed a states' institutional
strengthening program. As part of it, a capacity building scheme for Rs 3130 million has been approved
under NeGP to address both human resource and training requirements for e-governance in States and
UTs. In order to enhance the capabilities of the States/UTs to conceptualize and implement e Governance
initiatives, DIT through NeGD is hiring and providing professional resources to the States. A project
development support fund will provide resources to ensure that all States can prepare e-governance
project proposals. Finally, DIT will assist states to develop PPPs by providing guidelines, model
concession agreements and experts.



                                                     18
59.     PPPs in e-governance is being facilitated by the IT Amendment Act 2008, wherein a new section
6A was inserted to allow authorized service providers including private entities to collect, retain and
appropriate service charges as prescribed by the government. The DIT has gained experience with PPPs
during the implementation of the NeGP's core infrastructure, and especially for SWANs and CSCs. A
concept paper enunciating the guidelines of the proposed PPP policy has been drafted and discussed with
the MMP leaders.

60.     Specific measures under the proposed operation: States' e-government mission teams, staffed
with experts recruited centrally, have been established. The government has begun implementation of a
program to strengthen the institutional foundation of e-governance program at the state level and Prior
Action 1 of 7 has been met. The government will establish a Project Development Support Fund to
provide initial funding for technical, financial and legal experts, undertaking demand assessment, service
charges assessment, consultation with industry service providers and industry associations, and citizen
consultation. Building upon the principles of strategic control in outsourced projects, the government will
prepare an approach to PPPs in e-governance projects in consultation with stakeholders.

Prior action 1 of 7: The government has developed a comprehensive policy for institutional
strengthening program and has commenced its implementation by assisting state governments in
preparing and implementing e-governance projects.

Indicative trigger for DPL2: Government has approved a policy for PPPs in e-governance projects and
issued templates for model concession agreements.

61.     Expected results: The institutional strengthening program will support more robust
implementation of NeGP in less advanced states by increasing their capacity to prepare and implement e-
governance initiatives. It should also lay the foundation for greater private sector participation through
PPPs in e-governance efforts as private partners, financial institutions, and investors will be better
informed about the business potential of e-services. This should result in the implementation of a larger
number of NeGP project proposals from states. This will help in decreasing the gap between the more and
the less advanced states as well as help in getting more e-services delivered through the PPP mode.
Ultimately, this should lead to more services available online.

                                  1.2 Development of technical standards.
62.     Standards for e-governance are critical for ensuring sharing of information and seamless
interoperability of data across e-governance applications. These are principles that define any aspect of e-
government ranging from hardware specifications, software for implementing cost-effective e-governance
solution to the color and feel of a government website.

63.      Challenge: There is lack of uniformity in how information is shared, how systems communicate
and how common processes are reused. Currently, public services are not available in all languages. To
allow service delivery in a citizen's own language, translation software, character fonts and keyboards
need to be developed and standardized for each language. Unless all government departments follow the
same norms, the computers of one department cannot talk to the computers of another department.
Connecting government systems creates new security risks because a wide range of valuable information
is on-line protected only by electronic means. This increased security risk needs to be managed by a range
of standards introducing security controls for each system. Importantly, standardizing systems across
government agencies should not end up making the government dependent on a few suppliers. This
requires a policy on Open Standards so that hardware and software can be sold by any vendor. Open
Standards are also more reliable and sustainable because they are produced in a transparent and
collaborative manner.


                                                    19
64.      Government actions to address the challenge: The government has instituted an elaborate
consultative process to establish e-governance standards ­ with departments, the technical agencies,
technical and legal experts, vendors, service providers and user representatives. Standards already
released include: Metadata and Data standards, digital signature standards, character encoding and fonts
for localization of electronic data. At a later stage, these standards will be complemented with additional
agreements on the protection of privacy and authorization for data access.

65.     Specific measures under the proposed operation: The government has adopted a Policy on
Open Standards to prevent any single vendor from exercising legal, technical or financial control. This
reduces the risk of being hostage to price escalations or losing data when a vendor goes out of business.
The policy stipulates that GoI shall adopt Single and Royalty-Free (RF) Open Standard for a specific
purpose within area. Otherwise, a lot of time will be wasted in converting data to the common format and
there are increased risks of data loss when information is exchanged between the systems. Prior action 2
of 7 has been completed. The DPL continues to support the development of standards on security and
interoperability under the new open standards policy. As these standards are approved, new areas for
standardization will be identified in line with the requirements and priorities of the NeGP. To ensure that
these standards will be adhered during the implementation of e-governance projects, the government is
developing a comprehensive framework for certifying systems' compliance with approved technical
standards. Third party auditors /agencies will be selected and assigned to review whether services actually
are complying to the standards.

Prior action 2 of 7: Government has adopted a policy for the use of open standards in e-governance.

Indicative trigger for DPL2: Government will have adopted technology standards including for
interoperability and security.

Expected results: Standards will ensure that ransparency, efficiency, reliability and interoperability of all
of government systems. Open standards will protect systems from becoming vendor­lock-in and allow
technology neutrality. To track progress towards interoperability and reliability of services, compliance of
e-services with technical standards for e-governance will be measured.

               1.3   Improve Inter-Agency Coordination and Monitoring of e-governance.

66.      Description: The success of NeGP depends on the actions of many ministries and agencies at
different levels of government requiring an unusually high degree of coordination. A strong monitoring
system is particularly important to generate accurate and up-to-date performance information on all
MMPs.

67.     Challenge: The NeGP is implemented by several agencies at national level and by 28 states and 7
UTs. This quickly adds up to over 1,000 projects whose progress must be monitored and results
evaluated. The Apex Committee chaired by the Cabinet Secretary provides strategic directions and
resolves inter-agency coordination issues. It needs to review aggregated indicators that can provide a
status update at a glance. The challenge is to develop indices that capture the progress information
correctly and present this information in a dashboard overview without superfluous detail ­ but still
retaining the option to swiftly retrieve underlying data when required for deeper analysis. Selected
indicators need to be those that can be applied to all projects for easy comparison of results. A
computerized monitoring system allows automated collection of data and calculation of indices. Web-
based applications are required that can securely collect and store information from authorized sources
only.

68.      Government actions to address the challenge: For better coordination, the government has
established a council of mission leaders from participating agencies (inter-ministerial committee of senior
officials) to discuss program issues. This group discusses important issues related to NeGP's
implementation and its collective recommendation is transmitted to the Apex Committee. A
comprehensive monitoring framework is an integral part of the NeGP implementation strategy and
various options for the same has been under active deliberations with various stakeholders.

69.     Specific measures under the proposed operation: The DPL supports the development and
adoption of a project management information system. Project monitoring information comprises logical
progress, physical progress and financial progress. A computer system enables web-based entry of data by
all e-governance project managers. A third party security check on the software has already been
completed and the system has gone live. Leaders of MMPs will be trained how to use the system. Prior
Action 3 of 7 has been completed.

Prior action 3 of 7: An inter-ministerial committee of senior officials has adopted a comprehensive
framework for monitoring the implementation of the NeGP.

70.     Expected results: Systematic collection of information will contribute to improved decision
making at the level of the Apex Committee. Better coordination will lead to faster implementation, less
duplication and synergic allocation of resources. This in turn will lead to greater access and better quality
of e-services. Measuring coordination is difficult so the most useful indicator to track progress is the
actual quality of information in the monitoring system. The progress indicator is the number of e-services
from projects with updated information in the Project Monitoring Information System.

                                 Pillar 2. Increased outreach to citizens.

                         2.1 Improve access to services by using mobile platforms
                               and increasing the pace of internet penetration

71.     Description: The government's aim of providing web-enabled, anytime, anywhere access to
information and e-services is constrained by limited access to broadband services, especially in rural
areas. This has adversely affected the success of Common Services Center Sch eme.

72.     Challenge: The slow rise of Internet connections is due to the limited reach of backbone
networks. This, in turn, is caused by: inadequate rights of way and low availability of spectrum for
broadband services; high prices inhibiting computer and broadband device penetration; and limited
availability of regionally relevant content and applications. The recent meteoric rise of mobile phone
coverage in India offers an attractive alternative path to increased connectivity, though NeGP itself does
not currently integrate the mobile platform given the limited penetration at the time of its adoption.

73.      Government actions to address the challenge: The government is pursuing a two-pronged
strategy:
         It is proactively promoting Internet penetration rates, especially in rural India, through the
Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) schemes. All licensed telecom operators contribute 5 per cent
of adjusted gross revenues to the USOF. The USOF Administrator disburses monies from the fund for the
expansion of telephone and data services to rural areas. The government approved the results of the
auctions of 3G spectrum and Broadband Wireless Access spectrum in 2010 and operators have started
providing high speed data services. Following the mid-term assessment of CSC Scheme in 2010, DIT has
taken necessary steps to address the bottlenecks of the existing CSC Scheme. Further towards meeting the

recover an investment in
solar energy to ensure that CSCs remains operational even when electric connection is down.
         The government is planning to utilize mobile phones for delivering e-services as mobile tele-
density now stands at over 60 per cent and is expected to increase. A number of state governments have
started to provide m-government services. A committee has been established in DIT to develop a policy
framework for the delivery of government services on the mobile platform.

74.      Specific measures under the proposed operation: The DPL supports the adoption of a policy
framework for the delivery of basic financial services using mobile phones. Following adoption of the
policy, implementation guidelines have been issued by the Reserve Bank of India and the
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has developed the required regulatory
framework governing the quality of service, provisioning and pricing of mobile services for delivery of
basic financial services. A number of operators such as BSNL, Airtel and Vodafone have entered into
agreements with banks to provide mobile financial services. Thus, prior action 4 of 7 has been completed.
On the broadband agenda, an inter-ministerial committee has developed an action plan for extension of
broadband connectivity to all villages. The Expenditure Finance Committee of the cabinet has approved
funding for expansion of the CSC scheme. The TRAI launched public consultations on the National
Broadband Plan in June 2010 and has issued recommendations to the government.

Prior action 4 of 7: Government has adopted a policy framework for the delivery of basic financial
services using mobile phones.

Indicative trigger for DPL2: Government has approved the National Broadband Plan to establish
broadband in all panchayats.
Second indicative trigger for DPL2: Government has adopted a policy to facilitate the setting up of
additional 150,000 broadband- enabled service access points in panchayats.

75.    Expected results: Providing broadband to rural areas, setting up Common Services Centers and
making services available on the mobile platform will result in increased citizen access to online services.


                                                     22
The progress indicators are in line with the three reform areas: the number of broadband connections, the
number of CSCs, and the number of services delivered over the mobile network.

     2.2 Facilitate increased participation of users in design and evaluation of e-governance projects.

76.    Description: The government wants to make e-services user-centric by altering the current
asymmetry in power between users and public officials in determining the design and evaluation of
MMPs. Guidelines will define how MMPs conduct needs assessments, involve all stakeholders and
measure performance on the basis of user satisfaction.

77.      Challenge: There may be some resistance to increased citizens' participation because of its
potential to reduce corruption and increase public officials' accountability to users. Also, citizens'
participation should not place a burden on citizens in terms of their time and cost.

78.      Government actions to address the challenge: To ensure that users are actually given a voice,
the government is developing guidelines to involve users at every stage of the project life-cycle. Needs
assessments have been developed and tested in the e-District MMP. The guidelines will require all MMPs
to have agreements with users committing to minimum levels of services. Evaluation of impact with users
is also made mandatory through user surveys and user involvement through social audits. DIT has sought
comments on the guidelines for social audit for e-governance projects from the public through its website.
DIT will endeavor to make the guidelines user-friendly and have them adopted at central and state level
and applied in all government projects. DIT's funding approval will depend upon adherence to user
reengagement guidelines. Simultaneously, DIT will provide expertise and support to project managers so
that they can implement the citizens' participation guidelines.

79.     Specific measures under the proposed operation: The government has revised its earlier
methodology of impact assessments. Whereas the old methodology only collected subjective user
opinions, the revised methodology also measures service quality in objective dimensions (delivery time,
cost, number of visits, etc.) and compares these results against the objectives for improvement stated in
each project's funding proposal. Firms that have the capability to undertake these impact assessments are
being selected. Prior action 5 of 7 has been completed.

Prior action 5 of 7: Government has strengthened its e-governance impact assessment strategy and
has begun implementation.

Indicative trigger for DPL2: Government has adopted administrative guidelines that incorporate
comprehensive stakeholder involvement and performance measurements.

80.     Expected results: Services will improve as a result of enhanced user feedback. This will be
measurable after the implementation of the projects. The indicator being tracked is how many e-services
have incorporated user-participation in design and impact assessments. There is a 3 to 5 year project
implementation period between needs assessment and impact measurement. This means that the indicator
will initially be low until existing projects can be retro-fitted and new projects come on-line

                 2.3 Improve service orientation of government processes and officials.

81.     Description: Though the introduction of e-services has been able to computerize existing manual
processes, user surveys show that the impact on customer convenience, cost reduction, waiting time, and
corruption has been marginal. The reengineering of existing business processes is a necessary condition
for the realization of the benefits of egovernance. This requires mapping of existing processes,


                                                    23
determination and elimination of unnecessary steps, and monitoring of results. In addition, the successful
design and implementation of e-governance requires a new orientation of public officials emphasizing
customer service instead of control, knowledge sharing instead of knowledge hoarding, cooperation
instead of competition, and transformation instead of computerization of processes.

82.      Challenge: Re-engineering government processes requires systematic analyses and meets
resistance from officials who prefer to avoid change and preserve rent-seeking opportunities. For decades,
the orientation of public officials has been towards control instead of service; changing behaviors will
take time and well-crafted incentives. A significant challenge is measuring the extent to which new values
and attitudes have been internalized.

83.      Government actions to address the challenge: The Department of Administrative Reform and
Public Grievances has published guidelines on business process re-engineering and on change
management for e-government projects. DIT and the Ministry of Panchayati Raj Institutions are already at
work on an analysis to identify common platforms and components that all states are using to deliver
birth, death, income, caste and domicile certificates across states in India.

84.      Specific measures under the proposed operation: The DPL aided in the identification of key
officials that can shift the orientation of the whole public apparatus from control to service delivery using
e-governance. The DPL also supported the development of the content and methodology of three courses:
A special leadership course for policy makers has been developed. For senior officials, specialized
training in e-governance programming has been developed. Prior action 6 of 7 has been completed. For
Chief Information Officers (CIOs) a special course is still under development. The newly published
reports on government process re-engineering and change management for e-governance projects will be
integrated into the project lifecycle to ensure the steps become an integral part of project-level
implementation. Best business processes for the electronic delivery of common services like birth, death,
income, caste, residence certificates are being identified and will be rolled-out across states.

Prior action 6 of 7: Government has developed and begun implementation of a reorientation
program for state government policy makers and officials in e-governance.

Indicative trigger for DPL2: Government has begun project-level implementation of the process re-
engineering guidelines and common platforms and components.

85.     Expected results: Government process re-engineering can easily be measured at the level of each
public service. The progress indicator tracks the number of e-services delivered through re-engineered
processes. Service orientation of processes and officials will result in affordable and efficient services and
higher user satisfaction. The re-orientation of the leadership and senior officials will have an important
influence on quality of electronic services but the effect cannot be measured at the service level because it
would be too hard to attribute the improvements to the policy makers. The only progress indicator that is
robust and reliable is closer to the output level, i.e. the number of states whose officials have completed
re-orientation or leadership programs.

                                   2.4 Electronic Service Delivery Law

86.      Description: Currently, there is no legislation that makes electronic delivery mandatory for
priority public services or any mandatory timeline for transforming public services. Key institutional
aspects of the introduction of e-service delivery have not been set out in formal legislation such as the
role, functions and responsibilities of different government organizations, the mechanism for coordination
across government, the definition of an oversight mechanism, and the relevant financial arrangements.


                                                     24
There are also a range of policy issues that could be appropriately laid out in legislation such as strategic
control for statutory and sovereign functions of government, digital security, and data protection. The IT
Act of 2000 has already established the use of electronic records, signatures, and communications, and the
Indian Penal Code and the Evidence Act have been amended to make these enforceable. The Right to
Information Act, 2005 has made government departments responsible to create, store and retrieve
government documents in electronic form. But there needs to be a stronger legislative foundation for the
major transformation of service delivery anticipated through NeGP to commit government agencies to the
necessary reforms and to establish a common framework for the entire initiative.

87.    Challenge: Since e-governance goes far beyond technology, DIT will need to harness
cooperation from other ministries and State governments in implementing the provisions of any act.

88.     Government actions to address the challenge: DIT has been tasked with preparing a draft
Electronic Service Delivery Bill. Each government department will identify services that will be enabled
for electronic delivery with clear timeframes and published deployment plans. The proposed Bill will
create an appellate authority to monitor implementation, prescribe penalties for non-compliance, and
adjudicate disputes and resolve complaints. The government has established organizations such as the
Office of the Controller of Certifying Authorities that can assist with the implementation of the act.

89.     Specific measures under the proposed operation: By early 2011, the DIT will have developed
the framework document for the proposed ESD Bill. This document will define the contents of the law
and the approach towards its operation and enactment. An accompanying note will explain the rationale,
operation and expected effect of each part of the framework to facilitate the public consultation process.
The framework document and explanatory note will be used by DIT for stakeholder consultations,
including with citizen groups and government officials. These consultations will be completed early in
2011. Later, the Framework document will be taken by the Ministry of Law which will draft the ESD
Bill. The draft bill will be sent to the legislature for the formal Parliamentary approval process.

Indicative trigger for DPL 2: A draft ESD Bill has been formulated and submitted to the Union Cabinet.

90.      Expected results: The act should lay the basis for a gradual, nationwide improvement in
computerization and online delivery of government services in all states and UTs. The common timetable
set by the act will encourage less advanced agencies to implement their MMPs. It will make public
officials accountable for achieving benchmarks of e-service availability and quality. It will empower
citizens to demand and receive quality services and to hold officials accountable for not doing so. The
indicators of progress in this policy area will be the achievement of the various milestones towards
approval of ESD Bill.

                       2.5 Uniform and predictable verification of e-service users.

91.      Description: To deliver services fully electronically, there are four types of identification that
need to be automated: recognition of official service points by the user (i.e. how can a user recognize an
official website?); recognition of the user (i.e. is the applicant really is who she/he claims to be?);
recognition of computer systems to exchange information; and finally recognition of the product
delivered by the service (i.e. electronically signed birth certificate for example). Several electronic
services have already developed systems for each of these verification processes. A national verification
framework is required to make sure of the identity of the online service user provide a consistent
approach to managing identity related risks. Verification is commonly done by providing a username and
a password. For more important transactions, like internet banking for example, a username and token
generated pass-code are common.


                                                     25
92.      Challenge: Similar systems of online verification need to be used for comparable types of
security or privacy risks. For most types of verification, some systems have already been adopted.
However, these systems differ between departments and for each a separate infrastructure is being rolled
out, burdening the state and the user with extra cost and inconvenience. The challenge is to have in place
a verification framework that brings these systems together and ensures that a consistent approach is used
between all government services and departments.

93.      Government actions to address the challenge: Human intervention to sign documents or to
identify service users limits service delivery to working hours. Once documents can be signed
electronically and users can be verified electronically, services can be delivered round the clock and in
any locality with an internet or telephone connection. Several electronic services have already developed
systems for each of these verification processes. The government is now working to ensure that all e-
services use the same systems for electronic verification. Different applications have different security
risks and will need more or less stringent methods to verify the veracity of documents or the identity of
users. Ultimately, the government will support only two types of verification for each level of security, a
primary method and a fall-back method. These methods will be standardized for all e-government
applications. As a result, progress will be tracked by the number of e-services that use the standard
methods to verify the identity of users.

94.      Specific measures under the proposed operation: The proposed DPL supported the
development and issue of guidelines for use of digital signatures as one system of verifying on-line users.
This is rolled-out as a complement to -- but distinct from -- the UID system. It will provide electronic
proof that the signed records have been reviewed and approved by the signatory. Prior action 7 of 7 has
been completed. Like the pen and paper method, a digital signature attaches the identity of the signer to
the document and records a binding commitment to the document, but with the added advantage that
digital signatures are extremely difficult to forge, digitally signed documents cannot be changed after they
have been signed, and the original document can be copied and transported electronically without losing
authenticity.

Prior action 7 of 7: Government has issued guidelines for use of digital signatures in e-governance.

95.     Expected results: Once systems of verification are in place, services can be accessed around the
clock. The progress indicator used is the number of services that can verify users electronically.

                            VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                               A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

96.      The program is expected to have significant social benefits for the population and positive
impact on the poor. The selection criteria for the MMPs included an assessment of the impact in terms
of the number of people likely to be affected by the project, and the expected improvement in the quality
of service. Among the MMPs supported by the overall program, several are particularly beneficial to
common citizens. The e-District MMP provides services related to social welfare schemes, pensions,
certificates, dues and recovery, PDS related services for food and essential items, rural health,
compensation and relief packages, grievance services, RTI etc. The e-Panchayat MMP aims at improving
governance at the grassroots level, and providing various e-services at the village level. The Employment
Exchange MMP aims to provide e-services and information to employers and employment seekers. The
Agriculture MMP aims at providing information regarding farm practices, market trends, and technical
know-how to the farming community. The Pensions MMP provides updated information on government


                                                    26
pension rules and regulations, and enables monitoring and timely sanction of pension/gratuity. The
Income Tax MMP offers 17 e-services to tax payers to streamline the process and reduce the time burden
of filing income taxes. The Passport and Visa MMP has streamlined issue of passports and offers more
effective immigration services.

97.     The reforms highlighted under the DPLs will increase the efficiency and reliability of citizen
services, expand access, and improve citizen engagement in e-services. These will be socially
beneficial as they lead to an improved overall framework for public service delivery. Reducing the
financial and opportunity costs of obtaining specific services can have social benefits, and minimize
leakages. The Common Services Center Scheme will function as front-end delivery points for the
delivery of public and social services in an integrated manner, to rural and remote areas. The goal of
providing one CSC for every six census villages will enable the scheme to reach even far -flung villages.
The objective is to develop a platform that can enable government, private, and social sector
organizations to align their social and commercial goals for the benefit of the rural population in the
remotest corners of the country through a combination of IT- and non-IT-based services.

98.      Specific actions supported by the DPL series are directly geared towards benefiting citizens.
These include the following:
         Higher internet penetration rates, especially in rural India, and utilization of mobile phones for
delivering e-services will benefit rural and remote communities. Notification of a policy framework for
the delivery of government services on the mobile platform, and the implementation of the National
Broadband Plan to set up broadband in all villages will help to set up 150,000 service access points in
panchayats. The delivery of basic financial services using mobile phones will help financial inclusion. In
order that even less literate people in villages can access services, facilitators will be available at the
service centers to provide assistance as required.
         The government aims to find mechanisms to empower citizens to hold government accountable
for the implementation and results of e-Services projects. The DPL supports citizens' participation in
NeGP-funded projects' needs assessment, minimum citizen consultation, grievance handling mechanism,
minimum performance standards, and social audits. Support to this policy area will enable citizens to
evaluate whether e-services offered by government achieve the expected improvements, and to hold
government accountable if not. This will help ensure positive social impacts.

                                 B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

99.       The environment, forests, and other natural aspects of policies supported by the proposed
DPL were assessed as per OP 8.60. The assessment suggests that there will no significant negative
environment effects from this operation. At the same time, there will be significant positive
environmental effects from the use of e-service delivery mechanisms to promote innovative and more
interactive approaches that can increase the level of public awareness, involvement, and ownership of
environmental problems and solutions. One such example, already piloted in India, is the citizen
involvement in environmental monitoring and enforcement, whose further support and scaling up will be
facilitated by this operation. Involving citizens in the monitoring of state and municipal facilities would
make the regulation of public entities more transparent and effective. Further, the increasing public
demand for better performance by the environmental regulatory agencies when matched by adequate
support to these agencies conditioned on e-services will significantly increase efficiency, transparency
and accountability at all levels. Along with the Right to Information Act this will serve as a means to
proactively strengthen information dissemination in various government sectors about social and
environmental implication of development.




                                                    27
                   C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUTION

100.    The Department of Information Technology (DIT), Ministry of Communications and
Information Technology, will be responsible for overall implementation and monitoring of the
DPL-supported program. The department services the NeGP's Apex committee, and NeGP's
implementation structure facilitates DIT's coordinating role with other agencies implementing MMPs and
with state governments. A major role of DIT is to establish and enforce standards across the NeGP's
implementation. DIT conducts a technical appraisal of the detailed project report before it is approved for
NeGP funding, which comes from both Plan and Non-Plan budgets. Within DIT, the National e-
Governance Division has been established facilitate implementation of NeGP, especially coordination
functions, and has already been staffed by competent professionals from the private sector and from
within government.

101.     The NeGP is being monitored within government. Monthly progress reports are prepared by
all implementing agencies and monitored by the Apex Committee chaired by Cabinet Secretary according
to program level indicators, whose development is being supported by this DPL. In addition, the
Parliament's Standing Committee on Information Technology maintains close oversight over progress of
this national program.

102.    The Policy Matrix of the proposed operation will provide a results framework that
describes expected outputs / outcomes, as well as indicators by which to gauge progress and
monitor interim steps. Implementation Support Missions will be undertaken at regular intervals, in
consultation with the GoI. Specifically, the operation directly supports measures to improve how NeGP is
monitored, which in turn will improve the quality of program management and the capacity to assess
program impact. Given the complexity and size of NeGP, a computerized monitoring system has been
developed and launched. This system will provide decision-making information for the Apex Committee,
program managers, project managers and program stakeholders.

                                         D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

103.    The Bank has reasonable assurance that the control environment for foreign exchange in
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is satisfactory for the purposes of this operation, based on the RBI
audit report and the outcomes of other operations which have been disbursed and managed through the
RBI. The IMF does not carry out a Safeguard Assessment of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). As part of
the DPL operation, the RBI's audit report and published annual financial statements for the year ended
June 30, 2009 were reviewed. The audit report by joint auditors appointed by the Government of India
has an unqualified opinion. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Reserve Bank
of India Act 1934, the notifications issued under the Act, and in the form prescribed by the RBI General
Regulations 1949. The audit follows the standards generally accepted in India.

104.   A Public Financial Management Performance Assessment Report (PFM-PR) of the Union
Government, using the PEFA framework1, has been carried out by National Institute of Public Finance
& Policy (NIPFP) a premier academic think tank which works under the aegis of Ministry of Finance,
Government of India . This, supplemented by various focused studies of public financial management &
accountability at the Union level 2 and PFMA assessment in selected states 3, have provided a basis for

enhanced knowledge and understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the PFM systems at the union
& state level. As per the NIPFP study, the ratings across 28 individual dimensions range from A to D (A -
8,B-3,C-9,D-6, Not rated -2) and are generally in line with other countries in SAR. Our assessment of the
PFM systems & controls in India indicate that these are adequate for us to support budget operations. The
PFM-PR assessment concluded that with respect to aggregate fiscal discipline, the FRBM Act has helped
in monitoring aggregate fiscal indicators and adherence to stipulated deficit indicators; an elaborate
expenditure control mechanism exists in India; debt strategy and debt management practices are
reasonably well developed; procurement system is governed by General Financial Rules; and
Parliamentary control over budgetary practice and expenditure control is established following the
Constitutional provisions. At the same time, the absence of a multi-year perspective in budgeting and
expenditure planning that indicates future year commitments, the unevenness and the late spike in the
annual spending pattern and weak internal control and internal audit system are important weaknesses of
the PFM system. While external audit in the country is well established and facilitates the legislative in
exercising control over the executive, the process of scrutiny of the audit reports has is not timely,
adversely affecting its effectiveness.

105.    The initiatives taken by the government in recent years has put PFM issues at the forefront.
The role of PFM systems in contributing to fiscal discipline, strategic resource allocation through better
program management and improving service delivery has gained attention in recent years. The
government policies in expanding social sector spending has made it necessary to look at ways to improve
program management and actual service delivery. Attention is being given to improve the PFM systems
and processes including planning for budgeting, resource management, internal control and audit,
accounting and reporting and external audit which include (a) enactment of Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management Act; (b) passage of the Right to Information Act; (b) recognizing the need to
improve quality of financial disclosure and gradually move to alignment with international public sector
accounting standards and (c) better financial monitoring of Federally Funded Schemes with roll out of the
Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System.

                            E. DISBURSEMENT AND MONITORING

106.    The proposed loan credit will follow the Banks disbursement procedures for development
policy loans. Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the loan will
be deposited by IBRD in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the
Reserve Bank of India at the request of the Borrower. Based on this, RBI will credit the rupee equivalent
in GoI's account on the same day. The government will be required to provide a confirmation to the
Bank that the proceeds of the loan have been received in the designated deposit account with RBI and that
an equivalent amount in local currency has also been credited to an account of the government available
to finance budget expenditures.

107.    Disbursement of the loan proceeds would not be linked to specific p urchases. However, GoI
would not use the loan proceeds to pay for expenditures included in the Bank's standard negative list. If
any portion of the Loan is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Loan Agreement,
the Bank shall require the GoI to refund the amount.

108.     The financing terms and conditions for the IBRD loan will be reflected through a legal
agreement between GoI and IBRD. The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in a single
disbursement. The Bank support under the loan will be based on actions already taken. These actions will
be listed in the loan agreement.

                                    F. RISKS AND MITIGATION

109.     There are some risks that can affect implementation progress -- but mitigation measures are also
in place.
         The small budgetary support by the proposed series of DPLs being very small could impede its
leveraging power to establish critical policy and institutional actions. However, counterparts in
government readily acknowledge that critical institutional actions and policies, rather than financing, is
the main gap of the NeGP. An IBRD DPL can help identify these. Via the Bank's six-year old
engagement in this sector and understanding of the program, its experience with supporting other similar
programs in the region and round the world, it can bring valuable comparative international experience to
this program.
         Actions agreed under Pillar 2, and particularly increased participation of users and service
orientation of public officials could have results less than expected as citizen-centric service delivery has
not yet been mainstreamed in the public service and the benefits are perceived only after a few years.
However, NeGP funding becoming now conditional upon inclusion of service users' inputs. The
government has recognized that officials' service orientation is necessary and a strong program is in place
to meet the need. Pressure from service users will help hasten the service-orientation of public officials.
The success of implementation of Right to Information Act, 2005-- and especially how citizens are using
it to hold public officials accountable--suggests that citizens, once introduced into NeGP's
implementation, will play a strong role.
         NeGP's decentralized implementation arrangements make it difficult for any one department,
such as DIT, to coordinate across such a wide range of implementing agencies. However, the risk of
DIT's inability to undertake reforms supported by this DPL is low. The responsibility of other agencies to
play their specified role is clear. Mechanisms to coordinate among these implementing agencies, such as
the council of mission leaders, have been established and operational. The program's implementation is
monitored and supervised by the Apex Committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary and overseen by the
Prime Minister. The DPL supports the monitoring of the NeGP and MMPs utilizing indicators that
generate information relevant to the level of decision-making. The DIT has recently been staffed by 15
competent professionals at very senior levels. The Bank will work closely with the government team, to
offer guidance and assistance as required.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with India
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/2

January 5, 2011



On December 22, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with India. 1
Background
India's growth is among the highest in the world. Since mid-2009 the pace of India's recovery--led by
domestic demand, especially infrastructure investment--has been strong. Monetary and fiscal policies
remain accommodative: real interest rates are low and although there has been some fiscal consolidation,
the fiscal deficit remains high. With little slack in the economy, the ongoing exit from the policy stimulus
introduced during the crisis, and structural factors affecting food prices, inflation measures are in the 8½
to 10½ percent range. Financial conditions are comfortable, and capital inflows have been strong.

India's economy is projected to grow by 8¾ percent in real terms in 2010/11, moderating to about 8
percent the following year. Following last year's drought, this year's growth is already benefiting from
the rebound in agriculture and the pickup in private consumption as employment prospects have
improved and disposable incomes continue to rise. Infrastructure is expected to remain an important
growth driver and corporate investment is likely to accelerate, aided by conducive financing conditions
and robust demand growth. India's medium-term growth prospects remain strong. The economy is
expected to continue to expand rapidly, supported by high investment and productivity gains.

Risks to growth are broadly balanced, with downside risks relating mainly to the global economy.
Surging capital inflows could further spur investment, but could complicate macroeconomic
management. Sustaining rapid growth over the medium term will depend on sustaining reforms to
facilitate infrastructure investment--such as deepening the corporate bond market and lowering the cost
of doing business--and improving social indicators while carrying out fiscal consolidation. Improving
social outcomes and infrastructure are two key pillars of the government's strategy to achieve rapid and
inclusive growth.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their economic stewardship which has helped India
weather the crisis well. Growth is among the fastest growing in the world, social indicators are
improving, and medium-term economic prospects are favorable. Risks stem mainly from weaker global
growth. Near-term challenges confronting the authorities arise from elevated inflation, fiscal
consolidation needs, and buoyant capital inflows, warranting careful calibration of macroeconomic
policies and the diligent pursuit of ongoing reforms.

Directors commended the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) efforts to tighten monetary conditions. Noting
that short-term real interest rates remain below historic norms and financing conditions have hardened
only marginally, most Directors recommended further steps to bring the real repo rate clearly into
positive territory. They welcomed the RBI's moves to increase the frequency of policy reviews and
publish more guidance on future actions. Most Directors considered that continuing to improve the CPI,
including a new national CPI to be introduced in the future, and utilizing information from it in


                                                    55
policymaking could increase the impact of monetary policy on inflation expectations. Directors also
highlighted the role of structural reforms in containing food price inflation.

Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to fiscal consolidation, including their plans to
streamline spending. The envisaged Goods and Services Tax and the new Direct Tax Code should
increase tax efficiency. Given buoyant economic growth, and since future deficit targets could be more
difficult to reach, most Directors saw merit in a further strengthening of the consolidation effort. Saving
this year's over performance in revenue and one-off receipts could help reconstitute fiscal space. More
substantial current spending adjustment, mainly by further cutting subsidies and improving the targeting
of spending, would help achieve social goals along with medium-term fiscal consolidation. A few
Directors favored an appropriate balance between pacing the consolidation and sustaining growth by
addressing the exigencies of infrastructure investment and social spending.

Directors observed that low yields in advanced economies and India's favorable growth differentials
could raise capital inflows above its absorptive capacity. While exchange rate flexibility would remain
the first line of defense, reserve accumulation and macroprudential measures could be employed if strong
inflows continue. Absorptive capacity could also be improved by deepening financial markets or by
liberalizing foreign direct investment (FDI), consistent with India's gradual approach to capital account
liberalization.

Directors supported the authorities' focus on strengthening financial stability, including efforts to
strengthen macroprudential regulations to cool the residential real estate market and to ensure a
regulatory level playing field across the financial industry. While India's banking system is resilient and
well capitalized, Directors noted that monitoring asset quality will remain important, particularly as
prudential norms for infrastructure are eased. They commended the introduction of the RBI's Financial
Stability Report, the announced review of financial laws, and the creation of the Financial Stability and
Development Council, and looked forward to the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program.

Directors welcomed the emphasis on investment in infrastructure and human capital.

They supported the measures taken to increase the availability of long-term finance for infrastructure,
especially moves to develop the corporate bond market, while noting that in the short run foreign savings
also would be needed. Directors supported the authorities' reform efforts in areas such as land acquisition
and government clearances, while also stressing the importance of strong accountability and transparency
over large infrastructure projects.

         ANNEX 6: GOOD PRACTICE PRINCIPLES FOR CONDITIONALITY

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership. The National e-Governance Plan supported by this DPL is fully
formulated and owned by government. It was adopted in 2006 long before this DPL was conceptualized.
Extensive consultation preceded its adoption. At the central level, the matter was examined in both the
legislature and the executive--the Parliament's Standing Committee on IT (2005-06) and of the
Committee of Secretaries (March 2006). Other participation in the plan's formulation and ongoing
implementation is detailed in Section III of this program document. The government has already
approved allocation of Rs. 372 billion to the plan's implementation. The government has undertaken
extensive analytical work on different aspects of the program. The Bank is familiar with the plan's
strengths and weaknesses having been engaged in this sector since 2005.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework. The policy matrix has been jointly formulated by government counterparts
and the IBRD team and draws upon priorities in the government's program. India's IT capacity is very
strong, and the sector is vibrant with extensive private sector participation and innovation. The UNDP
provided some initial support to NeGP during 2003-07, and the Bank has coordinated with donors who
are supporting sectoral projects, with e-governance components, in the states. The government has invited
the Bank into this sector particularly because of its engagement since 2005 and its flexibility to provide
assist government's programmatic approach.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances. The instrument and its timing of this loan is a response to the type of assistance that
government seeks. Earlier, the Bank had assisted government prepare a Specific Investment Loan that
funded IT infrastructure. However, that did not reach fruition and government informed the Bank what it
needed was not major financial assistance for this sector but identification of critical policies / actions that
could speed up the implementation of this very important program. The Letter of Development Policy
attached at Annex 1 describes what its own program is and why / how it wants the Bank's support. The
policy areas are fully tailored to country circumstances. For example at this time the government's
priority is to establish Common Services Centers in all gram panchayats, but not all remote areas are
broadband-enabled. That is why the DPL supports a two-pronged policy that expands broadband
penetration on the one hand while uses the mobile platform to deliver e-services.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement . The
prior actions have been jointly identified and agreed because they are critical for achieving the objectives
of the program, and go beyond promises and action plans. For example, the first prior action is the
implementation of an institutional strengthening action plan to build states' capacity to prepare and
implement projects for MMPs. The policy matrix displays discipline in the use of prior actins and triggers
of which there are 7 each.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support. The government has its own mechanism to monitor the NeGP's implementation
progress. The Apex Committee reviews. In addition, the DPL supports a policy / institutional action (1.3)
so that monitoring generates information that can speed up NeGP's implementation. Given the
complexity and size of NeGP, the monitoring system is being computerized so that it generates
information for the indices. Implementation Support Missions will be undertaken at regular intervals, in
consultation with the government.

             ANNEX 7: METHODOLOGY FOR SELECTING INDICATORS

Why we chose number of e-services as progress indicator
Our preferred indicator for most of the policy / institutional areas was one that would allow the
government and IBRD to track links in the causal chain between inputs and results. We rejected the
following:
        The number of services available electronically, even though it would seem the most ideal
indicator, because it would display change only after an implementation period of 3 to 5 years. This
would not serve our purpose of measuring progress annually over the duration of the program.
        The number of MMPs in operation or under development because of inconsistency: the number
of e-services covered by state MMP proposals differs between states and over time. MMPs with similar
names cover different services.

Therefore we selected the number of services in the process of conversion to electronic delivery
covering all MMPs as the preferred indicator. Is directly related to the final outcome but can be
measured much earlier in the process. The indicator is reliable, comparable, specific, measurable,
realistic and targeted, and the information will be available from the PMIS once the system is populated
with information

Definition of "services" in our indicator
Services are distinct processes that are initiated or result in a public private interaction. Pro cesses that
serve internal government purposes were not counted as services. In conversion or transformation to
electronic delivery means that that the service being counted is part of an MMP, that the detailed project
report (DPR) has been reviewed by DIT and has been or will be approved by the Apex Committee.
For simplicity of measurement, all services listed in the NeGP PMIS database that are not related to
infrastructure are considered services. Thus services part of projects like E-office that have a large
internal government impact and only a small public-private exchange have not been counted.

Counting the number of services
The number of services is derived from the MMPs registered in the NeGP's PMIS. State-level services
are counted distinctly for each state, even when centrally driven. Projects like e-district are developed
centrally but are counted by state because implementation is repeated in each state. But, services in
integrated MMPs are counted only once for simplicity. At the start of the operation, 5199 services were
defined under the different MMPs. The number can go up over time because more MMPs or more
services under each MMP could be made available electronically. This will not affect the indicators
because the total number of services in process of transformation remains a reliable indication of progress
to date even if the final goal is shifted ever further.

Details of indicator choice for each reform area

                    Reform Area 1.1: Strengthening states institutions in e-governance.
The DPL-supported actions will speed up the development of projects at state level and in particular in
the least performing states. Of particular interest is whether or not those projects are able to leverage the
knowledge and resources available in the private sector. Rather than choosing 1 indicator for this wide
policy area, a combination of three indicators was selected: one for speeding up development in states,
one for least performing states and one for private sector involvement.

There are 145 services under the state MMPs multiplied by 35 states, results in a maximum of about 5000
services that could be achieved at this point in time. Within the project period at least 30% of these


                                                     64
services or 1500 services will be in transformation to electronic delivery. A second progress indicator
will be the number of e-services under implementation in least achieving states. According to the latest e-
readiness assessment report, these include: Assam, Nagaland, Andaman & Nicobar Islands,
Lakshadweep, Bihar, Tripura, Manipur, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli. The third indicator
tracks the effectiveness of the leveraging private sector support through the total number of e-services
delivered in a PPP mode at the implementation stage. It will only track those approved projects whose
proposal indicates that implementation of the project will be in PPP mode.

                  Reform Area 1.2: Development of technical standards for e-governance
The indicator for this policy area is compliance of systems with technical standards for e-governance
because of all the benefits that technical standards for e-governance can bring. Compliance can be
measured but a special compliance review or audit is necessary. The systems that deliver electronic
services need to be checked to ensure that they are in line with established standards. Measuring
compliance is also supported by this operation and the fact that compliance can be measured is an
indicator of progress in itself. Third parties will be charged with compliance measurements. The progress
indicator will capture only those projects that are compliant and have been certified as such. Most projects
might already be in compliance with all standards but since certification has not yet started the progress
indicator remains zero until certification of compliance has been awarded.

           Reform Area 1.3: Improve inter-agency coordination and monitoring of e-governance.
Measuring coordination is difficult so the best indicator to track progress is the actual quality of
information in the PMIS. Since the information is entered by e-governance project managers in various
parts of the country, an updated PMIS not only indicates coordination at the highest level can take place
on the basis of up-to-date information, it also indicates that the parties entering the data understand the
importance of coordination and are committed to contribute. The progress indicator is the number of e -
services from projects with updated information in the Project Monitoring Information System. Up to
date information means information that is not older than 1 month, as the meetings of some coordination
bodies take place on a monthly basis. The baseline and observation in January 2011, is still zero as the
PMIS system was still under development. This does not mean that at this moment no information is
flowing to the coordination bodies. Rather it means that the stream of information is not yet systematic
and directly entered by the project managers.

 Reform Area 2.1: Improving access to services by using the mobile platform while increasing the pace of
                                            internet penetration
Providing broadband to rural areas, setting up Common Services Centers and making services available
on the mobile platform will result in better access by citizens to public services. The progress indicators
for the infrastructure focus on the physical installation: the number of broadband connections and the
number of CSCs.

While rural access to services is dependent on both a service delivery point and a broadband connection
to that point, the only available data is the total number of broadband connections. This includes rural and
urban connections. Once the broadband plan is under implementation, figures specifically targeting rural
broadband connections might become available. This can be used as a corroborating indicator. The policy
matrix will have to make do with the information that is currently available, i.e. total number of
broadband connections.

The number of service access points or Common Services Centers (CSCs) is the outcome and indicator at
the same time. The operation of the CSCs can be tracked through a software program installed on the
computers of the CSCs that informs DIT when the CSC is on-line and ready to deliver services.

The number of services delivered over the mobile network can also easily be tracked. While ultimately
the goal is to have the whole gamut of services available through mobile phones, at this stage the
indicator tracks services that in some way use the mobile network to deliver. When a passport issuing

                                                    65
service uses sms-alerts to update users about the status of their passport application, then this is counted
as one service using the mobile network.

                       Reform Area 2.2: Facilitating increased participation of users
                             in design and evaluation of e-governance projects.
Services will improve as a result of user feedback, but this will be measurable only after the
implementation of the projects concerned. The best indicator for tracking progress during this series of
DPLs, is therefore, how many e-services have incorporated user-participation in design and impact
assessments. Because the period between needs assessment and impact measurement will be 3 to 5 years,
the indicator's value will initially be low until existing projects can be retro-fitted and new projects come
on-line. As opposed to most other indicators, this indicator tracks projects that are completed and are in
operation because the indicator only counts projects that have had involvement of users in both the design
phase and the evaluation phase.

           Reform Area 2.3: Improving service orientation of government processes and officials.
Service orientation of processes and officials will result in affordable and efficient services and higher
user satisfaction.

Government process re-engineering can easily be measured at the level of each public service. The
progress indicator tracks the number of e-services delivered through re-engineered processes. As yet,
there is no checklist yet to determine whether process re-engineering has been done in compliance with
the released guidelines. Therefore projects that have been approved by the Apex Committee and have a
section on process re-engineering in their DPR, will be included in the progress indicator.

The re-orientation of the leadership and senior officials will have an important influence on quality of
electronic services but the effect cannot be measured at the e-service level because it would be too hard to
attribute the improvements to the policy makers. The only progress indicator that is robust and reliable is
closer to the output level, i.e. the number of States whose officials have completed re-orientation or
leadership programs. The indicator does not record how many officials have been trained and in which
program. If any policy makers or officials have followed the leadership, STEP, or Chief Information
Officers' course, the state will be included in the indicator.

                                 Reform Area 2.4: E-Services Delivery Law
The E-service Delivery Act will result in more services becoming available on the doorstep of the citizen.
This impact of the Act can only be measured after the Act comes into force, which will only happen after
the end of this series of operations. The only progress indicator available therefor e is the formal stages an
act has to move through during its preparation.

                 Reform Area 2.5: Uniform and predictable verification of e-service users.
The indicator used is the number of service that can verify users electronically. To deliver services full y
electronically there are four types of identification that need to addressed: recognition of official service
points by the user; recognition of the user; recognition of computer systems to exchange information; and
finally, recognition of the product delivered by the service. Of these four types of identification, the
recognition of the user is the most challenging and therefore it is used as the progress indicator.
