   1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

   1.1. Context at Appraisal

1. Despite the recent period of economic growth much of Zambia’s economic history
   had been characterized by slow and uneven growth. Rising copper prices led to
   moderate growth in the Zambian economy between 1964 and 1972. However, in the
   subsequent decades the economy stagnated because of a slump in copper prices and weak
   economic management in a largely state controlled economy. After 1996 the economy
   began to grow again, albeit slowly, as a result of a relatively stable macroeconomic
   environment supported by sound macroeconomic policies and opening of the mining
   sector to foreign investment. However, real GDP per capita in 1999 was equivalent to 50
   percent of GDP per capita in 1965, and by 2007 this figure had increased to only 64
   percent. Poor growth translated into falling living standards, and Zambia's rank in the UN
   Human Development Index for 2009 was 164 out of 182.

2. Higher GDP growth had not been sufficient either to substantially alleviate poverty
   or to improve income distribution. Poverty levels remained very high, with 59 percent
   of the population living below the poverty line and 36 percent in extreme poverty in 2006.
   Total income distribution, however, was virtually constant over the same period: in 1996
   the Gini coefficient was 0.61, and in 2006 it was 0.60. At the same time, the income
   divide between urban and rural areas remained large, and migration from rural areas to
   the cities was increasing. While poverty in urban areas had declined from 56 percent in
   1998 to 27 percent in 2006, it remained high at 77 percent in 2006 compared to 83
   percent in 1998.

3. The economy was experiencing a period of macroeconomic stability with low
   inflation and low fiscal deficits, a promising departure from the country's long history
   of large macroeconomic imbalances. In the past the Government typically dealt with
   fiscal imbalances by reducing investment spending and increasing arrears, which
   generated large quasi-fiscal obligations in the 1990s. Commitment to structural reforms
   was also weak, resulting in the Government's failure to create an environment within
   which the private sector could diversify from copper and pursue alternatives both in the
   domestic and export markets. The weak implementation of reforms was reflected in
   Zambia’s slow improvement in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
   ratings. 1

4. The economy proved resilient to the 2008 global financial crisis. The global financial
   crisis impacted the country primarily through the copper mining sector, the mainstay of
   the economy. The price of copper and its global demand plummeted in mid-October
   2008, which substantially reduced export proceeds, capital inflows, and government

   revenue. Nevertheless, the large investment in the mining sector following the
   privatization in the 1990s, sound macroeconomic policies, significant debt relief coupled
   with advances in structural reform, helped the economy absorb the shock quite well.
   However, crisis support was needed from the European Union (EU) and the IMF to
   cushion the crisis.

5. Zambia’s debt burden had reduced significantly thanks to the external debt relief
   through the HIPC program and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). In
   2005, when Zambia reached the completion point of the HIPC program, its total debt was
   reduced by about 55 percent. In December of the same year, under the MDRI, Zambia
   received 100 percent relief on all debt owed to the World Bank and the IMF before 2005.
   These debt-relief measures were accompanied by the cancellation of debts with several
   bilateral creditors. Consequently, its external debt-to-GDP ratio fell from about
   86 percent in 2005 to around 9 percent in 2006. As a result, significant fiscal space was
   created. In the aftermath of HIPC and MDRI, the role of the donor community was
   gradually reduced in Zambia.

6. Zambia’s multi-party democracy was maturing. The country had held national
   multiparty elections in 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006. In 2006, President Mwanawasa was
   re-elected, and his Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) party retained its
   parliamentary majority. International and domestic observers reported that the 2006
   elections, unlike those of 2001, were substantially free of irregularities. Clear
   improvements were registered, not only in election-day activities, but also in the
   availability of information and materials, the role of the police and security officials, and
   the credibility and professionalism of the Electoral Commission of Zambia. Changes to
   the Electoral Act in 2006 gave the Commission greater independence and helped it to win
   the confidence of the voters and the donors who helped to fund its election activities.

7. Zambia had completed its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2002
   and had initiated its Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) 2 for 2006-2010. The
   PRSP focused on promoting growth in key sectors (particularly those associated with
   rural poverty), diversifying both output and exports, improving economic and political
   governance, entrenching macroeconomic stability, enhancing social services delivery,
   and supporting private investment. The FNDP emphasized labor-intensive growth
   supported by macroeconomic stability, infrastructure investment, and improved social
   services for the poor 3. The specific strategies designed to contribute to the achievement
   of the long-term goals were reflected in the rolling Medium-Term Expenditure
   Framework (MTEF) and the Performance Assessment Frameworks (PAF) which the
   Government agreed with Co-operating Partners (CPs) in the Poverty Reduction Budget
   Support (PRBS) group.

8. At appraisal of the first operation, despite the recent gains on the macroeconomic
   front, challenges remained. The Government was carrying a high volume of fiscal
   arrears resulting from weak budgeting and control. The Government program recognized
   the need to reduce arrears to strengthen fiscal discipline. The need for improved
   competitiveness and diversification to sustain economic growth and reduce poverty was
   also recognized. To support the diversification efforts, the Government program pursued
   structural reforms designed to strengthen energy, transport and communications sectors.
   To augment these efforts, the Government affirmed the need to continue reforms in
   public finance management (PFM), budget execution and improving public service
   delivery.

9. The PRSC series was a key component of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
   approved by the Board in May 2008. The CAS FY08-11, closely aligned with the
   Government’s objectives, supported two key areas of emphasis: improved public
   expenditure management, and investment in infrastructure to increase economic
   opportunities and competitiveness. The CAS also proposed selective interactions in four
   priority areas identified in the FNDP:(i) macroeconomic management; (ii) infrastructure
   development; (iii) institutional capacity enhancement; and (iv) social sector development.
   Within these broad areas, the CAS identified the reform focus that the annual program of
   PRSCs would support. The PRSCs were to support Zambia better manage its financial
   resources to foster more inclusive growth.

10. The PRSC series complemented several lending projects under implementation.
    These included: Public Service Management (PSM) Program-Support Project approved
    in 2006, Increased access to Electricity Project (IAES) approved in 2008, Support for
    Economic Expansion and Diversification (SEED) approved in 2005 and the Zambia
    Investment Climate Program (ICP) under IFC.

11. The PRSC series was designed within the PRBS 4 framework developed by
    participating CPs in partnership with the Government. The Bank is a cosignatory, with
    other members of the PRBS group, to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that
    guides the process for budget support to the Government of the Republic of Zambia
    (GRZ). 5 The MoU records an understanding on common procedures for consultation and
    decision-making, disbursement mechanisms, monitoring and reporting, review and
    evaluation, audit, financial management, the exchange of information and cooperation
    between the signatories. The PRBS group members base their actual budget support on
    the progress attained in the implementation of the NDPs (FNDP for PRSC I and II, SNDP
    for PRSC III) as measured through the commonly agreed performance indicators between
    government and donors that are described in the PAF.




   4
     As of 2012, the PRBS group included DFID, the European Commission, Finland, Germany, Norway, the
   World Bank, and the African Development Bank AfDB the Netherlands exited in 2009.
   5
     The first MoU was signed in mid-2005 and then revised in June 2008 to include new CPs. The latest
   version was signed in November 2011.

                                                    3
12. At appraisal, a PRBS coordinated approach was considered beneficial in
    consolidating donor dialogue and reducing transaction costs for delivering aid. In a
    context where aid constituted an increasingly smaller share of budgetary resources, this
    approach was considered sensible. In light of the Government’s weak track record on
    major policy reform implementation, a harmonized donor approach provided the
    opportunity to carry out a consolidated dialogue towards major reforms. The PRBS
    provided a platform for the CPs to also coordinate their support to the Government. Joint
    reviews within this framework were instrumental in harmonizing and consolidating donor
    dialogue around the Government’s program.

13. At appraisal, the country was under an IMF program. IMF approved a three-year
    Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement with Zambia in June 2008. The
    program with the IMF focused on (i) maintaining macroeconomic and debt sustainability
    while increasing the fiscal space for investment in infrastructure, energy, and human
    resources, and (ii) diversifying the economy to lessen dependence on mining by
    improving the conditions for private sector-led growth. The program ended successfully
    in June 2011.

   1.2. Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators


14. According to both the appraisal document and the legal agreement the objectives of
    the PRSCs were to contribute:
       •   To preserve macroeconomic stability and to enhance public sector performance
           and,
       •   Support broad-based growth by improving efficiency of the energy sector and
           reduce the cost of doing business.
   To achieve these objectives, the program intended to support a subset of the
   Government’s policy reforms set out in the PAF, covering the areas of macroeconomic
   management, public sector reform, public finance management, energy and private sector
   development.
   The key outcome indicators were: the number of service delivery charters (SDCs)
   adopted; the number of new domestic connections to the ZESCO grid; the number of
   ZESCO customers who are unmetered; the number of days to start (license) a business;
   and the number of ‘illegal’ licenses dropped. In addition, the intermediate indicators
   include: domestic arrears to suppliers; value of employer arrears to Public Service
   Pension Fund (PSPF); development of pay policy; percent of budget head whose
   calculated expenditure is between 95 and 105 percent of the total funding and the
   implementation of the approved procurement law.


   1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification




                                               4
15. Objectives were not revised. However, one indicator on electricity metering was dropped,
    due to a change in government policy.

   1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

   Policy Area I: Preserving macroeconomic stability

16. At appraisal of the first PRSC, the Government had accumulated arrears to
    domestic suppliers and the pension fund to the tune of 1.1 percent of GDP. Prior to
    the PRSC appraisal the IMF program (Extended Credit Facility (ECF), 2004-2007) had
    given attention to avoiding unplanned expenditures. That program had included
    development of a multi-year plan to settle domestic arrears as a structural benchmark.
    Following IMF’s recommendation the Government had begun taking steps to clear all
    existing arrears to domestic suppliers and to the PSPF.

17. The PRSC program supported broader efforts for macro stability. In addition to
    clearing arrears consistent with the IMF programs (ECF, 2004-2007 and 2008-2011)
    macroeconomic stability was also broadly supported under the energy, public sector and
    private sector development reforms.

   Policy Area II: Improving public sector performance


18. Since the early 1990s the Government has been slowly but steadily implementing
    public service reforms through the Public Service Reform Program (PSRP). Some
    progress had been made over the years in public service downsizing, pay reform for
    senior public service employees, certain aspects of public sector restructuring –such as
    the privatization and commercialization of parastatals –and in undertaking initial reforms
    in PFM, such as the introduction of payroll management. In an effort to boost the PSRP
    process the Government prepared the second phase of the reforms in September 2003.
    The Bank supported the Government program through the PSM project that had three
    components: i) Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA);
    ii) PSM; and iii) Supporting Retrenchments.

19. The PRSC complemented the PSM component of the PSM project by supporting
    pay policy reform and improvement of public service delivery. By supporting the
    development and implementation of a comprehensive public service pay policy, the
    PRSC series intended to help ensure the reform of an existing pay policy that was
    considered ad hoc and led to poor service delivery. In addition, supporting the adoption
    and institutionalization of SDCs was deemed a key element to service delivery reform.
    The SDCs were expected to set delivery standards that would make public servants more
    accountable.

   Policy Area III: PFM and Procurement




                                                5
20. Despite the PEMFA and IMF program’s support to broader PFM reforms,
    implementation lagged and weaknesses continued to inhibit spending efficiency 6.
    The IMF program (ECF, 2008-2011) recognized that improved budget and expenditure
    management and public procurement reform was critical to enhancing spending
    efficiency. The PEFA evaluation (2008) showed modest improvements in several PFM
    indicators, notably budget credibility, as well as its comprehensiveness and transparency
    and with regard to internal auditing and accounting. However, weaknesses still existed in
    budget execution: variances across individual budget heads continued to be significant;
    the accessibility of budget information remained limited; and internal payroll controls
    needed strengthening. Corresponding weaknesses in the procurement systems contributed
    to poor budget execution and poor value for money. Cognizant of the importance of this
    issue, the Government embarked on a comprehensive program of reforms to increase
    transparency; enhance competition and efficiency, and develop a regulatory framework
    for the country, including an arbitration system. A critical milestone was the passage of
    the Public Procurement Law No. 12 of 2008. The Law provided for the eventual
    establishment of the Zambia Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA) as a policy,
    regulatory and monitoring body for public procurement and the intermediate continuation
    of the Zambia National Tender Board for a two year transition period up to December
    2010. The full implementation of IFMIS was also recognized as critical to ensuring
    effective processing and timely production of financial information. The Government
    program under the PEMFA and PAF included policies that aimed to address these
    weaknesses. The Bank under the PEMFA component of the PSM project supported the
    Government program.

21. The PRSC consolidated the PEMFA and IMF support to monitor reforms targeted
    at improving PFM and procurement to strengthen: (a) predictability and control in
    budget execution; (b) internal and external audit; and (c) policy based budgeting. The
    PRSC also supported the rollout of IFMIS and procurement reforms to ensure greater
    budget credibility and control in budget execution. In addition, this would also contribute
    to broader macroeconomic stability.

   Policy Area IV: Improving efficiency in the energy sector


22. Zambia faces an electricity supply deficit in the medium-term and sizable new
    investment is needed to meet the deficit. The energy sector had also been plagued by
    inefficiencies, which deterred new investments. The country had not made major
    investments in new generation capacity since the development of the major hydro-power
    stations in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The poor financial condition and weak
    operational performance of ZESCO, the state-owned power company, has been an
    obstacle to undertaking the new investments whilst simultaneously posing a risk to fiscal
    stability and broader macroeconomic stability. To address the electricity supply deficit
    and sustain the sector, the Government developed a strategy that sought to address short-,
    medium-, and long-term issues in the energy sector. The strategy centered on improving

   efficiency and the financial position of the sector to enable new investments. The IMF
   program and the Bank’s IAES project supported the Government’s program in the
   electricity sector.

23. The PRSC supported the Government’s policy actions aimed at improving
    efficiency and the financial position of ZESCO. The program supported: tariff
    adjustments towards cost reflective levels, increasing electricity access and customer
    metering. These would improve the sector’s financial position and efficiency and enable
    it to attract new investments. In addition, a self-sustaining public utility company—
    ZESCO –would contribute to broad macroeconomic stability.

   Policy Area V: Improving business environment

24. The 2005 Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) Administrative Barriers
    Study had described Zambia’s licensing as “cumbersome, time consuming and all
    too frequently redundant?. It recommended that the Government review all registration
    and licensing inspection procedures to simplify requirements, reduce discretionary
    powers, eliminate redundancy of procedures and information, promote information
    sharing, and reduce procedural time and cost. To address these challenges, the
    Government in collaboration with the private sector had been undertaking reforms in
    business licensing under a private sector development (PSD) reform program.

25. The PRSC supported a licensing reform toward improving the business climate. The
    actions supported were: (i) identification and review of all business licenses in Zambia
    and determination of appropriate recommendations for reform; and (ii) the
    implementation of agreed licensing reforms, including establishment of an e-registry and
    screening mechanism to ensure that all new licensing regulations are appropriate.

   1.5. Revised Policy Areas

26. Policy areas were not revised.

   1.6. Other significant changes

27. As the next section shows there were changes in PRSC triggers that influenced the prior
    actions.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


   2.1.Program Performance

28. All the PRSC series, I, II and III were single-tranche operations that disbursed on
    effectiveness. The PRSC series were aligned with the reform agenda as spelled out under
    the PAF. PRSC I was approved on March 30, 2010 and became effective on July 22,
    2010. PRSC II was approved on March 31, 2011 and became effective on August 22,
    2011. And PRSC III was approved on May 3, 2012 and became effective on June 11,

                                               7
   2012. The subsequent operations build on the previous ones and prior actions followed an
   incremental sequencing to sustain and push the reforms deeper (Table.1).

29. Three of the eleven triggers for PRSC II were dropped (Annex 4 Table 2). Out of three,
    two triggers on “PSPF business plan publicly discussed and debated by end-2009? and
    the “beginning of the Job evaluation exercise? had already been met. But the trigger on
    “30 percent reduction achieved in compliance costs associated with licensing? was
    dropped due to the impossibility of quantifying the action. Further, the prior action on
    procurement guidelines was relaxed from the original trigger of “approval of
    regulations/guidelines? to “submission of the draft regulations/guidelines to Ministry of
    Justice?.

30. Two of the eight triggers for PRSC III were dropped, while an additional two were
    revised (Annex 4, Table 2). The protracted constitution making process and change in
    ZESCO electricity metering policy led to the dropping of the trigger on “PSPF agreement
    reached on pension rights for new entrants to the PSPF? and “the number of unmetered
    ZESCO customers reduced to 40,000? respectively. The triggers on “adopting an
    institutional framework for implementing the pay policy? and “development of standard
    bid documents and requests for proposals templates? were revised once it became
    apparent that they were not going to be met within the specified time. 7

   a/ While this prior action was considered met during the PRSC II appraisal, it was discovered at PRSC III
   appraisal that it was not met due an error in reporting that did not take into account the policy change in
   metering.

31. Under the PRSC program results matrix there were eleven indicators related to
    Prior Actions which largely remained unchanged during the program. These
    indicators are important in assessing the PRSC performance. The indicators in the results
    matrix identified at the start of the operation are used for the entire series. Although one
    indicator on electricity metering was dropped, due to a change in measurement
    parameters, the reform focus remained unchanged. The majority of indicators acted as
    prior actions. Three of the indicators - on PSPF, domestic arrears and budget variance -
    were not achieved at the closure of the program. The remaining seven indicators (in
    addition to the dropped indicator) were broadly achieved (Annex 4.Table 3).

   2.2.Major Factors Affecting Implementation


   Adequacy of Government’s commitment

32. The Government demonstrated broad commitment to reforms in the policy areas
    identified by the PRSC series although implementation was slow. Despite
    Government commitment towards reforms as set out in the NDPs and other policy
    documents, Zambia’s weak implementation of major reforms that characterized past
    efforts continued. The pace of procurement reforms was particularly slow. A protracted
    ongoing constitution making process affected progress on pension reforms. The death of
    President Mwanawasa in 2008 and the election in September 2011, also affected the pace
    of implementation. During the first six months of the Patriotic Front (PF) Government,
    when the third and final operation was negotiated, there was also no clear sense of policy
    direction.

   Soundness of background analysis

33. The PRSC was designed on the basis of sound analytical work undertaken prior to
    the preparation of the first project and during the implementation of subsequent
    operations. The program benefitted from: PEMFAR 2004, the Jobs and Competitiveness
    Report (2010), the Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2010), the Poverty and
    Vulnerability Assessment (PVA, 2007), and the diagnostic work on “constraints to
    inclusive growth? 8 undertaken as an input into the CAS (2008-2011). It also drew on
    reports and evaluations carried out by GRZ, such as the Public Expenditure and Financial
    Accountability Assessments (PEFA, 2005 and 2008). In the energy sector, the PRSC was

   informed by technical assistance provided to the “Electricity Sector Performance
   Review?. The Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2010) influenced the design of measures
   to strengthen efficiency and equity in public spending and suggested measures to improve
   the budget and planning processes. The effectiveness of the background analysis was
   however, limited to the extent the Bank was able to influence the PAF that provided the
   basis for program design.

34. In parallel the Bank provided technical assistance through ongoing projects. The
    ongoing projects (noted in para 10 above) were critical to the overall pace,
    implementation and outcome of the PRSC. For instance the slow pace of procurement,
    PFM and public service performance reform is directly linked to the progress of the PSM
    project.

35. A programmatic approach was adopted in line with lessons learned from past DPOs.
    The emphasis on sustained dialogue, which was inherent in this approach proved critical
    in ensuring that reforms that had earlier dragged or stagnated were ultimately brought
    back on track by the closure of the program. For instance reforms under procurement,
    public pay policy and IFMIS although slow at start had their indicators met by the time of
    program closure.

   Changes in the PAF and implications for PRSC

36. A PAF revision in 2011 weakened the alignment between PAF and PRSC series. The
    PAF was revised to have fewer indicators to increase its strategic focus. This revision led
    to the number of indicators being reduced from 34 in the 2009-11 PAF to 14 in the 2011-
    13 PAF. However, this revision was undertaken during the run-up to an election at a time
    when the administration was in the midst of a campaign. The significant change in the
    PAF was further compounded by the fact that the Bank team in Lusaka itself was in
    transition at the time, including a change in PRSC Task Team Leader (TTL) as well as in
    Country Management Unit (CMU). This led to the Bank being less involved in PAF
    revisions than it should have been. The revised PAF had dropped some of the PRSC
    program indicators.

37. Bank coordination with donors on PAF became a challenge under PRSC III. As a
    result of significant reduction in PAF indicators, 7 of the 11 PRSC program indicators
    exited the PAF. 9 In keeping with the programmatic nature of the series the PRSC
    however, continued to support policy areas as identified in PRSC I and consistent with
    the earlier PAF (2009–11). This created some donor coordination challenges because the
    Bank’s PRSC was not in full alignment with the new PAF (2011-13).

   Relevance of risk analysis




   9
     Indicators on PSPF, domestic arrears, PSM, Energy-ZESCO, and business environment were eliminated
   from the PAF monitoring framework.

                                                   11
38. Three risks were identified: external shock, political and institutional capacity.
    Mitigating measures were for the most part, adequately analyzed. Zambia’s
    vulnerability to lasting effects of the global crisis due to the economy’s reliance on
    copper threatened growth prospects. The PRSC program was designed to help sustain
    Zambia’s strong macroeconomic record, which contributed to relatively comfortable
    international reserves. In addition, the flexible exchange rate regime was also expected to
    mitigate this risk. The risk that the pace of reforms would be slow due to populist
    political pressures before and in the follow up to the elections was acknowledged,
    particularly involving energy reforms. Continued dialogue was expected to mitigate this
    risk. Institutional risk resulting from governance challenges and implementation capacity
    was also acknowledged. Bank engagement with PEMFA and demand for good
    governance activities was expected to mitigate this risk.

39. The risks were considered moderate, and although all the three occurred in varying
    magnitudes, they did not have significant impact on program implementation. On
    the macroeconomic front, while the global crisis did occur the Government’s overall
    management of the crisis was adequate. However, continued budget overruns due to the
    food subsidy continued to be a source of concern for agricultural reforms and fiscal
    management. The perceived political risk in the aftermath of the elections did not lead to
    policy reversals, since the new administration did not come to power on a significantly
    different mandate, and thus had little incentive to adjust the reforms.

   2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

40. The PRSC program expected to draw upon the monitoring framework of PAF that
    was to have two reviews each year. However, when some PRSC indicators exited the
    PAF in 2011 as discussed above, monitoring the PRSC results matrix became a challenge.
    The Government stopped monitoring the progress of dropped indicators within the PRBS.
    Therefore, monitoring of PRSC indicators required a separate monitoring mechanism
    outside the PRBS framework (see para 42).

41. The linkages between policy actions, outcome indicators and PDOs were not
    consistently strong. Eleven indicators were part of the matrix of policy actions for the
    three PRSCs. It was however, a challenge to use the indicators to infer on the program
    performance as some of these indicators were process-oriented indicators rather than
    outcome indicators (for example those on procurement reforms). Further, several
    milestones could not be objectively assessed. For instance, references to certain
    milestones being “begun?, “discussed? and “debated? depended on subjective
    interpretation.

42. Monitoring implementation: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) was responsible for
    overall coordination of supervision and monitoring of program implementation for the
    entire PRSC series. The matrix of policy actions indicated the agencies responsible for
    collecting data for indicator monitoring with data compilation and analysis carried by the
    M&E department of MoF. It was updated during program implementation and reviewed
    annually under the PRBS framework. When the PRSC indicators exited the PAF with
    PRSCIII their monitoring had to be undertaken outside of the PRBS arrangement,

                                                12
   through Bank missions and dialogue. This need for parallel dialogue increased the
   transaction costs on both the Government and the Bank.

43. Monitoring utilization: The monitoring framework included a review of the policy
    actions and indicators identified within the PAF and the PRSC matrix. During the
    preparation of the ICR, the team largely relied on Government/PRBS donor review
    reports to fill out the indicators table that were still part of the PAF. In addition, separate
    missions’ aide memoires and continued dialogue was used to fill out the remainder of the
    indicators data (see Annex). The monitoring (including Bank dialogue and missions) was
    adequate for tracking progress of policy actions and outcomes. Data was evaluated and
    used to inform decision making. For instance, in PRSC III, an energy indicator was
    dropped after the monitoring framework revealed a change in monitoring parameters.
    Also several actions were relaxed to accommodate reality of slow progress as identified
    in the monitoring framework.

   2.4. Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

44. A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was approved by the Board on 14th
    March 2013. Given the prevailing environment around major policy reforms, the CPS
    proposes a flexible approach. The budget support credits could include policy actions if
    the Government prepares a strong program of policy reforms that are reflected in the PAF.
    In the absence of strong policy actions, the Bank will consider other instruments also to
    support a program of institutional reforms and capacity building for economic and public
    sector management. The areas covered could include PFM, procurement, debt
    management, fiscal decentralization, project appraisal, M&E and statistical capacity
    building. The underlying strategy would be to complement financial support with
    advisory activities.

   3. Assessment of Outcomes

   3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

           Rating for relevance of Objective: Highly Relevant
           Rating for relevance of Design and Implementation: Relevant


45. Overall relevance of the PRSC program is rated Substantial. This is an aggregation
    of the high relevance of PDOs, and a modestly relevant design.

   Relevance of Objectives

46. The objectives of the PRSC series were stated rather broadly and remain relevant
    even today. Despite positive progress under PRSC operations, preserving
    macroeconomic stability and improving public sector performance needs further
    attention; and much remains to be done in improving and sustaining energy sector
    efficiency and improved business environment. These objectives also remain consistent
    with the SNDP objectives (2011-2015) and the ruling Party Manifesto.

                                                  13
   Relevance of Design

47. The relevance of PRSC design to deliver on these objectives is rated as modest.
    Given the broad nature of the PDOs, and the several other projects that were supporting
    achievements in the same areas, it is difficult to draw a causal link between progress on
    goals supported and outcome of the PDOs. Further, many of the actions in the PRSC
    were process-oriented. That said, the PRSC should be viewed as part of a multi-faceted
    strategy; it was aligned with other ongoing Bank and IMF/CPs’ reform programs. As
    such, although many of the PRSC actions were intermediate steps in institutional reform
    processes and arguably not sufficiently ambitious in and of themselves, they were part of
    a broader reform agenda supported by the Bank and other donors. For instance, under the
    objective of preserving macroeconomic stability, the PRSC action on domestic arrears
    was aligned with the IMF program. Reforms in the energy sector were similarly in line
    with Bank support under its sectoral intervention and also supported broader
    macroeconomic stability. PSM reforms were designed to complement and consolidate a
    Bank and multi-donor effort towards PSM and PFM reforms.

48. The PRBS provided a platform for the CPs to coordinate their support to the
    Government. The PRBS framework was designed partly to avoid duplication of results-
    monitoring and to limit transaction costs to the authorities. Government performance was
    jointly assessed against the commonly agreed performance indicators between
    Government and donors as described in the PAF. As such, it was a requirement that
    individual CPs’ program design their support either partially or wholly on only PAF
    indicators.

49. The Bank-PRBS dialogue to strengthen the PAF was challenging. The process of
    arriving at commonly agreed PAF indicators amongst the PRBS CPs was protracted.
    Generally the policy content of the PAF was weak and it was after much effort that the
    Bank succeeded in including the energy sector policy indicators that were critical to the
    country’s development priorities. That said, the Bank’s ability to further influence the
    PAF indicators was constrained by the PRBS MoU that guided the process for budget
    support in Zambia (see para 11).

50. The analytical underpinning could have benefited from a political economy analysis.
    Zambia’s track record of slow implementation of major reforms required a deeper
    understanding of political economy around these reforms. This is particularly important
    for PSM and PFM areas where the analytical underpinnings had identified that reforms
    here have been historically slow. In addition, political economy risks to some reforms
    were not sufficiently analyzed. For instance, those associated with comprehensive pay
    policy reform that has not managed to mitigate the recent unsustainable significant
    increase in the public service wage bill.

   3.2. Achievement of Program Development Objectives


51. Achievement of the PDOs is moderately satisfactory. The PRSC program consolidated
    and complemented other Bank and donor programs to attain positive progress in PDOs.

                                               14
   The broad macroeconomic focus of the PRSC program contributed to macroeconomic
   stability in Zambia. Real GDP was estimated at 7.3 percent in 2012, a robust performance
   in spite of mining sector GDP decline. Indeed, Zambia transitioned to a low middle
   income country during the PRSC period. The prospects remain positive, as prudent
   macroeconomic management continued and growth in mining, construction and real
   estate sectors are expected to underpin this performance. Annex 4 provides key economic
   and financial indicators. In addition, positive strides were achieved in improving energy
   sector efficiency and reducing the cost of doing business. Less progress was however,
   attained under public sector performance and PFM reforms, as these were more affected
   by the political transitions. However, the likelihood of progress under these reforms has
   recently strengthened as momentum within Government to tackle these reform areas has
   increased.

52. At completion of PRSC, the indicators that were broadly met were: (i) development
    and adoption of the public service pay policy – implemented in 2012; (ii) the
    implementation of procurement legislation though delayed is back on track; (iii)
    significant roll out of IFMIS; (iv) implementation of SDCs in eight MPSAs; (v) the
    number of new domestic connections to ZESCO has increased; (vi) the number of
    ZESCO customers who are unmetered while it decreased in 2008, due to change in the
    metering policy was dropped; (vii) elimination of illegal licenses and (viii) significant
    reduction in the number of days to start a business. Annex 4 also provides information on
    policy actions, indicators, and the matrix of policy actions.
   Objective 1: Preserving macroeconomic stability and improving public sector
   performance
         Preserving macroeconomic stability: moderately satisfactory
         Improving public sector performance: moderately satisfactory
         Overall rating: moderately satisfactory

    Preserving macroeconomic stability
53. The progress towards preserving macroeconomic stability was moderately
    satisfactory. The program supported actions aimed at consolidating macroeconomic
    stability achieved in the previous decade. Fiscal discipline was critical to this objective.
    The specific focus was on entrenching fiscal discipline and reducing fiscal risks by
    managing contingent liabilities in a proactive manner. The PRSC focused on eliminating
    government/employer contribution arrears owed to the PSPF. The aim was also to
    address PSPF’s financial stability over the longer term. Positive movement has taken
    place in this regard. PSPF employer contribution arrears stood at ZMK305 billion at the
    start of the program, they have been gradually reduced to ZMK82 billion as of end-2012.
    With the exception of Defense forces, all employer pension contribution is remitted
    automatically from the payroll account to PSPF by the Accountant General. In the short
    run, arrears were reduced which contributed to ensuring that PSPF’s cash flow position
    improved. A more important issue of reforming the pension sector was however, dropped
    since it got entangled in the constitution review process. In recent months, there has been
    renewed momentum towards long-term pension reforms with support being provided by
    the Bank, IMF and ILO. The PRSC-sustained dialogue has contributed to this recent
    movement.

                                                15
54. In addition, preserving macro stability was also broadly supported through other
    reforms included in the PRSC. Energy sector reforms that are discussed under the next
    PDO outcome entailed improving efficiency and the financial position of the sector
    which is critical to preserving macroeconomic stability in the long term.

   Improving public sector performance

55. The progress towards improving public service performance has been moderately
    satisfactory. The program supported the development and implementation of a
    comprehensive pay policy that was approved by the Cabinet in 2009. A job evaluation
    exercise that started in 2010 was concluded in 2012 and is due for a phased
    implementation in the 2013-2016 budgets. A remuneration division within Public Service
    Management Department in the Cabinet Office has been instituted by the Cabinet in 2013
    that will oversee the pay policy. The challenge going forward is to link the pay policy to
    improved public service performance.

56. However, some encouraging progress has been made towards increasing
    accountability for service delivery for select public services. The PRSC supported the
    establishment of SDCs as a key element of service delivery reform. By 2012, eight SDCs
    were adopted and institutionalized: in the Ministry of Lands and the Department of
    Immigration; in the Public Sector Management Division (PSMD), the Department of
    National Registration, the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources
    (MTENR); the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development (MMMD); the Ministry of
    Agriculture and Livestock and Patents and Company Registration Agency (PACRA).
    Accountability for service delivery has improved in selected sectors. A report by ZIPAR
    (2010) found that in the Department of Immigration, the time to process a passport has
    been reduced to 5-7 days on payment of appropriate fee, in contrast to the recent past
    where the wait could be as long as three months. At the Ministry of Lands, an
    information center has been established, at which the public can now easily access
    information on registered land title, although there are still remaining difficulties with
    registering land titles.

57. In the area of PFM, the PRSC supported the reduction of budget variance and roll
    out of IFMIS systems. The aim was to increase the effectiveness of the budget as a tool
    for financial planning. Progress towards the objectives has been less encouraging.
    Domestic arrears have persisted and as of end-2012 were ZMK484 billion. Budget
    execution and credibility as monitored by the program deteriorated. Only 28 percent of
    the Ministries and Public Sector Agencies (MPSA) have a (+/-) 5% or less expenditure
    variance against the budget in 2011 compared to 85 percent in 2008. Despite these
    challenges, there has been progress towards long term reforms. As of June, 2012, 28
    IFMIS sites were operational. The challenges that had delayed reforms have been
    gradually overcome. However, until the system is fully rolled out, its impact on improved
    financial reporting and accountability will not be evident.

58. Progress of procurement reform was slow during the PRSC time period but has
    gained momentum lately. A critical milestone was the passage of the Public
    Procurement Law No. 12 of 2008. Actual implementation of the Law was slow to take

                                               16
   off (para 20). The governance issues that highlighted irregularity in procurement in 2009
   in the health and road sectors contributed to this delay as the CPs and the Government
   took steps towards corrective action. Recent progress includes the preparation (PRSC II
   Prior Action), approval and publication (PRSC III Prior Action) of Procurement
   Regulations. After the 2011 elections that led to a new government, political will towards
   procurement reforms strengthened. In 2012 a new CEO of ZPPA was appointed and
   since then the procurement reforms have gained momentum. The audicious step was the
   pronouncement in April 2012 that procurement would be fully decentralized to ministries
   and public spending agencies in January 2013 except for cases of direct contracting or
   single source. Operational efficiency has improved in response to decentralization. ZPPA
   has assumed its oversight role that has already yielded positive results. For instance,
   US$20 million was saved in 2012 fertilizer procurement under the Ministry of
   Agriculture due to ZPPA leadership ensuring a competitive bidding process.

   Objective 2: Supporting broad-based growth by improving efficiency in the energy
   sector and improving business environment

           Improving efficiency in energy sector: satisfactory
           Improving business environment: satisfactory
           Overall rating: satisfactory


59. Satisfactory progress has been made in enhancing the efficiency and financial
    position of the energy parastatal. Improving the financial position of ZESCO required a
    major step towards cost recovery. The Government announced a multi-year tariff
    framework in 2009 that resulted in adjustment of tariffs by an average of 87 percent over
    2009-2011 to near cost recovery levels. Since 2008, the Energy Regulation Board has
    used the performance-evaluation framework of key performance indicators (KPIs) to
    monitor operational performance and to enforce penalties should ZESCO underperform.
    The company is also progressing on its plan to expand the installation of pre-paid
    electricity meters across the country. Overall, ZESCO is now an operationally sound
    entity in terms of current and near future financial performance. This has improved the
    energy sector’s attractiveness to investors.

60. Positive strides were made in reducing the cost of doing business. The PRSC focused
    on reforming business licensing and setting up an informational e-registry. The goal was
    to eliminate illegal licenses and reduce cost of doing business. Progress has been made in
    streamlining business licensing to reduce the regulatory burden. Following the
    completion of PRSC I, out of the total 517 business licenses that existed in Zambia prior
    to 2009, 170 have been eliminated, and the rest retained, amalgamated or reclassified.
    Procedures and processes associated with the remaining business licenses were also
    streamlined. In 2012 Government passed 18 laws, which cover 151 business licenses, of
    which 42 have been eliminated. An informational e-registry, hosted by the Zambia
    Development Agency (ZDA) was established in 2011. The number of days to start a
    business significantly reduced from 35 days in 2007 to 18 in 2012. Zambia’s Doing
    Business rank improved from 116 in 2008 to 76 in 2011, with the country being
    recognized among the 10 top reformers globally. However, investment climate reforms

                                               17
   need to be sustained as the recent cost of doing business (2012 and 2013) shows Zambia
   ranking stagnating.

    3.3. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
61. Based on the combined assessment of efficacy and relevance, the overall program
    outcome rating is moderately satisfactory (Table 2). The relevance of objectives is
    high and of the design is moderate. The achievement of program objectives is moderately
    satisfactory. The PRSC provided a platform for sustained dialogue that contributed to
    positive progress of reforms in preserving macroeconomic stability, energy, business
    environment, public sector and PFM. Indeed, even in areas where reforms have been
    frustratingly slow, the sustained PRSC dialogue eventually bore fruit.

   3.4. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
62. The effect on poverty alleviation was expected to be positive but indirect. Over most
    of the PRSC period a significant amount of budgetary resources have gone to weakly
    targeted agricultural subsidies that have not helped develop the agriculture sector with
    potential to make a major contribution to reducing poverty. It is only in the recent weeks
    that there has been positive movement as Government removed fuel and some agriculture
    subsidies with the expectation of reorienting public expenditure resources towards
    effective poverty reducing ventures. The reforms in PFM and procurement will
    potentially have a positive indirect effect on poverty in the long run. But it will take time
    before the efficiency gains in public expenditure open up the necessary fiscal space that
    could boost poverty related expenditure and ultimately translate into better living

                                                 18
   conditions. The gains under PSPF regarding financial stability helped preserve
   macroeconomic stability. This ensured fiscal sustainability, mitigating against a
   macroeconomic shock that could have potentially hurt the poor. Improving the energy
   sector financial position by adjusting tariffs has an overall positive impact on the poor.
   While increase in energy prices negatively affected the poor, the elimination of a poorly
   targeted electricity subsidy provided for a relatively better targeted cross subsidy that
   reduced the negative effect of higher electricity prices. In the long run, the poor will
   potentially benefit from higher electricity generation capacity by having higher electricity
   access. It should also be noted that the program ensured an increase of customers to the
   ZESCO grid, which should have had some effect on reducing urban poverty. Higher
   electricity capacity could also mean lower tariffs for the poor in the long run.

   (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63. Institution strengthening and capacity building were supported in this
    programmatic series, in addition to the capacity support provided by parallel Bank
    programs. Substantial capacity building has been part of the IFMIS implementation.
    Capacity was built with the set-up of the first site in MoF. This has been used to leverage
    additional capacity as MoF was then mandated to provide training in the new sites. In
    addition, technical assistance has been provided to train and address challenges as they
    appear. This in the longer term will enhance PFM capacity in the Government.
    Procurement reforms have also been accompanied by capacity building. The procurement
    capacity, while still limited especially in MPSAs, has been strengthened as TA has been
    provided. Government’s monitoring system has also been substantially strengthened
    through learning-by-doing since the PRSC program relied on Government’s M&E
    systems. Government provides bi-annual monitoring reports on the PAF and also it
    produces an annual NDP progress report.


   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

64. There were no unintended consequences.

   3.5. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

65. There was no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshop.

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

66. The risk that development outcomes or expected outcomes will not be maintained is
    moderate. Three risks to the program are identified.

67. Political risk is moderate. While the pace of reforms, and hence of the achievement of
    development objectives, cannot remain unaffected by the political risk, the stability of
    Zambia’s democratic system provides some hope that this risk remains low. Having
    achieved four peaceful, political transitions, Zambia has a relatively stable political system.
    The risk of a big, disruptive political change therefore is low. The country is working on a

                                                  19
   new constitution and the transition to it will likely be smooth and peaceful. The risk of
   reversal of institutional reforms is particularly low since they have been going on for a
   few years and are mature. Nevertheless, as has been attested by the pay policy, the risk of
   political capture of policy reforms towards populist tendencies is high.

68. Institutional capacity erosion risk is moderate. The likelihood of this risk emanates from
    frequent administrative changes that have a destabilizing impact. In the last year there
    have been frequent changes in senior management positions, including at the ministerial
    level that have affected the smooth functioning of the Government machinery. Ministries
    and districts have also been re-aligned frequently. These changes have been disruptive to
    the smooth implementation of programs. Nonetheless, there are signs that the
    Government is settling. It should also be noted that recent changes in senior staff have led
    to replacements with seasoned civil servants that could benefit the pace of reforms.
    Indeed, the momentum of reforms such as in the procurement area have picked due to
    these recent administrative changes.

69. The External macroeconomic risk is moderate. The likelihood of this risk occurring is
    moderate due to Zambia’s high exposure to movements in copper prices. However,
    Zambia has demonstrated its capacity to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment.
    This track record is encouraging in light of downside risks from an uncertain global
    economic environment. This was endorsed by the markets; in September 2012 when
    Zambia’s inaugural sovereign bond was 15 times oversubscribed. The economic outlook
    is positive with the economy expected to grow above 7 percent in the medium term.
    While the uncertain policy environment continues, its likely impact on the overall
    economic environment is expected to be moderate. The likelihood of a new IMF program
    should consolidate the macroeconomic gains.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

   5.1 Bank Performance


70. Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory


   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

           Rating: Moderately satisfactory

71. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is moderately satisfactory. The Bank
    followed several required practices in designing the series. The PRSC aligned with
    Government priorities as set out in the PAF, as well as the Bank’s CAS and built on
    lessons learnt from previous operations. The operation was also underpinned by
    analytical work that enabled identification of policy and institutional reforms that were
    supported by the program. The program was also aligned with other complementary
    Bank programs, and benefited from the deep knowledge of sector issues in the project


                                                20
   teams. The PRSC task team involved key sector specialists, most of whom where based
   in the field and were deeply engaged in the policy dialogue.

72. However, there remained weaknesses in design that were not resolved during
    implementation. As already discussed, the PRSC was significantly constrained by the
    PAF approach. In this regard, the policy focus and prior actions supported by the program
    did not reflect Government’s more ambitious priorities as much as they represented the
    lowest common denominator of agreement between donors and the Government. The
    extent, to which the PAF was ultimately a negotiated compromise, and subsequently
    more process than outcome-oriented, contributed to a weak causal link with PDOs.

73. The decision to design a programmatic series as opposed to a single tranche
    operation was sound. This was one of the lessons learnt from the previous support that
    encouraged a programmatic approach. It was an especially beneficial approach for public
    sector and PFM reforms, which necessarily required a prolonged and sustained dialogue
    to achieve some measure of success. A programmatic approach was also particularly
    important for PFM and procurement reforms which had gained momentum by the time
    the PRSC concluded.


   (b) Quality of Supervision

           Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74. The quality of supervision is moderately satisfactory. As already discussed, Bank
    supervision involved PRBS reviews, Bank missions and continuous country dialogue by
    field based staff.

75. Throughout the program implementation, the Bank showed flexibility to proactively
    identify and resolve threats to the achievement of the development outcomes. For
    instance, when it became clear that reforms in PSPF could not go on as planned due to a
    protracted constitutional making process, the Bank maintained the dialogue and was
    flexible on the program triggers. Also when the metering policy had been changed
    rendering the measurement of the earlier policy actions obsolete, the Bank refocused the
    prior actions while staying within the overall reform agenda. The Bank also remained
    flexible on the timing of reforms especially under procurement and IFMIS to enable the
    reforms to be carried out. In addition, on indicators exiting the PAF the Bank remained
    flexible by using other monitoring mechanisms to monitor progress.

76. The Bank transition could have been managed better to sustain PRBS dialogue
    during the important revision stage. This could have ensured PRSC indicators
    remained within the PAF. But even then when the PRSC seemingly became less aligned
    to the new PAF as a result of the revision, more could have been done to allow this
    flexibility within the donor dialogue.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance


                                               21
77. Overall Bank performance was moderately satisfactory. This is in light of
    combination of quality at entry and quality of supervision ratings that yield a combined
    moderately satisfactory rating.

   5.2 Borrower Performance

   Government Performance/Implementing Agency/Overall Borrower Performance

           Rating: Moderately satisfactory

78. The Borrower’s performance is moderately satisfactory. The implementing agency
    and Government were the same in this case as the MoF was the implementing and
    coordinating body for the reform program. MoF was also accountable for the overall
    program. At the closure of PRSC, overall progress on all policy areas was encouraging.
    However, PSPF reforms, PFM and procurement progress were slower than had been
    anticipated. Though delayed, there has been noteworthy positive momentum towards
    these reform areas in recent months.

79. Government expressed commitment to the reform program supported by the PRSC
    as reflected in the PAF. However, the PAF was a consensus document between the
    CPs and the Government and did not necessarily capture the latter’s top priorities.
    Government’s performance on the macroeconomic front was impressive. Under the IMF
    PRGF program that concluded in June 2011, Government’s performance was satisfactory,
    despite election-related expenditure pressures for agriculture subsidies and the impact of
    the global financial crisis. The fiscal balance was within program targets and inflation
    had been in single digits. The prudent macroeconomic management provided a strong
    enabling environment for the PRSC operations. However, implementation of reforms was
    slow especially in areas of PSPF, PFM and procurement. In addition there was a weak
    link between PAF indicators and the overall policy agenda of Government as set out by
    its national planning framework. The Government-PAF dialogue was mainly focused on
    reduction of transaction costs and on donor performance along disbursement targets.
    Indeed, Government’s own performance with respect to the PAF has been declining since
    2006, with the exception of 2010.

80. The Government created an institutional set up to consistently monitor progress.
    Within the framework of PRBS, the M&E function was a mandate of the M&E
    department of MoF. The External Technical Assistance (ETC) section under the
    Economic Management department was in charge of overall coordination of the PRBS
    framework. This framework has been strengthened overtime as PRBS evolved. Both the
    M&E and ETC functions have been strengthened and capacity to manage their mandate
    made stronger.

   6. Lessons Learned

81. Lesson 1: Success was more noticeable in areas which coincided with Government’s
    own priorities and where Bank had other instruments to engage outside the PRBS
    framework. Much was achieved in the areas of energy and private sector development.

                                               22
   Both of these areas were government priorities and the Bank had engagement through
   lending projects. Less was achieved in PSM where the Bank had engagement through a
   lending project but Government interest was muted. This principle of strong government
   interest combined with significant Bank engagement outside the budget support
   framework can be used for deciding upon future budget support operations too.

82. Lesson 2: A corollary of lesson 1 is that while the PRBS framework provides a
    platform for sustained dialogue, by itself it has limited leverage in influencing
    Government policy and institutional actions in the Zambian context. This is quite
    evident in the declining overall performance of the Government on PAF indicators in the
    past few years. There are several reasons behind this conclusion. One, the PAF document
    itself is the outcome of protracted negotiations and compromises between different
    groups of donors and the Government. As such it reflects the minimum common
    denominator as to what can be achieved and is unlikely to be a true reflection of
    Government’s most strongly held priorities. Two, the context of budget support in
    Zambia has changed; ODA has declined dramatically as a share of Government’s
    resources and unless the PAF mimics Government’s strongly held priorities, it will have
    limited impact.

83. The Bank should consider any future budget support in light of the above two
    lessons. One scenario would be where the PAF is fully aligned with the Government’s
    strong priorities. In such a scenario, the Bank could consider providing budget support
    towards areas where the Bank has significant engagement through other instruments –
    lending and non-lending. One objective of budget support in such a situation could be to
    strengthen the hands of the Ministry of Finance in guiding and directing reforms. In an
    alternative scenario, the PRBS/PAF framework could become more flexible to allow for
    individual CPs’ programs to support broad Government policy agenda beyond the PAF.
    That would ensure that each CP is accountable for its program strength and yet remains
    in harmony with the PRBS framework. In the latter scenario the Bank should also weigh
    the considerable costs of participating in PRBS Group with the benefits of such
    participation. The latter approach also necessarily means the Bank and Government
    counterparts would have to supplement monitoring efforts beyond PRBS monitoring
    mechanisms.

84. Lesson 3. The Bank should manage transitions within the Bank team more
    systematically. This is indeed a very general point but in this particular case it became
    very important. The Bank’s absence from key PAF revision discussions due to staff
    transition had significant implications for the PRSC. It led to a misalignment between
    PAF and PRSC and strained relations between the Bank, donors and government.

     1. Introduction

The World Bank has been supporting the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ)
in the implementation of its budget through the provision of Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs). The Bank has been providing PRSCs within the harmonized Poverty
Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) framework agreed by participating Cooperating
Partners (CPs) in partnership with the GRZ. The Bank is a cosignatory, with other
members of the PRBS group, to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that guides the
process for budget support to the GRZ. 10 The MoU records an understanding on common
procedures for consultation and decision-making, disbursement mechanisms, monitoring
and reporting, review and evaluation, audit, financial management, the exchange of
information and cooperation between the signatories. The PRBS group members base
their actual budget support on the progress attained in the implementation of the National
Development Plans (NDPs) as measured through the jointly agreed performance
indicators between Government and CPs that are described in the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF).

Through the PRSC operations the Bank sought to support GRZ efforts to undertake the
critical policy and institutional reforms for the successful implementation of the NDPs.
The PRSC series was designed to support Government policies in relation to: the
preservation of macroeconomic stability; improvement of public sector performance; and
broad-based growth by improving efficiency in the energy sector and enhancement of the
business environment.

While there was significant progress in preserving macroeconomic stability, improving
efficiency in the energy sector and enhancement of the business environment, there was
slow progress under improving public sector performance. The slow progress under
pension reforms could be attributed to the constitution making process since some of the
areas to be reformed were governed by an article of the constitution. With regard to
procurement reforms delays in setting up the governance structures (ZPPA Board)
contributed to their slow progress. Although some progress was made in relation to
Public Financial Management (PFM), some areas notably budget execution are still a
challenge.

     2. Assessment of the Outcomes

2.1 Preserving macroeconomic stability




10
 The first MoU was signed in mid-2005 and then revised in June 2008 to include new
CPs. The latest version was signed in November 2011.


                                           28
Zambia has preserved macroeconomic stability and the economy is on a strong growth
path, projected to grow at over 7 percent in the medium term. Inflation has been stable in
single digits. The fiscal targets have largely been met. Towards this end, Zambia
implemented broad reforms aimed at preserving macroeconomic stability. The PRSC
series supported reforms towards elimination of Public Sector Pension Fund (PSPF)
employer contribution arrears and a reduction in domestic arrears. There has been
significant progress in eliminating PSPF employer contribution arrears as an automatic
remittance system from the payroll account was put in place. However, domestic arrears
have persisted reflecting a weakness in the commitment control system. Nevertheless it is
worth recognizing that the PRSC focus areas were part of a broader GRZ macroeconomic
reform program that was supported by among others the IMF and other CPs.

2.2 Improving public sector performance
GRZ is committed to improving public sector performance through its PSM programme.
The programme sets out to improve accountability for service delivery, motivation and
retention of public service workers. The PSM programme also included PFM reforms
under the PEMFA programme that are intended to enhance accountability and efficient
utilization of public resources. The PRSC series supported the Government program
towards public pay policy and development and implementation of service delivery
charters. In PFM, implementation of IFMIS was also supported among others. While
Government has progressed on developing a comprehensive public pay policy, adopted
and instituted eight Service Delivery Charters (SDCs) and 28 Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMIS) sites are operational in 2012, the impact of these reforms is
yet to be determined. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that these are ongoing reforms with
a long term impact on improved public service delivery.

2.3 Improving Energy sector performance
Government has instituted several reforms that have improved the financial position of
the energy sector. In 2009, Zesco applied to the electricity regulatory board (ERB) to
progressively increase tariffs to cost-reflective levels. Tariffs were adjusted by an average
of 87 percent over 2009-2011. A first adjustment of 27 percent was implemented in
January 2009, followed by a 35 percent average tariff increase in August 2009. In August
2010, an increase of 25.6 percent was implemented, helping to bring Zesco’s tariff close
to cost reflective levels. Concerning efficiency of Zesco, since 2008, the energy regulator
has used the performance-evaluation framework of KPIs to monitor operational
performance and to enforce penalties should Zesco underperform. The company is also
progressing on its plan to expand the installation of pre-paid electricity meters across the
country as supported by PRSC. Based on these tariff adjustments and other fiscal
measures, Zesco has improved its financial performance and put the company on the path
to financial sustainability.

2.4 Improving business environment
Since 2008, Zambia has improved the business environment under the private sector
development reform program (PSDRP). Reforms have been carried out under: starting a
business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, paying taxes and
enforcing contracts among others. These reforms led to Zambia’s Doing Business rank

                                             29
improving from 116 in 2008 to 76 in 2011, with the country being recognized among the
10 top reformers globally. Notwithstanding this achievement, Government remains
committed to further improving the business environment in order to address the
stagnation in Zambia’s ranking in the recent cost of doing business (2012 and 2013).

   3. Evaluation of the Borrower’s Own Performance

With regard to preserving macroeconomic stability, improving efficiency in the energy
sector and enhancement of the business environment, Government’s performance was
impressive. But, challenges still remain with regard to the implementation of Public
Sector Management reforms as already discussed. Judging by the trend in scores since
2006, Government performance has been declining indicating that there are still areas in
which implementation capacity has to be strengthened.

   4. Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank

The Bank aligned the PRSC with the PAF (2008-11). However, the Bank maintained the
same indicators even after revision of PAF (2011-13). This consequently misaligned the
PRSC III with the PAF (2011-13) and therefore led to a situation where the Bank
performed its own assessment of Government performance outside the PRBS framework
in 2012.

   5. Proposed arrangements for future operations

Budget support remains Government’s preferred aid modality as articulated. However,
there is a decline in the volume of budget support contributions. Government proposes
that the Bank remains committed to Budget support. And in this regard Government is
ready to dialogue around issues and challenges surrounding the PRBS process.

   6. Comments on Bank’s ICR

In general, Government agrees with the assessment of the Bank. It is a fair reflection of
how Government has been performing in regard to implementation of reforms. The
Bank’s ICR is consistent with Government’s own findings as already discussed. In
relation to the Bank’s assessment on the policy relevancy of the PAF, Government
believes that there is room for improvement particularly in relation to indicator selection,
alignment with NDPs and broader Government priorities.
