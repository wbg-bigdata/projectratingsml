Program Development     The program is aligned with the CAS 2008-2011 and CAS
Objective(s) and        Progress Report 2008-2012, which identify PRSCs as the primary
Contribution to CAS     vehicle to support the Bank’s macroeconomic and public
                        expenditure management program. The CAS provides a resource
                        envelope of 15-20 percent of the IDA country allocation for
                        budget support.

                        The objectives of the PRSCs will contribute to:
                         Preserving macroeconomic stability and improving public
                           sector performance; and
                         Supporting broad-based growth by improving efficiency in the
                           energy sector and improving business environment.
                        In pursuit of these objectives the program supports the
                        achievement of a number of outcome indicators in macroeconomic
                        management, public sector reform, public finance management,
                        energy policy, and private sector development.

Risks and Risk   Political Risks
Mitigation
                 1.     There are two main sources of Zambia’s political risks:
                 (i) challenges associated with the ushering in of a new
                 government; and (ii) high public expectations arising from
                 election-time promises. During the first six months of the PF
                 government, these risks have materialized in the form of (a)
                 weakly coordinated policy messages and actions coming from
                 within the government, and (b) frequent administrative changes
                 that are still continuing, or anticipated, after six months in office.
                 Continuous administrative changes have affected the functioning
                 of government machinery.
                 2.     The overall risk of reversing the institutional reforms
                 identified and monitored by the PRSC program is low, even
                 though the pace of reforms, and hence of the achievement of
                 development objectives, cannot remain unaffected by the political
                 risks described above. The risk of reversal of institutional reforms
                 is particularly low since they have been going on for a few years
                 now and are mature. At the same time, the disruption caused by
                 the changes in senior staff and continued re-alignment of
                 ministries, could slow down the pace of reforms.
                 3.      On macroeconomic policies, the government has
                 adopted the policy framework and objectives inherited from
                 the previous government but there are downside risks. The
                 recent IMF Article IV mission confirmed that macroeconomic
                 framework remains sound and the near-term outlook remains
                 positive. Yet there are downside risks from global economic
                 uncertainty and domestic policies. The capacity of the new
                 government to manage the impact of a large external shock, such
                 as a steep fall in copper prices, is not known and would be tested.
                 The PF government’s actions such as the reversal of Zamtel
                 privatization and the continued emphasis on investigating actions
                 of the previous government are straining investor sentiment and
                 raising concerns about the government’s commitment to
                 privatization.
                 4.      To manage political risks, IDA, working in close
                 collaboration with other cooperating partners, including the IMF
                 will strive both at the national and sector level in favor of
                 continuing the reform program. There is also a frank and open
                 dialogue being conducted with the political leadership at the
                 highest level aimed at highlighting the importance of continued
                 reform momentum. IDA has also been working actively with the
                 civil society to create demand for good governance as described
                 below.




                                      viii
Institutional Risks
5.     Governance Issues. In Zambia, over the years there had
been a steady decline in the quality of governance, as institutions
charged with oversight became weaker, the public service
became politicized with over-centralized decision making and
public administration systems and controls became weaker. In
order to address this, successive governments have been
implementing reforms addressing the efficiency and
accountability of the public sector, and tackle corruption, but with
limited success. There are now new opportunities to work with
the new government as it has placed improving governance
institutions and anti corruption at the core of its programs.
6.     The fraudulent activities in the health and roads sectors
were a demonstration of the erosion of administration
systems and controls. The Bank is working in the roads sector,
at government’s request, to assist them develop and implement an
integrity plan to address governance weaknesses identified by
various reviews and assessments.          In the health sector
Government has engaged an independent fiduciary review agent
who is addressing fiduciary concerns and building capacity in the
sector. The Bank will continue working with Government on
improving public financial management and building institutions
under the public service management program. The Bank has
also instituted a multi sectoral governance team that works with
task teams in addressing governance challenges at project level.
7.     In Zambia, IDA has started, as a pilot approach,
activities to improve accountability of the Government vis-à-
vis citizens by supporting demand for good governance. These
activities are essentially aimed at enhancing the capability of
citizens to hold the state and service providers accountable and
make them responsive to the needs of the citizenry. It is expected
that such activities could help improve the efficiency of
government interventions, for example by better targeting, and
improve effectiveness of institutions through feedback
mechanisms and monitoring. These improvements would
ultimately lead to better development outcomes. Examples of
activities that support demand for good governance include
support to issue-based coalitions, trainings on extractives and
procurement, sensitizations on freedom of information, training
workshops on investigative journalism, and interactive radio
programs that improve information dissemination amongst rural
constituents on key policy issues.
8.    Implementation Capacity. The prior actions identified in
PRSC-3 have been met. Therefore implementation capacity is
likely to be a minor issue as far as the identified actions
themselves are concerned. At the same time broader


                      ix
               implementation capacity could be an issue for sustainability of
               the broader reform program in terms of follow-up actions needed
               to take supported actions to a logical end. The government has
               had a weak track record in policy implementation, specifically in
               terms of policies linked to public sector reform, the civil service
               compensation structure, and budget execution in public finance
               management. This risk will be mitigated to a large extent by the
               activities of ongoing lending and TA programs in public sector
               and energy sector. The Bank and other cooperating partners are
               also supporting government capacity building in public sector
               management and public expenditure management, and in the
               reform of financial accountability protocols. The PEMFA
               program is specifically designed to assist the authorities in
               improving institutional capacity and the management of public
               finances, and has now been extended by IDA.                 Several
               cooperating partners are also implementing reform programs
               involving oversight institutions such as the Office of the Auditor
               General and the Parliament. Given the continuing progress in
               institutional strengthening being made under these programs, the
               risk posed by limited implementation capacity should not present
               a constraint on the execution of the PRSC-3 program.
               External shocks
               9.     Despite significant improvements in Zambia’s fiscal
               stance, the lasting effects of the global financial crisis and the
               economy’s continued reliance on a single primary-commodity
               export could threaten Zambia’s growth rate if copper prices were
               to fall significantly. Such a situation may come to pass if the
               continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe were to slide into a
               financial crisis and a large and long-drawn economic downturn. It
               is not clear that there will be consensus on how to respond to
               such a circumstance and, more importantly, that the political
               resolve by the government to tackle difficult issues involved will
               be present. However, the adequate size of the country’s
               international reserves combined with continued flexible exchange
               rate policy should allow absorption of the economic shock that
               such an event would trigger. The Bank and other donors are
               helping the government to diversify the national economy
               through program support and policy dialogue on structural
               reforms. This effort has thus far been successful, as evidenced by
               an increase in Zambia’s exports of non-mineral products.

                             I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      This Program Document describes the proposal for a Third Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-3 or the Credit) to the Republic of Zambia in the
amount of SDR 19.3 million (US$30 million equivalent). The proposed PRSC-3 is the
last in a programmatic series of annual poverty reduction support credits to the country.
PRSC-1 (US$20 million equivalent) was approved in March 2010 and PRSC-2 (US$30
million equivalent) in February 2011.

2.      The PRSC credits provide support to a policy and institutional reform
program emanating from government’s development strategy articulated in the Fifth
National Development Plan (FNDP) for the period 2006-2010 and other strategic
documents and reform programs prepared by the government. The successor to the FNDP
- the Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP) for the period 2011-2015 – was prepared
by the outgoing government and adopted in February 2011. As described later in this
document, the PRSC program is in good alignment with SNDP as well. Policy
preferences of the new Patriotic Front (PF) government that assumed office in September
2011 display commitment to the reform activities monitored by the PRSC series. This
was evidenced in the team’s policy discussions with the government and progress being
made on the activities.

3.       This Credit maintains the development objectives laid down by the PRSC
series. The PRSC series identifies and monitors, jointly with the government, policy and
institutional actions that are seen as making significant contribution to the achievement of
two broad development objectives: (i) Preserving macroeconomic stability and improving
public sector performance; and (ii) Supporting broad-based growth by improving
efficiency in the energy sector and improving business environment.

4.      The PRSCs’ development objectives are mapped to the Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for the period 2008-2011 and the CAS
Progress Report for the period 2008-2012. The CAS identified budget support as the
primary instrument towards implementing Bank’s macroeconomic program over the
period 2008-11. It provided a resource envelope of 15-20 percent of the IDA country
allocation for budget support. The objectives of the Bank’s macroeconomic program
identified in the CAS are to help Zambia in better management of its financial resources,
in improving accountability and transparency in the use of financial resources, and in
implementing its reform programs to improve public sector efficiency and business
environment. The PRSC process also provides a forum for broader policy dialogue with
the government and other major stakeholders.

5.     The proposed PRSC-3 draws upon a collaborative and harmonized process
for providing budget support to the GRZ by donors in line with the 2005 Paris
Declaration. Zambia’s cooperating partners (CP) providing budget support have formed
the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) group1, which is led by the government
1
The PRBS group currently comprises the European Union, UK (DFID), Germany, Norway, Finland, the
World Bank, and the African Development Bank.

and dedicated to improving the quality and effectiveness of direct budget support. The
PRBS group has agreed on a common review process, the Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF), which is a multi-year matrix of policy reforms supported by the PRBS
group. The PRSC-3 prior actions are drawn from the PAFs for the periods 2009-2011
and 2011-13. The latter one was approved by the government and participating donors in
November 2011.

                          II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                  A. ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

6.      Zambia has enjoyed a decade of rapid economic expansion, following a long
period of low growth and declining per capita income. A combination of prudent
macroeconomic management, market liberalization and privatization efforts, and
investments in the copper industry and related infrastructure, and steep increase in copper
prices helped to achieve annual average economic growth of about 5.4 percent during the
decade 2000-10. The economy had stagnated in the 1980s and 1990s due to a highly
inefficient state control over the economy in general and the mining sector in particular.
The economy began to grow again after 1996, albeit slowly, as a result of a relatively
stable external environment and improved, market-oriented policies.2 Economic growth
accelerated in the 2000s following the privatization of the mining industry and a return to
fiscal discipline.

7.      The authorities’ adherence to sound macroeconomic policies, and provision
of debt relief by official creditors, has laid the foundation for stable macroeconomic
environment. The government has consolidated macroeconomic stability under two IMF
programs and successfully navigated the shocks connected with the global economic and
financial crises. Annual inflation declined from about 30 percent in 2000 to 7.9 percent in
2010 and has remained in single digits since 2006, except in 2008. The completion of the
HIPC and MDRI initiatives provided Zambia with about US$6.5 billion in debt relief,
which provided the much-needed fiscal space by reducing debt service obligations. In
addition, debt relief improved Zambia’s external position and enabled building up of
foreign-exchange reserves to a comfortable level. This, in turn, has strengthened the
country’s ability to manage volatility in its exchange rate and bolstered the financial
system. Average annual T-bill rates have declined from 31.4 percent in 2000 to low
double digits in 2011. This enduring stability has supported robust growth, a marked
turnaround from only a decade ago.

8.     Zambia continues to boast rich endowments of natural resources both within
and beyond the mining sector but agriculture potential remains underdeveloped.
Zambia has large mineral and agricultural resources, but copper mining and processing
remains the mainstay of the economy and the engine of GDP growth and foreign
exchange earnings. The mining sector leads GDP growth, and mineral products

                                                2
(especially copper and cobalt) are the country’s main export (at close to 80 percent,
combined). Agriculture, the major economic activity of the Zambian people and the
agricultural sector remains largely underdeveloped, despite its potential to reach much
broader segments of the population, and in particular the rural poor.

9.      The sources and benefits of growth are narrowly distributed. Capital-
intensive industrial (mining and construction) and service sectors have accounted for bulk
of the growth in recent years. The mining industry is concentrated in the cities of the
populous but relatively isolated Copperbelt region. The labor-intensive rural economy, on
the other hand, has been growing slowly. Manufacturing growth has also been sluggish,
contributing 0.3-0.4 percentage points to annual growth in the past five years. As a result,
economic growth has not been accompanied with enough new jobs and increased
incomes necessary for making a dent in the high poverty rates, particularly in rural areas.

10.     High growth in gross domestic production has not resulted in commensurate
increase in net national income which is a more relevant measure of economic
performance for a resource-centered economy like Zambia that has a significant foreign
ownership of assets in the extractive sector.3 In 2011, while mining taxes amounted to a
little more than 2 percent of GDP, dividend outflows are estimated at about 15 percent of
GDP. Sustainable and more inclusive growth in Zambia will depend on the government’s
ability to capture a fair share of economic rents from the mining sector.4 The new
administration is acutely aware of this issue and the 2012 budget attempted to address it
partly by doubling the royalty rates on copper and other base metals to 6 percent.

11.     Therefore, the past decade of economic growth has led to only a moderate
reduction in poverty, even though during this decade, gross national income per capita
reached a level that puts Zambia at the lower end of middle income country status.
According to the 2010 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS), the national
poverty rate is at about 60 percent, not much different from the 62.8 percent in 2006.
Forty two percent of population is estimated to live in extreme poverty, with insufficient
consumption to meet daily minimum food requirements. Poverty rates are much higher in
rural areas than urban. With a majority of population dependent on subsistence
agriculture, rural poverty remains at 78 percent, again not much different from 80 percent
in 2006. The concentration of growth and relative enrichment of the urban population has
accentuated the income inequality between the urban and rural economies. But inequality
has been growing within provinces. Zambia’s Gini coefficient is now around 0.54, much
higher than 0.47 in 1996.

12.    Along with the moderate reduction in overall poverty, social indicators have
improved at an uneven pace in the last decade. There have been continued
advancements in education indicators, including rising enrollment rates at the primary
and secondary levels, with more marginal improvement in the youth literacy rate (see
Table 1), but challenges remain, including overcrowded classrooms and limited access to

education in rural areas. There have also been some improvements in health outcomes,
including a reduction of the under-5 mortality rate and a decline in maternal mortality
rates, but Zambia is still not likely to meet the 2015 Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) for the health sector. The prevalence of HIV has remained at about 15 percent
for the 15-49 year-old cohort.

13.     The peaceful transfer of power following elections in September 2011 has
strengthened Zambia’s democratic credentials. Zambia was a multi-party democracy
for the first eight years of independence in 1964, but became a one-party state in 1973.
The one-party government followed socialist principles of economic management, and
many private firms were nationalized during its rule. In 1991, multi-party democratic
governance was restored following the victory of reinstated opposition parties in the
general elections. Since then, the country has conducted five elections that led to three
changes in government, all of which were peaceful.

14.     The PF government has identified growth that would reduce poverty and
create jobs as its main priority. It recognizes that mining sector-led growth has failed to
reach a large number of the poor and looks upon agriculture sector as an important source
of pro-poor growth. Education development and health services are also priority areas
for the PF government given their importance to poverty reduction and creating jobs. The
PF government has strongly signaled continued attention to macroeconomic stability,
public service reforms, and business environment reforms, the areas of focus of this
Credit, as enablers of poverty-reducing and jobs-creating growth.

15.     The level of aid to Zambia has sharply declined in the past three years and is
now not as prominent as in many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010,
grants, including both budget support and project grants, amounted to about 8 percent of
total government expenditure (1.8 percent of GDP), compared to 22 percent in 2004 and
a peak of 27 percent in 2002. The decline in aid has narrowed much of the fiscal space
created as a result of debt relief. It has also highlighted the importance of domestic
resource mobilization and efficiency in the use of resources for Zambia if the country
wants to scale up infrastructure investment rapidly.



                                                     4
16.     Domestic resource mobilization has been improving slowly but remains low.
Zambia’s tax revenue collections have hovered in the vicinity of 17 percent of GDP for
almost the whole of past decade. Mining has until very recently generated about 2 percent
of GDP making Zambia an outlier for mining revenue collections. However, in 2011
mining revenues saw an upward jump on account of better mining tax administration and
collection of formerly accumulated arrears, enabling the government to collect about 19.3
percent of GDP in total revenues.


       B. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES

Recent Performance

17.    Zambia’s economy continued growing strongly in the past two years. Real
GDP is estimated to have grown by 6.6 percent in 2011 following on 7.6 percent growth
in 2010 (Table 2). Growth has been led by increases in mining output - boosted by
investments in the mining sector that came online in early 2009, an expansion in
construction activities, and continued recovery of tourism after the 2008 decline, and a
spike in agricultural production, including successive bumper harvests of maize, which
more than doubled its output from three years ago.

18.     Services, construction, and mining remained the big contributors to growth
in 2011 and 2010. Services and construction together have on average contributed more
than 73 percent to the growth rate between 2008 and 2011 with mining and quarrying
adding about 14 percent. Contribution of agriculture and manufacturing remain relatively
small, making overall growth lop-sided. Copper prices are the main drivers of mining
contribution to GDP growth. For instance, while in 2008 and 2009, copper production
volumes grew by17 and 15 percent respectively compared to 5 percent growth in 2007,
falling prices in 2008 (2 percent) and 2009 (26 percent) led to declining sector
contribution to GDP from 0.8 percent in 2007 to 0.4 and 0.2 percent in 2008 and 2009
respectively. Conversely, increasing prices in 2010 (46 percent) and 2011 (17 percent)
led to increasing contribution of the sector to GDP recovering from 0.2 percent in 2009 to
1.6 and 1.4 percent in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

19.     Inflation stayed in single digits but above target in 2011 and 2010. Annual
inflation was 7.2 percent in December 2011 against end-year target of 7 percent and was
7.9 percent at the end of December 2010. The deceleration of inflation is the result of a
rapid decrease in prices for most food items due to the bumper maize harvests (in 2011
and 2010) mentioned earlier and monetary tightening during 2010. Food price-inflation
dropped to just 4.4 percent in 2010, from 8 percent in 2009 and just above 20 percent in
2008. Non-food price inflation remained in low double digits in 2011 and 2010.

20.     Fiscal performance in 2011 and 2010 has been satisfactory with overall
deficits and net domestic financing close to programmed levels. In 2011, tax revenues
are estimated to have outperformed target, reaching about 19.3 percent of GDP against a
programmed 18.4 percent with mining taxes, including payment of outstanding arrears,



                                                  6
contributing a significant share to the increase. However, there were large pressures on
expenditures arising from higher maize purchases, fertilizer support, and elections-related
expenses. Therefore, 2011 is estimated to have ended with an overall deficit (including
grants) of about 3.5 percent compared to a projected 2.9 percent of GDP. In 2010,
revenues (excluding grants) were an estimated 17.9 percent against a targeted 17.8
percent of GDP; overall deficit (including grants) was 3.1 percent of GDP against a
programmed 3.3 percent. However, net domestic financing exceeded the target of 2.6
percent by a small margin.

21.     The external position continued to remain strong in 2011 and 2010, with
gross international reserves worth three months of potential imports. The current
account surplus in 2011 is estimated to have declined by 79 percent over 2010 (from
US$1,145 million to US$237million) mostly on account of a decline in the trade surplus,
widening services deficit and decline in current transfers. Gross international reserves at
end-December 2011 stood at a comfortable US$2.2 billion, sufficient to finance three
months of potential imports. Reserve accumulation has been helped by the special
allocation of SDRs and augmentation of access under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF),
which accrued US$714 million to Zambia during 2008-2009.

22.     Financial sector conditions continued to improve in 2011. Private sector credit
continued to grow in 2011 after recovering to pre- global financial crisis levels in 2010
(credit to the private sector contracted by 6 percent in 2009). In 2010 credit to private
sector grew by about 12 percent in real terms. Asset quality also improved due to
reduction in gross non-performing loans (NPL) during 2011. NPLs had started to decline
towards the end of 2010. In the wake of the global recession in early 2009 Zambia’s
financial sector faced a sudden spike in NPL, especially to the agricultural sector and
private households. The banking system responded by reducing lending to the private
sector and redirected funds to relatively low-risk investment in government securities.

Government Policies
23.    The 2012 budget prepared by the new government states that
macroeconomic policy will be geared towards maintaining a stable macroeconomic
environment conducive to investment, inclusive growth and employment creation.
The following objectives are explicitly stated:

           a) Achieve real GDP growth of above 7 percent.
           b) Attain end-year inflation of no more than 7 percent
           c) Limit overall fiscal deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP and domestic borrowing
              to 1.3 percent of GDP, and
           d) Maintain gross international reserves of at least four months of import
              cover.
All of the above four objectives are appropriate and attainable if macroeconomic and
sector policies followed in the recent past are continued and refined further.

24.   The 2012 budget states that the government’s fiscal policy in 2012 will be
aimed at increasing domestic and external resource mobilization. As discussed


                                            7
above, domestic revenue collection has grown each year in the past three years; 2012
budget aims at collecting 19 percent of GDP, almost the same as the 19.3 percent in 2011
(Table 3). For 2012, the government has made two important changes to the tax structure.
One, PAYE has been restructured by raising the threshold of exemption and moving
lower limit of all income bands up. And two, the rate of royalty on copper and other base
metals has been increased from 3 percent to 6 percent. Overall, tax measures are expected
to be revenue neutral but volatility and vulnerability to external shocks will go up due to
greater dependence on mineral royalty. External borrowing will go up from 1.6 percent to
4.3 percent of GDP with a planned international bond worth $500 million.

25.     The stance of macroeconomic policies in 2012 is expected to be expansionary.
Expenditures are planned to go up significantly by 2.4 percent GDP to support growth.
Assuming similar levels of grants as in 2011, overall deficit including grants is planned at
5.6 percent of GDP, higher than 2.9 percent in 2011. A sharp increase in expenditures
while reducing tax burden on residents, combined with the recent monetary policy
measures aimed at reducing lending rates, could put upward pressure on prices. The 2012
budget commits monetary policy to maintaining single-digit inflation. Towards that
objective the Bank of Zambia will continue to use market-based instruments to limit
money supply growth. It has also adopted a policy rate in a move towards an interest rate-
based framework. The government will have to watch inflation and stand ready to tighten
policy if inflation starts moving away from the targeted path.

26.    The flexible exchange rate regime has worked well for Zambia in the past by
allowing the economy to absorb external shocks. For example, in 2008 exchange rate
appreciation partially offset the increase in food and fuel prices. The 2012 budget
commits the government to keeping the exchange rate determination market-based, with
Bank of Zambia stepping in as needed to smoothen volatility.




                                                8
27.    The 2012 budget proposes significant restructuring of government
expenditure to markedly enhance pro-poor orientation of government’s activities by
scaling up budget allocations to agriculture, education, health, and infrastructure.
Several large changes are proposed to government expenditures. The most significant are:

a) 38 percent increase in agriculture core program budget. The increase will support,
   among others, irrigation infrastructure, livestock development and enhanced
   extension services. The government will redesign the FISP to diversify support to
   crops other than maize.

b) 27 percent increase in education sector’s budget. The budget speech highlights
   construction of additional classroom blocks, upgrading Chalimbana and Palabana
   colleges into universities, new recruitment of 5000 teachers, and scaling up youth
   skill development programs through expanding Technical Training Institutes
   infrastructure.

c) 45 percent increase in allocation to the health function. The speech highlights
   scaling up provision of essential drugs, procurement of equipment and other medical
   supplies, net recruitment of 2500 front line medical personnel, and expansion of
   health infrastructure. User fees for primary care services will be abolished.

d) Large increases in investments in roads and energy sectors.

28.      There are fiscal risks to the 2012 budget execution. The composition of
revenues now has a greater share of mining revenues that are likely to be more volatile
and susceptible to external price shock. The financing from the international bond is
linked to attendant uncertainties in the world capital markets. And above all contingent
liabilities have been building up, particularly in the Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF).
The PSPF is insolvent currently and arrears to retirees are building up.

29.     The relatively high share of wage bill in total expenditures (33% in 2011)
remains a concern over the medium term. On average nominal wages for public
employees have been increasing at a faster rate than inflation. The government has
undertaken a review of its compensation structure, and a new wage and salary policy is
expected to be implemented in 2012. However, the new wage and salary policy may not
necessarily reduce the level of wage bill. The focus should instead shift to improving the
quality of government services.

30.    The new government has indicated that it will review the role of Food
Reserve Agency. Transfers to FRA were 1.6 percent of GDP in 2010 and equally large in
2011(1.8 percent of GDP). The objective of the review will be to rationalize FRA’s
functions including its role in maintaining strategic reserves of food crops. The 2012
budget provides for a much reduced allocation of 0.3 percent of GDP to FRA.

31.    Zambian government has also recognized a need to develop social protection
measures to address the issues of extreme poverty and vulnerability. In 2010 it
adopted a social protection policy document, and is embarking on development of a



                                            9
social protection program in 2012. Meanwhile the coverage of existing social safety net
programs is being scaled up.

32.     Following years of structural deficits, the ZESCO Limited (ZESCO)
increased tariffs in 2010-11 to cost-reflective levels to attract private sector
participation in the energy market. ZESCO’s current revenue is sufficient to cover its
operating costs, and the transition to cost-reflective tariffs will enable both the state utility
and private investors to turn a profit in new investments. ZESCO’s weaning off the fiscal
accounts is a major policy achievement and substantially reduces the potential financial
risks posed by the accumulation of contingent liabilities in public enterprises.


                    C. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

33.     Overall, Zambia’s medium-term economic outlook remains steady but
vulnerable to downside risks from a global economic slowdown and domestic
policies. Real GDP growth is projected at about 7.7 percent in 2012, based on the
expectation of continued growth in the mining, construction, and tourism sectors, as well
as renewed expansion in the manufacturing, transportation, and communications
industries (Table 4). These projections however face serious downside risks from the
potential global economic downturn triggered by the sovereign debt crisis in the
Eurozone countries and domestic policies.

34.     The direct economic impact of the Eurozone crisis on Zambia has so far been
minimal. However, Zambia will not remain unaffected should the financial turmoil
in Europe spread to other countries and result in a global economic downturn.
Eurozone is not a major trading partner of Zambia and most of the tourism and
remittance inflows do not originate from the crisis-hit countries. But Zambia’s high
dependence on the copper sector means that an unexpectedly large drop in copper prices
resulting from slowdown in emerging economies could weaken the country’s prospects
for growth and affect its fiscal and external balances severely. In addition, the tourism
sector is especially susceptible to adverse changes in the external environment. The
turmoil in the international capital markets could also push up the costs of the proposed
borrowing from international markets.

35.    A steep decline in copper prices would impact the economy in several ways. It
would directly slowdown growth in GDP, export revenues, fiscal revenues, and
investment flows to mining. In 2009, a decline of about 26 percent in copper prices was
accompanied by a sharp decline in collection of mining and other taxes (about 1.3 percent
of GDP). There was a large depreciation of Kwacha in the first half of 2009, which would
be expected again in the event of a decline in copper prices. The Zambian economy could
grow less by about 0.6-1.4 percentage points against the 2012 projected growth in the
event of a shock similar in size to the 2008-09.

36.     The situation in 2012 is materially different from 2008-09 and the
government should not be complacent. Foremost, the new government’s capacity for
macroeconomic management in the face of a large external shock is untested. Then, the
fiscal position is not as strong as it was in 2008-09; fiscal risks are more pronounced and
the budget is more reliant on domestic resources. And finally, several large mines were
coming into production in 2008-09, which may not be the case in 2012.

37.     The macroeconomic framework will be put to test should the risks
materialize but can withstand shocks with some adjustment. In the case of risks
materializing, Zambia will have some maneuverability on the monetary side. The
comfortable foreign reserve position should allow absorption of shocks to the overall
balance of payments to some extent, beyond which, the flexible exchange rate regime
should keep external balance from swinging too far. However, unlike the 2008-09 crises
the government does not have a fiscal cushion anymore and adjustment could be needed.
It is expected that the government would be willing to cut spending pro-cyclically, if
needed. Notably, despite the public rhetoric at the time of elections, the new government
has decided to continue with macroeconomic objectives and sound policies that it
inherited.

38.     External debt relief through the HIPC program and the Multilateral Debt
Relieve Initiative (MDRI) have reduced Zambia’s debt burden significantly. In 2005,
when Zambia reached the Completion Point of the HIPC program, its total debt was
reduced by about 55 percent. In December of the same year, under the MDRI, Zambia
received 100 percent relief on all debt owed to the World Bank and the IMF before 2005.
These debt-relief measures were accompanied by the cancellation of debts with several
bilateral creditors. Consequently, its external debt-to-GDP ratio fell from about


                                            11
86 percent in 2005 to around 9 percent in 2006. Since then, the country has adopted a
conservative debt policy, borrowing mostly on concessional terms. The debt ratio
increased marginally to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2010, and most of this increase was in
public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt.

39.     The Low Income Countries Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA)
conducted in November 2010 suggests that Zambia’s overall public sector debt
dynamics are sustainable in light of the current size and evolution of the domestic debt
stock. The analysis concluded that Zambia faces a low risk of external debt distress as all
debt indicators stay below the indicative policy thresholds throughout the projection
period (2010-2030). The stock of external debt is expected to grow from 12 to17 percent
of GDP through 2016 and to decline thereafter. The share of total public-sector debt
(including domestically issued debt) is also projected to remain manageable. The total
public debt, which was equal to 24.6 percent of GDP in 2010, is expected to reach a peak
of 28.7 percent of GDP in 2013, under the baseline scenario, and to decrease to about
20 percent by 2020.

40.    The proposed international borrowing of US$500 million in 2012 is unlikely
to worsen Zambia’s debt outlook but needs careful debt management. The baseline
scenario for the November 2010 DSA assumed new public external borrowing in the
order of US$3.3 billion during 2010-2016 (equivalent to US$470 million per year) of
which US$ 1.8 billion was assumed to be on non-concessional terms. Accordingly, the
planned international bond is not seen as having a material effect on debt dynamics.
However, the country will need to manage debt carefully in face of the rise in non-
concessional borrowing. The government agrees that sound macroeconomic policies,
including a prudent fiscal position, and strong debt management and project appraisal
capacity are needed to maintain debt-sustainability, while allowing for non-concessional
borrowing for growth-critical infrastructure investment.

41.     The planned international bond will also attract the implementation of IDA’s
non-concessional borrowing policy (NCBP). In the FY12 assessment by IDA, Zambia
has been assessed as a country with low debt vulnerability and low macroeconomic and
public financial management capacity. In line with this assessment, the country team has
initiated discussions with the authorities towards setting annual non-zero non
concessional debt limits (i.e. annual authorized amount of non-concessional borrowing).
In case Zambia opts for an IMF program, the discussion on setting a non-zero limit will
be integrated in program discussions with the IMF.

42.     Overall, Zambia’s medium-term macroeconomic framework provides an
adequate basis for the proposed operation. The Bank’s view is based on the steady
macroeconomic performance during the past five years, economic outcomes during 2011,
economic outlook, and the policy stance of the new government thus far. A continuation
of prudent fiscal policies, particularly in the event of external shocks, appropriate levels
of capital expenditure, and continued donor support is assumed.

           III. THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

                          A. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

43.     The government’s long-term development objectives are articulated
in the National Vision 2030 (the Vision). This vision projects Zambia attaining a
prosperous middle-income country status by the year 2030, through developing
infrastructure and human resources to stimulate creation of wealth and jobs. The
development strategy to achieve the Vision objectives has been elaborated in a
series of national development plans (collectively referred to as NDPs in this
document).

                       Box 1: Zambia’s National Development Plans
 The Transitional National Development Plan, covering the period 2002-2005, was
 launched in May 2002. It focused on promoting sectors that would create employment and
 income opportunities for the poor. The measures emphasized included diversifying both
 output and exports, improving economic and political governance, bolstering macroeconomic
 stability, enhancing social services delivery, and supporting private investment.
 The Fifth National Development Plan covering the period 2006-2010 (FNDP) was
 launched in December 2006. FNDP largely built on the previous Plan, through a highly
 participatory process, by prioritizing wealth creation through citizenry participation and
 technological advancement as the central element in poverty alleviation. It emphasized
 creating an environment that encourages labor-intensive private sector-led economic growth
 through macroeconomic stability, public sector accountability, improved social services to
 the poor, and investments in infrastructure and the social sectors.
 The Sixth National Development Plan covering the period 2011-2015 (SNDP-also
 referred to as ‘the Plan’ henceforth) was launched in February 2011. SNDP aims to
 build upon the successes, and address the challenges identified, during the FNDP period. The
 strategic focus of SNDP is to address the constraints of infrastructure and human
 development. It lays emphasis on achieving pro-poor growth.

44.     The SNDP was prepared through a highly consultative process and
discussions with local leaders were held in all of Zambia’s 72 districts. Several
stakeholder groups such as the Sector Advisory Groups (SAGs), Cooperating
Partners, Provincial Development Coordinating Committees (PDCCs) and District
Development Coordinating Committees (DDCCs) participated in consultations
and in reviewing the document.

45.     SNDP identifies agriculture, livestock, fisheries, mining, tourism, and
manufacturing as the leading growth areas. It lists the following overarching
objectives:
   a) To accelerate infrastructure development, economic growth and
      diversification;
   b) To promote rural investment and accelerate poverty reduction; and
   c) To enhance human development.



                                         13
46.    While NDPs provide a broad development strategy, more specific and
priority policies and institutional actions are elaborated in several other
programs and documents from time to time. These include Public Sector
Reform Program (PSRP), the Private Sector Development Reform Program
(PSDRP), the rolling Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), the annual
budget, and the PAFs agreed with PRBS donors. In the case of the new PF
government, pre-election party manifesto also provides indications of policy
preferences during its rule.

47.     In consultation with PRBS donors the government has developed a
PAF for the period 2011-13 which was signed in November 2011. The 2011-13
PAF (Annex 2) was developed at a time when a number of changes were taking
place within the Government including the re-constitution of some of the
ministries which are responsible for indicators in the PAF. For that reason,
indicators and targets for 2012 and 2013 are considered flexible. The 2011-13
PAF lists indicators in the areas of macroeconomic management, competitiveness,
PFM, anti-corruption, roads, health, education, water and sanitation, agriculture,
social protection, and environment. An attempt has been made to align the PAF as
much as possible with the SNDP so that its review can draw upon from
monitoring of the Plan.


   B. ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND STRUCTURAL REFORM PROGRAMS

Macroeconomic Objectives

48.      SNDP affirms continuation of policies to maintain macroeconomic
stability with emphasis on maintaining a business-friendly and growth-promoting
environment. It identifies sustaining single-digit inflation, enhancing domestic
revenue mobilization, maintaining a stable and competitive exchange rate,
reducing commercial bank lending rates, maintaining public debt sustainability,
and increasing decent and productive employment as key macroeconomic
objectives. The Plan expects that fiscal stance during the plan period would
remain expansionary but the level of government domestic borrowing will be
contained to an annual average rate of 1.5 percent of GDP and supplemented with
increased external borrowing, which will be used towards infrastructure
development. As described before, the 2012 Budget re-confirms the
macroeconomic objectives laid down in SNDP.

Public Service Reform Program (PSRP)

49.     PSRP targets making public service delivery more efficient and
effective, through strengthening institutional and human capacity. SNDP
proposes continuation of PSRP along three priority areas: (i) Public Financial
Management (PFM), which includes procurement, (ii) Public Service
Management (PSM); and (iii) Decentralization and Strengthening of Local
Government. Reforms during the Plan period will be focused on the creation of
more fiscal space, the improvement of public expenditure and financial
management, improvement of tax administration and the expansion of tax base,


                                       14
and enhancement of local government capacity in readiness for devolution. The
following paragraphs briefly describe the PFM and PSM programs; discussion on
the decentralization component is left out because it is not one of the priority
areas in the PRSC program.

PFM

50.    In the early 2000s Zambia embarked on a series of PFM and public
sector reforms supported by donors following re-engagement. In September
2003, the Government shared a program document on PFM reforms that they
wanted to embark on with support from donors. After several iterations, this
program emerged as the Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability program (PEMFA). PEMFA has been under implementation for
more than six years and since January, 2011, the Bank and selected donors have
been supporting the partially extended PEMFA program (up to December, 2012).

 Box 2: Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA) Program

 PEMFA reform program has been an ambitious program covering all aspects of the public
 financial management cycle namely, policy review, strategic planning, budget preparation,
 budget execution, accounting and reporting, audit and public scrutiny. The overall objective
 of the PEMFA program was to ‘continue with efforts to improve Government capacity to
 effectively and efficiently mobilize and utilize public resources (improve public expenditure
 management) and to strengthen overall financial accountability’.
 An independent evaluation of the PEMFA program carried out in August, 2010 reveals that
 the program had only modest influence on improving public expenditure management. Some
 of the achievements to date are: (a) the development of the ZAMMOD macroeconomic model
 in the MoFNP; (b) improvements in procurement legislation and procedures; (c) improved
 infrastructure and logistics for internal and external audits, parliamentary committees and
 Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants (ZICA); and (d) a significant amount of training
 across all components including IFMIS. The evaluation also noted that there is significant
 potential to achieve the project objectives if GRZ can complete the IFMIS exercise
 successfully and also embark upon a continuing PFM reform programme avoiding the
 mistakes of the past.
 After the evaluation, the government committed to reducing the scope of PEMFA to address
 the reforms as part of the extension of the program. The extended PEMFA program covers
 IFMIS, Internal Audit, Procurement and Revenue Administration. There has been
 considerable progress on the IFMIS component with 28 sites operational as of January, 2012.
 Progress in other components has been slow but moving in the right direction.

51.     The PEMFA Final Evaluation (August 2010) notes that there has been
continued progress in PFM reforms which would in turn improve PEFA
scores. Notably, the government changed the budget cycle in 2009, which the
2008 PEFA assessment identified as the biggest impediment to improved PFM in
Zambia. The Single Treasury Account has been introduced. External audit has
continued to improve as the OAG and PAC have strengthened, the former
supported bilaterally by Norway and the Netherlands, the latter through the
Parliamentary Reform Programme III. The next PEFA assessment is being
planned to be conducted in 2012 and a TOR has been drafted and shared with the
donors.


                                          15
52.     Following the completion of PEMFA in 2012, the government plans to
continue to improve the quality of PFM emphasizing on efficiency,
effectiveness, transparency and accountability of public funds. The 2012
budget commits that the Government will finalize and begin to implement a
revitalized PFM strategy and bring a Planning and Budgeting bill and an
amendment to the Public Finance Act to the parliament. SNDP lists the following
areas on which action will be taken during the Plan period:
       a)   Development of a new comprehensive PFM reform strategy
       b)   Rolling out of the Integrated Financial Management Information
            System
       c)   Improvements in the preparation and execution of the national budget
       d)   Enactment of a Planning and Budget Act and its regulations
       e)   Strengthening expenditure control, accounting, audit functions and
            reporting
       f)   Improving cash management through a Treasury Single Account
            system
       g)   Strengthening system of non-tax revenue collection.

53.     Key reforms, such as procurement and IFMIS remain incomplete and
the Government has been slow to embark on the process of developing a new
PFM strategy which has now been submitted to the cabinet and is pending
approval. Whilst there are some concerns over Government capacity to continue
reforms, the Government has continued to show commitment as evidenced by
inclusion of continued PFM focus under Structural Reforms in the SNDP and
specific mention of PFM reforms in the 2012 budget speech by the Minister of
Finance and National Planning.

PSM

54.     The PSM program focuses on (i) enhancing the management of, and
incentive systems faced by, civil servants in order to improve their
performance, and (ii) strengthening the administrative structures of
government ministries. This is a prerequisite for effectively implementing the
other two components of PSRP. The overarching policy goals are to improve
service delivery to citizens and to create an institutional environment appropriate
to reducing poverty effectively. The PSM includes four sub-components: (i)
rightsizing, (ii) pay reform, (iii) performance management, and (iv) payroll
management and establishment control. The goals of each sub-component are
elaborated below:

   a) Rightsizing. All government ministries and institutions have staff
      complements which are appropriate to their agreed mandates and are
      affordable in relation to their respective budget ceilings.
   b) Pay reform. Employee remuneration is related to job type and
      performance; the public service is able to attract and retain essential
      technical, professional and managerial staff; pay arrangements support and
      reinforce improved service delivery; and increases in pay levels are
      consistent with the resource envelope.


                                        16
       c) Performance Management. All government ministries and institutions are
          managing performance effectively within an agreed framework of planned
          objectives and standards, and are taking action to improve their capacity to
          deliver better services.
       d) Payroll management and Establishment Control. Personnel emoluments
          and establishments5 for the public service are effectively managed and
          maintained at agreed-upon levels.

         Box 3: Results Achieved Under the Public Service Management (PSM) Program

             The PSM Program has achieved modest results in the following areas:
             • A comprehensive pay policy was developed and approved by Cabinet in December
               2009. Job evaluations and salary structures have been finalized.
             • Several tools for improved service-delivery designed (e.g. Service delivery charters,
                process re-engineering, performance management systems) .
             • An integrated approach to restructuring of the public service has been designed and is
               being piloted.
             • The payroll management and control system has been upgraded and decentralized
               covering ministries and provinces. Payroll audits have been institutonalized.
             • Under the Service-Delivery Improvement Facility innovative approaches to improving
               service delivery have been implemented and the improvements recognized at local,
               regional and international level.

55.     The specific components of erstwhile PSM reform program such as
rightsizing, pay reform, performance management, and payroll management
and establishment control are not specifically mentioned in SNDP. The 2012
budget also does not make any specific mention of public service management
reforms. The PAF 2011-13 however includes actions aimed at designing of new
pay structures and payroll management.

Business Environment and Competitiveness Reforms

56.     Zambia has made significant improvements in its business climate but
challenges remain. Zambia was listed among the 10 top reformers of 2010,
ranked 80th among in 2011 and 84th in 2012 among 183 economies in ease of
doing business. It has made substantial progress in the areas of ease of starting a
business, with the elimination of the minimum capital requirement, and in the area
of enforcing contracts, with the introduction of an electronic case management
system. Three issues however stand out in the 2012 survey report: (i) Dealing
with construction permits (rank 148), (ii) Getting electricity (rank 118); and (iii)
Trading across borders (rank 153). The latter is a matter of concern since Zambia
is landlocked and depends on smooth border crossings to promote all trade.

57.    During the SNDP period, Government will continue to reform the
business environment through the implementation of PSDRP II, a successor
to the PSDRP I. PSDRP II will accelerate reforms in a number of key areas
which are expected to lead to a less-burdensome and competitive business
environment. Towards reducing regulatory burden, the government has

5
    Establishments are the positions set up at government institutions.


                                                   17
successfully identified the majority of the licensing requirements that will be
eliminated, consolidated, or otherwise streamlined as part of the PSDRP. With
the assistance from the World Bank Group, the government has been
implementing regulatory activities that includes the following: (i) reforms in the
areas measured by Doing Business, (ii) reduction in the number and cost of
business licenses, (iii) the establishment of a Business Regulatory Unit, and
establishment of an online business registry (e-Registry) and one-stop shop.
Besides licensing and regulatory framework, reforms in the areas of MSME
development, labor market, and skills supply will enhance competitiveness of
Zambia’s private sector, partly by accelerating the development of infrastructure.
These reforms are briefly described in the following paragraphs.

58.     MSME Development. MSME face numerous constraints that adversely
affect their development. These include limited access to finance and output
markets, high costs of borrowing, and working capital shortages. To deal with
these constraints the government is working on the design of an official MSME
policy, along with a credit guarantee scheme for MSME, an MSME incubator
program, and a training program for achieving access to finance and markets
designed specifically for MSME.

59.      Labor Market Reform and Labor Productivity Development. Labor
legislation has been identified as posing a significant impediment to the growth of
the private sector. The high cost of severance packages as well as the overall
rigidities in the labor market introduced by labor regulations act as deterrents to
private sector growth. In addition there is a significant gap between the practical
vocational skills demanded by the private sector and those produced by the
educational system. The government plans to reform business related labor laws,
including issues of retirement and severance packages, and to develop a system
for measuring and improving labor productivity. Laws to be reviewed include the
Employment Act, the Minimum Wages Act, and the Industrial Relations Act.

60.    Public Private Partnership (PPP) Development. In the 2012 Budget
Statement, the government has identified PPPs as a viable model for infrastructure
development and service provision capable of augmenting the government’s
limited financial and managerial capacity. The government is finalizing the
appropriate PPP legislation, creating a dedicated PPP unit, and training private
firms and public agencies in how to properly form PPP arrangements.

61.     Trade Expansion. The government is working to develop more
coherence in the policy, regulatory and legal framework for international trade. It
is improving border infrastructure, streamlining customs procedures, and assuring
the legitimacy of its professional accreditation standards, product quality controls,
and national metrology system, along with other related initiatives.

62.   Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP) is the broad reform
program for the financial sector that will continue to be implemented under
Phase II in the SNDP. The reform measures will be focused at addressing
weaknesses in the financial sector so as to improve market infrastructure, increase
competition, and increase access to finance. Financial sector policies will also aim


                                         18
to increase access to financial services in rural areas. The new Government has
taken some initial steps to reduce taxes and costs to the banking sector towards
reducing lending rates.

63.    SNDP places particular emphasis on addressing the institutional, legal
and policy constraints in Information and Communications Technology
(ICT) and energy sectors. In ICT, following the enactment of the ICT Act of
2009 and the privatization of ZAMTEL in 2010, reforms and policies will focus
on promoting competition so as to reduce costs to businesses. In the electricity
sub-sector, reforms will continue to emphasize maintaining cost-reflective tariffs.
In the petroleum sub-sector, a review will be undertaken to determine measures
required to achieve efficiency and cost effectiveness in the petroleum supply
chain.

64.     Zambia faces an electricity supply deficit in the medium-term and
sizable new investment is needed to meet the deficit. The rapid expansion of
mining and other energy-intensive activities in recent years has virtually
exhausted the surplus of electric power that characterized Zambia’s energy sector
in the 1960s and '70s. With the whole of southern Africa experiencing a power
deficit, any additional power would need to come largely from new power
generation within the country. While there is an abundance of hydroelectric
potential to be harnessed in Zambia, bringing new capacity on line will require
considerable investment and in many instances long lead times.

65.     The energy sector has been plagued by inefficiencies, which have, for
some time, deterred new investments to the sector. The country has not made
major investments in new generation capacity since the development of the major
hydro-power stations in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The poor financial
condition and weak operational performance of ZESCO, the state-owned power
company, has been an obstacle to undertake the new investment needed to build
power-generating capacity.

66.     To address the electricity supply deficit, the government has
developed a strategy that seeks to address short-, medium-, and long-term
issues in the energy sector. The strategy is centered on the following elements:
(i) opening the transmission network to private electricity providers in addition to
the state-owned ZESCO; (ii) improving the operational and financial performance
of ZESCO, while gradually phasing out the need to subsidize new capital
investments; and (iii) raise electricity tariffs to total cost recovery levels in order
to attract private investors to the market. To improve the efficiency of ZESCO, a
set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were agreed upon between the Energy
Regulation Board (ERB) and ZESCO. The KPIs fall under five main categories:
(i) customer metering, (ii) cash management, (iii) staff productivity, (iv) quality of
service, and (v) system losses. The strategy also specifies the medium- and long-
term investment programs required to build new power stations.

67.     Zambia’s fuel prices at the pump are high compared to other
neighboring countries, even after accounting for the higher transportation cost due
to land-locked nature of the country and the reduction in excise duties on fuel in


                                          19
2008. A study carried out by the World Bank in 2010 found that Zambia’s high
fuel costs are built into the wholesale fuel supply system consisting of fuel
imports, transportation, and processing. The wholesale fuel supply system is
dominated by a vertically integrated government monopoly consisting of Tazama
Pipelines Limited, the Indeni Petroleum Refinery Company Ltd., and the Ndola
Fuel Terminal. In the absence of any competition, this system suffers from
operational and structural inefficiencies, therefore high costs, the burden of which
is shared by private consumers and the government (through subsidy meant to
keep fuel costs low). The energy regulator has been unable to control costs
effectively. The new government has shown interest in an assessment of the fuel
supply system. An independent expert assessment study on the effectiveness and
efficiency of the fuel supply system is expected to be commissioned by the
government.



       IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT
                    PROGRAM
  A.    LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND AFRICA REGION
                                 STRATEGY

68.    The PRSC series is a key component of the CAS 2008-11 and the CAS
Progress Report, 2008-12. The CAS seeks impact through greater selectivity in
support of the government reforms. To that end, it supports two key areas:
improved public expenditure management, and investment in infrastructure to
increase economic opportunities and competitiveness. Within the two broad
themes, it proposes selective interactions in four priority areas of the national
development plans:       (i) macroeconomic management, (ii) infrastructure
development, (iii) institutional capacity enhancement, and (iv) social sector
development.
69.     The CAS identifies the reform areas that the annual program of
PRSCs will support. The PRSCs will support the core objective of the Bank’s
macroeconomic program to help Zambia better manage its financial resources so
that fiscal policy can be used to foster more inclusive growth. The focus areas are
the reform of the energy sector, the improvement of the business climate, and
capacity enhancement in public services.
70.    The PRSC program is consistent with the Africa Region Strategy. In
supporting four policy areas of macroeconomic management, public service
reform, energy sector policy, and business environment, it is fully aligned to the
main themes of the African strategy, namely: vulnerability and resilience,
competitiveness and employment, and governance and public sector capacity. The
focus of the macroeconomic management policy area in the program is consistent
with the theme of reducing vulnerability and building resilience to shocks by
entrenching fiscal sustainability and reducing fiscal risks that could arise from
contingent liabilities. Through public service reform the program is aligned to the
African strategy theme of enhancing governance and public sector capacity. The


                                        20
PFM and procurement reforms supported by the program will go a long way in
enhancing governance and public sector capacity required for improved service
delivery. By supporting the improvement in the energy sector policy and the
business environment, this program is consistent with the Strategy’s theme of
competitiveness and employment.
71.     The World Bank works in close collaboration with IFC, through the
joint Investment Climate Advisory Services, on the implementation of Doing
Business and business license reforms. The first Investment Climate Program
started in 2009 and ended in December 2010. A successor program is being
prepared.
                          B.   COORDINATION WITH THE IMF
72.     The IMF leads the dialogue on, and assessment of, the country’s
macroeconomic performance. The IMF agreed with the GRZ on a three-year
PRGF program in June 2008, later caller the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The
fifth and the final review of the program was successfully carried out in June
2011. The ECF had structural policy benchmarks in a number of areas including:
the adoption of the Treasury Single Account so as to cover 60 percent of
budgetary expenditures, submit to cabinet a review of maize pricing policy, and
prepare a review of tax administration and policy. These were developed in close
consultation with IDA. The Bank and the IMF also collaborate closely on
financial sector reform, debt-sustainability analysis, and trade policy formulation.


                     C.   COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS

73.     The Bank is a cosignatory, with other members of the PRBS group, to
a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that guides the process for budget
support to the GRZ.6 The MoU records an understanding on common
procedures for consultation and decision-making, disbursement mechanisms,
monitoring and reporting, review and evaluation, audit, financial management, the
exchange of information and cooperation between the signatories. The PRBS
group members base their actual budget support on the progress attained in the
implementation of the SNDP, measured through commonly agreed performance
indicators as described in the PAF.
74.     The World Bank worked closely with the PRBS group in
strengthening the policy content of the 2011-13 PAF. As a result the number of
indicators was reduced from 34 in the 2009-11 PAF to 14 in the 2011-13 PAF
largely by ensuring that the PAF is not used as an instrument for monitoring
progress in individual sectors and only indicators that are truly strategic and
policy-relevant are included. Towards preparation of the 2011-13 PAF, extensive
consultations took place with the line Ministries and the Sectoral Advisory
Groups (SAGs), which consist of government officials, representatives of Non-


6
  The first MoU was signed in mid-2005 and then revised in June 2008 to include new CPs. The
latest version was signed in November 2011.


                                             21
Governmental Organizations, civil society groups, business organizations, and
donors.

75.     A recent evaluation of budget support in Zambia (period 2005-2010)
found that progress made by the PRBS group in the areas of harmonization
and alignment has been limited.7 While substantial progress has been made in
setting up dialog structures and a common conditionality framework, yet there are
several flaws in the harmonization and alignment process. The conditionality
framework has been inconsistent with the priorities of CP who have different
interpretations of what the focus of PAF should be. CP have also failed to
harmonize their disbursement mechanisms. This leads to differences in the
application of fixed and variable tranches and their links to the PAF. Clearly,
improving harmonization and alignment is an area that requires further
strengthening of cooperation between CP.


                  D.    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER IDA OPERATIONS
76.     The PRSC program complements several operations and ongoing
knowledge-based activities identified in the CAS FY 2008-11. In the area of
Public Sector Reform, IDA has in place a Technical Assistance (TA) operation,
the Public Service Management Project8. This is assisting GRZ in two areas: (i)
the area of civil service and pay reform, and (ii) reforms in public expenditure
management and financial accountability, including the installation of an IFMIS.
IDA has also undertaken a Public Expenditure Review (PER) working with
government and with the support of other cooperating partners. This has looked
into the efficiency and equity of public resource allocation across sectors. The
Bank’s aim in the electricity sector is to assist the government in improving
ZESCO’s efficiency and quality of services it provides. In support of the
government’s private sector reform agenda, the Bank is working on a Jobs and
Competitiveness Economic and Social Work (ESW) focusing on the areas of
private sector development in tourism, beef and dairy production, and value
addition in the copper sector.


                       E.   LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST DPOS

77.      The PRSC program draws on the lessons learnt from the past DPOs
namely EMGC I & II and PRSC-1 and -2. EMGC I & II were two DPOs
identified in the previous CAS FY 2004-07 to assist GRZ in policy and
institutional reforms. EMGC I was approved in December 2004 and closed in

  The PSM project in the amount of US$30 million was approved by the board on January 5, 2006
and was declared effective on May 10, 2006. The operation contributes to a pooled-funding

closed in 2005.

December 2005, EMGC II was approved in May 2008 and closed in December
2008.
78.      The major lessons to draw from EMGC I and II for the PRSC
program were based on IEG’s evaluation of the operations.9                     The
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) for EMGC I was finalized
in March 2007 and for EMGC II was finalized in June 2009. One of the key
lessons from IEG’s evaluation of EMGC I ICR is the need to recognize that
institutional reforms require a longer time horizon than can be achieved through a
one-year disbursing credit. A second (and related) lesson is that the conditions of
the credit were not adequate to meet the objectives of the program. Taking these
lessons into account, the CAS identified a series of three annual credits, PRSCs,
as the method by which policy reform will be supported. This provides a longer
time horizon in which to undertake the reforms described in the program. Finally,
recognizing the importance of the reform areas to which the previous credits were
directed, the PRSC program continued to support most of those reforms.


                 F.    SUGGESTED POLICY AREAS FOR FUTURE DPOS
79.     The PRSC series has monitored institutional reforms in several areas
where continued support in future would be essential to ensure that these
reforms achieve their longer-term development objectives. Some of these are
listed below:
    a) PFM and Procurement: It is important to continue supporting PFM and
       procurement reforms with a long term perspective since these reforms
       have not been fully institutionalized. In order to sustain the gains that
       have been made in the PFM environment over the last several years, it is
       imperative that the Government continues to receive support and
       encouragement to reform.10
    b) Public Service Pension Fund: The PSPF is a source of significant
       contingent liabilities. Continued monitoring of the PSPF along with
       technical assistance would be needed to sequence reforms and put it on a
       sustainable path.
    c) Fuel Supply Chain: Significant involvement of the government in the fuel
       supply chain is either a source of fiscal burden or a source of higher costs
       for businesses. The government has started to look into the issue and
       continued dialogue and monitoring would be essential to maintaining
       momentum.

   2009 and 2010 saw the unfolding of serious cases of financial mis-management and
irregularities in health and roads sectors related to previous years. On the one hand these cases
show that government institutions such as the OAG, the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC), and
the Internal Audit functions have seen their capacity strengthened. On the other hand, these cases
highlight the need for further reforms of PFM systems and enforcement of rules.

     d) Tax Policy and Administration Reforms: This would be a new policy area
        that has gained in importance since domestic resource mobilization will
        increasingly be central to maintaining desired levels of public expenditure
        on infrastructure etc.
80.    Besides continuing with ongoing reforms, future DPOs could consider
several other areas that are critical to inclusive growth in the medium-term.
These relate to agriculture sector policy, access to finance issues, and regulatory
burden on private sector.


                          G.    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
81.     The PRSC series draws on several pieces of economic and sector
work. This includes the PEMFAR 2004, the Jobs and Competitiveness Report
(2010), the Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2010), the Poverty and
Vulnerability Assessment (PVA, 2007), and the diagnostic work on “constraints
to inclusive growth?11 undertaken as an input into the current CAS (2008-2011).
The PRSCs also draws on reports and evaluations carried out by GRZ, such as
“Zambia: Public Financial Management Performance Report and Performance
Indicators?, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment
(PEFA, 2005 and 2008).          In the energy sector, the PRSC is informed by
technical assistance provided to the “Electricity Sector Performance Review?.
82.     The Public Expenditure Review covers issues regarding the efficiency
of fiscal spending, with an emphasis on the infrastructure and agriculture
sectors, as well as cross-cutting issues. This PER reviews the major structural
challenges that the government must meet in order to improve efficiency and
equity in public spending. Following a review of the major achievements in terms
of macroeconomic stabilization, the PER suggests measures to improve the
budget and planning processes, as well as to account properly for the economic
effects of an exhaustible resource such as copper, and the need to improve
project-specific investment management. The PER provides a detailed analysis of
the major infrastructure sub-sectors, such as roads and water, as well as
agriculture.
83.     The Job and Competitiveness Report analyses several cross-cutting
issues that affect the productivity of three major industries in Zambia. The
Report highlights the major issues that negatively affect the growth of the
livestock, tourism and copper processing sectors, and offers several options to
increase the productivity of these industries. The Report analyses and offers
solutions to the following questions: Why are these industries not generating more
jobs and income? What can be done differently by the government, businesses,
civil society and the donor community to make these industries more
competitive? Can innovative approaches such as crowd-sourcing and the
promotion of competition, often adopted by the private sector, play a role in

facilitating implementation, advocacy and accountability in the public sector and
civil society.
84.     An analysis of constraints to growth in Zambia published by the Bank
in 2008 examined the potential for enhancing pro-poor growth in Zambia.12
It indentified the main challenge to improving the functioning of the agricultural
sector, enhancing access to markets through a better road network, and
broadening the availability of (micro) finance in rural areas. The analysis also
revealed several market coordination failures that undermine the country’s
competiveness, limit job creation and hinder inclusive growth. These include
limited access to markets, inputs and information, and high indirect costs related
to services (i.e. energy, transport and telecommunications). The study further
points to ineffective governance and regulatory mismanagement as major factors
behind these market failures. This is reflected in a number of distortive policy
interventions, especially in the agriculture sector.
85.     The PVA (2007) found that despite recent gains, poverty levels are
unacceptably high in Zambia, especially among the rural poor. The
assessment identified four fundamental challenges faced by the country in its
efforts to reduce poverty and promote economic equity. These are: (i) the need
for policies designed to expand economic opportunities for the poor, (ii) the
recognition that the poverty-reduction impacts of reforms are contingent on the
poor having the necessary tools to participate in growth, (iii) the need to recognize
and account for the risk-averse nature of the poor, and (iv), the need to develop a
well-functioning and responsive public administration to improve governance.
86.    The World Bank has recently re-engaged in social protection and is in
the process of carrying out a comprehensive assessment of all social transfers
programs in Zambia. This assessment is at a very early stage, but some patterns
emerge. Zambia is already spending large amounts of money on programs that
provide transfers to its citizens, most of which are not targeted at the poor. There
are some new programs (social cash transfer) that have shown promise and are
being scaled up to increase the coverage, but Zambia will need to make tough
choices to select instruments that would help address the issue of extreme poverty
and at the same time are most cost-effective and fiscally sustainable. As recent
experience elsewhere – for example, in Latin America, India, and in other
countries in Africa – has shown this is possible and spending on well-designed
large scale national social safety net program can have a substantial role in
accelerating the rate of poverty reduction.

PRSCs. These are macroeconomic management, public service reform including
PFM and procurement, energy sector policy and business environment.
Continuing with the existing policy areas allows continuity with the development
objectives of the PRSC program which remain critical to government’s overall
development strategy.

                     A.   MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

88.     Actions identified in the area of macroeconomic management are
aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stability achieved in the previous
decade. The specific focus has been on entrenching fiscal sustainability and
reducing fiscal risks by managing contingent liabilities in a proactive manner. The
first two operations – PRSC-1 and -2 -- focused on government arrears owed to
the Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) and domestic suppliers and included
remedial actions to reduce arrears in the short and in the long run. In the past,
relatively large arrears had been accumulated by some government agencies not
making full payment of employer contributions owed to the PSPF. The
government program concentrated first on reducing the arrears to a minimum and
then on facing the actuarial deficit by changing parameters and financial
limitations of the PSPF, as recommended by a business plan.

89.     The most important short term measure has been the implementation
of a program to reduce arrears to the PSPF. Over the duration of the PRSCs,
the government has made steady progress in reducing arrears owed to the PSPF.
During the PRSC-1 implementation period, the stock of arrears was reduced to
ZMK93 billion (compared to ZMK305 billion at end-2007, and ZMK464 billion
at end-2005). Under PRSC-2, the government had committed to reduce the
arrears to ZMK67 billion at end-2009, but actually reduced them to
ZMK48 billion. Towards a permanent solution to the problem, the government
has started making a special provision in the Ministry of Finance budget towards
employer share on behalf of public servants in all ministries and agencies, which
is then remitted by the Accountant General to the PSPF. However, this provision
does not include defense forces and at the end of 2011, arrears on account of non-
payment of employer contribution by defense forces amounted to ZMK 91 billion.
The government is committed to liquidating these arrears in four equal
installments of ZMK 22.8 billion each and has made supplementary provision in
the 2012 budget.

90.     For long term sustainability of the PSPF, the PSPF Board adopted a
business plan in 2009. The preparation of the business plan was sought and
monitored by PRSC-1. The business plan recommended reworking of the benefit
and contribution structure and also re-opening the scheme to all new personnel.
Given that the issues of benefit and contribution structure required constitutional
changes, PRSC-2 focused on opening the scheme to new entrants instead. At the
time of PRSC-2 approval, the government was developing a draft on the pension
rights for new entrants to the PSPF. Accordingly, PRSC-2 identified a trigger for
PRSC-3 which sought that ‘an agreement be reached on pension rights of new
entrants to the PSPF’. The government has made an attempt to move on the issue
of new entrants by forming an inter-ministerial committee to advise on the impact


                                        26
of re-opening the scheme, particularly on public servants who joined other
schemes while the PSPF was closed.

91.      To achieve sustainability and reduce fiscal burden, the government
needs to implement a comprehensive set of reforms along the lines identified
in the business plan. The Fund faces an actuarial deficit estimated at ZMK15
trillion. The annual financing gap is large: PSPF will need about ZMK516 billion
to meet payments to the retirees in 2012, against a government budget of
ZMK250 billion. The government needs to move on all issues, namely
membership, and contribution and benefit structure. However, the issues of
contribution and benefit structure are connected to the constitution-making
process, which is likely to take its own time.

92.     Dialogue and analytical work continues on what will be a very deep
reform for which neither full analysis nor consensus on how to proceed
exists. No prior actions are associated with this specific component for PRSC-3.

            B.    PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM INCLUDING PFM AND PROCUREMENT

     93.    In the area of public service reform, including PFM and procurement,
     PRSC-3 monitors the development and implementation of a comprehensive
     public service pay policy, improvement in service delivery through the adoption
     of SDCs, strengthening control and management of public resources, and
     improving efficiency and effectiveness of government procurement. All these
     reforms are supported by the Bank’s Public Service Management Program
     Support Project, an investment operation, which is being implemented in
     conjunction with technical assistance provided by donors.

     Pay policy reform
     94.   Development of a comprehensive pay policy for the public service is
     part of the government’s efforts to develop, in a systematic manner, an


                                                     29
incentive system that should attract and retain qualified personnel at
management and professional levels, and motivate staff to improve
performance. The pay policy reform addresses longstanding problems in the
civil service payroll. Previously, the payroll system was adjusted on an
unsystematic and ad hoc basis. Real wages were allowed to erode for long
periods at a time and inflation adjustments were unpredictable. Public service
wages periodically became uncompetitive, giving more qualified staff members a
strong incentive to leave their agencies and pursue employment in the private
sector. To combat this tendency, agency managers began dispensing unearned
promotions, moving staff they wished to retain, up the pay scale in order to
combat the inflationary decline in their real wages. The use of in-kind
remuneration and other non-salary benefits also became common. As a result, the
pay system became increasingly distorted and expensive, as cost-of-living wage
increases were ultimately added to existing informal incentives.

95.     In order to address these challenges the PRSC-1 and -2 supported the
preparation of a draft pay policy and its pilot implementation in the 2010
budget. The new pay policy established clear guidelines for the organization of
the career and pay scales and provided for timely inflation adjustments, created an
explicit link between pay raises and staff performance, and discouraged the use of
non-salary compensation or unwarranted promotion as means to retain qualified
staff. The Cabinet has since reviewed and ultimately approved a final version of
the new pay policy. As a complement, the government has launched a thorough
exercise to reassess competencies, qualifications, and job description in the public
sector (the job evaluation exercise).

96.     Pay policy reform continues to remain a high priority with the new
government. A new pay structure is being developed and its cost implications are
being worked out. The new pay structure has been finalized recently and will be
submitted to the cabinet, along with its cost implications, soon. Action is also
going on, on putting in place an institutional framework for implementing the pay
policy, which was identified as a trigger for PRSC-3. The institutional framework
agreed to after an inter-ministerial consultation is to set up an authority or a board
with a legal mandate over the entire public sector. A draft bill on setting up a
body with legal mandate to implement pay policy is likely to be submitted to
cabinet in the first half of 2012.

97.     Given the timeframe for PRSC-3 it is proposed to recognize actions on
job evaluation and finalization of new pay structures as prior actions that
have been met. Meanwhile, the issue of institutional framework for
implementing the pay policy remains important and relevant for Bank support in
future.

 PRSC-3 Prior Action: a) a) Job evaluations for public service are completed.
 b) New pay structures are designed for public service.

Service delivery reform
98.      Service Delivery Charters. The PRSC Series has been monitoring the
establishment of Service Delivery Charters (SDCs) as a key element of service
delivery reform.       The government began establishing SDCs for public
administrative agencies in 2008, as a means to ensure that all ministries and
institutions benchmark performance and service delivery to fixed known
standards that clients can expect from government agencies. While the content of
each SDC is specific to its agency, all share a common set of objectives; these are
to: (i) enhance clients’ awareness of the type of service the agency provides, (ii)
inform clients of the standard of service they may expect to receive, (iii) outline
clients’ rights and responsibilities in relation to the agency, (iv) define the
agencies’ rights and responsibilities as service provider, and (v) detail the ways in
which clients may provide feedback to the agency and seek redress for
complaints. The SDC serves as an important touchstone for both the agency staff,
by laying out a set of clear and consistent guidelines for professional
performance, and for clients, by apprising them of the standards to which the
agency may be held.

99.    The government is continuing to make progress on SDCs. Under the
PRSC-1 SDCs were adopted and institutionalized in two government agencies,
the Ministry of Lands and the Department of Immigration. At the end of 2009,
SDCs had been prepared and institutionalized for four additional government
agencies, namely; the Public Sector Management Division (PSMD), the
Department of National Registration, the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and
Natural Resources (MTENR), and the Ministry of Mines and Mineral
Development (MMMD). This was twice the original target in PRSC-2, which
was to establish SDCs in two additional ministries.

100. Government has also recognized the need to develop systems to review
performance of the charters under implementation. In 2011, the government
initiated a Service Delivery Survey to ascertain whether the two original
ministries (the Ministry of Lands and Department of Immigration) have
implemented their SDCs satisfactorily. A report prepared by ZIPAR found that in
the Department of Immigration, the time to process a passport has been reduced to
5-7 days on payment of appropriate fee, in contrast to the recent past where one
could wait for a passport for as long three months after applying for it. At the
Ministry of Lands, an information centre has been established, at which the public
can easily accesses information on land title registered, although there are still
difficulties with registering land title. The government has also completed the
review of one SDC for the Zambia Revenue Authority.

101. Adoption and institutionalization of SDCs for an additional two
Ministries is a trigger for PRSC-3. The government has made significant
progress on preparation of SDCs for the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock,
and Patents and Company Registration Agency (PACRA) under the Ministry of
Commerce, Trade and Industry. These two charters have been recently adopted,
which is recognized as a (revised) prior action for PRSC-3.

 PRSC-3 Prior Action: SDCs adopted for Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock and
 Patents and Company Registration Agency (PACRA).

PFM reform
102. The PRSC series is monitoring reforms targeted at improving public
financial management and procurement to strengthen: (a) predictability and
control in budget execution; (b) internal and external audit; and (c) policy based
budgeting. These are proposed to be achieved through strengthened budget
execution control, enhanced internal audit functions, accounting and reporting
systems (including at sub-national level with interaction between IFMIS and
enhanced-FMS), improved cash management through a Single Treasury Account
system, implementing fully the new Public Procurement law and its Regulations,
and addressing capacity needs at sector level. Steps have been initiated to
improve the scope, coverage, efficiency and quality of external audit services as
well as to strengthen the oversight role of the Parliament, CSOs, professional
associations, and the media. On the budget side, the reforms focus on using the
budget as a policy and planning instrument for allocation efficiency (improving
links between MTEF and annual budgets) and enacting budget-related legislative
reforms.

103. As part of the Government’s drive to improve budget execution,
efforts are in progress for rolling out IFMIS to all ministries and provinces.
PRSC program has identified IFMIS rollout as an important indicator of progress
made in strengthening budget execution and reporting. The complete roll-out of
IFMIS to all the ministries and provinces will strengthen expenditure controls
thereby supporting Government’s efforts to reduce the gap between budget and
expenditure outturn. Some of these controls relate to: (a) systems-based
commitment control for a strict application of budget checks before commitments
are entered into; (b) ensuring that all consolidated fund expenditures are
processed through the computerized financial management system and relate to
specific approved budget appropriations; and (c) instilling fiscal discipline
through avoidance of extra-budgetary expenditures. IFMIS roll-out will also lead
to improved quality and timeliness of fiscal and financial information, which will
allow good decision making and predictability of cash flows and timely
reconciliation of government accounts. This will aid the Government in preparing
better quality and timely reports on the utilization of public funds, in turn helping
the Accountant General to produce annual Financial Statements within the
statutory time limit.

104. So far, 28 IFMIS sites are operational as of January 2012. Roll out of
IFMIS to 15 sites was identified as a trigger for PRSC-3. It is a prior action for
PRSC-3 and has been met. In a recent visit to two sites where IFMIS has been
rolled out, namely the Ministry of Finance and Office of the Auditor General, the
Bank team found that both sites are using the system and all payments are
processed through the system, apart from salaries which is routed through a
separate payroll system on a different SAP platform. All manual checks have
been withdrawn from the two sites. Officials met during this visit indicated
confidence in the use of the systems and cited several benefits of using the


                                         32
system. The users cited an example of the speed with which they are able to
process transactions and reduction of outstanding imprests as a definite advantage
of using the IFMIS. Staff in the Ministry of Finance, which was the first pilot site
(went live on January 4, 2010) are now providing on the job training to staff in
sites that are being rolled out now.

105. However there are several challenges that remain to be addressed
such as integration of payroll and IFMIS systems, power outages, change
management etc. The government is aware of these issues and is handling them.

106.    The government has prepared a draft PFM strategy for the period
2011-15. It proposes twelve reform areas: Budgeting & Planning, Cash
management, accounting and financial reporting (including IFMIS), Procurement,
Debt management, Government investments, Domestic revenue mobilization,
Internal audit & control, Legal and regulatory framework, Capacity building,
Fiscal decentralization, Monitoring & Evaluation and Restructuring of MFNP.
The key lessons learned from previous PFM reforms (most recently PEMFA)
have been considered and the government is also strengthening its institutional set
up and capacity for the smooth implementation of its new strategy. The
submission of the PFM strategy to the Cabinet is a prior action for PRSC-3 which
has been met and the strategy is pending cabinet approval. The approval of the
strategy would be an important step for designing the next set of PFM reforms for
the government.

 PRSC-3 Prior Action: a) IFMIS operational in 15 sites. b) Draft PFM strategy
 submitted to cabinet.

Procurement reform
107. Weaknesses in current procurement systems have contributed to poor
budget execution and poor value for money. Cognizant of the importance of
this issue, government embarked on a comprehensive program of reforms with a
view to increase transparency; enhance competition and efficiency, and
developing a regulatory framework for the country including an arbitration
system. A critical milestone was the passage of the Public Procurement Law No.
12 of 2008. The Law provided for the establishment of the Zambia Public
Procurement Authority (ZPPA) as a policy, regulatory and monitoring body for
public procurement and the continuation of the Zambia National Tender Board
(renamed as ZPPA) for a two year transition period to December 2010.

108. Actual implementation of the Procurement Law has been slow to take
off. During the transition period, the Government had established Procurement
Committees in Ministries and Public Agencies (MPSA). However, in December
2010, the Government amended the law to allow for a further two-year transition
period to December 2012 to allow the ZPPA to review procurement actions and
decisions carried out by Procurement Committees. The amendment followed
fiduciary concerns in health and road sectors and findings of special audit by the
Auditor General which found many cases on non-compliance to the procurement
law. The amendment also introduced Special Team of Inspectors to review and


                                        33
clear procurements valued at ZMK 50 million or more which was lowered from a
previously high threshold of ZMK 300 million. The huge volume of applications
arising from this low threshold and low capacity at ZPPA has resulted in
substantial delays in concluding contracts thereby negatively impacting budget
and project implementation. There are lingering concerns about the ability of the
ZPPA to transform itself into a procurement regulator, in the absence of its Board
which has remained un-constituted for over two years. The new Government has
initiated the process of nominating Board members of ZPPA as per Procurement
Act to guide the implementation of the reforms.

109. Some progress has been achieved but procurement reforms remain
important for any future support. Progress includes preparation and approval
of Procurement Regulations and start of capacity assessments for MPSAs with a
view to commence further decentralization. Following the amendment of the law
Government prepared a Procurement Reform Action Plan leading to the 2012
deadline for the transition period. Implementation of the reform plan is important
to get procurement reforms back on track. The reform plan is yet to be approved
by the ZPPA Board though implementation has started, and it includes
sensitization of procuring entities on the new Law. Further tools for the
implementation of the Law in the form of Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs),
Request for Proposals (RFP) and bid evaluation templates are required. The Bank
through the PEMFA Project is supporting the development of SBDs, RFP and
evaluation templates.

110. PRSC-2 had identified development of SBD and RFP templates as a
trigger for PRSC-3. This trigger is revised because the process of recruiting a
consultant has not been finalized due to eligibility issues under Bank financed
contract and the selection process had to be restarted. The progress made so far on
procurement regulations and the reform action plan is recognized as prior action.

 PRSC-3 Prior Action: a) Procurement regulations finalized and published.
 b) Procurement reform action plan for 2011-13 updated and implementation
 commenced, decentralization commenced.



                              C.   ENERGY SECTOR

111. Substantial progress has been made in improving the operational
efficiency of ZESCO. As major step towards cost recovery, the government
announced a multi-year tariff framework in 2009 that has seen electricity tariffs
rise to cost-recovery levels by 2011. A first adjustment of 27 percent was
implemented in January 2009, followed by a 35 percent average tariff increase in
August 2009. In August 2010, an increase of 25.6 percent was implemented,
helping to bring ZESCO’s tariff close to cost reflective levels. Concerning
efficiency of ZESCO, since 2008, the energy regulator has used the performance-
evaluation framework of KPIs to monitor operational performance and enforcing
penalties should ZESCO underperform. The company is also progressing on its
plan to expand the installation of pre-paid electricity meters across the country.


                                        34
112. Regarding generation, several sizable electricity generation projects
are underway. Work has commenced on the Kariba North Bank extension
project that will add 360 MW of additional capacity in the medium term. The
government is also close to finalizing technical discussions and financial
negotiations for the Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) project, which is expected to add
another 600-750 MW of electricity by 2017. The government has also endorsed
the investment plans for the ITEZHI-TEZHI 120 MW power project, in addition,
to bilateral agreements reached with Maamba Collieries Limited coal powered
plant that will generate 265.5-300 MW by 2014 and Ndola Energy Company (50
MW) a Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) powered plant.

113. PRSC program had initially identified two indicators to monitor
progress on the policies of increasing household access to electricity and
improving operational efficiency of ZESCO. These are: (i) increase in the total
number of new domestic customers served by ZESCO, and (ii) decrease in the
total number of unmetered customers served by ZESCO. Progress on these
actions was expected to lead to improved efficiency of ZESCO and a decrease in
its financial losses. Both were seen as essential to putting the utility company on a
sustainable path. For PRSC-3 a prior action related to continuing with the tariff
increases of the previous years in 2011 has been added. This action confirms the
willingness of the new government to continue with the policy of cost-reflective
tariffs.

114. Government performance on the indicator on new domestic
household connections added to the ZESCO grid annually was satisfactory
during PRSC-1, and PRSC-2. There are more than 400,000 households with
access to electricity in Zambia (out of a total of 2.5 million households). The
government’s program aims at a minimum growth of 4 percent per year in
domestic connections, so as to consistently increase electricity coverage for
households. In 2008, the first year of electricity reform implementation, new
domestic connections reached 25,700, substantially exceeding the target of
18,000. The relevant PRSC-2 target was also exceeded. As of end-2009, ZESCO
added 35,709 new connections to the grid, well above the target number of
20,000. For PRSC-3 the target is a net increase of 10 percent, in 2011, on the total
number of ZESCO customers recorded by the 30th of December 2010 which has
been met.13

115. There was a shift in the metering policy of ZESCO from credit (post-
paid) metering to pre-paid metering in 2008 due to significant benefits of the
latter. The change in policy was triggered by the challenges faced by ZESCO in
collecting money owed to it by customers in unpaid electricity bills. As part of
new policy preference is given to installing pre-paid meters on both already
metered (replacements) and unmetered (new) customers. The pre-paid metering
program targets whole communities i.e., whole townships and towns to ensure
smooth administration of customer accounts.


13
  The total number of customers at the end of 2010 was 410,511. The Ministry of Energy has
reported that another 55,699 were added during 2011.


                                              35
116. The PRSC-2 prior action on the number of unmetered customers was
erroneously reported and documented as having been met. One of the prior
actions of PRSC-2 was reduction in the number of unmetered customers to less
than 85,000, translating into an effective installation of about 30,000 new meters
on unmetered premises in the second half of 2009. By mid-2009, when the
appraisal of the PRSC-1 was completed, ZESCO had reduced the number of
unmetered customers to about 114,000 (surpassing the target of 120,000). During
the period between July 2009 and December 2009, a total of 39,968 new meters
were installed but the number of unmetered customers went down to only 109,801
due to an additional 19,614 new connections and new meters being used for
replacement of credit meters. Due to a calculation error, the number of unmetered
customers at end-2009 was reported by ZESCO to ERB as 56,558 instead of the
actual 109,801. The error came to ZESCO’s notice and the formula was corrected
and reported to the ERB in July 2010. The PRSC-2 appraisal itself was based on
the PAF review completed earlier in May 2010, which showed this indicator as
having been met. The revised data came to IDA’s notice only at the time of
PRSC-3 pre-appraisal.

117.     The change in metering policy has rendered the trigger on unmetered
customers identified for PRSC-3 not relevant for monitoring progress on
policy action. The PRSC-3 trigger was to reduce the number of unmetered
customers to 40,000, a reduction of 45,000 over the PRSC-2 target. In 2010, a
total of pre-paid 60,522 meters were installed and another 83,857 were installed in
2011. Therefore while the metering program has been moving at a reasonable
pace, it does not show up in a sizable decline in unmetered customers due to the
change in policy.

118. ZESCO continues to implement cost-reflective tariffs in 2011. The last
tariff revision was implemented in August 2010 and an increase granted in 2011
for supply to the mining sector. The new government is in favor of maintaining
cost-reflective tariffs. Actually a tariff increase proposal is currently pending with
the ERB.

 PRSC-3 Prior Actions: a) ZESCO continues to implement the policy of expanding
 access and achieves a net increase of 10 percent in 2011 over the total number of
 ZESCO customers at the end of 2010.
 b) ZESCO continues to implement the approved tariffs for (i) Metered Residential; (ii)
 Commercial; (iii) Social services; and (iv) Maximum Demand tariff categories during
 2011.



                          D.    BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

Licensing reform
119. Progress has been made on streamlining business licensing to reduce
the regulatory burden, under the PSDRP. The business licensing and
regulatory framework has been identified as a critical constraint to private sector
development due to costly and cumbersome business licensing procedures and


                                         36
 requirements. The unnecessarily complex and onerous process of acquiring
 business licenses also discourages formalization, further restricting many firms’
 access to bank financing. These effects have particularly impeded the growth of
 micro, small and medium enterprises.

 120. Under the PSDRP licensing procedures have been made simpler and
 more transparent through the elimination or consolidation of a significant
 number of administrative requirements. In 2009, following completion of the
 PRSC-1 a baseline for all licenses to be eliminated was established by the
 Government's Business Licensing Reform Committee, which in February 2009,
 proposed that, out of the total 517 business licenses that existed at the time in
 Zambia, 170 were to be eliminated, and the rest retained, amalgamated or
 reclassified. Procedures and processes associated with the remaining business
 licenses were to be streamlined as well. The Government has so far passed 18
 laws, which cover 151 business licenses, of which 42 have been eliminated, while
 the remainder have been retained, amalgamated or reclassified. The government
 estimates the reduction in compliance cost already achieved at ZMK 76.5 billion.

 121. Rationalization of business licenses has been followed by the
 establishment of an e-registry, which was identified as a trigger for PRSC-3.
 The e-Registry is a centralized and publicly accessible electronic database
 designed to hold all approved and legal business licenses that exist in Zambia. An
 informational e-registry, hosted by the Zambia development Agency was
 established in 2011. The registry will ultimately include information on 287
 licenses that were found legal after dropping another 230 licenses as illegal,
 unnecessary or redundant. As at the end of January 2012, 118 licenses could be
 viewed on the web-site. The rest are in the process of development and review by
 the Ministry of Justice. The vision of the government is to make the e-registry
 transactional.

PRSC3 Action: Informational e-registry established for housing all approved

            VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                       A.   POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

 122. The proposed PRSC-3 will have a positive, though indirect, effect on
 poverty reduction through its support to the government’s efforts with regard to
 SNDP implementation and continued growth. The PRSC is expected to facilitate
 poverty reduction through three primary channels. The first is by assisting the
 government to maintain a growth-conducive macroeconomic environment, which will
 provide the necessary stability for poverty reduction and wealth creation. The second
 is through its continued support to improving public sector management processes,
 enhancing the government’s ability to direct its scarce resources to high-impact
 expenditure programs designed to reduce poverty. The third is by contributing to


                                        37
broad-based growth through improvements in the efficiency of the energy sector, and
improving business environment. These impacts could be measured by assessing
progress on relevant indicators included in the quadrennial Living Conditions
Monitoring Survey.

123. The reforms on PFM, procurement and improving public sector
performance lay the foundation for improved public service delivery. Poor public
service delivery through procurement inefficiencies and low public sector capacity
negatively affect the poor more by reducing public sector outcomes in education,
health, agriculture and infrastructure sectors. Streamlining public sector jobs and
instituting SDCs should improve public service delivery. PFM and procurement
reforms enhance value for money. These reforms are expected to bring modest direct
positive social benefits through better fiscal management anticipated to lead to
improved budget allocation, reduce budget linkages and increase service delivery to
the most vulnerable.

124. Sustaining fiscal and financial stability by reducing contingent liabilities
mitigates the impact of macroeconomic shocks which affect growth and the poor
more. The poor are more vulnerable to shocks, thus by supporting reforms that
preserve the macroeconomic stability, this program builds resilience to this nature of
shocks. It identifies sustainability of PSPF as a contingent liability that could lead to
fiscal pressures yielding a macroeconomic shock. In addition, a stable
macroeconomic environment should be sustained for inclusive economic growth
agenda of government.

125. Policy reforms on improving efficiency of the energy sector and business
environment address constraints to broad-based growth. Reforms in the
electricity sector aim to reduce inefficiencies in ZESCO and make it more
sustainable, to so as to mitigate against, first the fiscal risk posed by ZESCO
inefficiencies which would lead to a poorly targeted subsidy to the sector and a
contingent liability that could create a fiscal risk, second, discourage electricity
investments that could constrain growth and job creation. Improving business
environment by reducing the cost and barriers that unnecessary licensing creates will
positively impact the poor through increased business creation that generates
employment.

126. The direct effect of continuing with cost-reflective electricity tariffs on the
poor is negligible. There are two reasons for this: (a) under the current system the
poor have almost no access to electricity—according to recently revised data from the
2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey only 6 percent or the rural population
have access to the electricity grid, and among the three lowest income quintiles
electricity access is only around 2.5 percent; and (b) the electricity tariffs contain a
cross-subsidy element by maintaining a fixed low price for the first kilowatt-hours of
consumption (life-line tariff). In fact the indirect effect of cost-reflective tariffs is
potentially positive in light of financially sustainable ZESCO that frees up public
resources elsewhere – which can be targeted on the welfare of the poor – and reduces
fiscal risk.




                                         38
             B.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

127. Implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the PRSC-3 will be
completed in the context of the assessment of the PAF, undertaken in
collaboration with other cooperating partners. The agreement reached between
the cooperating partners and GRZ, which was made explicit in the Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) for budget support, defines reporting requirements, sets out a
schedule of bi-annual meetings to discuss progress and possible revisions to the PAF,
and includes institutional arrangements and platforms for evaluation. In addition, the
cooperating partners have agreed to provide budget support in a way that: (i) is
aligned with GRZ cycles for planning, implementation, monitoring, reporting, and
funding; (ii) improves harmonization by eliminating bilateral administrative and
reporting requirements as well as bilateral reviews; (iii) ensures the transparency of
conditions and funding; and (iv) enhances the capacity of GRZ to meet its
commitments by providing appropriate technical assistance and capacity-building
support.

128. With the completion of PRSC-3, significant progress would have been
made on most of the indicators identified by the program. Key achievements have
been: (i) Almost full liquidation of arrears to the PSPF and to domestic suppliers;
putting in place arrangements for regular payment of employer contribution to PSPF;
(ii) development and adoption of a public pay policy; (iii) Implementation of SDCs in
eight ministries and agencies; (iv) Significant rollout of IFMIS; (v) development and
adoption of procurement regulations; (vi) Setting up of an e-registry; and (vii)
expansion of access to electricity and improvement in operational performance of
ZESCO. At the same time some deeper reforms such as those in the PSPF structure
and implementation of procurement law did not make enough progress.



                                C.   FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

129. Zambia’s fiduciary framework is adequate to support the proceeds of the
credit, particularly in light of the progress made in the PFM reform program being
undertaken under PEMFA and PAF—projects to which the Bank is offering support.
The ongoing reforms under PEMFA and PAF will continue to strengthen the
country’s financial management systems, providing further assurance of fiduciary
readiness.

130. As noted above, a number of diagnostic studies of Zambia’s PFM system
have determined that public financial management faces several key weaknesses.
These studies include the Country Financial Accountability Assessment14 (CFAA) for
November 2003 and the PEFA assessments for 2005 and 200815. The PEMFA project
has been addressing weaknesses in PFM, and while the reform effort has yielded only

14
     A comprehensive Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
   (PEMFAR) was carried out by the Government of the Republic of Zambia with the support of
   cooperating partners and the World Bank in November 2003.
15
    The Government of Zambia has carried out an internal assessment of the PFM system based on
   PEFA indicators finalized in 2005 and in 2008.


                                             39
modest results so far, some notable improvements have been achieved, including: (i)
commencement of the IFMIS rollout, (ii) an improved MTEF green paper, (iii)
approved public procurement reform legislation, (iv) the implementation of activity-
based budgeting, (v) the development of a revised chart of accounts, (vi) a
strengthened external auditing process, and (vii) enhancements in parliamentary
oversight, among others. The 2008 PEFA assessment recorded improvements in
transparency, comprehensiveness and accountability in fiscal management, evidence
that progress is being made under the PEMFA project. Policies designed to further
address PFM weaknesses, especially the public service compensation reforms and
ongoing improvements in budget execution, are also being supported by the PRSC.

131. The status of budget publication in the country. The Government budget
for the financial year beginning January 1, 2012 was presented to Parliament on 11th
November 2011 (before the start of the new financial year). The budget presented to
parliament through the budget speech by the Minister of Finance was immediately
made available on several government websites including Parliament and Zambia
Revenue Authority websites. The approved budget documents are also available in
published hard copies to the public at a modest fee.

132. The most recent Safeguards Assessment for the Bank of Zambia (BoZ)
was completed by the IMF on January 13, 2009. The assessment found that aspects
of the BoZ safeguards framework have been strengthened since the previous
assessment, completed in 2004. Specifically, the BoZ had implemented International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2005 and recently strengthened its foreign
reserves management and oversight systems. Weak statutory independence,
protracted external audit completion, and the non-publication or delayed publication
of audit information all remain important safeguard concerns. To address these issues
the assessment recommended that the BoZ:

   -   put in place year-end closing and audit-planning procedures to facilitate
       more rapid completion of the annual external audit;

   -   adopt legislative amendments that address all legal safeguard concerns
       raised in the 2004 safeguards report;

   -   publish the annual audited financial statements and audit opinions on the
       BoZ’s external website no later than one month after audit completion;

   -   commission an external quality-assurance review of the work practices of
       the internal audit function and the oversight exercised by the BoZ Audit
       Committee;

   -   mandate that the external audit firm, in coordination with the Internal
       Audit Department, verify unissued currency in vaults at year-end and
       reconcile the confirmed balances with corresponding documentation from
       the printing firms;

   -   request that the MoFNP fill the vacant seat on the Board by appointing a
       person with professional experience in accounting and auditing, who
       should also serve on the Audit Committee; and


                                       40
   -   implement a review of all program data for accuracy, and for consistency
       with the technical memorandum of understanding, conducted by BoZ’s
       Internal Audit Department.

133. The Government has accepted the recommendations made by the Fund and
compliance is being regularly monitored. The Fund does not have a program at the
moment and a review was recently done as part of the Article 4 mission in March
2012.

134. Overall, the fiduciary risk of the operation is rated substantial. This is based
on the results of last IMF safeguards assessment of the Bank of Zambia, the
improvements already made as well as the demonstrated commitment of the
Government to implement other wide ranging reforms in the area of PFM, including
public procurement and this program’s strong alignment to PFM and procurement
reforms.


                      D.   DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

Disbursements

135. A single-tranche credit equivalent to US$30 million will be made
available upon the Poverty Reduction Support Credit’s effectiveness. The
proposed credit will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for development
policy lending. Once the credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, and
upon receipt of a withdrawal application signed by an authorized signatory, the
proceeds will be deposited by IDA in a US$ account designated by the GRZ at the
BoZ. The credit proceeds will form part of the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
Within two business days, the BoZ will credit the Zambian kwacha (ZMK) equivalent
of the credit proceeds to the consolidated accounts maintained on behalf of the GRZ
for budget execution. The Accountant-General will be notified accordingly. The BoZ
will not impose any charges or commission on the GRZ for these transactions. The
conversion from United States dollars to Zambian kwacha will be based on the
prevailing exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated
account. The government, through the MoFNP, will (i) provide written confirmation
to IDA within 30 days that an amount equivalent to the credit proceeds from IDA has
been credited to the consolidated account along with an indication of the exchange
rate applied; (ii) provide evidence that the ZMK equivalent of the credit proceeds was
recorded as financing the GRZ budget; and (iii) ensure that the ZMK equivalent of
the credit proceeds are subject to effective controls sufficient to ensure its use for
eligible, budgeted public expenditures only as per the Credit Agreement. If the
proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes, IDA will require the GRZ to
promptly refund an amount equal to the total of the ineligible expenditures. The
refunded amount will be cancelled, thereby reducing the amount of the credit. The
administration of the credit shall be the responsibility of the MoFNP.




                                       41
Auditing

136. The use of the ZMK equivalent of Credit proceeds to support budgetary
expenditures will be subject to audit by the Auditor General as provided for by
the Zambian Constitution. The Bank will have access to these audit reports. The
annual financial statements of the BoZ are audited in accordance with International
Standards of Auditing and the financial statements are publicly available.

137. The Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit report
and accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the
Recipient. Upon the Association’s request, the Recipient shall; (i) have the account
and the recording of amounts of the Credit into the Recipient’s budget management
system audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association, in accordance
with consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish
to the Association as soon as available, but in any case no later than four months after
the date of the Association’s request for such audit, a certified copy of the audit report
by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have
reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Association such other information
concerning the said account and recording of the Credit amounts into the budget
management system, and the audit thereof, as the Association shall have reasonably
requested.


                         E.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

138. Environmental Impact. The proposed operation is likely to have no
significant effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources. The first
set of triggers is linked to public administration. The policy goals are enhanced
productivity of civil servants and greater efficiency in the use of public funds. There
will be positive and negative impacts on the natural environment. The energy triggers
are designed to support the government’s energy policy and in particular to effect
improvements in the governance and efficiency of ZESCO. One indicator will
require an absolute increase in electrical grid coverage which, in Zambia, can only
result from an increase in power generation. The potential environmental
consequences of this should be neutral, on balance. An increase in the number of
connections could be beneficial to the environment to the extent it provides an energy
alternative with positive impacts on deforestation and indoor air pollution. On the
other hand there are likely to be adverse environmental impacts resulting from the
construction of new transmission lines.

139. The country’s regulatory systems and environmental legislation is
normally adequate, with suitable legislation on environmental impact assessments
(EIA) and corresponding institutions. Regulatory shortcomings include (a) a legal
provision that enables the reversal of decisions made by the Environment Council of
Zambia, and (b) the lack of compliance with and/or enforcement of decisions on the
adaptation or mitigation of industrial, mining or large-scale agriculture operations.
The government has committed to adopting a new Environment Policy and to


                                         42
maintaining a dialogue with the Bank and other PRBS financiers on improved
enforcement of its environmental legislation.


                       F.   RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

Political Risks
140. There are two main sources of Zambia’s political risks: (i) challenges
associated with the ushering in of a new government; and (ii) high public
expectations arising from election-time promises. During the first six months of the
PF government, these risks have materialized in the form of (a) weakly coordinated
policy messages and actions coming from within the government, and (b) frequent
administrative changes that are still continuing, or anticipated, after six months in
office. Continuous administrative changes have affected the functioning of
government machinery.

141. The overall risk of reversing the institutional reforms identified and
monitored by the PRSC program is low, even though the pace of reforms, and
hence of the achievement of development objectives, cannot remain unaffected by the
political risk described above. The risk of reversal of institutional reforms is
particularly low since they have been going on for a few years now and are mature.
At the same time, the disruption caused by the changes in senior staff and continued
re-alignment of ministries, could slow down the pace of reforms.

142.    On macroeconomic policies, the government has adopted the policy
framework and objectives inherited from the previous government but there are
downside risks. The recent IMF Article IV mission confirmed that macroeconomic
framework remains sound and the near-term outlook remains positive. Yet there are
downside risks from global economic uncertainty and domestic policies. The
capacity of the new government to manage the impact of a large external shock, such
as a steep fall in copper prices, is not known and would be tested. The PF
government’s actions such as the reversal of Zamtel privatization and the continued
emphasis on investigating actions of the previous government are straining investor
sentiment and raising concerns about the government’s commitment to privatization.

143.    To manage political risks, IDA, working in close collaboration with other
cooperating partners, including the IMF will strive both at the national and sector
level in favor of continuing the reform program. There is also a frank and open
dialogue being conducted with the political leadership at the highest level aimed at
highlighting the importance of continued reform momentum. IDA has also been
working actively with the civil society to create demand for good governance as
described below.

 Institutional Risks
144. Governance Issues. In Zambia, over the years there had been a steady decline
in the quality of governance, as institutions charged with oversight became weaker,
the public service became politicized with over-centralized decision making and
public administration systems and controls became weaker. In order to address this,


                                       43
successive governments have been implementing reforms addressing the efficiency
and accountability of the public sector, and tackle corruption, but with limited
success. The team feels that there are now new opportunities to work with the new
government as it has placed improving governance institutions and anti corruption at
the core of its programs.

145. The fraudulent activities in the health and roads sectors were a
demonstration of the erosion of administration systems and controls. The Bank is
working in the roads sector, at government’s request, to assist them develop and
implement an integrity plan to address governance weaknesses identified by various
reviews and assessments. In the health sector Government has engaged an
independent fiduciary review agent who is addressing fiduciary concerns and building
capacity in the sector. The bank will continue working with Government on
improving public financial management and building institutions under the public
service management program. The Bank has also instituted a multi sectoral
governance team that works with task teams in addressing governance challenges at
project level.

146. In Zambia, IDA has started, as a pilot approach, activities to improve
accountability of the Government vis-à-vis citizens by supporting demand for
good governance. These activities are essentially aimed at enhancing the capability
of citizens to hold the state and service providers accountable and make them
responsive to the needs of the citizenry. It is expected that such activities could help
improve the efficiency of government interventions, for example by better targeting,
and improve effectiveness of institutions through feedback mechanisms and
monitoring. These improvements would ultimately lead to better development
outcomes. Examples of activities that support demand for good governance include
support to issue-based coalitions, trainings on extractives and procurement,
sensitizations on freedom of information, training workshops on investigative
journalism, and interactive radio programs that improve information dissemination
amongst rural constituents on key policy issues.

147. Implementation Capacity. The prior actions identified in PRSC-3 have been
met. Therefore implementation capacity is likely to be a minor issue as far as the
identified actions themselves are concerned. At the same time broader
implementation capacity could be an issue for sustainability of the broader reform
program in terms of follow-up actions needed to take supported actions to a logical
end. The government has had a weak track record in policy implementation,
specifically in terms of policies linked to public sector reform, the civil service
compensation structure, and budget execution in public finance management. This
risk will be mitigated to a large extent by the activities of ongoing lending and TA
programs in public sector and energy sector. The Bank and other cooperating partners
are also supporting government capacity building in public sector management and
public expenditure management, and in the reform of financial accountability
protocols. The PEMFA program is specifically designed to assist the authorities in
improving institutional capacity and the management of public finances, and has now
been extended by IDA. Several cooperating partners are also implementing reform
programs involving oversight institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General
and the Parliament. Given the continuing progress in institutional strengthening


                                        44
being made under these programs, the risk posed by limited implementation capacity
should not present a constraint on the execution of the PRSC-3 program.

 External shocks
148. Despite significant improvements in Zambia’s fiscal stance, the lasting effects
of the global financial crisis and the economy’s continued reliance on a single
primary-commodity export could threaten Zambia’s growth rate if copper prices were
to fall significantly. Such a situation may come to pass if the continuing sovereign
debt crisis in Europe were to slide into a financial crisis and a large and long-drawn
economic downturn. It is not clear that there will be consensus on how to respond to
such a circumstance and, more importantly, that the political resolve by the
government to tackle difficult issues involved will be present. However, the adequate
size of the country’s international reserves combined with continued flexible
exchange rate policy should allow absorption of the economic shock that such an
event would trigger. The Bank and other donors are helping the government to
diversify the national economy through program support and policy dialogue on
structural reforms. This effort has thus far been successful, as evidenced by an
increase in Zambia’s exports of non-mineral products.
