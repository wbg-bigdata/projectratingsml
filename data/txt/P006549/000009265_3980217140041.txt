Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
Project development objectives are to:
* develop a gas market in South/Southeast Brazil; and
* help create an export alternative for Bolivian gas.
2. Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost breakdown):

working capital.
Total                       2,086                        100%
3. Benefits and target population:
The proposed project and ongoing complementary reform of the energy sector would help diversify energy supply in Brazil
and provide direct economic benefits to the Bolivian economy through increased investment in upstream gas exploration and
production activities. In the case of Bolivia, gas exports to Brazil through the proposed pipeline are expected to reach 25% of total
current exports within eight years. The Brazilian export market for Bolivian gas has also become important because of the expected
termination of the Bolivia-Argentina gas export contract in 1998.
In the case of Brazil, the direct beneficiaries of the project will be the population in South/Southeast Brazil which will reap
health benefits from the substitution of polluting fuels (e.g. high-sulfur fuel oil, wood, etc.) by gas at competitive prices. The gas
would also be used in power generation and thus address the looming power shortages in Brazil. But above all, the project would be
used as a vehicle to address sectoral constraints through private sector investment and participation in the hydrocarbon sector.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Petrobras and YPFB entered into a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in 1993 for the sale of Bolivian gas to Brazil. This has led
to plans for the construction of a gas pipeline from Bolivia to the consumption centers in Brazil.

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Gas would be transported from Bolivia to Brazil by two separate national transport companies: Gas Transboliviano S.A.
(GTB) and Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil S.A. (TBG) who will be the owners of Bolivian and Brazilian sides of
the Pipeline respectively (together known as TransCos).
While GTB currently exists as a subsidiary of Enron and Bolivian pension funds, the new ownership structure will include:
Petrobras, BBP, El Paso Energy, British Gas, Enron/Shell Joint Venture, Bolivian Pension Funds, and Bolt JV.
TBG has been created as a subsidiary of Petrofertil which in turn is a subsidiary of PetrobrAs responsible for gas operations.
Petrofertil plans to reconstitute the company with a 49% private-ownership structure by March 1998. Petrofertil will initially have a
51% stake in the reconstituted company. No later than six months before the end of the construction of the Pipeline, Petrofertil will
submit a plan to the Bank to fumther reduce its participation in the Pipeline to a minority level. With the exception of a 20%
shareholding Ifnked to the YPFB-assigned private sponsors, the rest will be owned by Petrobras, BTB Group, and some private
investors (see below for a complete ownership structure).
Important decisions affecting the project are undertaken by a management board constituted of all sponsors. As a result of
negotiations to mitigate project risks, Petrobras has agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the engineering, design, materials
procurement and construction of the Bolivian side of the Pipeline on behalf of GTB for a fixed price of US$350 million.
Construction of the Brazilian side of the Pipeline will be undertaken through an owner-managed arrangement, pursuant to which
significant components of the engineenng, procurement, and construction will be provided under contracts with various parties. The
Bank loan will support the construction activities on the Brazilian side of the pipeline between Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre.

The project implementation plan provides the proposed TBG organizational structure which was reviewed during Appraisal
for compliance with the Bank's financial and auditing requirements. It was further agreed that implementation of an effective
organizational structure, including appointment of key corporate staff, will be a condition for loan effectiveness.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:
Brazil: Bank/IFC CAS/PSS discussed on June 12, 1997 (Report No. 16582-BR)
Bolivia: CAS discussed on February 8, 1994 (Report No. P-6095-BO)
Brazil CAS objective is to support GOB's strategy of infrastructure development by helping to mobilize private capital for needed
investments, with a secondary emphasis on financing critical infrastructure in areas where market-based funding is not feasible at
this time.
Bolivia CAS objective is to foster Bolivian economic growth by developing the productive and export potential of its most important
natural resources - hydrocarbons, minerals, and land.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Main sector issues are: (i) high investment needed to expand energy supply to meet looming power shortages in Brazil; and
(ii) the limited financial capacity of the sector under its current structure and federal and state ownership. The Government of
Brazil's strategy to meet increasing energy needs in a sustainable manner is to: reform the hydrocarbon sector by introducing
increased competition and private participation; reduce energy waste through efficient supply and use of energy; and diversify its
hydrocarbon fuel sources by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly fuels.
The Government's goal is to increase the participation of natural gas in its primary energy supply from 2% to at least 10%
by 2010. This could have a number of desirable effects which include: (i) amelioration of atmospheric pollution through the
replacement of less clean fuels (e.g fuel oil, wood) in some of the major cities; and (ii) provision of gas supplies to the
South/Southeast industries which currently depend on expensive alternative fuels (e.g. LPG, wood, charcoal) It would also allow the
construction of gas-fired power plants, which Eletrobras considers a key component of its policy to avoid an energy deficit in the
short-term in South/Southeast Brazil. The Project will, through the introduction of a new energy source in the southern states and
increased supply to other southeastern states, enhance the conditions for inter-fuel competition in the near-term and development of
gas to gas competition in the longer-term.
To ensure the long-term sustainability of reforms in the hydrocarbon sector, the Govermnent is in the process of significant
structural changes in the economy. These reforms, which are being implemented mainly through constitutional amendments and
complementary regulations include the following: (i) reformulating the role of the state in the economy; (ii) giving flexibility to
private sector participation in state monopolies; (iii) eliminating restrictions on foreign participation, by establishing clear and
permanent rules; (iv) introducing monetary and fiscal discipline; and (v) reforming the tax system.
The Lawfor Public Concessions already allows majority private participation for gas distribution concessions at State level.
In this respect, the Bank is assisting with the privatization of the gas distribution companies of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Sao
Paulo. The Hydrocarbon Law of August 6, 1997 intends to dismantle the Federal monopoly of Petrobras and further open the sector
to private competition. While this law is an important step forward in establishing a legal framework for private participation in the
hydrocarbon sector, it is not specific on the regulatory aspects. This shortconing could be overcome by the establishment of the
regulatory agency and its procedures. In this respect, the Bank's technical assistance (under an existing loan) would support the
Government's efforts. The recent progress made withfuel price deregulation includes the freeing of downstream distribution of
gasoline, alcohol and LPG, and removal of transport equalization for diesel. The Government expects to extend the fuel price
deregulation to the interior regions of Brazil and has an agenda to bring prices into line with international levels.
A letter of the Government's policy undertakings in the hydrocarbon sector is attached in Annex 12.

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The ongoing reform of the hydrocarbon sector is providing a favorable climate for private participation in the sector. The
specific issues to be addressed by the project would include:
a) design and implementation of a gas sector federal regulatory agency;
b) design of supporting gas sector regulations;
c) design of model concession agreements for gas transmission and distribution; and
d) deregulation of hydrocarbon fuel prices.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection:               El To be defined
A number of project alternatives were considered, including: (a) using gas to produce electricity in Bolivia and bringing it
to the industrial centers of SouthtSoutheast Brazil through a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) line; (b) ending the main trunk-
line from Bolivia in Sao Paulo and building another pipeline from Argentina to provide energy in South Brazil; (c) structuring the
project only for power generation; (d) building a smaller diameter pipeline; and (e) using alternative fuels methods of transporting
gas such as LNG or using LPG. Most of the cases did not meet one of the main developmental objective of the project, namely,
providing an outlet for the Bolivian gas. In other cases, the alternatives proved to be too expensive and benefited a narrow range of
population. After careful comparisons with other options, the current project design was preferred because of its relatively high
economic rate of return and desirable environmental benefits, and smaler increase in capital cost compared to advantages of having
a bigger diameter pipeline.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in proposedproject design:
With the exception of the Yacuiba (Bolivia/Argentina Gas Pipeline Project -0635-BO) and Tunisia (Second Natural Gas
Pipeline Project- 1864-TU) pipelines, constructed 25 and 17 years ago respectively, the Bank has not financed other trans-
national oil or gas pipeline projects in recent history. This is due to considerations such as: risk mitigation between the countries,

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
harmonition of financial parameters, and the need for policy coordination along the whole gas chain. Since the proposed project
will be the Bank Group's first project supporting a trans-national gas pipeline with financial support from private sector sponsors,
public sector, and official creditors, there is no specific experience in Brazil or elsewhere which applies to the proposed project.The
Bank's oil and gas lending strategy recognizes the difficulties in funding and implementing such projects, and has identified them as
highest priority for Bank support. Soundings of the market have unequivocally demonstrated that any private participation in debt
financing is dependent on and takes substantial comfort from direct multilateral participation.
The Bank's experience in gas sector projects in Brazil primarily relates to the Sao Paulo Natural Gas Distribution Project.
This was adversely affected by: (i) serious delays in project implementation due to deficient internal procurement procedures within
COMGAS; (ii) lack of commercial orientation within COMGAS which, together with a freeze of tariffs imposed by the Federal
Government for macroeconomic reasons, resulted in failure to meet the Bank's financial covenants; and (iii) interference from the
State Government. However, procurement problems were solved with the adoption of standard procurement documents and financial
conditions are improving as a consequence of improved efficiency. COMGAS is now preparing for privatization and a large
expansion in its distribution activities. The proposed project is to be managed by a committee formed of both the private and public
sector partners who are all world-renowned oil and gas companies with well-defined commercial objectives. Since the project also
counts on private risk capital and is structured through back-to-back take-or-pay contracts along the gas supply chain, the private
sector partners will not accept delays in project implementation and have sufficient incentive to expedite procurement on a timely
basis. In addition, the project seeks to implement a legal and regulatory framework which will preclude arbitrary interventions by the
Government on fuel pricing in the future.
Other lessons derived from recent energy projects in Brazil, are: (i) linking effectiveness of loans and loan disbursements to
the adoption of macroeconomic or sectoral measures (e.g. financial rehabilitation) has not been effective in past operations in Brazil
and has undermined the credibility of the financial covenants. The approach used in the proposed project is to work in parallel, but
separately, on macroeconomic/sectoral issues and project (pipeline) specific issues. To this end, the Bank is financing technical
assistance activities for the hydrocarbon sector through an existing loan (3376-BR); (ii) successful projects have heavily relied on
strong project management teams with authority to make timely and difficult decisions; and (iii) the commitment of the borrower,
especially in terms of the timely availability of counterpart resources, is a must for successful completion of the project.
The Bank's Public Enterprise Reform Loan for Argentina (PEREL - approved in 1991) was aimed at providing TA to
support the Government's program to privatize most of the country's inefficient public enterprise sector, including oil and gas. The
loan included conditions to implement: (i) fully deregulated prices, with free imports and exports of petroleum products and natural
gas; and (ii) policy making and regulatory agencies to be restructured in a way satisfactory to the Bank. Many features of these
conditions have direct applicability to the proposed project and have been included in the project design. In addition, the PEREL
under-estimated the funds required to finance the sector reform studies, requiring additional funds to be sought. To address this, the
funds currently assigned under loan 3376-BR will be increased depending on the actual cost of the proposed studies.
11. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
The project is govemred by a number of contractual agreements from the production of gas to putting it through the pipeline
and to its final sale to the distribution companies. On the supply side there is a ship-or-pay contract between Petrobras and the
TransCos. which requires Petrobras to purchase gas provided it is tendered. Similarly, on the distribution end, Petrobras has signed
long-term take-or-pay contracts with the state distribution companies. Failure to meet contractual obligations will result in
substantial financial penalties. To ensure timely completion of the pipeline on the Bolivian side, the penalties are specific as to per-
day delays in the completion of the works.
Furthermore, TBG will be initially 49% owned by the private sector. Over the life of the project, the private sector is
expected to increase its participation in the project to become the majority owner. The project, thus, contains strong incentives for
timely completion.
12. Value added of Bank support.
In determining its new lending strategy for the oil and gas sector, the Bank concluded that almost all proposed trans-
national pipeline projects in developing countries have been in a state of flux over the last 5-10 years. Despite their substantial
benefits to exporting and importing countries and the involvement of reputable sponsors, they do not go forward. The main difficulty
is that the perceived risks and complexities increase exponentially when a lumpy investment is physically hooked to the supply in
one country and to the markets in another country. Attracting equity and debt financing would thus require a coincidence of
favorable plitical and economic conditions in two countries, which can be much more difficult to achieve than in one country.

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Development of trans-national projects has thus been concentrated in countries offering more stable conditions, either with
industrialized economies on both sides, or with an industrialized country as an importer which has a track record of good institutions
and pricing policies. The Bank's dialogue with potential investors and financiers clearly shows that projects involving two
developing countries are unlikely to materialize unless strongly supported by the respective Govermments and by global and regional
development banks. This applies especially to the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline since Brazil does not have a history of sound
institutional and pricing policies, nor a gas distribution infrastructure in place. Even if Brazil could have such policies fully in place
tomorrow, the project could not be implemented for a protracted period without multilateral financing.
While IBRD financing in Bolivia is not an option due to its status as IDA country, we are considering this project in its
entirety. The Bank's involvement in Brazil is thus to be seen as the key element of comfort for sponsors and financiers on both sides.
Also, our support strengthens the credibility of Petrobras which is the driving force for both the Bolivian and Brazilian portions. The
private equity partners of the pipeline companies consider the Bank's participation instrumental to ensure that institutional reforms
in the gas sector and downstream are implemented. A pipeline company shareholder agreement is not yet in place and its conclusion
will depend on mobilization of the financing. Continued involvement of the private partners is thus doubtful without the Bank on the
Brazilian side.
Additionally, the Bank has been supporting the reform, and the increase in private-sector participation in the energy sector,
through its country dialogue. The proposed project is an important effort by the Government to attract private capital to the
hydrocarbon sector. The Bank's direct participation in the project will allow the Bank to continue to exercise its leverage to
implement these refornns. This would be through technical assistance linked to the restructuring of the sector (under an existing
loan), and the design and implementation of a rational fuel pricing system which recognizes the environmental costs and benefits of
competing hydrocarbon fuels.
Over a course of 3,150 km distance, the pipeline crosses through more than one hundred municipalities and some sensitive
environmental ecosystems which harbor endangered species. The Bank's participation in the project will ensure that the project
meets the appropriate environmental standards in order to minimize any adverse aspects arising from the project.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the projectfile. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment      1  Cost-Benefit Analysis     I Cost Effectiveness Analysis  E Other [Specify]
(See Annex 4)
Proiect
NPV = US$1,225 Million
@12%
IERR = 21%
Southern Leg:
NPV = US$707 Million
@12%
IERR = 27%
The base case internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the project is estimated at 21%. Project costs include the gas
pipeline from Santa Cruz to Porto Alegre, the compressor stations required to meet the full TCO condition, new gas distribution
systems and consumer conversions. The cost of gas equals the volume under the Transport Quantity (TCQ or up to 18MMcm/d of
ship-or-pay contract between PetrobrAs and the Transcos) at the price specified in the GSA, plus the volume under the Transport
Capacity Option (TCO or up to 6MMcm/d) at a higher price to reflect additional transport costs from Southern Bolivia/Northern
Argentina. Project benefits are based on the net benefits of using natural gas in the various consuming sectors, which takes account of
the cost of alternative fuels displaced by gas, adjusted for efficiency and other cost differentials. Where gas displaces High-sulfur Fuel
Oil (HSFO), an environmental premium is included.
Sensitivity Analysis: The base case economic evaluation is based on up to 80% capacity utilization of the pipeline and a crude
oil price of US$181bbl. Based on these assumptions, the IERR was calculated to be 21% for the pipeline as a whole and 27% for the
southern leg. The project becomes marginal only if (a) capital and operating costs are 70% more than used in the analysis, or (b)

benefits are reduced by 25%.
Fiscal Impact: No taxes will be levied on construction of the pipeline in Brazil. During operations however, TBG will be
fully taxable. Based on current tax rates, the Brazilian Government wiU receive over 20 years taxes from pipeline operations and value
added taxes from gas sales amounting to about US$2,550 million in current or US$670 million in present value terms. Further taxes
wil be paid at the level of state gas distribution companies and end consumers. However, at this point no estimates on the amount of
these additional taxes are available. On the Bolivian side most construction expenses will be exempt from taxes. GTB will be fully
taxable during operations, however. Based on current tax rates, the Bolivian Government would receive about US$180 million in
current or US$40 million in present value terms from the pipeline operations over 20 years. While the tax effects of upstream gas
production activities are expected to be considerably higher, they have not yet been assessed.
14. Fnancial Assessment (see Annex 5):  NPV@1o20/% = 226-1,423 Million (nominal, after-tax)
IFRR= 9.0%/o-14.5% (real, after-tax)
= 12.90/o-18.5% (nominal, after-tax)
The low estimate of the IFRR (internal financial rate of return), based on financial projections for TBG (Annex 5), takes into
account only costs and revenues related to the contractual gas quantities (TCQ), which build up to 18 MMcm/d. The tariff used for the
calculation was the tariff contractually agreed for the TCQ, which will be adjusted by only 0.5% p.a. in nominal terms. The NPV
discount rate was determined by the assumed return of an alternative long-term low-risk investment in Brazil (e.g. Brazilian Dollar-
denominated government bonds). If cash flows linked to additional gas volumes (TCO plus excess capacity-an additional 12
MMcm/d) are taken into account, and tariffs for these volumes are assumed to be unregulated (increasing in line with international
inflation), the IFRR would amount to 18.5% in nominal or 14.5% in real terms. Depending on the additional volumes realized and
tariffs implemented, the IFRRs will be somewhere within that range.
The IFRRs are noticeably lower than the IERRs because they do not capture the environmental benefits of the project and do
not take into account taxes paid by TBG. However, they are considered to be adequate since there is only minimal downside risk for
TBG and the expected equity returns, even purely on the TCQ-basis (18.1% nominal after-tax), have been sufficient to attract private
investment. In addition, also for the TCQ-case, the projections show satisfactory coverage ratios for senior debt, amounting to a
minimum of 1.38:1 in 2002 and an average of 2.84:1 in the base case, with low sensitivity for the major risks the borrower couldbe
facing.
15. Technical Assessment.
The main issue is if gas reserves in Bolivia are sufficient to meet the contractual commitments with Petrobras. Independent
certification has shown that known Bolivia reserves cover about 80% of the 105 bcm needed under the GSA. The risk is mitigated by
the good potential for new discoveries in Bolivia (less than 20% having been explored), where the Bank's records show that if the past
level of exploration is maintained, sufficient reserves could be built up to satisfy the contract. Also, the two private production
companies which resulted from YPFB's capitalization have committed to yearly expenditures of US$70 million each, exceeding
YPFB's past records by two thirds. Petrobras is confident of future discoveries in Northern Argentina from its own exploration
licenses, and has already purchased compressor stations for the pipeline in anticipation of this.
The construction and operation of the pipeline will use standard and well-proven technology and there are no issues. Several
major items have already been the subject of international competitive bidding including the pipes, the construction of the trunkline,
and several major compressor stations. The project cost estimate is therefore considered reliable.
16. InstitionalAssessment:
Hydrocarbon Law: In 1995, Congress approved a constitutional amendment which lays the basis for abolishing the
hydrocarbon monopoly exercised by Petrobris. However, the termination of the monopoly and the implementation of a regulatory
framework for open access required enactment of a new Hydrocarbon Law. This law which includes provision for open access to and a
firm timetable for fuel price deregulation was also enacted on August 6, 1997.
Open Access: The main issues affecting open access (defined as access of any shipper to the pipeline) are: (i) the lack of
provision for open access in the pipeline project agreements and (ii) Petrobras' preferential option in the GSA to purchase gas
supplied at Santa Cruz up to the maximum capacity of the pipeline (30 MMcm/d), which could be used to preclude free access to
others. To address these concerns, the Bank has received a policy letter from the Government agreeing to include in the transport

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - BolMa-Brazil Gas Pipeline
authorization a provision of an obligatory open access beyond the uncommitted capacity.
The Regulatory Framework: The implementation of an autonomous federal regulatory agency with supporting regulations
is essential to ensure that meaningful competition is introduced. The Bank has allocated funds from an existing loan (3376-BR) for
studies to design and implement the regulatory framework, and Terms of Reference have already been prepared and agreed with the
Bank. The Government agreed to present to the Bank not later than December 31, 1998 a proposal for the regulatory framework.
Executing Agencies: The Brazilian section of the Pipeline will be executed by TBG. While TBG will be the borrower of the
loan, the actual implementation will be undertaken jointly by SEGEN (Engineering Department of Petrobras) and the private sector
partners. All sponsors are qualified oil and gas companies with extensive experience in building and operating gas pipelines.
Project Management: The project will be managed by a management committee made up of representatives from all
sponsors and responsible for making important decisions regarding the project and the operation of the pipeline. The details on the
responsibility of the Committee were agreed among the sponsors. SEGEN will be responsible for the construction of the pipeline
project
17. SocialAssessment:
Impacts of construction and maintenance operations on local populations will be minimized by locating camps away from
smaller towns and utilizing local labor. There are several groups of indigenous people, mainly along the Bolivian Pipeline corridor,
who are likely to be impacted by the Project. Even if their territories will not be directly crossed by the Pipeline itself, there could be
indirect impacts by opening up previously inaccessible areas of forest, which would reduce the forest areas for indigenous use. Since
partial clearance of the right-of-way in 1993, no evidence of colonization has been detected, although some has been detected in the
eastern are of the Kaa-Iya National Park (Gran Chaco). Moreover, impacts on indigenous people have been mitigated by the
establishment of the Kaa-Iya National Park, a protected area, and their participation in the public consultation process on the project
has been assured. However, in order to prevent any unexpected issues, an indigenous peoples development plan has been prepared for
both segments, and a community relations program will be implemented under the project. Although the indigenous people in the
Brazilian pipeline area have had many years of contact with other groups of Brazilian society and are integrated into regional life, the
consultation program concluded that an indigenous people's development program was entailed for indigenous groups in Mato Grosso
and Santa Catarina. Minimization of the effects on those inhabitants will be assured by review of additional access roads needed and
their impact. No resettlement is envisaged along the pipeline alignment.
1& EnvironmentalAssessment:                   Environmental Category:      3 A          [l B           El C
A full Enviromnental Assessment was prepared for the entire length of the pipeline. Although separate EAs were prepared
under different environmental institutional frameworks, an integrated EA report was produced thus guaranteeing that the same
environmental and social impact analysis criteria were applied to both Brazilian and Bolivian segments of the pipeline.
Environmental licensing processes have been completed in both countries as well as in the Brazilian States crossed by the pipeline.
All studies have been either carried out or updated as necessary following Bank's environmental and social policies and guidelines.
Enmironmental benefits of the project include improved air quality due to the use of clean burning natural gas in Brazil, increased
employment opportunities in both countries and increased public revenues for Bolivia.
Perhaps the main environmental mitigation measure for the entire project has been a careful selection of the pipeline
comdor. Environmental considerations have played a key role in defining the right-of-way in both countries. After the primary
objective of transporting natural gas from the supply sources to market demand centers had been established, the pipeline route was
laid out based upon envirownental sensitivity mapping. The route was further refined based upon environmental conditions identified
through field work. Ecologically sensitive areas and areas of high population density were avoided to the extent possible in both
countries. For instance, the route avoided the Canon de la Victoria area in Bolivia. Also, the crossing of the Pantanal area in Brazil,
where the alignment was deviated to the south following the existing highway through previously impacted ranching and agricultural
areas, resulted in a longer and hence more costly route.
Direct and indirect impacts were identified and analyzed and appropriate mitigation and compensation measures have been
proposed and included in project planning and costs. In Bolivia, for instance, the project sponsors will make a direct contribution to
CABI (the legally constituted entity to represent the Izozog communities and administer the Kaa-Iya Park) and revenues from this
contribution will be earmarked for the management of parks in the Santa Cruz Department, primarily the Kaa-Iya national Park.

Construction impacts to terrestrial and wetland/aquatic plant and animal species identified as species of special concern are
expected to be minimal and temporary. Temporary displacement of some species from the construction area will occur, and the
movement of some species across the right-of-way will be hampered during construction activities. Another major issue identified was
the impact of camp location and construction crew behavior on small rural and indigenous communities, specially on the Bolivian
segment of the pipeline. An Environmental Construction Plan describing basic environmental construction techniques for the project
has been developed. This plan includes pre-construction planning and environmental construction methods; erosion and
sedimentation control practices, restoration and revegetation; specialized construction methods including waterbody and wetland
crossing procedures and site specific construction methods for environmentally sensitive areas; measures to prevent, contain and
control spills; criteria for camp location and management, and worker behavior norms (hunting, fishing, controlled access to wildlife
areas, etc.).
An indigenous peoples' development plan was prepared for the Bolivian segment of the pipeline. Under this plan, indigenous
land titling programs will be financed for groups in the area of influence of the project. The plan also includes natural resource
management and education programs. A similar, yet much simpler plan is being developed (and will be available prior to loan
effectiveness)for the Brazilian side targeting indigenous peoples groups in the states of Mato Grosso and Santa Catarina.
Increased and accelerated gas exploration in Bolivia may lead to upstream impacts in ecologically and culturally sensitive
areas in the country. A Strategic EA analyzed upstream and downstream impacts of gas development and transport and their
cumulative impacts vis-a-vis other development projects in the Bolivia-Brazil region. A regional environmental EA, including an
environmental management plan for gas development activities in the most critical gas development area in Bolivia will be
undertaken in the context of the project. This activity will complement Bank-financed programs for the development of environmental
regulations for gas and oil activities in sensitive areas. The Bolivian Government has committed to implement regional environmental
management programs in critical areas.
A comprehensive Environmental Management Plan has been developed for the entire pipeline. Environmental management
and control during project implementation will be guaranteed through: (i) an independent environmental supervision and monitoring
firm that will ensure compliance with all construction related mitigatory measures; (ii) an environmental unit within the supervision
firm organization that will coordinate all ecological and social compensation program; and (iii) an independent environmental
auditing team that will report directly to project sponsors and multilateral organizations. All these activities have been provided with
the necessaxy budget and resources.
The project's EA report was sent to the Bank and reviewed by the then existing Latin America Region Environment Division
(LATEN). A copy of the EA reports has been placed in the Bank's Public Information Center. The reports are available to interested
parties in both countries in addition to the extensive community consultation and public hearings that have been carried out. An
executive EA summary in English has been prepared and was distributed to the Board on November 18, 1997 (the full EA was sent to
the PIC before project Appraisal). The EAIA reports are also available on the Internet An Environmental Committee with
representatives from the World Bank, IDB, and CAF has worked closely with the government agencies throughout the preparation of
the extensive environmental work that has been carried out for this project.

20. Sustainabiiy
Technically and economically, sustainability of the project's benefits depends on successful gas exploration in Bolivia, and on
implementation of the energy sector reforms in Brazil which will ensure market entry for gas. Socially and environmentally, the
project will be sustainable if during construction and operation environmental rules and regulations of both countries are adhered to,
international good practice is followed, and the environmental and social measures are implemented as included in the project.

scenario, different options will need to be evaluated to
cover the financial gap, including new multilateral
lending in support of the project.

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
No external controversial aspects are foreseen at this time of project preparation. There are, however, concerns within the
Bank Group whether the Bank should be at all involved with the construction of the Pipeline, or should it be done entirely in the
private sector using commercial financing
There are basically only two financing structures which can be considered for this operation:
a) A project financing structure (limited recourse) where all the financing is provided by the private sector;
b) Sovereign guaranteed debt from multilateral/bilateral sources with some equity participation from private
sector.
Even if it were possible to restructure the project and use a project finance structure, it would raise the following issues:
*  Restructuring would require more time ( at a minimum two years) to mobilize financing than available under
the current schedule.
* Private commercial financing would be of shorter duration and more expensive, thereby requiring a higher city
gate gas price.
* Under the project finance structure the Brazilian Government/Petrobras would have to underwrite the sovereign
risks including some nsks in Bolivia as well as the demand risk. The benefit to the Government in terms of risk
sharing will therefore be very limited.
* Any change in structure would require a commitment from the Brazilian Government and the private partners
to restructure the transaction, backed by commensurate resources. The current equity investors would need to
take lot more risk than under the current structure.
In view of the above, the current financing plan for the Brazilian portion is based on the second structure. Moreover, because
of the long gestation and low revenue in the initial build up period, the project would need multilateral debt which has substantially
longer tenor than the bilateral debt.

Bnmil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
The Project comprises a 32-inch gas pipeline from Rio Grande in Bolivia to Sao Paulo in
Brazil, continuing with a smaller diameter southern leg (24 to 16 in.) to Porto Alegre. The
pipeline is 3,150 km in total, of which 2,593 km is in Brazilian territory. The total investments in
the pipeline, including financial costs but excluding phased compression costs, are estimated at
about US$2.1 billion of which about US$1.6 billion would be in Brazil. The capacity of the
pipeline will be 30MMcm/d which compares with a gas supply ceiling of 16MMcm/d specified in
the gas import agreement with Bolivia. Gas would be transported from Bolivia to Brazil by two
separate national transport companies with participation from all sponsors. Petrobris' ship-or-pay
agreement with the transport companies is for up to 18MMcm/d (Transport Contract Quantity -
TCQ). The project sponsors have agreed to proceed with the larger capacity pipeline on the
likelihood that larger supplies will become available at a favorable incremental cost. The
Transport Capacity Option (TCO) related to part of the extra-capacity of the pipeline beyond
TCQ up to the amount of 6MMcmd/d was purchased by Petrobras at a cost of US$383 million.
Project Component 1 - US$436 million
This component is related to the cost of developing and constructing the project on the
Bolivian side. Petrobris has won a turnkey contract for the construction of the Bolivian
portion of the 557 km pipeline from Rio Grande in Bolivia to the Bolivian Border near
Corumba in Brazil at a cost of US$350. Other costs under this component include
'working capital, interest during construction, development, and management costs. This
component will not be financed under the Bank loan.
Project Component 2 - US$1,421 million
This component support the construction of the main trunkline from Corumba to Sao
Paulo (Campinas), continuing with a smaller diameter southern leg to Porto Alegre and
lateral line between Campinas and Guararema. The cost of the component includes:
construction cost of the main trunk-line and the southern leg, construction of one
compression station at Penapolis, procurement of pipe, valves, fittings, and installation of
telecommunication and SCADA system The Bank loan will finance the construction cost
of the southern leg.
Project Component 3 - US$229 million
This component includes all the soft costs related to the Brazilian section of the pipeline
which include: interest during construction, development and management costs, debt
service reserve fund, and working capital.

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 4
Economic Evaluation
A. Background
1.     A cost-benefit analysis is presented which evaluates the economic benefit to Brazil of the
proposed project. Project benefits are estimated by calculating the net benefit of using gas (the
netback value) based on the cost of alternative fuels displaced and adjusted for efficiency and
other cost differentials, plus an environmental premium where natural gas displaces more polluting
fuels. Where alternative fuels are tradable, benefits are based on the border prices plus internal
transportation costs. Project costs include the cost of gas supply at the inlet of the pipeline in
Bolivia, the investment and operating costs of the pipeline, the costs of gas new gas distribution
systems in Brazil, and the cost of converting existing consumers of alternative fuels to natural gas.
All costs exclude taxes, duties and financial costs. The distortions in the exchange rate and the
significance of wage rates in the overall costs are not deemed sufficient to justify the use of
shadow prices.
2.    Both the cost of gas supply, and the value of gas in the market, are defined at the point of
the City Gate, according to the following relationships in terms of US$/MMbtu:
Cost of Gas       =  Gas Cost (Bolivian Contract) + Cost of Pipeline
Transportation
Gas Netback       =  Value Fuels Displaced - Conversion Cost - Distribution
Value                 Cost
The Gas Netback Value at the City Gate is calculated as the discounted value of the fuels
displaced by natural gas, less the cost of converting existing installations to natural gas, less the
cost of gas distribution.
3.    The evaluation calculates the internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the project in its
entirety and the net present value (NPV) of the benefits assuming an opportunity cost of capital of
12%. Also, the IERR's for the project in its main component parts are calculated which comprise:
(i) the trunkline from Santa Cruz to Campinas (Sao Paulo) and, (ii) the southern leg from
Campinas to Porto Alegre viewed as a marginal project. Sensitivity analyses are included to show
how the economic viability of the project would be affected by variations in project benefits,
availability of gas supply, cost overruns and delays in project implementation.
B. Proiect Alternatives
4.    The following alternatives to the project were considered:
(i) No Importation of Gas: This represents a scenario of increasing reliance on
imported petroleum fuels. Currently, Brazil is large importer of diesel and LPG. Fuel
oil is more or less in balance, with about I million tons/y exported. Since 1994, there



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Poeg 22
Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 4
has been an increase in the consumption of natural gas by 33%, LPG and diesel by
20%, and of fuel oil by 11%. Petrobras' refinery strategy is driven by the growing
demand for diesel oil and LPG, and is implementing a refinery upgrading program to
convert heavy residual oils to the lighter products (which reduces the availability of
fuel oils). The growth in demand for these fuels is expected to continue, boosted by
the demand for thermal power generation (see below). Gas importation will displace
LPG and take up growth in the demand for fuel oil, which could remain as small
exportable surplus or become deficit if used for therrnal power generation. Imported
gas will also displace fuelwood and some charcoal. Since the delivered economic
cost of Bolivian gas is less than the economic cost of alternative fuels, the do nothing
alternative can be rejected.
(ii) Pipelinefrom Yacuiba (Bolivia) to Campinas via Paraguay: This so-called
southern route was studied early on by Petrobras and rejected in favor of the
northern route from Santa Cruz to Campinas, on grounds of higher cost (by US$200
million), and the complexities of involving three countries rather than two.
(iii) Pipeline from Uruguaiana to Parana (Curitiba): This represents an alternative
project to the Southern Leg. Petrobras intends to acquire 2 MMcmld gas from YPF
to supply a new power plant at Uruguaiana (at the border with Brazil). The project
requires a new 400 km gas supply pipeline linking into the existing transmission
system north of Buenos Aires. The source of gas is the Cuenca de Neuquen located
some 1000 km from Uruguaiana, and the gas will be transported to Uruguaiana using
the existing Argentinian transmission system and the new supply line. There is only
spare capacity in the Argentinian system during the summer, and the power plant will
be supplied on a seasonal basis. An extension of the project to supply 6 MMcm/d to
the three states on the southern leg would require over 1000 km of new transmission
and compression reinforcements from Neuquen to Buenos Aires, and to Urugaiana,
plus a new 580 km pipeline with compression from Uruguiana to Porto Alegre.
Comparison of the investment and operating costs shows this scheme would result in
a higher gas price to the Southern Leg than the current project. For similar reasons,
an extension of the project to supply 2 MMcm/d to Porto Alegre only is rejected.
(iv) High Power Alternative on the Trunkline: This assumes that the gas designated for
the Southern Leg under the base case economic analysis would instead be used for
new gas fueled power generation in Sao Paulo, and therefore represents an
alternative project to the Southern Leg. The economic base case already assumes
1,350 MW of gas fueled power generation will be constructed on the trunkline to
accept gas transported under the TCO, and the diversion of all the gas from the
Southern Leg would require a further 2,500 MW to be constructed in Sao Paulo. It
is expected that most of this additional capacity would need to operate in
complementarity to hydropower to avoid spilling water, which would necessitate the
development of an equivalent secondary industrial market in Sao Paulo. However,
the development of a dedicated secondary market of such large size (9.5 MMcm/d)
in Sao Paulo is not considered feasible.

Annex 4
(v) Importation of LNG to Santos: There is currently insufficient international spare
LNG capacity to supply the proposed gas sector expansion in Brazil. In spite of this,
an LNG reference price regasified on the Brazilian coast of about US$3.5/MMbtu
could be expected, which would not be competitive with the city gate price of
Bolivian gas.
(vi) Power Generation in Bolivian with Power Export to Brazil: This would require the
construction of a gas pipeline from Santa Cruz to the border with Brazil, to transport
the base case volumes to some 6000 MW of new generation capacity. The power
would then be exported to Sao Paulo with multiple 750 KV electrical transmission
lines. Order of magnitude estimates show that investment cost for this concept would
be US$2.5 billion, compared to the cost of the trunldine to Sao Paulo under the
current project of about US$1.4 billion, which indicates the transporting energy by
pipeline is the lower cost option. Irrespective of this, such power plants would need
to be base loaded (there is no secondary market for gas in Bolivia), which would
require large spillage of water under favorable hydrological conditions in Brazil,
without meeting the requirements of the industrial sector for an environmentally
clean fuel which is price competitive with existing fuels.
(vii) A Gas Pipeline from N. W Argentina to S-SE Brazil: This would start from the gas
fields of N.W. Argentina and extend through the North Eastern part of Argentina to
the S-SE states of Brazil. The concept would rely on the development of existing
fields and future discoveries in N.W. Argentina, and require the development of new
gas markets in the N.E. provinces of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. It would not
meet the developmental objective to fully exploit Bolivian reserves, and is considered
a possible future complementary supply source for S-SE Brazil rather than a direct
alternative to the current project.
C. Gas SUPDIy and Demand
5.    Gas Demand in S-SE Brazil: Bolivian gas will be supplied to Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao
Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, primarily for industrial use and power
generation. The potential market for gas is shown in Table 1, together with the market in Rio de
lJaneiro and Minas Gerais', since together these seven states form an interconnected gas market in
S-SE Brazil.
6.    The potential market for each of the five states is based on recent market surveys within
areas located close to the proposed pipeline, and includes only those fuels which can be
technically substituted by gas (e.g., fuel oils, LPG, fuelwood, manufactured gas). Gas will also be
consumed in relatively small quantities as a transport fuel and in commercial uses. Fuels with a
IIncluded are the markets currently supplied with domestic gas in Sao Paulo (3MMcm/d) and Rio (3.8MMcm/d).



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 24

Annex 4
very low economic cost (e.g., bagasse) are excluded, and a growth in energy demand of 3-4%.
p.a. is assumed. Market penetration in the industrial sector will be largely determined by the rate
at which new gas distribution networks can be constructed and consumers hooked up. The
realizable demand for industry is taken as the gas volumes which the states have committed to
absorb under the take or pay contracts already signed with Petrobras, and which accounts for
14.3 MMcm/d (Attachment 1).
7.    With respect to power generation, a recent joint study by the Bank and Eletrobras shows
that 3,600 MW of gas fueled power generation can be economically inserted into the S-SE power
system by 2005, but much of this would operate in complementarity to hydropower. However,
the realizable demand for gas in power generation is constrained by the rate at which independent
power plants (IPP's) can be brought on stream, and demand forecasts are thus based on a number
of specific projects currently under development. These include three plants to be developed on
the trunkline (Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo) under an agreement between
Petrobras, Eletrobras and BNDES, for capacity totaling 1,350 MW. These will be supplied under
the TCO and consume up 6 MMcm/d natural gas, with first units onstream by 1999 and full
capacity assumed by 2004. Several other projects are under development by private consortia and
900MW of these are assumed implemented by 2004, utilizing transport capacity under the TCQ
(up to 3.5 MMcm/d). The total realizable demand for gas in power generation is therefore
estimated at 9.5 MMcm/d.
8.    Gas Supply includes domestic production and gas supplied through the import pipeline.
Domestic production from known fields includes free gas from Santos (Merluza) and associated
gas from Campos. Excluding gas from new discoveries, this is expected to reach about
13 MMcm/d by 2005.
9.    The Gas Sale Agreement between YPFB and Petrobras specifies a gas volume of
8 MMcm/d initially and increasing linearly to 16 MMcm/d by the eighth year of operation, and
remaining at that level for the 20-year duration of the contract. This represents a commitment to
deliver 105 bcm. Certified reserves in Bolivia indicate that, taking account of Bolivia's own
requirements, about 82 bcm would be available for export to Brazil from proven, probable and
possible (risked) reserves. The known reserves are located in the area between Santa Cruz and the
Argentine border and are sufficient to fulfill the contracted deliveries for at least the first 10-12
years of the contract with a shortfall of about 20 bcm thereafter.
10.   The potential for new discoveries in the Bolivian Sub-Andean are estimated at 160 bcm,
and development of a typical new discovery (45 bcm) within a ten year time-frame would
effectively eliminate the shortfall noted above. The capitalization of YPFB commits the private
sector to invest substantially in exploration and production in Bolivia, and the risk that the
additional gas will not be discovered and developed is considered slight.
11.   Gas supply under the TCQ would increase the utilization of the pipeline to 18.3 MMcm/d
and under the TCO to 24 MMcm/d. The additional gas is expected to come from North-Western
Argentina and cost around 25% more due to the incremental transport costs to Santa Cruz.

Annex 4
Petrobras expects to secure additional volumes from North-Western Argentina from its own and
other exploration interests and has already purchased compressor units in readiness for this.
12.   Considering the total reserves in existing fields (about 79 bcm), plus the development of
discoveries already under appraisal (about 121 bcm), would allow gas availability to meet the
TCO condition for at least 12 years allowing for internal consumption in Argentina. The initial
supply availability of Northern Argentine exports for Brazil is dependent on the market for the gas
and the intensity of the development to produce the gas. For the base case, the supply under the
TCO is assumed to commence at 3 MMcm/d in 1999, reaching 6 MMcm/d by 2004, which brings
the total gas supply to 37 MMcrn/d over the planning horizon.

D. Economic Benefits
13.   The economic benefits to the project are calculated through the net benefit (netback
values) of fuels displaced by natural gas in industry, and for gas is use in power generation.

Annex 4
Industry
14.   Economic Cost of Fuels: For industry, the most important fuels in terms of volume
displaced by natural gas are fuel oils, fuelwood and LPG, with a lesser contribution from other
fuels such as charcoal which is used to make manufactured gas for the ceramics industry.
Relatively small amounts diesel (used by industry and as a transport fuel) and electricity (used in
firnaces) will also be displaced.
15.   The economic cost of fuel oils, LPG and other tradable petroleum products are calculated
from border prices plus inland transportation costs. Border prices are based on fob USGC prices
plus sea freight to Santos (or the closest port to the market), insurance, port unloading and losses.
Inland transport and in-city distribution costs are added to give the economic cost at the factory
gate, with all taxes and duties excluded. Based on an international crude oil price of US$18/bbl,
the economic costs delivered to the industrial consumer in Sao Paulo is estimated at
US$3. lIMMbtu for HSFO (3.5% Sulfur), US$3.4/MMbtu for LSFO (1% Sulfur), and about
US$7/MMbtu for LPG. For fuelwood, economic costs are based on estimates of the cost of land,
stumpage, logging, transport and handling in Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. A
benchmark economic cost for fuelwood is estimated at US$4.5/NCMbtu. This compares to official
prices of about US$3.6/MMbtu in Sao Paulo and Parana (although actual prices may vary), and
the economic evaluation uses this price as a conservative estimate of the economic cost.
16.   Natural Gas Netback Values in Industry: The gas netback values are estimated at the
point of city gate, using the delivered economic costs of the fuels displaced. This takes account of
differences in the net heat content and thermal efficiencies between natural gas and the competing
fuel. Where natural gas displaces fuel oil, a convenience premium (US$0.2/MMbtu) is included to
reflect the avoided costs of fuel oil storage and handling. In the case of HSFO, a premium
(US$0.3Mlbtu) is also included which is equivalent to the international price differential
between HSFO(3.5%) and LSFO(1%) over the last decade. This sets the value of gas on par with
LSFO which is considered the major industrial competing fuel within mature gas industries of
developed countries, and the premium is considered a proxy to reflect the environmental benefits
of gas over HSFO. The premium is considered conservative with respect to reducing sulfur levels
at the refinery level, or at the end consumer level, and results in a city gate netback2 value of
US$3.24/MMbtu where gas displaces HSFO.
17.   The ceramics industries in Santa Catarina represent high value markets for natural gas.
During the last three years, many of the ceramics industries have switched to LPG, instead of
manufacturing their own gas from charcoal or coal feedstock. Where LPG or manufactured gas is
used, the opportunity cost of natural gas in substitution is set at the economic cost of LPG,
resulting in a city gate gas netback value of US$5.5/MMbtu.
18.   The Competitivity of Natural Gas on the Trunkline and the Southern Leg; The
economic evaluation uses the following city gate netback values for gas use in industry in the five

states, expressed in terms of lower heating values: Mato Grosso do Sul (US3 .36/MMbtu), Sao
Paulo (US$3.541MMbtu), Parana (US$3.991MMbtu), Santa Catarina (US$4. 16/MMbtu) and Rio
Grande do Sul (US$3.67/MMbtu). These are derived from a weighted average of the competing
fuels to be substituted by gas and include the premia described above. The elasticity of industrial
gas demand to price is shown in Attachment 2.
Power Generation
19.   The 1,350 MW gas-fueled power plants noted earlier are expected to operate at or close
to base load. For these, the value of gas is calculated assuming combined cycle plant with small
turbines (about 150 MW) with investment cost excluding taxes, with continuous operation at 75%
load. The economic benefits reflect the marginal cost for generation expansion in the S-SE Brazil
(US$40/MWh), which results in a city gate netback value of US$3 .4/MMbtu.
20.   Other plants are expected to operate in complementarity to hydropower. Over the next
five years the risk of deficit in the S-SE is substantially higher than the 5% planning level used by
Eletrobras, and the system dispatch would permit gas fueled plants to operate at load factors
typically 75%. Five to ten years out, the plants could be economically dispatched at average load
factors closer to 60%.
21.   However, the operational load factor in any single year is unpredictable. If the plant
operates at low load factor, the generators will have to pay the full firm cost of gas as though
operating at high load factor (comprising the reserved pipeline capacity charge plus the gas
commodity charge), and divert the excess gas to secondary industrial markets when the plants are
turned down. As such, the gas demand for these plants should be taken as if they were operating
at base load. The insertion of such a plant will upgrade a block of secondary energy (assumed to
be worth US$5/MWh) to firm energy (valued at US$40/IWh), equivalent to the capacity of the
inserted plant no matter what load factor the plant actually operates. This serves to increase the
value of gas substantially when used in this way. Where excess gas is diverted to the industrial
market, it will likely displace high sulfur fuel oils and be sold at a discount to the price of firm gas
to reflect its unpredictable supply characteristics. As such the value of gas in these industrial
applications excludes a convenience premium and will only require inclusion of a marginal cost for
gas distribution expansion. Here the weighted average gas netback value (power and industry) is
estimated at US$4.4/MMbtu for operation of the power plant at 60% load factor and this value
was used for the economic evaluation.
E. Costs
22.   The project investment costs are summarized in Table 2 The major items of line-pipe for
the entire project and construction works for the trunkline have already been subject to
international competitive bidding and their cost is known with accuracy. The cost of compressor
stations reflects the requirement to meet the TCO flow condition, and includes two stations
between Santa Cruz and Corumba, five stations between Corumba and Campinas, and three
stations on the Southern Leg.

commencing at US$1. I/MMbtu with price increasing in line with the GSA, (b) TCO volumes of
gas from Southern Bolivia or Northern Argentina at US$1.45/MMbtu at Santa Cruz, (c) the
capital cost of the 32 inch trunkline plus the southern leg including contingency, (d) the cost of
the Campinas-Guararema pipeline (US$61.7 million), and (e) the necessary compressor stations to
meet the TCO condition (US$192 million). New gas distribution systems plus the costs of
converting existing consumers to gas are estimated at US$0.65fMMbtu.
27.   Project Benefits are estimated using the net benefit of natural gas according to volumes
specified in the gas supply agreements between Petrobras and the five states. Industrial use
accounts for 14.8 MMcm/d of gas supplied under the TCQ, with power generation accounting for
the remaining 3.6 MMcm/d of the TCQ plus the TCO volumes. Where gas displaces High Sulfur
Fuel Oil, environmental and convenience premia are added.

Entire Project IERR = 21%
NPV (at 12% discount rate) = US$1.23 billion
The Trunkline from Santa Cruz to CamDinas:
28.   The base case for the trunkline uses 8.6 MMcm/d contracted for Mato Grosso do Sul and
Sao Paulo, plus 6 MMcm/d for power generation supplied under the TCO.
29.   A 10% reduction in the cost of the trunkline is assumed to reflect the marginal cost of
transportation capacity assigned to the southern leg, with compressor station investment and
operating costs reduced accordingly.
Trunkline IERR   =   17%
NPV (at 12% discount rate) = US$0.48 billion
The Southern Lee from Campinas to Porto Alezire:
30.   The base case for the southern leg uses 6.2 MMcm/d contracted for the three southern
states, plus a build up of gas consumption for power generation rising to 3.5 MMcm/d by 2007,
and operating in complementarity to hydropower.
31.   The southern markets are viewed as essential to assure early absorption of the gas
volumes already contracted with Bolivia, and the costs include the marginal cost of gas transport
through the trunkline, plus the full costs of the southern leg.
Southern Leg IERR = 27%
NPV (at 12% discount rate)  =  US$0.75 billion
Sensitivity Analyses
32.   The sensitivity of the project's economic viability to variations in the major assumptions
are summarized below:
33.   Shorfall in Gas Supply: The loss of TCO gas from the base case (and any corresponding
TCO gas purchase commitments by Petrobras) reduces the IERR of the entire project from 21%
to 17%, which then represents the IERR for the TCQ case. The GSA with YPFB requires the
delivery of 105 bcm over 20 years, of which an estimated 80 bcm will come from proven,
probable and possible (risked) reserves. Assuming just the 80 bcm can be delivered to fill the early
year requirements of the TCQ (which requires 115 bcm in total), the IERR falls only a further
point since the major shortfall is assumed during the final few years.
34.   Lower than Expected Demand: The loss of the TCO power generation market reduces
the IERR of the entire project to 17%. In their gas supply contracts with Petrobris, the states
have agreed take or pay conditions starting at 55% in year one and increasing to 90% by year six.

Annex 4
An across the board reduction in demand under the TCQ (and corresponding gas purchase
commitments by Petrobras) equivalent to these minimum take percentages further decreases the
IERRto 14%.
35.   Fall in Crude Oil Prices: The base case economic analysis uses an international crude oil
price of US$18/bbl, which is close to the current level and consistent with the Bank's long term
forecast. The IERR for the project is quite robust to changes in crude oil prices, buffered by the
market for gas power generation the substitution of those fuels which are not affected by the price
of crude.
36.   Delay in Project Implementation: A delay in implementing the entire project by two
years results in a decrease in NPV of about US$0.2 billion at the discount rate considered. The
timely implementation of the southern leg and associated gas distribution systems are necessary to
ensure that Petrobras' contractual commitments to take Bolivian gas can be met, and that the gas
can be onsold in the market. A delay in the construction of the southern leg is unlikely to result in
a big increase in realizable demand within the industrial sector of Sao Paulo, since this would be
determined by the rate of construction of distribution networks. If the trunkline is implemented on
time, and the southern leg delayed by two years, the NPV of the southern leg is decreased by US$
0.12 billion at the discount rate considered.
Switchine Values
37.   Switching values were determined to assess the impacts on the economic viability caused
by variations in the main inputs. It is concluded that the project will become marginal
(IERR=1 2%) only if: (a) capital and operating costs are 70% more than used in the analysis, (b)
benefits are reduced by 25% with respect to the values used in the base case.

Sensitivity of Industrial Gas Demand to Price
The industrial gas demand (as aggregated over the five states) drops substantially as the
gas price exceeds US$2.4/MMbtu as shown below. The main reason for the drop is that natural
gas is likely to lose its competitiveness above this level.

City Gate Gas Price (US$/MMBTU)
The Government of Brazil has adopted a policy of uniform price (US$2.7/MMbtu) for all
city gates along the pipeline, up to the volumes of Bolivian gas agreed in the GSA. At this price,
natural gas is competitive with LPG diesel oil, charcoal, fuelwood and LSFO over the trunkdine
and the southern leg. For HSFO, the price competitivity is tighter. However, market surveys in
Sao Paulo show that consumers are willing to pay up to 15% more for natural gas for its
convenience in use over fuel oil and where environmental regulations are enforced. If this is taken
into account, there is a shift in the above demand curve to the right which allows the capture of
HSFO at US$2.71MMbtu. The inclusion of such premia sets the value of gas more on par with
LSFO, which is considered the main competing fuel within the industrial sector of mature gas
industries in developed countries. It is expected that increasing environmental pressures in Brazil
will tend to influence consumer choice towards using natural gas or LSFO rather than HSFO. The
economic costs (and prices) of HSFO in Sao Paulo and over the southern leg are close
(notwithstanding variations in internal transport costs), which means that natural gas would be
very competitive with HSFO in these locations with the premia internalized. If the southern leg is
viewed as a marginal project, the cost of gas transport to the southern states can be assigned as
the sum of the marginal transport cost over the trunkline plus the full cost over the southern leg.
In this case, although the resulting transport costs and therefore the city gate prices of natural gas
would be similar, they would not be exactly equalized.

L     Proiect Financing Issues
1.    Introduction
1.    The World Bank Group's involvement will be the key to mobilization of debt financing
and thus implementation of the project, since a suitable commercial financing solution would not
be feasible in the near future. This is principally due to the project's size and complexity, lenders'
country risk considerations, the project's cross-border nature, its long gestation period, the
novelty of the regulatory framework in Bolivia, the uncertain timing of scheduled deregulation in
Brazil, and a lower degree of proven gas reserves and confirmed gas demand than generally
required by commercial lenders.

Annex 5
2.    Private Debt Financing
2.     The key obstacles to private debt financing can be demonstrated by a brief review of two
principal financing vehicles:
1) Corporate loans raised separately by the sponsors on their own account would not be
compatible with normal business practice and balance sheet policies of private sector
companies under the given conditions. Based on financial and risk management
considerations relating to a project of this size and complexity, private sponsors will
seek a limited-recourse solution which allows mobilization of debt financing on
account of the project, requires only limited sponsor support, and restricts the impact
on the sponsors' balance sheets essentially to their equity contributions.
2) A completely private limited-recourse financing package would under current market
conditions not be available for this project, primarily because: (i) the required
maturities of at least 15 years are far beyond what external commercial lenders have
been willing to accept for Brazil, let alone for Bolivia, due to country risk restrictions;
(ii) even for shorter maturities (8-10 years) of Brazilian exposure, which are in
principle feasible, external financial markets require excellent corporate quality of the
borrower and are generally not willing to accept the credit risks of a new project
company without substantial recourse to the sponsors; (iii) Brazilian financial markets
have neither the experience nor the depth to provide the necessary amounts and
maturities needed to fund the whole investment; (iv) the Brazilian energy markets are
not yet sufficiently deregulated and the gas market not enough developed to pennit
debt providers at this point a reliable assessment of the market prospects; (v) while
Bolivia's gas potential is substantial, the current level of proven reserves would not be
considered adequate by commercial lenders to enter into long-term financing
commitments; and (vi) recent experience shows that mobilization of debt finance is
particularly difficult for transnational gas pipelines. Indeed, the Bank's new oil and gas
lending strategy recognizes such difficulties as serious constraints and, accordingly,
specifies transnational gas pipelines as the area of highest priority for Bank financial
support.
3.    Even if-  despite the project-and country-specific obstacles mentioned above -  a
market-based private financing package could be secured, it would under the current
circumstances' not be suitable for this project. We have simulated the consequences of such a
financing structure, assuming a 10-year final maturity and interest rates approximately at levels
required for good-quality Brazilian corporate borrowing (10-year treasury + 350bp), not taking
into account any premium for project risk. The calculation shows that under these assumptions
the equity returns of the sponsors would decrease from around 18% to 15% (nominal) and would
thus make the project marginal for private participation. More seriously, however, as a result of
I The following assessment is based on the situation before the serious deterioration of emerging financial markets
in October 1997. The comparative margins at the time of this report would be substantially - at least 50% - higher.
However, it is unlikely that commercial debt for the required amount could be raised at all.

Annex 5
the short maturity, the project would not be in a position to fully service its debt until 2004 and
would thus require additional equity contributions from the sponsors in the early years, leading to
an altogether lower financial leverage. This, however, would further reduce the equity returns,
and thus the project's attractiveness for private investment.
4.    In order to maintain debt service coverage in the early years and preserve attractive equity
returns under these financing conditions, the transport tariff would have to rise by at least
US$0.20 pushing gas sales prices up to US$2.90/MMbtu and thus beyond the current competitive
limit of US$2.70/MMbtu. Although the transport tariff could be reduced again, when the debt
service levels off, the impact of this structure would counteract the basic objective of the project
by impeding the introduction of gas into the market. This bias would be further compounded by
the fact that gas is competing with fuels (mainly high sulfur fuel oil) whose tariffs do not yet fully
reflect their environmental costs.
5.    An alternative to a private financing structure might be fully Government-guaranteed loans
or bonds raised on international capital markets. While Brazilian Government and Petrobras
(which is seen in the markets as equivalent to sovereign risk) have recently successfully tapped the
international bond market, only the last sovereign issue of US$ 3 billion (June 1997) had a
maturity beyond 10 years and of that amount about US$ 2 billion represented refinancing of
existing bonds. Given the limited scope for long-term sovereign bond issues, particularly
following the October 97 turnoil in the financial markets, Government backing of bond financing
for the entire project could interfere directly with the Government's external borrowing
requirements. Moreover, due to back-ended repayments, an entirely bond-based financing
structure would have disadvantages for a project with a fairly constant cash flow. An appropriate
financing plan for the project would thus require a substantial amount of loan funding. However,
Brazil's access to international loan markets, even for sovereign borrowing, is even more limited.
The first medium-term (3 years) loan to a Brazilian borrower since 1982 was syndicated only in
April, 1997, amounting to US$ 275 million in the name of BNDES. It would therefore be
difficult, even with Government guarantees, to mobilize the necessary amounts of debt under a
financing structure suitable for the project.
6.    Finally, as another option Petrobras might have tried to raise the project debt entirely in its
own name. While Petrobris has recently successfully tapped international financial markets, it has
only in September started preparing for a US$ 200 million bond issue beyond 10 years maturity.
Even without the interference of the recent turmoil in financial markets, it is highly unlikely that
PetrobrAs could have raised at this point the entire debt funding needed at terms and maturities
suitable for the project. In addition, this option would have been incompatible with sound
corporate finance practices since it would have provided full balance sheet support for a project
company in which Petrobras has only a 51% stake, that is planned to be reduced to a minority
share in the near future. Moreover, such borrowing strategy would have increased Petrobras'
leverage and thus restricted its capacity to raise financing for its corporate core business. It would
thus have been inconsistent with the approach needed to meet the challenges of a changing
environment due to the abolishment of Petrobras monopoly, increasing competition, and
preparation for further privatization of ownership.

3.    Bilateral Sources
7.    A financing plan relying mainly on bilateral official sources would not be feasible either,
since the agencies responsible (mostly export credit agencies) would principally aim at supporting
their respective countries' exporters. However, more than half of project costs in both Brazil and
Bolivia would be for construction and other local expenses and would thus not be eligible for
bilateral support. Moreover, these agencies will expect strong commercial or multilateral lenders
leading the transaction. In absence of a purely commercial solution, their participation will thus to
a large extent be contingent on the comfort they derive from the presence of the Bank Group.
4.    World Bank Group
8.    For the reasons outlined above, the preliminary financing plan is predicated on substantial
multilateral lending including a traditional IBRD loan, that will be extended to the Brazilian
project company with Government guarantee, and similar loans provided by the IDB and CAF.
However, within the context of the needed multilateral support, the preliminary financing plan
aims at maximizing private financing sources through a bond placement by the Brazilian project
company with a partial IBRD credit guarantee. While the exact amounts for the private
participation will have to be determined by the markets, initial soundings have resulted in the
figures reflected in the preliminary financing plan. They have also clearly demonstrated that any
private participation in debt financing depends on and takes substantial comfort from IBRD's
direct participation in the project's funding.
5.    Financing Plan
9.    The total project cost of US$2.09 billion comprises about 21% for the Bolivian part and
79% for the Brazilian side. The preliminary financing plan contemplates a 63:37 debt to equity
ratio. The sponsors' equity contribution amounts to about US$768 million of which US$383
million (18%) represents the purchase, by any of the sponsors, of future transportation services.
This arrangement, the Transport Capacity Option-TCO, enables the buyer(s) to ship up to
6MMcm/d of gas (above the Transportation Contract Quantity-TCQ, which builds up to
18MMcm/d) for 40 years without payment of fixed transportation tariffs. Petrobras has
committed to purchasing the entire TCO. The equity portion, excluding the TCO, amounts to
US$385 million (19%) and consists of share equity and subordinated shareholder loans. The
shareholder loans represent quasi-equity, as they would rank in all respects below senior debt.
10.   The equity amounts and composition (excluding TCO) are predicated on the need to
assure investors a return on their capital (equity plus subordinated loans) commensurate with
market expectations. The returns are based on cash flows derived from the contractual TCQ-gas
volumes and transport tariffs and amount for this scenario (base case) to about 18% pre-home-
country-tax in nominal, or 14% in real terms. The private partners in the project are multinational
companies from different countries with world-wide experience in the energy business. As they
have various domestic and foreign investment alternatives, any investment of the type proposed
must be weighed against those options. As a point of reference, regulatory agencies of the US and
Canada permit nominal after-tax returns of up to 14% in the regulated pipeline business. Given

Annex 5
the country risks involved, the cross-border nature of the pipeline, the untried regulatory
frameworks in Bolivia and Brazil, the limited development of the Brazilian gas market and
constraints of demonstrated gas reserves, the TCQ case equity returns appear to be in line with
the perceived investment risks.
11.   For the Brazilian side, the preliminary financing plan shows equity sources of US$3 10
million, a share of the TCO of US$302 million, and US$1,038 million debt which is foreseen to be
financed by direct loans from IBRD (US$150 million), IDB (US$240 million), CAF (US$60
million), EIB (US$60 million), Petrobras (US$ 348 million-Jexim and BNDES loans passed on to
TBG), and a US$180 million bond placement with an IBRD partial credit guarantee for a bullet
redemption at maturity. BNDES has agreed to finance Petrobras' purchase of the TCO. The
Bolivian side of the pipeline is expected to be financed through a mixture of US$75 million
equity, a US$81 million share of the TCO, and senior debt of US$280 million provided by
Petrobras (of which US$ 150 million from Jexim passed on to GTB. CAF has agreed to finance
Petrobras' purchase of the TCO.
IL    Financial and Risk Analysis
1.    Backeround
12.   The Government has asked the Bank to lend to the Brazilian project company,
Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brazil S.A. (TBG). The request is based on
Petrobras' corporate strategy to take only those commitments on its balance sheet for which it
carries full responsibility. While Petrobras is prepared to extend far-reaching support for
construction and operation of the pipeline, it would like to benefit financially from the joint-
venture and risk-sharing nature of the project. Moreover, Petrobras has expressed concern that, if
it were to be the borrower of record for the bulk of the project debt, it would risk violating loan
covenants of the Bank-financed Hydrocarbon Transport and Processing Project (Loan 3376-BR).
13.   The designated borrower TBG is a recently created corporate entity which at this point
has only minimal share capital, employs no staff, and lacks any credit or performance history. The
justification for lending to TBG therefore stems from the arrangements which will enable the
company to implement the project as planned and to fulfill its financial obligations. These
arrangements are reflected in a tightly-knit contractual framework which secures the borrower's
future financial viability, and which involves strong commitments by the private shareholders
British Gas, El Paso Energy, Broken Hill Proprietory (the BTB consortium), Enron, Shell, and
Bolivian Pension Funds, and by the state companies YPFB in Bolivia and Petrobras in Brazil.2
The contractual obligations under this framework are designed to (i) ensure a reasonable equity
return, (ii) provide for sufficient debt service cover, (iii) protect the borrower against major risks
2The financial position of the borrower on the Bolivian side, Gas Transboliviano S.A. (GTB), is determined by the
same parameters and contractual agreements that muror those on the Brazilian side.

Annex 5
beyond its control, particularly in construction, supply and off-take, and (iv) ascertain appropriate
management, know how, and human and technical resources.
14.   The expected financial performance of the borrower and its creditworthiness rest solely on
arrangements relating to the Transportation Contract Quantity (TCQ) which builds up to 18
MMcm/d. An additional 6 MMcm/d of capacity, the Transportation Capacity Option (TCO), is
available for purchase to the sponsors (with Petrobras committed to buy the entire option) against
a US$383 million payment for part of the investment costs of the project. As cash payment, the
TCO does not require any debt service or dividend from the borrower. It also does not generate
any revenues for TBG which has to provide the agreed transportation capacity to the buyer free
of fixed charges. The TCO is therefore neutral to the borrower's financial situation. The
conditions for use of the remaining 6 MMcm/d, the Excess Capacity (TCX), have not been
defined yet. While they do not imply any risk for the borrower, they could represent an upside
potential, resulting in higher equity returns and an increase in debt service coverage. However, the
Government's intention in implementation of the new hydrocarbon law is to regulate the pipeline
business in Brazil on the basis of maximum equity returns. If these were aligned with the TCQ-
returns, any additional TCX-benefits would be passed on to the consumers.
15.   The project will be governed by 15-20 agreements in both countries which have either
been concluded or are at an advanced draft stage. These agreements are embedded in and
supported by (i) the contracts underlying the Bolivian capitalization process entailing investments
of US$835 million, and operating commitments, by the private partners on the production (YPF
and Perez Companc from Argentina, Amoco from the US) and on the transportation side (Enron
and Shell), (ii) long-term sales contracts between Petrobras and five state gas distribution
companies in Brazil, and (iii) gas supply agreements (under negotiation) with major prospective
clients in industry and power. The borrower is thus largely shielded from risks beyond its control,
which are distributed among various participants upstream and downstream.
2.    Assumvtions for Financial Proiections
16.   Financial projections for the borrower were carried out with the help of a forecasting
model designed by Credit Suisse First Boston, the financial adviser to Petrobras. The model
includes projections both for TBG and GTB, as well as consolidated forecasts for the pipeline
operations in both countries. The model assumptions are essentially identical for both companies
through equal shares in investment and operating costs, as well as revenues. However, minor
differences in the financial projections result from different financing terms for the two financing
packages, as well as from slightly varying tax and accounting rules. The model includes pro-forma
income and fund flow statements, as well as projected balance sheets and all necessary schedules
with background calculations.
17.   Construction Cost. The construction period of the project is expected to span a total of
approximately 30 months. The first portion of the project, which includes the segment from Rio
Grande, Bolivia, to Campinas/ Paulinia, Brazil, is anticipated to come on line by the end of 1998,
the remainder, which includes the segment from Campinas/ Paulinia to Porto Alegre/Canoas, by
June 30, 2000. Total Project cost is estimated to be approximately US$2.09 billion, of which US$

Annex 5
1.65 billion for Brazil and US$0.44 billion for Bolivia. About US$1.77 billion of total is hard cost
and 0.32 soft costs, including interest during construction, upfront and commitment fees,
development and transaction costs as well as a 3-month senior debt service reserve. The Bolivian
construction contract is fixed-price lump sum. On the Brazilian side construction will be managed
by Petrobras under an agreement with TBG. About 10% contingencies have been included. This
is considered adequate and on the Brazilian side offers or quotations for most of the equipment
(about 40% of project hard cost) have already been obtained, soundings on construction costs
have been carried out, international inflation is low, and the bulk of construction is scheduled to
be completed within two years. After the initial construction period, additional compression
facilities along the pipeline will be required to increase gas throughput. The model assumes that all
such additional costs would be financed by export credits and internally generated cash. Any
additional capital expenditures associated with the TCO volumes will be the responsibility of the
TCO purchaser(s) and are thus excluded from the model.
18.   Capital Structure. The target capital structure of TBG comprises 63% senior debt, 19%
equity and subordinated shareholder loans, and 18% TCO payment. The model is based on the
preliminary financing plan and assumes that the subordinated debt will carry a nominal interest
rate of 15% (of which 8.75% will be deductible for income tax purposes), and that its principal is
repaid in ten equal annual installments commencing in the 11th year of operations. To the extent
the Project generates insufficient cash in the early years of operations to pay subordinated interest,
such interest will be capitalized and repaid over the remaining term of the debt.
19.   Gas Volumes. Pursuant to the Transportation Agreement with TBG, Petrobras as the
shipper will have the ship-or-pay obligations for the TCQ if gas is tendered by YPFB at the
border:
TCO-Volumes
(MMcmd)
Year     2000     2001      2002     2003      214  J 200   J  2006     207+

As the sponsors' intention is to transport gas as soon as possible on acceptable terms, the model
assumes that during 1999, before the portion of the pipeline extending from Campinas/ Paulinia to
Porto Alegre/Canoas is completed, Petrobras will contract to reserve at least an average of 5.0
MMcmd of firm capacity. The model further assumes that the tariff revenues thus received are
applied to construction cost. The TCQ-volumes listed above form the basis of the revenue stream
for the project, as they are contractually fixed. The TCO purchaser has the right to utilize 6
MMcmd of Pipeline capacity over and above the TCQ free of fixed capacity charge. The
borrower would receive additional revenues only for transporting volumes over and above the
TCQ and TCO (excess capacity-TCX). However, the shipment of TCX-quantities has not been
taken into account for calculation of TBG's financial projections since contractual agreements or
understandings on their utilization have not been finalized yet.

20.   TariffPricing. The fixed capacity charge (tariff) for the TCQ covering both the Bolivian
and Brazilian stretches will be US$1.5352/ MMBtu per day in 1996 terms, which is escalated at a
contractually agreed rate of 0.5% per annum. It is designed to cover projected debt service and
fixed operating costs, provide a fair return to the project sponsors, and leave a security cushion.
Capacity payments are assumed to be made for the entire TCQ independent of the actual
throughput, as stipulated in the project agreements. The tariff profile is defined in the following
table:

2005           1.6057           2015            1.6878
The fixed tariff will be split between TBG and GTB in a way so that both companies will realize
substantially similar pre-tax unleveraged and equity returns, as well as debt service coverage
ratios. In accordance with the contractual arrangements the tariff split in the financial projections
has been assumed to be US$1.2096/MMBtu per day (78.8% of total) for TBG and
US$0.3256/MMBtu per day (21.2% of total) for GTB for 1996. The shippers Petrobras (Brazil)
and YPFB (Bolivia) are also required to pay a minimal throughput charge to cover the variable
operating costs. In addition, the shippers will be responsible for providing the fuel associated with
the actual throughput. Variable operating costs are thus pass-through items for both
transportation companies.
21.   The fixed tariff for the TCO has been agreed between Petrobras, BNDES and Eletrobras
to be set at US$ 1.00 in 1996, escalated by the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). Moreover, the
Bank agreed with the Government during appraisal, that this tariff would be an average rate from
which distance-based tariffs would be derived for different sales points along the pipeline. No
arrangements have been made yet for TCX-tariffs. However, it should be stressed that, in



Project Appraisal Document                                                                  Page 44
Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Biv-Bazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 5
accordance with the new hydrocarbon legislation, the Government intends to regulate the pipeline
business based on maximum equity return criteria. Since additional investments to realize the TCX
would be minimal (around US$ 105 million), the fixed TCX-tariff required to achieve regulated
(assumption: TCQ) equity returns would total only US$ 0.30-0.351MMBtu per day. In that case,
in order to avoid considerable tariff distortions, an average tariff would have to be set jointly for
TCQ and TCX. The TCO-tariff may not be affected by the regulation as it is not directly related
to the services of the gas transportation company.
22.   Inflation. An inflation rate of 3.5% p.a. is used in the model to escalate all construction
and operating costs. Depreciation for book purposes has been set at twenty year straight-line.
The TCO prepayment is equally amortized over the full 20-year term of the Project on a straight-
line basis.
23.   Taxes. In Brazil, the income tax rate is currently 25%. Only 30% of pre-tax income may
be offset by prior year losses. A 15% tax on interest income currently applies, for which Petrobras
as a domestic company is also liable, but no withholding tax on dividends is levied. The 13.64%
ICMS tax on total revenues is a passthrough for the borrower since revenue is grossed-up by the
same amount. Furthermore, a PIS/COFINS tax of approximately 2.65%, inclusive of the ICMS
gross-up, is currently levied on total revenues, and an additional 8% social contribution tax on
taxable income is applied, which is deductible for income tax purposes.
24.   In Bolivia, the income tax rate amounts also to 25% but no restriction on offsetting of
past losses applies. Foreign companies are currently subject to a 12.5% dividend withholding tax
and a 12.5% interest withholding tax. Because of the capitalization program, YPFB and its
successors are assumed in the model to be liable for withholding taxes as well. A hydrocarbons
transportation tax of 1% would be levied on the total revenues of GTB. The following table
summarizes the various current taxes that are applicable to the two transportation companies:

Annex 5
25.   Senior Debt Service Coverage. The coverage ratios determined by the model are
calculated by dividing all cash flows (i.e. revenues less cash operating and capital costs) by total
senior debt service (i.e. interest and principal payments), both on a yearly basis and as average
over the total debt repayment period. A three-month senior debt service reserve is assumed to be
funded in cash at the end of construction and to be maintained in full up to maturity. The model
assumes that any funds in the reserve earn interest at 5% p.a.
3.    Financial Proiections
26.   Financialprojections for TBG were calculated based on the assumptions outlined above
and on the preliminary financing plan, and are summarized in the table attached to this Annex. The
TCQ-case, which is the basis for the financial projections, shows coverage ratios for senior debt
of a minimum of 1.38:1 in year 3 post-construction (2002) and an average of 2.84:1. Even with
relatively low coverage ratios in the early years, the borrower's debt service capacity is considered
satisfactory, given the project's low risk profile (Chapter 4) and the comfortable average debt
service cover over loan maturity. The equity returns to the shareholders show an equalized after-
tax rate of return of 18.1% in nominal terms, which provides virtually no upside, but has been
sufficient to attract strategic private partners into the project, given the low risks.
27.   Thefinancial structure is designed to allow for the gradual increase of Bolivian gas
deliveries, taking into account the status of gas reserves, the need for new investments in Bolivia
to increase reserves through further exploration, and the lead time for introducing the gas into the
Brazilian market. This gradual build-up is reflected in a slowly increasing revenue and cash flow
curve. While long-term loans by multi- and bilateral financing institutions were the only feasible
way of funding the project, their repayment requirements still put a relatively high burden on the
project in the early years in view of the slow build-up of its debt service capacity. In order to
achieve an acceptable match of risk and debt service coverage for the borrower, the sponsors
decided to fund the TCO as separate investment and to exclude certain capital expenditure needed
for the TCX from the initial project design. The coverage ratios were further enhanced by
introduction of a Bank-supported partial credit guarantee for a bond issue which balances some of
the effect of the more front-loaded repayment schedules of the official lenders and thus
contributes to achieving a financial structure adapted to the project's needs.
28.   Thefinancial rate of return (FRR) for 1BG after-tax amounts to 12.9% in nominal terms
(9.0% in real terms) based on the TCQ only. While this is relatively low, it should be considered
adequate since there is only minimal downside risk (Chapter 4). However, the project's overall
rate of return-potential is expected to be considerably higher, if rapid increase of gas throughput
due to dynamic market developments is taken into account and if market-based tariff levels and
adjustments are applied. In order to assess this potential, the following alternative assumptions
regarding the possible build-up of gas shipments beyond the TCQ were made:

29.   In a first alternative, a set of scenarios was tested, in which the TCQ-tariff was applied to
the TCQ and the TCX, and the agreed TCO-tariff was used. As a second alternative, one main
scenario was tested, in which it was assumed that after full liberalization the competitive position
of gas would permit TCO and TCX-tariffs based on the 1996 TCQ-level, but escalated by
inflation (the US CPI, projected at 3.5% p.a.). The tariff structure for the TCQ was assumed to
remain unchanged for the analysis since it has been set through binational agreements. It should be
stressed that (a) a TCO tariff-structure has been agreed between Petrobras, BNDES and
Eletrobras and may not be easily adaptable, even if market conditions permit, and (b) after the
new hydrocarbon legislation comes into effect, the Government intends to regulate the pipeline
business based on maximum equity return criteria. In that case the project may not be able to
realize its overall rate of return-potential due to regulatory considerations. The results of the
analysis combining alternative assumptions on gas volume build-up and transportation tariffs are
summarized in the following table (NPV figures in US$ million).
Real FRR    Nominal FRR  Real NPV   Nom. NPV

30.   The economic rate of return (ERR) has been determined including the TCQ and TCO but
not the TCX It is noticeably higher than the corresponding FRR since it is based on a much wider
spectrum of benefits. The ERR assesses the impact of gas transport and sales, while the FRR

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - BolMa-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 5
reflects the return of the transport operations only. For this reason the ERR, due to the use of
net-back values for gas, captures the benefits of replacement of high-value fuels, as well as the
environmentalpremium attached to gas vis-a-vis the bulk of competing fuels. In addition, the
ERR does not take into account taxes paid by TBG.
4.    Risk Analysis
31.   Construction delays and cost overruns. Petrobras has entered into a fixed-price lump sum
construction contract with GTB on the Bolivian side, which provides for a maximum construction
period, a completion date (in December 1998) subject to a comprehensive completion test, and
the possibility to cancel the contract with penalties if construction is not completed 12 months
beyond the due date. Liquidated damages and penalties amount to about two years of debt
service. Moreover, Petrobras has to start paying fixed capacity charges to GTB from December
1999 even if construction is not completed. It is exempted from this obligation only if non-
completion or interruption of pipeline operations is caused by force majeure or by GTB's fault.
32.   On the Brazilian side, Petrobras will be the construction manager under supervision of an
independent engineer and and will report to a construction committee appointed by the sponsors.
Petrobras will hire construction contractors following ICB-procedures and will ensure appropriate
contract provisions with regard to performance, liability and insurance. While TBG would not
receive a comprehensive completion guarantee, far-reaching provisions for cost overruns would
largely protect the borrower against negative financial impacts due to unforeseen events during
construction: (i) contingencies of about 10% of project hard costs have been built into the
construction budget; (ii) the sponsors have agreed to provide jointly US$ 200 million or 14% of
hard costs as standby facility in the form of equity and shareholder loans; and (iii) another US$
200 million of standby subordinated debt is assured by Petrobras. The total overrun reserves thus
amount to 37% of hard costs, or 62% of cost items for which firm offers are not available yet.
33.   Given Petrobras' and the sponsors' experience in large engineering and construction
projects, and firm orders or offers amounting to 40% of project hard costs, the risk of delays or
cost overruns is small. In addition, due to the equity and shareholder contributions and the
considerable interest of the sponsors in upstream and downstream investments, their commitment
to timely and on-cost completion of the project will be very strong. Moreover, through the
contingencies and overrun funding facilities, TBG is essentially protected from the financial
consequences of construction risks if they occur in the normal course of business. However,
residual risks would arise from force majeure, which could result in cancellation of contracts,
limitation of claims on liquidated damages and overruns possibly exceeding the generous
contingencies and funding reserves.
34.   Technology, operations, and maintenance. The pipeline will utilize well-known standard
technology which is applied world-wide in similar projects and which is supported by customary
producers' warranties. The operation and maintenance of pipeline projects is straight-forward and
implies by design low technical risks. Nevertheless, these areas are under direct responsibility of
the borrower. The occurrence of any related risk could reduce tariff payments and thus affect the
borrower's cash flows. In order to minimize these risks, the two pipeline companies will be staffed



Projet Appraisal Document                                                                  Page 48
Brazl: Gas Sector Developrnent PjW - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 5
and assisted by the sponsors which have extensive experience in operating similar projects world-
wide. In addition, appropriate insurance cover will be obtained. The staffing and operating
arrangements are summarized in the Borrower Inplementation Plan.
35.   Tariff revenues and gas delivery. Petrobras will pay to TBG a monthly fixed capacity
charge equal to US$ 1 .2096/MMBtu, in 1996 US$, adjusted annually by 0.5%, multiplied by the
number of days per month and by 100% of the TCQ. Petrobris thus assumes all market risk vis-a-
vis TBG independently of the actual gas flow. Moreover, Petrobras has to start paying fixed
capacity charges from pre-determined dates even if construction is not completed. It is exempted
from this obligation only if non-completion or interruption of pipeline operations is caused by
force majeure or by TBG's fault. However, if gas is not tendered on the Bolivian side, YPFB3 as
aggregator has to pay the share of the fixed capacity charge that corresponds to the share of
contractual quantities not delivered. YPFB thus assumes all supply risk vis-a-vis TBG. From the
point of view of the borrower, Petrobris' commitments offer a higher degree of security than
those of YPFB, given the difference in size and financial strength of the two companies.
Nevertheless, substantial or extended supply interruptions are considered unlikely because of the
considerable interest and financial commitments of the newly privatized gas production and
transport companies on the Bolivia side, whose future essentially depends on the proposed project
and which have committed substantial resources for development of their facilities. The main
residual risk would consist of force majeure which would prevent Petrobras, YPFB, the borrower
or GTB from fulfilling their contractual obligations.
36.   Gas reserves. Bolivia's proven, probable and possible reserves deliverable within the initial
20-year term of the Gas Supply Agreement amount to 101 BCM, while the TCQ requires a
minimum of 119 BCM. From the borrower's point of view, any insufficiency of reserves does not
present a supply risk but a performance risk of YPFB, which is contractually obliged to pay the
share of the fixed capacity charge that corresponds to the share of contractual quantities not
delivered, thus assuring the borrower's debt service capacity and shareholder's returns. While
YPFB may financially not be strong enough to cover the tariff payments for substantial reserve
shortfalls, its non-compliance risk is mitigated by the business strategy of the newly privatized gas
production and transport companies in Bolivia, by the experience of their private shareholders,
and by their commitments to invest US$ 835 million over approximately five years, substantially
more than YPFB's past record of US$ 60 million/year. Since Bolivia's market potential is small
and exports to Argentina will cease in 1998/99, the strategy of the private YPFB- successors will
be entirely focussed on gas exploration and production for the Brazilian markets. The ultimate
fall-back position would be to supplement Bolivian gas by imports from Argentina.
37.   Pricing. The financial position of the borrower depends entirely on the transport tariff and
is not linked to the commodity price for gas. Moreover, there are not expected to be any gross
economic distortions which would prevent market penetration of gas and could make support of
financial operations of the borrower unacceptable to the main risk-takers. The basis for the gas
3YPFB is a small part of the forner YPFB which was not capitalized, has retained certain assets, and is still
owned by the Bolivian Govemment.

Annex 5
purchase prices from Bolivia and its adjustments are contractually fixed in the Gas Sales
Agreement. As shown in the economic analysis, the gas prices to the end consumer resulting from
the transport tariff and the gas commodity prices are internationally and domestically competitive
and thus in line with the gas marketing strategy of Petrobras and the state gas distribution
companies. The econcomics of gas pricing is thus not considered to imply any long-term indirect
risk for the financial viability of the borrower. Petrobras assumes the full market risk vis-a-vis
TBG through its commitment to pay fixed capacity charges based on the fill TCQ. Petrobris in
turn has concluded agreements with gas distribution companies in five states covering volumes
that increase from 55% to 90% of the TCQ in the first six years of operations. Since these go
beyond its minimum gas purchase commitments under the Gas Sales Agreement with YPFB,
Petrobras, while assuming some of the tariff risk, has shifted the market risk essentially to the gas
distribution companies.
38.   Economic risks. All of the project debt, shareholder loans and equity is contracted and
revenues are determined in US$. Moreover, revenue increases are pre-determined in US$ through
the escalation formula for fixed capacity charges. Variable operating costs are mostly energy, and
thus US$-based, and are passed on in the gas prices. Only some fixed costs (e.g. wages) would be
in local currency and thus affected by domestic inflation. Since these costs have to be covered
from the fixed capacity charge, any increase has to be borne by the borrower. However, as they
represent only a small and over time decreasing (from 25% to 13%) share of total revenues, the
resulting risk to the borrower from domestic inflation is acceptable. For the reasons listed above,
devaluation of the Real would not impact negatively on TBG's financial position. The
shareholders' intention is to reduce the risk of increasing interest rates by interest rate fixing as
much as possible. To that effect the Government and Petrobras have asked for US$ fixed-rate
loans from the multilateral lenders and aim at a fixed-rate bond issue under the partial credit
guarantee. Interest rate movements would thus only have an effect on the borrowers financial
position to the extent that they occur before the respective interest-fixing dates of disbursements
and before placement of the bond. Furthermore, the borrower will not be affected by the risk of
non-convertibilty as most of its debt is contracted from multilateral institutions with Government
guarantee. In addition, the project would result in higher availability of foreign exchange for the
country through displacement of fuel imports. The long history of Petrobras' access to foreign
exchange for its core and related businessess also mitigates this risk.
5.    Sensitivities
39.   Sensitivity analysis was carried out from the point of view of the borrower. It was
therefore based on the TCQ only, since the TCO represents capacity pre-purchased by Petrobras
without any financial impact on the transportation company. It also did not take into account the
TCX. The sensitivity analysis focused on the two essential parameters of project stability - debt
service coverage ratios and equity returns - which were tested against major risks the borrower
could face in accordance with the analysis above. While TBG is largely protected against
construction cost overruns and delays, there is a small chance of occurrence these risks as a result
of force majeure or of unlikely gross negligence on the part of the borrower. The table below
shows that even cost increases by 5% and 10% or a completion delay of one year would reduce
equity returns by not more than 1.5 percentage points, and would only minimally affect the

borrower's debt service coverage ratios. Operating cost increases of 10% were assumed to
reflect the impact of high domestic inflation on local fixed cost elements (e.g. labor), as well as of
unforeseen operating problems (e.g. force majeure, work stoppages). They would reduce equity
returns by only 0.3 percentage points and barely affect the debt service coverage. The borrower's
financial situation is most sensitive to the risk of delayed revenue receipts. This could happen if
construction were not completed in time because of force majeure or if YPFB did not promptly
pay its share of fixed tariff revenues in the case of gas supply interruptions. A full year's revenue
delay would reduce equity returns by 3.5 percentage points. While this would most likely be
below the sponsors' target equity returns, the debt service cover ratios of 1.2:1 (minimum) and
2.4:1 (average) would remain satisfactory. Finally, if no additional gas reserves were found, gas
supplies would run out in year 17 of operations. However, this would reduce equity returns by
just 0.8 percentage points and would only marginally affect debt service cover.

6.    Financial Conditions
33.   It is proposed that the Loan and Guarantee Agreements include the following financial
conditions:
Before effectiveness of the Bank Loan, all project agreements have to be signed and effective, and
the availability of counterpart funds has to be documented in a legally binding way (e.g. sponsor
funding agreements). Starting with signing of the Loan Agreement, and during the period of its
effectiveness, the borrower will: (i) submit to the Bank annually audited financial statements; (ii)
submit to the Bank annually financial projections which demonstrate that it has the resources to
carry out and operate the project and comply with its debt service and other financial obligations;
(iii) declare and pay dividends only if it: 1) is in full compliance with its project-related financial
obligations, 2) has demonstrated availability of sufficient financial resources to comply with all its
financial obligations over the Loan Maturity, and 3) has cumulative distributable net profits or
unencumbered liquid assets at least equal to the proposed dividend payments; (iv) not contract
any debt with maturity beyond 12 months in addition to the sources provided for in the project

coverage ratio of less than 1.5, and/or 2) a projected maximum long-term-senior-debt/equity ratio
of more than 67:33; and (v) acquire shares of its subscribed capital or reduce its subscribed capital
without demonstrating to the Bank that this would not have a material adverse effect on the
Borrower's financial obligations.

Annex 5a
Documentation:               Standard Documentation including: Offering Circular, Terms, and
Conditions of Bonds and Guarantees, Trust Deed, Warranty
Agreement, Paying Agency Agreement, and Subscription Agreement.
All provisions would reflect the Bank's participation as partial
guarantor of principal at maturity. The offering circular discloses (i)
material information on the Bank and its Loan, audit and record
keeping to demonstrate proper use of the proceeds. (ii) the counter-
guarantee and indemnity arrangements between Transportadora
Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil S/A, Government of Brazil and the
Bank, (iii) other sources of financing and the remedy provisions in the
Bank's Loan Agreement, Indemnity Agreement and Project Agreement
with TBG.
Bonds:                       The Bonds would be unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of
Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil S/A. All
modifications to the terms of the Bonds would require prior written
approval from the Bank. Bondholders will covenant not to enter into
any repackaging arrangement, i.e. an arrangement that separates the
rights to payment of principal from those to payment of interest. The
Bonds can be redeemed before maturity for taxation reasons by
Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil S/A.
World Bank Guarantee         Scope: The terms of the Bank's Guarantee would be set out in the
Provisions:                  Trust Deed constituting the Bonds and are outlined in the offering
circular and in conditions endorsed on the Bonds. The guarantee will
cover payment of principal only at maturity in 2016 and is not
accelerable in case of default by Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto
Bolivia-Brasil S/A to pay principal on Bond redemption before stated
maturity. The maximum amount payable under the Guarantee would
be the principal amounts of the Bonds. Upon either regular redemption
of the Bonds by the Issuer or upon payment under the Guarantee, the
Bank will be discharged automatically from all obligations with
respect to that redemption or payment. The Bank does not guarantee
the due execution or authenticity of the Bonds. The Guarantee is of
the payment and not collection of funds.
Call: Demand under the Bank's Guarantee can only be made after
notice has been given by the Trustee that the Paying Agent has not
received repayment monies from Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto
Bolivia-Brasil S/A, who is required to pay Interest installments and
Principal (on redemption) to the Paying Agentfive business days in
advance of the due date. Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-
Brasil S/A and the Bank would receivefifteen-day advance notification
of payment dates. This mechanism would allow early warning of any
potential call on the Bank's Guarantee. Any call on the Bank's
Guarantee should be made within ten days of the maturity date.

Annex 5a
Subrogation: If the Guarantee is enforced, the World Bank would be
entitled to stand in the place of the Trustee and Bondholders to seek
reimbursement from the Issuer. A specific provision on subrogation
will clearly stipulate that the World Bank would be entitled to exercise
its rights of subrogation immediately. The Bank's claims through
subrogation will rank equally to all other bondholder claims.
Currency Indemnity: The Bank will not provide any Issuer Currency
Indemnity.
Negative Pledge: The Bank's Guarantee will rank parn passu with the
Bank's other unsecured unsubordinated obligations. The Bank will
give a standard negative pledge in relation to the guarantee enjoying
the same security as may be granted by the World Bank in respect of
its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
Amendments: Any amendment to the Guarantee provisions would
require the consent of all parties, including the World Bank.
Counter-Guarantee and        As required under the World Bank's Articles of Agreement, Federative
Indemnity Agreement:         Republic of Brazil will enter into a Counter-Guarantee and Indemnity
Agreement with the Bank. Pursuant thereto, Brazil agrees to
reimburse and indemnify the Bank in respect of any amount paid out in
respect of principal (or other liabilities incurred) under the provisions
of the guarantee, on demand or as the Bank may otherwise direct. In
the event that the Bonds are redeemed, canceled, or exchanged in an
eventual privatization of Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-
Brasil S/A, the Bank's guarantee will be discharged. Breach of the
Agreement by TBG or Brazil would constitute an event of suspension
with respect to Brazil's borrowing program. The Bank will not
Guarantee any Issuer Currency Indemnity.
Guarantee Fee:               The fee represents 0.25% per annum, charged on the guaranteed
exposure on present value basis, using the Bank's cost of funds as
discount rate. The fee is payable in advance by TBG at financial
closure date, out of the proceeds of the Bonds. Fee payment would be
guaranteed by Brazil. In the event of early redemption of the Bonds
(or part thereof), a precalculated refund of a prorated part of the
guarantee fee will be made by the Bank. The Principal Paying Agent
has responsibility for notifying the Bank on redemption and
cancellations of the Bonds. The Payment of the Guarantee Fee would
be a condition precedent to effectiveness.
Governing Law & Jurisdiction:   The terms and conditions of the Bonds, the Guarantee and all
agreements with the commercial parties to which the Bank is a party,
are subject to the laws of the [State of New York in United States of
America] Non-exclusive jurisdiction will be vested in the courts of
New York, subject to the Bank's statutory right to transfer any

The Bank loan will finance the construction of the Southern Leg (Campinas-Porto
Alegre). All the bidders have been pre-qualified and the process has been reviewed by the Bank.
As the bidders may submit proposals for any combination of the five spreads (depending on their
pre-qualication status for each spread), the winner(s) will be selected on the basis of overall
minimum cost of the construction for the entire Southern Leg. Thus, the number of contracts can
range from one to five. The bid opening is currently scheduled for December 2, 1997.

To expedite project execution, a Special Account would be opened in a Brazilian
commercial bank under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank with an authorized allocation
of up to US$17 million equivalent. This account would be replenished for the amount of
withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures. The disbursement arrangements will be discussed
and agreed upon during negotiations.
As TBG is a new company, only the proposed organizational structure was reviewed
during appraisal and was considered adequate to carry-out the project on a sustainable basis. The
implementation of the organizational structure, including appointment of key financial and
auditing staff will be a condition of Loan Effectiveness.

BOLIVIA-BRAZIL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.0   Background
The purpose of the proposed Bolivia-Brazil pipeline project is to transport natural gas produced
in central Bolivia to major industrial centers in Brazil, opening a new and important market for
existing Bolivian reserves of natural gas and bringing an additional source of power to the
Brazilian energy matrix. The project is being developed by Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos (YPFB) and Petrobras, together with participating partners Enron Corporation, and
the BTB Group. The BTB Group represents a consortium comprised of Broken Hill Proprietary
Company Limited (BHP), El Paso Energy, and British Gas.
In 1988 the presidents of Bolivia and Brazil signed a "Treaty for Integration of Energy" in which
Brazil committed to purchase electric power produced with Bolivian natural gas in a thermal plant
to be erected on the border between the two countries. This Treaty was later followed by
additional negotiations and agreements for the transportation and sale of gas to the main industrial
centers of Brazil, delivered through the proposed gas pipeline.
In 1990 YPFB commissioned an Environmental Impact Study to be completed for construction of
the Santa Cruz - Puerto Suarez gas pipeline and a thermoelectric power plant in Puerto Suarez.
Environmental missions from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank
visited Bolivia in 1991 and submitted comments and recommendations to the government of
Bolivia and YPFB upon completion of their missions. The Bolivian government gave its approval
to the project in 1991 by signing the Declaratoria de Impacto Ambiental and Resoluci6n
Ministerial #269/91. In the intervening period since 1991, the scope of the project changed
substantially. The Puerto Suarez power plant is no longer part of the project, and the pipeline has
been extended to include the Brazilian segment. Due to these changes and new environmental
regulations, additional environmental studies were required in Bolivia and a complete EIA was
required in Brazil.
Beginning in 1992, Petrobras commissioned a Brazilian consultant to produce an Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) and Risk Analysis (RA) for the Brazilian sector of the project. The
studies were completed in two phases, the first segment being from Corumba to Curitiba and the
second from Curitiba to Porto Alegre. In 1996 and part of 1997 the studies were revised,
consolidated, updated and completed, when necessary, to comply with the requirements set out by
the World Bank's and IDB's Guidelines.

Annex 13
Since 1992, the EIA, Risk Analysis and numerous supplemental environmental reports have been
submitted to Brazil's federal environmental office and the environmental agencies in the five
affected states, and the licensing process has been completed.
In January, 1996, work commenced on an Environmental Impact Study for the Bolivian sector to
reflect the current project scope and environmental conditions. The EIS was based upon a
comprehensive review of existing information, field work, and community consultation to
evaluate the biophysical and socioeconomic environments in the area of influence of the project.
The report was completed and presented to Bolivia's Ministry of Sustainable Development and
Environment in November, 1996, and an amendment to the environmental license has already
been issued.
2.0   Regulatory Framework
Although the project will be constructed under two different environmental legal and institutional
frameworks, at design it was decided at the onset to treat the entire length pipeline as a single
project rather than two altogether different segments. The environmental management plans, the
environmental guidelines for construction, as well as compensation criteria have been uniformly
applied to the entire length wherever possible. Environmental supervision and environmental
audits will be carried out by consultant firms and auditors responsible for the whole length and all
work fronts.
Bolivia
Bolivia's Environmental Law No. 1333, enacted in 1992, established procedures for
environmental management and regulatory compliance for activities potentially impacting the
environment. Article 62 of the Environmental Law provided that indigenous populations, together
with public and private nonprofit institutions, social entities and traditional communities may
participate in the administration of Protected Areas. The Ministry of Sustainable Development
and the Environment (Ministerio de  Desarrollo Sostenible y Medio Ambiente - MDSMA),
created in 1993, has recently enacted six environmental regulations associated with Law No.
1333, addressing the following issues: Environmental Management (Reglamento General de
Gesti6n Ambiental); Environmental Prevention and Control (Reglamento de Prevenci6n y Control
Ambiental); Air Pollution (Reglamento de Contaminaci6n Atmosferica); Water Pollution
(Reglamento de Contaminaci6n Hidrica); Hazardous Substances (Reglamento para Actividades
con Sustancias Peligrosas); and Solid Waste Management (Reglamento de Gesti6n de Residuos
S6lidos).
The Subsecretariat of the Environment (Subsecretaria del Medio Ambiente) was created to
monitor compliance with the new regulations and environmental legislation.
Hydrocarbon Law No. 1689, was signed in May, 1996. Environmental regulations necessary to
enforce this new law have been proposed, but have not yet been promulgated. The law provides
that an administrative concession must be granted prior to construction and operation of a

pipeline. The law also defines tariff requirements and responsibility for supervising and inspecting
concessionaires. Transportation of hydrocarbons by pipelines is governed by the principle of free
access.
Public Participation Law No. 1551 and its associated regulations were passed in 1994. The Law
and its regulations established procedures for encouraging and involving the indigenous, rural, and
urban communities in the judicial, political and economic processes of the country. Law No.
1551 transferred some levels of authority from the central government to municipal governments
and provided for distribution of a portion of tax revenues collected from the central government
to the municipalities.
In September, 1995, Supreme Decree No. 24122 gave protection status to over 3.4 million
hectares of land and established the Gran Chaco National Park and its Integrated Management
Areas. The Decree defined the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline right-of-way as the boundary line
between the park and the Integrated Management Area.
Bolivia's regulations related to archaeological heritage declare that all artifacts are property of the
State and require authorization from the Ministry of Education and Culture prior to excavation
activities. The regulations also establish penalties for destruction, damage, removal, or
exploitation of cultural resources.
There are a number of proposed laws which have not yet been passed, including laws on
indigenous settlements, biological diversity, and environmental norms for the hydrocarbon sector,
the latter being supported under a World Bank Technical Assistance project. Progress of these
proposed laws will be monitored by Project Sponsors to ensure compliance and identify any
potential areas of concern for the project.
Brazil
In the Brazilian Constitution (Carta Magna Brasileira) which was rewritten 1988, Chapter, No.
VI, Article 225, was devoted to the environment, which confirmed the growing importance of this
matter in Brazil. The Constitution also allocated authority to legislate on environmental issues
between Federal and State levels.
The National Policy for the Environment (PNMA) was established under Article 2 of Federal Law
No. 6.938 dated August 31, 1981. The purpose of the Law was the preservation, improvement
and recovery of environmental quality, to ensure conditions for socioeconomic development, in
compliance with the interest of national security and for protection of the dignity of human life. In
1990, Decree No. 99.274 created the National Environmental System (SISNAMA) as an
organization with responsibility for promulgating rules and regulations to enforce the National
Environmental Policy..
From the array of directives consolidated into the PNMA stem the main guidelines related to
environmental protection, through regulatory decrees, ordinances and resolutions enacted by the
bodies and agencies that integrate the National System for the Environment

Annex 13
The Consultant and Deliberative Body of the SISNAMA is the National Council for the
Enviromnent (CONAMA). CONAMA has responsibility for advising on the establishment of
Federal environmental policies and issuing regulations to implement the National Environmental
Policy.
CONAMA's first resolution, and one of the its most important, was 01/86, which imposed the
requirement for an environmental impact study for projects which have the potential to impact the
physical, chemical or biological environment. These studies are a fundamental part of the
licensing process. Decree No. 99.274 established environmental licensing as a three-stage
process, including a Previous License, Installation License, and Operating License.
CONAMA Resolution 06/86 provides that the request for environmental licenses must be
published in the Official State Newspaper and in all major local newspapers in the project area.
Resolution 09/87 requires that public audiences be held to review the environmental aspects of
major projects. In accordance with these CONAMA resolutions and various state resolutions,
notice of the Bolivia-Brazil project was published in the official federal journal and in the major
regional or local newspapers in each state. The notices advised the public where the RIMA
(environmental impact summary) for the project was available for review, normally in the local
library. Public audiences were held in each state to provide local citizens an opportunity to
understand and evaluate the project.
3.0   Project Description
Route
The Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline will extend approximately 3100 kilometers from a point near the
city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and terminating near the city of Porto Alegre in Brazil.
The transmission system will originate at the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB)
Rio Grande Natural Gas Plant located approximately 40 kilometers southeast of Santa Cruz and
extend approximately 560 kilometers in an easterly direction to the town of El Carmen de la
Frontera on the Bolivia-Brazil border. The Brazilian segment extends approximately 2500 km
through the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do
Sul (see map nex page).
The Bolivian sector of the project will traverse the Baniados de Izozog, then cross the
predominantly flat tropical dry forest of the Bolivian Chaco region within the Department of
Santa Cruz. East of the Otuquis river, the pipeline will cross the northern portion of the Otuquis
and Tacuaral marshes. In Bolivia the route crosses the Rio Grande, San Miguel and Otuquis
rivers.
From the border, the route continues southeast crossing the Paraguay River and the Pantanal
marshland, running parallel to Highway BR-262. In the 700 kilometer segment through the state

of Mato Grosso do Sul, the pipeline crosses the Miranda, Pardo and Verde rivers. The pipeline
then crosses the Parana river into the state of Sao Paulo, continuing southeast, and crossing the
Tiete river to the Petrobras REPLAN refinery at Campinas. From the refinery, the route turns
south through Capao Bonito where it crosses the Paranapiacaba mountain range, then reaches the
Itapirapua river which separates the states of Sao Paulo and Parana. The route crosses the
Ribeira river and follows the right-of-way for existing oil pipelines into the state of Santa
Catarina, then east of Curitiba and across the Tijucas Mountain Range and the Tijucas river.
From this point, the route follows a new right-of-way, passing west of Florian6polis and
terminating at the Alberto Pasqualini Refinery near Porto Alegre.
Environmental considerations played a key role in defining the route for the Bolivia-Brazil Gas
Pipeline in both countries. After the primary objective of transporting natural gas from supply
sources to market demand, the route was laid out based upon environmental sensitivity mapping.
The route was further refined based upon environmental conditions identified through field
reconnaissance.
Ecologically sensitive areas and areas of high population density were avoided to the extent
possible. For example, in Bolivia the route was relocated to avoid the Cafion de la Victoria area
due to its ecological importance. The Cafion de la Victoria is a hydrologic and biological
connection between the wetland systems of the Bafiados de Otuquis, in Bolivia, and the Pantanal,
in Brazil. The route was modified to avoid crossing in this area which would impact a large
natural wetland and might affect the hydrologic connection between the systems.
In Brazil, many deviations were made to the route to reduce impa. in environmentally sensitive
areas. One notable example is in the Pantanal area. The original route in the Pantanal passed 40
km to the north of BR-262. In order to avoid crossing in this ecologically sensitive area of the
Pantanal, the route was diverted to the south following the highway through previously impacted
ranching and agricultural areas. Although this resulted in a considerable increase in cost, it was
considered prudent in view of the environmental considerations.
Engineering Design
The pipeline system will have an initial contract demand of 8.0 million standard cubic meters per
day with a maximum capacity of 30.0 million. Pipe will be manufactured in accordance with API-
5L, X-70 and X-65 standards and will range from a maximum of 32 inches in diameter at the Rio
Grande Gas Plant in Bolivia, progressively decreasing to 16 inches at Porto Alegre. Wall
thickness will range from 0.406-0.650 inches, depending upon the design factor. The pipeline will
be designed for a maximum allowable operating pressure of 1420 psi with a minimum delivery
pressure of 450 psi. In order to increase its transportation efficiency level, the pipe will be
internally coated. Corrosion protection for the pipeline will be provided using external anti-
corrosive coating and a cathodic protection system. Automatic reduced pressure shutdown valves
will be installed to ensure safety of the line. Locations of these valves will be determined during

the detail design phase of the project. Pig launchers and receivers will be installed for the purpose
of internal inspection and cleaning of the pipe
There will be two metering stations in Bolivia and five in Brazil. It is anticipated that thirty city
gates will be installed by State concessionaires along the gas pipeline in Brazil. Four compressor
stations are included in the system design for the Bolivian sector and twelve for the Brazilian
sector. Compressor station locations were selected based upon hydraulic studies and finalized
taking environmental considerations into account. The stations will be constructed as required
during the life of the project to increase delivery volumes and maintain acceptable pipeline
pressure. In the initial stage of the project only one station will be constructed in Bolivia and four
in Brazil. Compressor station sites will be restricted to a maximum 300 x 300 meter area in
Brazil, with Bolivia requiring a smaller area, as the natural forest will mitigate noise from the
compression equipment.
Meter stations and compressor stations will be automated for remote monitoring and control. A
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system will serve to monitor and control all
pipeline facilities from two Gas Control Centers, located in Santa Cruz, Bolivia and Guarulhos,
Sao Paulo, Brazil. Each compressor station and meter station, as well as some valves and other
remote facilities will be provided with electronic communication equipment for process control
and data transmission to relay information to a host computer via the telecommunication system.
Logistics
Pipeline construction has been segregated into thirteen spreads - two in Bolivia and eleven in
Brazil. Each spread will have one permanent camp and smaller camps which will move as
construction progresses along the right-of-way. Camp site locations in Bolivia have been
identified using the following criteria:
*  Minimize disturbance of virgin ground
*  Maximize use of readily available access roads
* Minimize number of camps and the size of the areas, primarily by 1) using areas for multiple
purposes such as camp and storage and 2) using one camp location for two construction
spreads at different times
* Minimize distance to storage yards
Location of camps in Brazil will be determined by the construction contractors, with the approval
of the Project Sponsors' environmental team. The camp site locations must also have approval
from the municipal governments and the local environmental authorities. Camps will be located
away from small towns, and will not be permitted in sensitive areas.
Extensive logistics studies have been conducted to determine methods for transportation of pipe
and materials to the work sites. Seven possible sea ports have been identified for use in the
project - four in Brazil, two in Argentina, and one in Chile. Internal ports on the Paraguay river
near the Bolivia-Brazil border will also be utilized for offloading. Pipe imported through ports in
Argentina may be transported by river to the Bolivia-Brazil border, then by train or roadway to

designated storage yards in Bolivia and Brazil. Materials may also be transported from Argentina
via the Beigrano Railway to Santa Cruz, then to storage sites by rail.
Pipe received through the four Brazilian coastal ports will be transported to storage areas by
truck. Pipe received through the port in Arica, Chile, will be transported by truck to Santa Cruz,
then to storage yards by railway.
There will be two primary storage areas in Bolivia and four in Brazil. From the storage yards,
pipe will be transported by truck to the right-of-way for stringing.
No new access roads are proposed for the project; however, in some cases existing access roads
will be upgraded. The majority of the required rework consists of drainage improvements and
reshaping of existing roadways.
Construction
The construction right-of-way will be a maximum of 30 meters in Bolivia and 20 meters in Brazil.
The additional width is required in Bolivia to provide free movement of construction equipment in
this area of limited road infrastructure. The permanent right-of-way will be reduced to 17 meters
in Bolivia following construction. The pipeline will be installed approximately one meter below
grade, or deeper in agricultural areas if required.
The pipeline construction will consist of several distinct phases, including clearing, grading,
ditching, lowering-in, backfilling, hydrostatic testing and restoration. Highway crossings, river
crossings and other unique topographic features may require the use of specialized construction
techniques to mitigate and minimize environmental impacts.
An Environmental Construction Plan describing basic environmental construction techniques to be
used for the project has been developed. The plan includes impact minimization techniques that
will be employed during and after construction. These procedures have been designed to protect
the environment and to minimize any potential effects of pipeline construction. Topics covered in
the plan include:
*  Preconstruction planning and standard environmental construction methods
* Erosion and sedimentation control practices, restoration and revegetation
* Specialized construction methods including waterbody and wetland crossing procedures and
site-specific construction methods for environmentally sensitive areas
* Measures to prevent, contain, and control spills
During the detailed design phase of the project, the application of these procedures will be defined
on a site-specific basis for the entire pipeline alignment. Construction of the pipeline is expected
to last 36 months.

4.0   Environmental Baseline Conditions
The study area in Bolivia was defined as an area located 10 km to the north of the Santa Cruz to
Puerto Suarez railroad and 10 km to the south of the proposed pipeline alignment. This study
area incorporates both the proposed pipeline route and the main route alternative considered for
the project.
For the purpose of physical and biological baseline studies, the indirect influence area in Brazil
comprises a 20 km wide strip, which was established based upon technical and economic
considerations. Various routing alternatives were analyzed within this area to identify the
optimum route from an environmental, technical, and risk perspective. The direct influence area
was defined as a 1,000 meter area on each side of the pipeline alignment.
For socioeconomic baseline information, the study area in Brazil includes the entire area of all the
municipalities crossed by the pipeline which have their administrative seats in the 20 km strip.
The data was taken from official data sources, qualified when necessary by primary data collected
during field research. Archeological data was collected from all the municipalities crossed by the
gas pipeline, not just those with administrative seats within the 20 km indirect influence area.
4.1   Physical Environment
Climate, Air Quality and Noise
The entire area of influence of the project in Bolivia is within the Steppe Climate zone according
to the Koppen classification system. In general, this climate is characterized by warm dry winters,
with mean temperatures over 23 degrees Centigrade. The distribution of average annual rainfall
varies from about 700 mm/yr in the southwestern portion of the study area to more than 1000
mm/yr in the east.
The gas pipeline in the Brazilian sector will run through two very distinctive climatic units. The
first unit is the region between Corumba in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, and Campinas, in the
State of Sao Paulo, where the climate is tropical with a wet summer and a dry winter. In the
Pantanal region there is a one to three month rainy season and a dry period which extends from
90 to 270 days. In the second climatic unit from Campinas to Porto Alegre the climate is
classified as wet subtropical, controlled by tropical air masses with local changes due to steep
hills.
The majority of the gas pipeline route extends through undeveloped or agricultural and pasture
land with minimal or no human activity. Consequently, the air quality and noise levels along the
pipeline right-of-way are, in general, associated with the natural environment and correspond to
low levels of air pollution and noise. The proposed storage yards and compressor stations are to
be located within or in the vicinity of small, non-industrial urban areas. Air quality is good in
these areas, and noise levels are in the low to medium range.

Annex 13
Geology, Geomorphology and Soils
The Llanura physiographic province in Bolivia is a broad, northwest-southeast trending trough
which is bounded on the northeast and southwest by relatively elevated portions of the Brazilian
Shield and the Faja Subandina, respectively. The surface of the Llanura is characterized by a
nearly complete cover of quaternary aged sediments. These consist of varying thickness of
generally fine grained sediments (clay, silt, and fine sand with lesser amounts of medium to coarse
sand and gravel), which were deposited by alluvial, fluvio-lacustrine, coluvial and eolian
processes.
Lands surveyed in the Brazilian sector range from pre-cambrian to quaternary times.
Approximately 75% of the route is through sedimentary and volcanic rock of the Parana
Sedimentary Basin of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic ages.  There are three environmentally
sensitive areas from a geological perspective, 1) the section between Corumba and Aquidauana, in
the State of Mato Grosso do Sul in the Pantanal complex, 2) the region of Planalto de
Paranapiacaba, next to the border of the States of Sao Paulo and Parana, where there is the
greatest density of areas with high physical fragility, and 3) the uphill portion of the foothills of
Serra Geral, where there is a steep escarpment and the presence of rocks and deposits of talus
which subject the hillsides to extreme instability.
The entire study area has a low degree of seismic activity which is confined to shallow surface
layers, with a small probability of earthquakes due to the geotectonic configuration of the region.
Coal deposits are present in some sections of the study area in Brazil, principally in the State of
Santa Catarina.
Hydrology and Water Resources
The study area in Bolivia lies on the drainage divide between the Amazon basin to the north and
La Plata basin to the south. The proposed pipeline route lies within the Llanura Chaquefia, which
is generally flat with very little relief, except where the plain is cut by occasional small streams and
creeks. The most significant rivers which cut the Llanura Chaquenia in Bolivia include the Rio
Grande and the Rio Parapeti, which drain the western portion of the region and flow northward to
the Amazon Basin; the southward flowing Rio San Miguel, which drains the central portion of the
region; and the eastward flowing Rios San Rafael/Aguas Calientes, Tucavaca, and Otuquis, which
drain the Sierras Chiquitanas in the eastern portion of the region, draining south and east to the
Rio Paraguay.
Rivers, streams, and creeks in the Llanura Chaquefia generally lack well-defined channels, and are
often characterized by broad meandering floodplains, frequent bank erosion and channel shifts
during periods of high flows. Large areas of the Llanura Chaquefia are subject to periodic
flooding.
The proposed pipeline route in Bolivia also traverses two large wetland regions; the Bafnados de
Izozog, associated with the Rio Parapeti and the Bafnados de Otuquis, associated with the Rio
Otuquis and the Pantanal area. The Cafion de la Victoria is an intermittent connection between

Annex 13
two distinct wetland systems, the Bafnados de Otuquis in Bolivia and the Pantanal system in
Brazil.
In Brazil the project will pass through the hydrographic basins of the Paraguay river, the Parana
river and the South Atlantic. The Paraguay river basin drains an area of approximately 500,000
square kilometers. The Paraguay River is the main drainage vector of the Pantanal Complex
which belongs to the Pantanal Depression geomorphologic unit. The extreme flatness of the area,
with reduced hydraulic gradients is responsible for its very low drainage flow velocities. The
Paraguay River is characterized by unstable banks and a meandering bed. The Miranda river is a
tributary of the Paraguay river within this basin.
The Parana hydrographic basin has a total area of 2,600,000 square kilometers and includes the
Southeast region of Brazil, Paraguay, Eastern Bolivia, and Northern Argentina. Its vast network
of rivers include the Pardo, Verde, Parana, and Tiete. The rivers are typical highlands rivers with
flow directions following the topographic gradient of the region.
The hydrographic basins of the South Atlantic are small, comprised of numerous small rivers that
run predominantly in a Southwest/Northeast direction in a course that is parallel to the coastline.
These rivers have origins in the backlands of the Serra do Mar, and upon reaching lower lands,
have meandering courses over sedimentary fluvial and marine deposits. The Itajai Acu river basin
has been impacted by high organic and chemical discharges from the textile, metallurgical, and
food industries located along the Blumenau/Brusque axis.
4.2   Biological Environment
FHora
Various types of vegetation cover are present throughout the study area in Bolivia, particularly
since the area is a transition zone between the biogeographic regions of the Cerrado and the
Amazon to the north, the Chaquefna region to the south and the Andes to the west. The three
main vegetation types are:
Dry Forest - The area between the Rio Grande and Rio San Miguel is predominantly dry
forest. The vegetation formations in this area are characterized by dense low shrub
species and low altitude trees. Scattered emergent trees, approximately 20 meters in
height are embedded in a matrix of smaller trees with a relatively open understory. The
ground cover stratum is dominated by shrubby vegetation, and dense thickets of terrestrial
bromeliads are scattered throughout the forest.
Riparian Forest and Marshland - Riparian forests, characteristic of the Bafnados de
Izozog region, grow along the Rio Parapeti. These tall, dense semi-deciduous forests
remain flooded the majority of the time. In addition to the arboreal stratum, the area is
characterized by an abundant shrub stratum, vines and ferns. The understory is dominated
by tree saplings. Many palm species are also associated with the riparian forests and other
inundated areas such as the Tacuaral and Baniados Otuquis.

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 13
Savannah - Forested Savannah is present in broad areas east and southeast of the
serranias de San Jose de Chiquitos. In general, these areas are dominated by grasses and
sedges, with patches of dense shrub with heights ranging from 1 to 3 meters and small
isolated trees. Scattered palms are in evidence in the eastern wet portion of this forested
Savannah area.
In Brazil, the majority of the area crossed by the pipeline route has already been impacted by
human activities. Much of the area is characterized by pasture, agriculture and cultivated forest.
Only small areas of primary vegetation remain. The main vegetation types identified in the area of
influence are represented as the following Ecological Zones: Pantanal, Cerrado, Seasonal Forest,
Atlantic Forest, Araucaria Forest, and Campo Limpo. Each one of these types is directly
influenced by its physical and/or socioeconomic condition.
Pantanal Complex - The Pantanal is a complex mosaic of landscapes characterized by at
least six vegetation types, including Cerrado, Grassy Timbered Cerrado, Cerrado Park,
Cerradao, Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, and Deciduous Seasonal Forest. In spite of
being decharacterized by human intervention, the Cerrado still maintains its dense arboreal
character, constituted of elements of low and medium height, with about 50% of the
species comprised of trees and thomy shrubs. The Grassy Timbered Cerrado is
characterized by periodic floodings with a predominantly creeping vegetation, mixed with
rare shrubs. The Cerrado Park is characterized small trees sparsely interjected over a
continuous mat vegetation and tufts of arboreal Cerrado vegetation. The Cerradao
formation has an average height of about 10 meters, occurring predominantly in isolated
areas of the Pantanal Matogrossense plains. The upper canopy of the deciduous seasonal
forest has an average height of about 20 meters, and is found in the area between the
Paraguay and Miranda rivers.
Cerrado - The Cerrado is characterized by the following vegetation types: Cerradao,
Cerrado Gratnineo-Lenhoso or Campo Cerrado and Campo, the latter being the result of
intervention by human activity in the area. The Campo Cerrado in this formation is
extremely degraded, as a result of the burning for creation of pastures.
Seasonal Forest - This type of forest usually occurs in regions under the influence of two
distinct seasons, a rainy season and a dry season, causing partial deciduality of its arboreal
species, primarily the ones which occupy the upper canopy of the forest. This vegetation
type is found only in scattered areas of the State of Sao Paulo and small areas of Rio
Grande do Sul, although in the latter area it has been largely replaced by agriculture and
pastures.
Atlantic Forest - The Atlantic Forest is a dense pluvial tropical forest located along the
Brazilian coast line near the Parana State border and parts of the State of Sao Paulo. Its
dense vegetation with an upper layer of trees approximately 25 meters in height is
characteristic of wet tropical areas, which do not have a biologically dry period.

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 13
Araucaria Forest - The Araucaria Forest occupies areas of high altitude, primarily in the
Serra do Mar slopes. Its main characteristic is the large occurrence of Parana pine, which
is the dominant species of the upper canopy.
Campo Limpo - Within the study area, the Campo Limpo formation occurs almost
exclusively in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. It is characterized by a variety of grass
species growing in shallow soil layers.
Fauna
The composition and diversity of fauna present in the study area varies according to the life zone
and level of disturbance of the natural habitat. The temperate dry forest area of the Chaco region
has one of the highest mammalian species diversities on the continent. The majority of the
mammals present in this area have extensive distributions in this part of the continent; however,
this area also represents the southern limit of dispersion of some of the large Amazonian mammals
like the capybara, jaguar, puma, and some primate species. The Pantanal Complex has a great
biodiversity system, with great areas of flooded vegetation, which are habitat for some of Brazil's
richest fauna. However, the process of environmental modification that the area has experienced
has significantly reduced the populations of some species. The extensive use of land in Brazil for
ranching and agriculture has contributed to the declining populations in much of the study area.
The avifauna exhibits Amazonian influences from the north and Andean-Patagonian influences
from the south and southwest. In the western portion of the Bolivian study area the most
conspicuous bird species include parrots, toucans and wading birds. In the dry and humid forest
areas the typical species include the various pigeons, Toco toucan, cardinal, Greater Rhea, and
vultures. In the Pantanal and the Bafnados de Izozog area and in Isla Verde, large concentrations
of ibis, storks and herons are present. Within the study area are also a great number of migratory
birds.
The herpetofauna are also rich, with the occurrence of diverse species of amphibians and reptiles,
and a great number of turtles. The Pantanal area also harbors several caiman species and lizards.
The many rivers in the Project area of influence harbor a high fish species diversity, being
surpassed in the neotropics only by the total existing in the Amazonian basin.
Species of Concern
The most pursued and threatened mammalian species include large mammals such as deer, wild
pigs, and large cats which are hunted for their meat and skin.  The felines are hunted
indiscriminately because they are considered a threat to cattle which occupy a broad area of the
woodland. Among the species which require protection are Tayassu tajacu (Collared Peccary),
T. albirostris (White-lipped Peccary), Catagonus wagneri (Chacoan Peccary), Alouatta caraya
(Black Howler Monkey), Mazama Americana (Agouti), Tapirus terrestris (Brazilian Tapir),
Dawypus novemcinctus (Nine-banded Armadillo), Priodontes maximus, Tolypeutes tricinctus,
Panthera onca (Jaguar), Felis concolor (Puma or Cougar), Blastocerus dichotomus (Marsh

Deer), Hydrochaeris (Capybara), Chrysocyon brachiurus (Maned Wolf), and Ozotocerus
bezoarticus (Pampas Deer). The Chacoan Peccary, blind armadillo, and the Chaco race of the
Guanaco (Lama Guanico) are endemic to the Chaco and are not adequately protected in any other
conservation area.
There are also a great number of avifaunal species which are threatened with extinction or that
have a declining population, including Amazonetta brasiliensis (Brazilian Duck), Anodorhychus
hyacinthinus (Hyacinth Macaw), Amazona xanthops, Columbina cyanopis, Alecturus risona,
Ara ararauna, Culcivora caudacuta, Nothura minor, and Falco deiroleucus (Bat Falcon), among
others. A great number of migratory birds, like the macaricos and the swallow are also in the
process of reducing their populations.
The reptile species which is most threatened due to intense hunting is the caiman. In Bolivia, the
Caiman yacare is intensively pursued, although there are laws to protect these reptiles. In Brazil
the Eunectes notatus, Dracaena notatus and a great number of turtles are also endangered.
Threatened plant species in the Chaco area include Bulnesia sarmientoi and several species of
orchids. There are also many ecologically critical vegetation species found in Brazil, such as
Aspidosperma, Bromeria, Cereus, Mimosa, Curatella americana, and Agonandra brasiliensis.
Protected Areas and Areas of Environmental Sensitivity
In Bolivia the most ecologically sensitive area impacted by the project is the Gran Chaco National
Park and Integrated Management Area, instituted in 1995 to protect the largest tract of
subtropical dry forest in the Americas. The other protected area in Bolivia potentially impacted
by the project is the Historical National Park of Santa Cruz La Vieja. National parks in Bolivia
are areas of ecological or historical significance which are set aside and protected, to allow natural
evolution and development of existing ecosystems with minimal human intervention. Integrated
Management Areas are areas which have a management plan for the controlled use and
development of renewable natural resources. The management plan is designed to maintain a
balanced interface between man and the ecological environment.  The Gran Chaco and the
adjacent Banlados de Izozog are rich in biodiversity and high in floral endemism. The Chaco is the
largest protected area in South America and contains one of the highest mammalian species
diversities on the continent.
In Brazil there are three primary areas of environmental sensitivity - the Pantanal Complex, Mata
Atlantica, and Aparados da Serra. A 70 km stretch of the pipeline from the Verde River to a
point just south of Miranda in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul will traverse the Pantanal, which
is the world's largest fresh water swamp. The Pantanal is a unique ecosystem which is habitat for
many of the world's threatened and endangered species. The Mata Atlantica is an ecologically
sensitive forest which has been officially designated as a protected area. The cutting of
vegetation in this area is forbidden by federal decree, unless specifically approved by IBAMA.
The pipeline will cross 70-100 km of Mata Atlantica in the state of Santa Catarina, which totals
approximately 62 hectares of forest. The Mata Atlantica is notable because of its diversified fauna
and flora, primarily smaller mammalian species and avifauna. The forest area is somewhat

fragmented, however, due to farming, ranching and silviculture. The Aparados da Serra which is
located on the boundary of the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul is a legally
protected area. The area is particularly sensitive to erosion and is characterized by patches of
Mata Atlantica, steep topography and associated talus deposits. There is significant rainfall
associated with this topographic variation which accelerates the erosion process.
The following Legally Protected areas are located close to the Project Influence Area in Brazil:
* Pantanal Arenoso Biological Reserve;
* Pantanal Matogrossense Environmental Protection Area;
* Corumbatai Environmental Protection Area;
* Ibitinga Environmental Protection Area;
* Ipanema National Forest;
* Aparados da Serra National Park;
* Serra Geral National Park;
- Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve; and

4.3   Socioeconomic Environment
Land Use
Most of the study area in Bolivia is under natural vegetation cover. Low precipitation and
relatively poor soils limit the capacity of the land to sustain intensive cattle ranching or
agricultural activities. Human concentrations are scattered. The most prevalent land use type is
lowland deciduous forest, which has been developed only to a small extent by the logging
industry, apparently due to the lack of moisture, which limits the development of commercially
valuable timber resources. The second most prevalent land use type is the lowland pasture and/or
shrubland, which is used for low density grazing and limited agriculture, and found primarily in
the central portion of the study area. The floodplains of the Parapeti River in the west and the
Otuquis River in the east which are characterized by abundant surface water, as well as shallow
groundwater, support limited agricultural development, primarily rice. The most significant areas
of cultivation occur in the western portion of the study area, mainly to the west of the Rio
Grande. Principal crops grown in this area include soybeans, sunflowers, barley, and corn.
In Brazil the predominant land use in the study area is pasture, which occupies approximately
60% of the total area. Natural vegetation cover occupies 15%, and agricultures occupies less
than 10%. The distribution of these land uses varies among the states.
Two thirds of the land in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul is utilized for ranching, due to the
native grasses which constitute the basic feed support for cattle. A small amount of the land is
used for crops, principally soybean, rice and wheat. In Sao Paulo, the primary land use is
agriculture, principally sugar cane. Remnants of the Mata Atlantica (Atlantic Forest) are also
found within this state, near the Parana border. The forest in this area has been greatly altered by

Annex 13
agricultural and ranching activities. In Parana, 40% of the land is agricultural, and 20% is used
for cattle grazing. Natural forests and vegetation occupy approximately 15% of the area, and 8%
of the land is used for commercial tree farms. In Santa Catarina, the primary land use is
agriculture, with a large number of annual crops such as banana, rice, pineapple, sugar cane,
tobacco, and manioc. The principal land use in Rio Grande do Sul is ranching (65%), followed by
natural forests (22%). Annual crops occupy a small percentage of the study area.
Population and indigenous peoples
The sparsely populated study area in Bolivia is concentrated in six urban settlements, with a
combined population of less than 50,000 inhabitants - Pail6n, San Josd de Chiquitos, Robore, El
Carmen, Puerto Suarez, and Puerto Quijarro. There are three indigenous groups located within
the study area: the Ayoreos, Chiquitanos, and the Izozefno Guaranis. The Ayoreos have a semi-
nomadic culture and inhabit the areas located along the Santa Cruz-Puerto Suarez railroad. The
Chiquitanos reside primarily in areas located in the vicinity of San Jose de Chiquitos. The
Izozenios live along the Parapeti River in the area of the Bafnados de Izozog. The twenty-two
communities in Izozeino Guarani group, with a total of 7500 people, are well organized and
constitute the Capitania del Altoy Bajo Izozog (CABI).
In Brazil, the population in the indirect influence area of the pipeline is approximately seven
million, with over 90%  being concentrated in urban areas.  The demographic density is
approximately 50 inhabitants per square kilometer. There are four indigenous groups in the
pipeline area, three located in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and one in Santa Catarina. The
indigenous lands of Mato Grosso do Sul are a territory of the Terena Indians, with a population of
approximately 3500. These indigenous people have had many years of contact with other groups
of Brazilian society and have integrated into the regional life as agricultural and urban workers.
The Guarani Nandeva Indians in the state of Santa Catarina have historically lived a semi-nomadic
life, existing upon hunting, fishing and subsistence agriculture. This social organization is
changing, and the few remaining Indians are concentrated in one family unit living in the area of
Palhoca. It is not anticipated that there will be any resettlement either in the Bolivian or Brazilian
sector due to the pipeline project.
Economy
The Bolivian macroeconomy faced a deep crisis in the mid-80's. Inflation rose to 24,000 percent
in 1985. However, since 1985, Bolivia's economy has stabilized, and the country has maintained
the lowest comparable inflation rate in South America.
The main sources of income for the population in the Bolivian study area are agriculture,
ranching, various government institutions, and trade. The area around Pail6n has fairly fertile soil,
and the majority of the population is employed by large scale agroindustrial farms. In San Jose de
Chiquitos and Robor6, the majority of the urban population is employed by the government, the
railroad, or various commercial establishments.  Ranching also contributes to these local
economies. El Carmen has a 60% unemployment rate. Employment is available primarily

through the logging concessions in the area and cattle ranching. Due to their proximity to the
Brazilian border, the economies of Puerto Quijarro and Puerto Suarez are based almost
exclusively on activities involving border trade.
Brazil also faced a severe economic crisis during the 1980s, but since July, 1994 the economy has
stabilized. In the Brazilian study area there is great economic diversity, with some municipalities
being typically agricultural or pasture land and others very industrialized. In Mato Grosso do Sul
ranching is the predominant economic activity, followed by annual crops like soybeans and wheat.
Border trade also contributes to the local economy in Corumba. Sao Paulo is the most
industrialized state in Brazil, with a concentration of industrial activity in the Arauquaria/
Paulinia/Campinas area. Production of sugar cane and citrus crops are also important sources of
revenue in this state. The economies of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul are
primarily based upon industry, services, and agriculture.
Education
Basic education in the Bolivian study area region consists of a limited number of pre-schools,
primary schools, and high schools. The Mennonite colonies, primarily in the western portion of
the study area, have implemented their own educational systems based mainly on their cultural
and religious beliefs. Because the area is rural, there are a limited number of technical schools, and
due to the lack of universities, the majority of the population does not have access to higher
education.
In Brazil the educational infrastructure is reasonably proficient because the pipeline route crosses
some of the most developed states in Brazil. There are many universities, concentrated in the
larger cities. The better universities are owned by the state, although there are many private
institutions. There are fewer schools in the rural areas which are typically owned by the State,
and they have a larger student-teacher ratio. The best primary and secondary schools are typically
privately owned.
Health and Safety
The medical facilities in the villages in Bolivia are comprised of small, minimally-equipped
hospitals and first aid posts. The medical work force is limited, with often only one physician and
one or two nurses, supported by several midwives located throughout the region. The most
common diseases are dysentery, malaria, lung infections, parasites, bronchopneumonia, measles,
and tuberculosis. There is a high rate of infant mortality as a result of poor living conditions,
deficient health care and education services, and diseases such as dysentery and malaria.
Medical facilities in most of the project area in Brazil are fairly well equipped, and the medical
staff is generally well trained. The most common diseases are hepatitis, dengue fever and parasitic
diseases. In Mato Grosso do Sul there is also an incidence of malaria, yellow fever and rabies.

Annex 13
Cultural and Archeological Resources
The "Ethnic, Territorial, and Archeological Map of Bolivia" does not indicate any cultural or
archeological resources in the study area. However, literature research has identified a limited
number of sites in the general area, none of which are in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline
route. The most important historical sites in the region are the Jesuits Cathedral and the Santa
Cruz la Vieja National Historic Park, both of which are located in San Jose de Chiquitos.
In Brazil, much of the project area of influence has a high archeological potential due to its
historical occupation by indigenous people. There are 615 known archaeological sites in the
municipalities located within the five states traversed by the pipeline, most of which are outside
the direct influence area of the pipeline. In Mato Grosso do Sul, there is a predominance of
earthen archaeological sites. In Sao Paulo, most of the sites are stone, while in Parana 96% of the
archaeological sites are ceramic. In the State of Santa Catarina and -Rio Grande do Sul, there is a
predominance of sambaquis and ceramic sites. The most significant buildings of historical interest
are generally located in the main towns. The majority of these churches, homes, monuments and
squares are protected on a state and municipal level.
5.0   Analysis of Alternatives
Various siting and construction alternatives have been evaluated for both the Bolivian and
Brazilian sectors of the project. The final route was determined to best balance overall impacts to
the human, biological, and physical environment while achieving its overall gas transportation
purpose.
Bolivia
Two alternate routes for the Bolivian sector were evaluated by CUMAT in a study performed in
1990. The first alternative was a route running parallel to an existing railroad between Pail6n and
Puerto Suarez. Under this alternative, the pipeline would run adjacent to or through the
populated centers of Pail6n, San Jose de Chiquitos, Robore, El Carmen, and Puerto Suirez. The
second alternative followed a relatively straight route from the Rio Grande Gas Plant to Puerto
Suarez, across the Bolivian Chaco region. The second alternative was preferred from an
environmental perspective, mainly because it traverses relatively homogeneous terrain and avoids
areas of slope instability along the southern foothills of the Sierras Chiqutanas. This alternative is
shorter in distance and impacts less area of undisturbed forest and marshland. During the
Environmental Impact Study performed in 1996 this route was further evaluated and modified to
minimie potential environmental impacts, especially in areas of high environmental sensitivity
such as the Cafion de la Victoria.
Brazil
Numerous alternatives have been considered in finalizing the pipeline route in Brazil. In defining
the route, the goal has been to minimize potential environmental impacts by avoiding steep slopes,

Annex 13
areas of primary and secondary vegetation, protected areas, and urban areas. A notable example
of how alternative routing was selected to minimize environmental impacts is in the Pantanal. The
original route was 40 km North of BR-262, in a sensitive area of the Pantanal. The route was
moved South into a previously impacted area parallel to the highway in order to minimnize
environmental impacts. In the State of Santa Catarina, the original route passed within 50 meters
of mines in coal exploitation area. The route was diverted to avoid these mining areas. Satellite
imagery and aerial photography have been carefully evaluated to fine-tune the route and avoid
fragmentation of forested areas and other areas of primary vegetation.
No Project
The "no project" alternative was also evaluated. If the project is not implemented, potential
adverse impacts on the human, biological and physical environments as a result of the proposed
project would not occur. However, there would be no potential positive impacts realized as a
result of project implementation such as improved air quality due to use of clean burning natural
gas in Brazil, increased employment opportunities, improved area infrastructure, and especially
the generation of public revenues that can be used for health and education in Bolivia.
6.0   Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impacts in the Bolivian sector were analyzed using a combination of matrices, modeling, and map
overlays using Geographic Information System (GIS). An impact identification matrix was used
to determine associations between the project activities and the environmental parameters, based
on predicted modifications to the existing environmental conditions as a result of construction and
operation of the project. For each possible combination of activity and environmental parameter,
an assessment was made as to whether the baseline condition of a given environmental parameter
is likely to be modified by the project activity. The GIS-based map overlays were used in the
quantification of the impacts on individual environmental parameters such as soils and vegetation.
6.1   Physical Environment
Air Quality and Noise
Impacts to air quality during the construction phase will be temporary and localized. An air screen
mr.odel of the four proposed compressor stations in Bolivia was run using the SCREEN3 simulator
program. The model predicted the project in-stack emissions rates for PM1o, S02, and No, will be
well below the World Bank Emission Guidelines for gas turbine sources and Bolivian air emission
standards. No exceedance of the World Bank Guidelines for ambient air quality were predicted
for any of the pollutants modeled. However, the model did predict a minor exceedance of the

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 13
Bolivian 1-hour and 24-hour national ambient air quality standards for No. Identical equipment
will be used for the compressor stations in Brazil.
To prevent or minimize potential air quality impacts, the following measures will be applied.
Where available, water will be used to wet construction areas for dust control. All engines will be
properly maintained to minimize emissions of contaminants.  Detail design will consider
modifications to stack height and other parameters related to the operation of the compressor
stations to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
The noise from camps and construction activities along the pipeline alignment and the compressor
station sites could affect wildlife and human settlements. This impact will be minimal and
temporary. Compressor stations have been sited to avoid heavily populated and sensitive wildlife
areas, which will minimize noise impacts during operations. Workers will be exposed to noise
generated by compressor station equipment which will be mitigated by utilizing hearing protection
devices.
Due to the substitution of clean-burning natural gas in Brazil other less attractive fossil fuels such
as medium and heavy fuel oils with some sulfur content, there will be a reduction in the levels of
atmospheric pollution, particularly in the metropolitan and industrial areas. Air pollution levels in
most urban areas were predicted for project and non-project conditions. Unlike oil and coal,
natural gas contains little sulfur, which produces sulfur dioxide emissions upon combustion.
Nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions and particulates emitted from the burning of natural
gas are also lower compared to coal and oil. The increased availability of natural gas in Brazil will
result in an improvement in air quality through replacement of alternative fuels which are more
polluting sources of energy.
Geology, Geomorphology and Soils
The prmary impact of the project on soils is an increase in erosion potential in areas where soil
becomes exposed by vegetation removal and areas where soils are physically disturbed by
trenching, spoil piling, and backfiuling. Because the majority of the pipeline in Bolivia will
traverse relatively flat areas with natural vegetation cover and low precipitation, it is anticipated
that the potential for erosion will be low. The erosion potential is somewhat higher in some areas
of Brazil, due to topographical features. Highly limited areas, from a construction point of view,
such as hill slopes greater than 30 degrees, and terrains subject to erosion will be avoided where
possible. To control erosion, appropriate erosion prevention and control techniques will be
employed during construction, as described in the Environmental Construction Plan developed for
this project.
Some areas will be replanted with natural vegetation to inhibit erosion. However, due to the
limited rainfall in much of the Bolivian project area, the recovery of native vegetation and
restabilization of disturbed areas will be a slow process. Vegetation recovery will be rapid in
-19-



Projed Appraisal Document                                                                    Page 99

Annex 13
areas of higher precipitation. In some areas, the adjacent vegetation will serve as a barrier
against wind and as a source of seeds for natural revegetation to occur.  Overall, the erosion
potential is considered minimal as the right-of-way will disturb only a very narrow strip of soil.
Cambrian outcrops in the Puerto Suarez area, mountainous areas principally in the State of
Parana, and the rocky plateau in the Aparados da Serra may necessitate blasting, but this should
not have a significant effect on the geomorphology with the implementation of managed blasting
procedures. Soil compaction will be minimized through application of soil restoration techniques
during final grading. Due to low levels of seismic activity and the absence of known, active faults
in the study area, the potential for damage to project facilities resulting from a seismic event is
negligible.
The final alignment of the pipeline route in Brazil was delineated to avoid numerous mining sites.
In cooperation with the National Department of Mineral Production (DNPM), attempts will be
made to place restrictions on mining licenses granted in the future to avoid interference with the
pipeline. Project sponsors will work with IBAMA and the DNPM to develop a Minerals
Investigation Program to precisely identify the location of valuable mineral deposits.
Hydrology and Water Resources
For each significant river crossing, detailed studies of its hydrological conditions have been
conducted to determine the best crossing method. To minimize sedimentation in water bodies and
disturbance to wetland areas, controlled procedures for wetland and water body crossings will be
implemented. Most of the river and stream crossings will be constructed using open-cut methods
which could suspend sediment in the streams. However, many of the rivers to be crossed are
shallow and carry heavy sediment loads, and the additional load is expected to be temporary and
localized. Clearing of vegetation, trenching and storage of topsoil in the study area may also
result in increased soil erosion and sediment load carried by surface runoff from the disturbed
areas. The Paraguay and Itajai-Acu rivers have very active beds and will be crossed by directional
drilling which will eliminate the potential for sedimentation.
During the peak construction period, more than 1,600 persons will be on the project in Bolivia in
various locations. Potable water for these workers will be withdrawn from wells at multiple
locations installed at depths ranging from lOOm to 200 m. The groundwater resources of these
aquifers are recharged mainly by infiltration of rainwater, and the expected annual recharge is
relatively high. Therefore, impacts from groundwater withdrawal to meet the domestic water
requirements of the project are considered less than significant. Aquifer mixing will be prevented
by properly casing the wells. -In Brazil it will not be necessary to drill water wells for potable
water.
The majority of the water used for hydrotesting the pipeline is expected to be withdrawn from
surface waters. To mitigate impacts to aquatic life, volumes of water for hydrotesting will be
limited The pipeline will be tested in 20-30 km segments, requiring withdrawal of approximately
15,000 m3 per test segment. Thus, the impact of withdrawals from surface waters is considered
less than significant.

Annex 13
Groundwater and surface water quality will be protected through the implementation of
appropriate spill prevention and control measures. Potential impacts will be avoided or minimized
by applying proper techniques to manage and dispose of hazardous materials. Domestic and
sanitary wastewater generated at work camps and pipe storage yards will be treated prior to
disposal.  Extended aeration package plants or conventional septic system  drains will be
constructed to provide treatment. Impacts are not expected to be significant due to the short
construction period and relatively small volume of discharge anticipated.
6.2   Biological Environment
Flora
Throughout most of the proposed pipeline corridor in Bolivia, a five meter wide strip of
vegetation was cleared in 1993 in preparation for route survey and project implementation.
Additional impacts will result from expansion of the cleared area to a width of 30 meters for
pipeline construction. In most areas of the pipeline corridor, native herbaceous and shrubby
species are expected to revegetate naturally following completion of pipeline construction. Due
to the nature of the soils and dry climatic conditions, revegetation of the pipeline corridor in the
Chaco may require more time than the remainder of the corridor. The Aeolic Plain will be
replanted to expedite revegetation in this area. There will be a permanent loss of forested canopy
in the 17-meter wide permanent corridor, but the canopy will return to the portion of the right-of-
way which is not required for maintenance of the pipeline.
In Brazil 85% of the area cirossed by the gas pipeline has been previously impacted by human
activity. Remnants of original vegetation affected by the project are found in only 15% of the
area, and only 7% of these areas will not readily regenerate. Where appropriate, areas will be
replanted with native species collected from surrounding areas. This will be done in the Pantanal
Matogrossence in areas of Chaquena vegetation, in the Araucarias Plateau and the Aluvial Pioner
Formation. Workers involved in the project will be instructed about the importance of preserving
natural vegetation, and construction activities will be monitored to ensure this is done.
Fauna
Potential impacts affecting animal populations include the following:
*  Permanent loss or fragmentation of wildlife habitat.
* Disturbance to important habitat elements such as breeding, foraging, and cover areas.
* Displacement of individual animals during construction or maintenance.
* Temporary disruption of movement patterns of animals across the right-of-way.
* Direct loss of wildlife from construction activities or increased hunting pressure
The most substantial wildlife impact associated with the project will be the conversion of habitat
in the permanent maintenance corridor. However, along portions of the right-of-way which were
previously cleared for route survey, additional impacts will be minimal, due to the fact that
-21-

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brzil Gas Pipeline
Annex 13
impacts to faunal species have already occurred. Clearing of vegetative cover in the right-of-way
will affect the nesting and foraging habitat for some wildlife species, but this impact will be
minfimized by restricting the permanent right-of-way strip to a narrow corridor.
Additional impacts on wildlife include disturbance, displacement, and mortality during
construction. These impacts will be minimized by training the work force regarding protection of
natural resources, including wildlife. Construction activities will be carried out as quickly as
possible to diminish exposure time. The construction area will be monitored, and animals which
may fall into the pipeline trench will be rescued.
Aquatic species in the area of the Pantanal, floodplains and major river systems are expected to be
adversely impacted by high turbidity generated by construction activities. However, impacts are
expected to be short-term. Fish species and mobile reptilian and mammalian species will likely
move out of the area temporarily, but should return following completion of construction
activities. Non-mobile species including benthic invertebrates and any bivalves will be eliminated
in the construction corridor, but are expected to recolonize impacted areas quickly from
surrounding areas.
To minimize loss of wildlife during construction, hunting and fishing by construction crews will be
strictly forbidden. Intruders will be prohibited from entering wildlife areas during construction.
Although the pipeline corridor will open access to previously undeveloped areas which might
increase hunting activities, this wi1l be controlled in the operations phase through the use of signs,
fences and barricades.
Species of Concern
Impacts to terrestrial and wetland/aquatic plant and animal species identified as species of special
concern are expected to be minimal and temporary. Temporary displacement of some species
from the construction area will occur, and for some species movement across the right-of-way
will be hampered during construction activities. After completion of construction, however, the
right-of-way will be allowed to naturally revegetate as much as possible, and affected species of
special concern are expected to return. To mitigate impacts to the wildlife populations, hunting
will be strictly prohibited for anyone associated with pipeline construction and maintenance
operations. Impacts to the population of protected floral species are expected to be insignificant.
Protected Areas and Areas of Environmental Sensitivity
Project activities will be conducted in the vicinity of two protected areas in Bolivia. the
Integrated Management Area of the Gran Chaco National Park and the Historical National Park
Santa Cruz La Vieja Direct impacts in the Gran Chaco will be limited to clearing of the right-of-
way. Secondary impacts may include the risk of colonization of areas in and around the park due
to the establishment and maintenance of the right-of-way; however, this potential is deemed low.
Indirectly, the possibility of increased hunting pressure within the park boundaries exists, and
specific measures will be implemented to prevent it.

Annex 13
The access road from San Jose de Chiquitos to the right-of-way traverses the Santa Cruz La Vieja
park. The park will be affected by road improvement work and increased traffic in the area. To
mitigate any potential adverse impacts, the area will be closely monitored, and access to the park
will be controlled. The work force will be educated in the significance of the park to Bolivia's
national heritage and the necessity to protect this historic site.
The project sponsors propose to make a contribution to Bolivia's National Endowment Fund as
an offset mitigation for direct and potential indirect impacts of the project. Revenues from the
contribution will be earmarked for the management of parks in the Department of Santa Cruz
funded through this program, primarily the Gran Chaco National Park. Administration of the
funds will be managed by Bolivia's National Secretary of Natural Resources and the Environment.
In addition, one of the camps will be strategically placed in order to be used as a control facility
by the park administration after construction is finished.
To develop a plan to minimize potential environmental impacts in the Pantanal, extensive
environmental studies have been completed. The route was finalized in this area based upon
technical analysis and environmental considerations. For the most part, the pipeline will run
parallel to an existing highway. Seasonal considerations and implementation of specialized
environmental construction techniques and will further mitigate any adverse impacts.
The Mata Atlantica is a fragmented region in which areas of high ecological significance are
interspersed with areas of low sensitivity. The route through this area was carefully selected to
avoid environmentally significant areas to the extent possible, and additional impacts are expected
to be minimal.  Where environmentally sensitive areas cannot be avoided, they will be
compensated through an ecological compensation program.
After a comprehensive evaluation, it was recommended that potential impacts of soil erosion in
the Aparados da Serra be mitigated by utilization of specialized construction techniques.
6.3   Impacts on the Socioeconomic Environment
Land Use
Some changes in land use are expected to occur as a result of project implementation. However,
the Project Sponsors plan to restore land as much as possible to its pre-project condition.
Conversion of land from existing uses such as farming and grazing has the greatest potential to
create adverse social and economic impacts to rural households. Temporary conversion of land to
support pipeline and facility construction may result in the loss of one to two years' use for crops
and grazing. Landowners will be compensated for their losses. Little of the land along the
pipeline route, storage yard or camp locations is currently under human use, so this impact is
expected to be minimal. Project facilities have been sited to avoid areas of socioeconomic value
as much as possible.

Brazil: Gas Sector Development Project - Bolwia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Annex 13
The project will create an increase in vehicular traffic, primarily during the construction phase.
This impact will be mitigated by upgrading the access roads to work sites, camps and storage
areas. Signs will be posted on access roads, and communities will be informed about traffic
conditions.
The possibility exists for indirect land use impacts due to utilization of portions of the right-of-
way as a trail or road, which may promote illegal trade, increase mobilization and colonization
pressure. However, the project does not intend that the right-of-way be used as an access road
and will provide measures to prevent such use. Signs, barriers and gates will be installed, and the
area will be monitored on a regular basis. Furthermore, the project will contribute to the in-situ
protection of parks and reserves.
Population
Perhaps the most sensitive social issue related to the project is the a small and temporary increase
in population during the construction phase due to the influx of workers. Impacts to the local
populations will be minimized by siting camps away from smaller towns and utilizing local labor
as much as possible. While workers will be housed in camps along the right-of-way, it is expected
that they will visit the main population centers in search of relaxation and entertainment during
work breaks. Environmental and social behaviour codes of conduct will be enforced in all camps.
One of the primary areas expected to be impacted is El Carmen in Bolivia, where an 800-person
camp will be located. The presence of the working crew will be continuous, adding to the
demand for services in this town. El Carmen should experience an overall positive impact from
the improvement of the water and electrical supply to support camp activities.
The project will increase the risk of accidents to the population due to the transportation and
distribution of gas. This risk will primarily affect the population living in the immediate vicinity of
the pipeline. The pipeline will include design factors to mitigate safety risk. Risk Management
and Emergency Response plans will be developed and implemented to respond to unexpected
events.
Indigenous peoples
The project could potentially impact the indigenous people in Bolivia by opening up previously
inaccessible areas of forest, which would reduce the forest areas available for indigenous use.
However, since the right-of-way was partially cleared in 1993, no evidence of colonization has
been detected. Therefore, this impact is considered insignificant.
Impacts to indigenous groups have been further mitigated by the establishment of the Gran Chaco
National Park, which gives legal protection to the core territory of these groups. Through a
contribution to Bolivia's National Endowment Fund, interest earnings will be designated to
benefit the management of the Gran Chaco National Park by subsidizing park rangers and the
construction of ranger stations.

An indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) was developed for the Bolivian segment. This
plan includes programs such as land titling, water supply, health, and education. Perhaps the most
important component is support to land titling activities. This plan is being negotiated with the
indigenous communities. On the Brazilian side, an IPDP is being developed for the Terena and
Guarani Nandeva groups.
Community Relations
The project will maintain a Community Relations program to promote good relations with the
communities in the influence area of the project, as well as providing environmental education and
information. Preference will be given to local hiring. Impacts on local populations are considered
to be minimal and temporary. No displacement of households is anticipated for the project.
Economy
The project will provide substantial direct financial revenues to Bolivia and Brazil through the sale
and purchase of natural gas. Additional revenues will be generated through taxes on local goods
and services. This economic impact will benefit both countries on a national, regional and
municipal level throughout the life of the project.
The project will employ several thousand Bolivian and Brazilian nationals during peak
construction of the pipeline, some of whom will be retained as operations and maintenance
personnel. This increased employment will improve the local economy, primarily on a short-term
basis during construction.
Urban areas will experience some increase in the demand for goods and services from pipeline
construction and operations personnel, which will be a positive impact of the project. The
potential exists for inflationary prices, which would have a negative impact on local residents, but
this potential is not considered to be significant.
Health and Safety
Medical facilities in the urban areas will be upgraded to provide adequate medical care for
personnel involved in the pipeline construction. This will have a positive impact on the available
health care for local populations. With the temporary influx of people during construction, there
may be an increase in contagious diseases, particularly sexually transmitted diseases. This adverse
impact will be mitigated through education programs, initial and periodic health examinations and
prophylactic health care. The increased risk of parasitic diseases such as malaria will be mitigated
by chemoprophylaxis programs.
A Construction Safety Plan has been prepared to provide explicit instructions for accident
prevention, occupational health, and construction safety procedures. The manual will apply to all
contractor and subcontractor personnel as well as project personnel.

Annex 13
Archaeology
No potentially significant impacts to cultural, archeological, or historical resources have been
identified in the area of direct influence of the gas pipeline. However, an Accidental Discovery
Plan has been developed to provide guidance in the event such resources are encountered during
construction. An archeologist will be present during construction in areas with a high potential
for archeological or cultural resources. Any artifacts discovered will be reported and/or salvaged
in accordance with applicable governmental requirements and the Project Archeological Plan.
Upstream and Cumulative Impacts
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was carried out per request of the lending
institutions. Perhaps the most sensitive upstream impact of the project is related to increased
exploration and exploitation of new gas developments in Bolivia. In order to fill the capacity of
the pipeline (30 million m3/day) it will be necessary to develop new reserves in addition to the
proven reserves of 18 million. The most promising areas are located in highly sensitive regions
(Yungas and Chaco) including vulnerable ecosystems and indigenous peoples (more than 19
groups). Seismic studies, exploratory wells, new pipelines, access roads, and the influx of
workers, will pose serious risks on natural systems and indigenous groups. Existing institutional
capacity to manage this type of situations is still weak in Bolivia. Although technological and
management strategies exist to minimize environmental and social impacts from gas and oil
exploration in sensitive areas, the "fast track" exploration could result in serious environmental
and social degradation in those areas. An environmental management plan for the most sensitive
areas will be prepared during project implementation with terms of reference approved by the
lending institutions. Regulations for oil and gas activities in indigenous territories have already
been prepared under a World Bank Technical Assistance Project.
The SEA also concluded that the synergy of the gas pipeline with other macro-projects in the
region is relatively low therefore cumulative impacts will not be significant. For instance, the
exploitation of iron and manganese in Bolivia and Brazil has a strong linkage with the Hidrovia
project but a weak one with the gas pipeline. Expansion of soybean agriculture in Bolivia presents
a strong synergy with the paving of the Santa Cruz - Puerto Suarez road and the Hidrovia but not
with the gas pipeline.
7.0   Public Consultation Program
In accordance with Bolivian and Brazilian regulations, public consultation programs were
conducted during the preparation of the Environmental Impact Studies for the Bolivia-Brazil Gas
Pipeline project in each country. In addition, project sponsors have been involved in numerous
informal sessions to discuss project issues with the people.
In Bolivia project sponsors held a series of public meetings and visitations with government
authorities, non-governmental organizations, organizations of indigenous peoples, and affected
communities. Sponsor representatives participated in the program, which was attended by
approximately 850-900 people. The meetings in six affected municipalities followed an interactive

approach to identify and discuss environmental issues associated with the project.  This
consultation assisted with identification of possible project impacts, reconciliation of opposing
views about the project, discussion of licensing requirements, and promotion of understanding of
the nature and extent of any social or environmental impacts. The indigenous peoples
development plan was subject of intensive consultation with indigenous organizations.
The primary concerns of the Bolivian people were employment and basic needs such as water and
electricity. These concerns are being taken into account in project planning. Preference will be
given to utilizing local labor in the project. To the extent possible, water wells drilled for the
project will be left for use of the people, and consideration is being given to donating electrical
generators to some of the communities upon completion of construction.
In Brazil, numerous meetings have been held with municipal, state and federal government bodies,
the scientific community and the concerned population to discuss the project. Interviews have
been conducted with community leaders, and extensive research has been done in museums,
universities, and various institutions.  Videos have been presented, brochures have been
distributed, and presentations made in an attempt to inform the population about the project and
resolve any concerns.
As prescribed in Brazilian regulations, a Summary of the Environmental Impact Assessment
(RIMA) must be available for public review for at least forty-five days. For the Brazilian sector
of the Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline Project, this announcement of the availability of the RIMA was
published in the official State journal and in the major regional and local newspapers in each
affected State. Public audiences were held in each State to provide local citizens an opportunity
to evaluate the project's environmental aspects and resolve public concerns.
8.0   Environmental Management
A comprehensive Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been developed, to serve as a
master planning and management tool for the project. The plan establishes guidelines and
procedures to manage the environmental aspects of the project. Included in the plan are
environmental construction procedures, spill prevention and control, waste and hazardous
materials management, air quality protection and noise control, vegetation and wildlife protection,
and cultural resources management. Community relations, training, inspection, monitoring,
impact mitigation are also addressed. Ecological and socioeconomic compensation programs are
described in great detail. Indigenous peoples development plans are an integral component of the
management plan.
To implement the Plan, an environmental organization and budget has been established within the
Project Management organization. This organization includes: (i) an environmental consultant
firm will supervise environmental compliance during construction as well as manage the
implementation of all ecological and socio-economic compensation programs and indigenous
peoples development plans; and (ii) an independent environmental auditor will audit works and
environmental supervision and management and will report directly to the World Bank and the
IDB. Terms of reference for both activities were approved by the lending institutions. The

environmental auditor will prepare audit reports every two months which will be sent to the
lending institutions, NGOs and community organizations. NGO representatives will be entitled to
participate of audit visits and periodic workshops to discuss audit reports will be held in selected
cities and towns along the pipeline.
Environmental training will be provided to all employees prior to commencement of work. New
workers brought to the project after the initiation of project activities will receive training as soon
as practicable following their arrival.
During construction, monitoring will be part of the inspection program.  Environmental
monitoring may include, but not be limited to erosion control, water quality, protected wildlife
species, cultural resources, social problems, water resources, vegetation, and protected areas.
As part of the management of the project, the sponsors will maintain a community relations
program aimed at promoting good relations with the communities in the area of influence of the
project, as well as providing environmental education and increasing awareness about the project
and the environment.
The Environmental Construction Plan outlines basic environmental construction procedures that
will be used to construct the pipeline and describes impact minimization techniques that will be
employed during and after construction.  These procedures are designed to protect the
environment and to minimize potential effects of the pipeline construction. The Plan includes
standard construction procedures and specialized techniques designed for use only as required
under specific circumstances.
Environmental impacts of the project will be further mitigated through following procedures
established in plans for "Spill Prevention and Control" and "Waste and Hazardous Materials
Management". Specific procedures will be established to minimize direct and indirect impacts to
vegetation and wildlife. A plan has also been developed to provide guidance in the event of an
accidental discovery of cultural resources or human remains.
9.0   Conclusions
The majority of the pipeline route in Bolivia is in an area of low environmental sensitivity, and the
probability of significant adverse environmental impacts is expected to be minimal. In Brazil 85%
of the area of influence has already been impacted by human activity. Additional impacts of the
project are expected to be minimal, and most negative impacts will be mitigated.
*  The most significant impacts identified will occur during the construction stage, most of them
being temporary and reversible.
*  Throughout most of the study area, the physical and biological environment appears to be
resilient to the type and magnitude of impacts anticipated from this project. The primary
direct impact in most of the route will result from clearing the right-of-way. In Bolivia.

Annex 13
*  The most environmentally sensitive areas within the project study area are 1) the Gran Chaco
Park in Bolivia, due to its protected status, large biological resources, indigenous populations,
and biogeographic status, 2) the Pantanal Complex in Brazil, due to its species diversity, 3)
the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, due to its primary vegetation and protected status, and 4) the
Aparados da Serra in Brazil, due to its high erosion potential. Measures will be taken to
mitigate or compensate for any adverse impacts to these areas.
* The population in the study area of the Bolivian sector is small, and throughout much of the
area land use is sparse, partly due to limited land use capability associated with poor soil
quality, low precipitation, and a lack of readily available surface and groundwater. Native,
undisturbed vegetation is prevalent throughout much of the study area. Socioeconomic
impacts of the project are not expected to be significant.
*  The proposed pipeline alignment was selected to avoid areas of slope instability, populated
areas, and environmentally sensitive or protected areas. The route was determined to best
balance the overall impacts to the human, biological, and physical environment while achieving
the project's main purpose, which is to transport natural gas from production fields in Bolivia
to markets in Brazil through an environmentally acceptable and economically viable
transportation system. As a result of the Environmental Assessments, the route was further
refined to avoid areas of potential environmental sensitivity.
*  The principal positive impacts anticipated in the project area of influence are 1) an
improvement in air quality in Brazil's industrial and metropolitan areas, 2) an increase in
revenues for Bolivia from the sale of gas to Brazil, 3) redistribution of tax revenues back into
the area of influence of the project, 4) a temporary increase in employment within the study
area, 5) an increase in the demand for goods and services in the study area, and 6) an increase
in funds allocated for management of protected park areas.
*  The principal negative impacts anticipated in the project area of influence are 1) the removal
of vegetation and wildlife habitat along the right-of-way, 2) an increase in the potential for
erosion, sedimentation, and hydrology disruption due to project construction activities, 3) the
potential for increased hunting pressure on species of special concern, 4) the potential for
promoting colonization of undisturbed areas, and 5) the potential disruption of the hydrologic
patterns in the rivers and Bafiados.
*  Perhaps the most sensitive upstream impact of the project is the increased gas exploration and
exploitation in sensitive areas in Bolivia. Environmental management plans for these areas will
be designed during project implementation. Further institutional strengthening in
environmental management and enforcement will be necessary.
* Cumulative impacts will be relatively insignificant. The project does not present strong
linkages with other regional development projects.

*  During the detail design phase of the project, procedures and design parameters will be refined
to respond fully to concerns identified in the Environmental Impact Assessments. Project
sponsors will continue participation in public consultation to evaluate public concerns as they
relate to the final design and execution of the project.
*  An Environmental Management Plan and various environmental programs and I.P.D. plans
will be implemented to provide appropriate mitigation of unavoidable impacts and lower the
significance of negative impacts to acceptable levels.
The project is environmentally achievable, as its negative impacts can be satisfactorily mitigated,
in order to reach a balance between economic growth and ecological preservation, in accordance
with the goals of sustainable development. However, there will be a need for continued
monitoring throughout the project life to ensure these objectives are maintained.
