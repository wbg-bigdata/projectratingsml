Federative Republic of Brazil
Gas Sector Development Project - Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline
Partial Credit Guarantee for US$180 million Notes
INTRODUCTION
1.    This memorandum seeks the approval of the Board to provide an IBRD Partial Credit
Guarantee (PCG) for private placement of Notes of US$180 million for the Gas Sector
Development Project -- Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline (the Project). The Government of Brazil has
requested Bank support to mobilize financing to provide a PCG for the Project and has
confirmed that it would provide an indemnity to the Bank. The Project is also being supported
by a World Bank loan of US$130 million that was approved on December 18, 19971, and
became effective on May 17, 1999. The financing plan of the Project considered by the Board
included the provision of a PCG.
2.    According to the original schedule, Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil
S.A. (TBG), the special purpose project company for the Brazilian section of the pipeline had
planned to go to the market with the private placement of the Notes issue by September 1998.
However, by the time a formal approval to process the issuance of the Notes was obtained in
Brazil by mid 1998, the capital markets had started to deteriorate in the wake of the Asian crisis.
The Asian crisis was followed by the Russian crisis during which period the capital markets were
closed to all emerging market credits. The Brazilian crisis followed, resulting in high volatility
of Brazilian spreads in the capital markets. With the improvement in market conditions,
subsequently, a Request for Proposals (RFP) to select an arranger for the proposed Notes was
issued in October 1999. In October 2000, a Road Show was organized by the placement agent
(Credit Suisse First Boston or CSFB) to present the Notes transaction to prospective investors.
Representatives from TBG, the Bank, and CSFB participated in the Road Show. This
memorandum provides details on the current status of the Project and the proposed structure of
the PCG Notes.
PROJECT STATUS
3.    The Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline is a joint undertaking promoted by the governments of
Bolivia and Brazil, and developed initially by both Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos
(YPFB), a Bolivian state company tasked to manage gas export contracts with Argentina and
Brazil, and Petr6leo Brasileiro S.A. (PETROBRAS), the Brazilian state company for oil and gas.
The Project is comprised of a natural gas pipeline 3150 kilometers (km) long that begins in Rio
Grande, Bolivia and reaches the Bolivia-Brazil border after some 557 km using a 32 inch
diameter pipe. The Bolivia-Brazil pipeline extends from Rio Grande, Bolivia, through the
Brazilian States of Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do
Sul. Its purpose is to transport natural gas from Bolivia to customers in Brazil. The 2,593 km
Brazilian portion of the pipeline includes a 32 inch diarneter pipeline from the border to a point
near Campinas, Brazil, with smaller diameter pipelines extending to Sao Paulo (24 inch
diameter) and to Porto Alegre (24 inch diameter reducing to 16 inch diameter). The pipeline and
related compression stations are designed to transport up to 30 million cubic meters per day
(MMcmd) of natural gas to a split-point near Campinas, with some of the gas flowing east to Sao
Paulo and beyond and the remainder flowing south from such point along the southern leg of the
Loan No. BR-4265, Project Appraisal Document - Report No. 16769-BR

pipeline to Porto Alegre. TBG owns the Brazilian portion of the pipeline and is responsible for
its construction, operation and maintenance.
4.    The construction of the pipeline has been satisfactorily completed within the estimated
costs. Despite the tight schedule, complexity and the adverse conditions, the Project has faced
only minor delays. The Project is in compliance with the environmental and socio-economic
compensation programs. The trunkline, which spans from Rio Grande in Bolivia to Sao Paulo,
has been in commercial operation since July 1999; the southern leg, scheduled for completion in
a year after the operation of the trunkline, began operations in March 2000. The southern leg
was partially financed by the World Bank loan of US$130 million. It is estimated that the World
Bank loan would be disbursed completely by the end of this calendar year. In anticipation of the
issuance of the PCG Notes, the goods and services that were to be funded from the proceeds
from the Notes have been financed through short-term financing. The expenditures being
financed from the proceeds of the Notes were incurred for supply of equipment, materials and
construction of some sections of the trunkline and the southern leg, compressor stations, city
gates as well as construction management services. The utilization of the pipeline will
progressively increase as the gas market develops and transport capacity is expected to reach its
maximum capacity by 2004, much earlier than envisaged during appraisal of the Project.
5.    The existence of abundant and underutilized gas resources in Bolivia is the basis for the
development of the Project. The Project is of great importance to Bolivia as a major source of
export revenue. The Project's significance to Brazil derives from its need to find an
environmentally sound way to support its growing industrial base. The development of the gas
sector in Brazil establishes a platform to diversify the fuel mix away from high sulfur fuel oil,
thereby providing further environmental benefits. Gas transported by the pipeline will be
supplied to industrial and residential users in Brazil's principal cities, including Campo Grande,
Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba and Porto Alegre, as well as gas-fired thermal power plants
along the pipeline route.

6.    Beyond the value of the Project to Bolivia and Brazil, part of the reason that the Project
has received support from the Bank, IDB, EIB and CAF is its regional significance. The Project
is an important cornerstone for establishing a natural gas transportation infrastructure for the
Southern Cone of Latin America so as to create an energy matrix linking these resource-rich
countries (Argentina and Bolivia) with important demand centers (Brazil and Chile). When
combined with the pipeline infrastructure in neighboring countries, the effect of the Project is to
make Bolivia the natural gas hub of the Southern Cone of Latin America. Because of the
Project, additional connecting pipelines to transport supplemental gas volumes from Argentina
are already under development or in advanced feasibility stages. In addition, other pipelines,
possibly from Peru, are also expected to feed additional gas into Brazil within the next two
decades. When completed, these additional projects will create a natural gas transportation
system covering most of South America.
ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS IN BRAZIL
7.    Reform in the hydrocarbon sector was initiated with the constitutional amendment of
November 1995 that terminated the monopoly of PETROBRAS for the exploration,
transportation, import and export of oil and gas, and approval of the "Hydrocarbon Law" by the
Brazilian Congress in August 1997, that set the framework for the establishment of a free market
for the oil and gas industry. Under the Project, the World Bank also supported Brazil's policy of
progressively phasing out fuel subsidies and deregulating petroleum product prices. In 1998, the
Brazilian regulatory authority, Agencia Nacional do Petr6leo (ANP) was established pursuant to
the Hydrocarbon Law. Since its inception, the ANP has awarded two successful rounds of oil
and gas block concessions, with participation of major international oil companies, and issued a
series of essential regulations. The reforms undertaken by the government, including the
establishment of ANP as a respected entity, are facilitating the growth of the natural gas sector.
8.    While the Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline is of great importance to Bolivia for export
revenue, the pipeline's significance to Brazil derives from its potential to provide an
environmentally sound means of supporting its growing industrial base. As indicated in the chart
below, natural gas would considerably increase its share in the Brazilian energy matrix in a
relatively short time horizon.

9.    The demand for gas supplied through the Project is in line with the projections at the time
of its appraisal (1997), but is expected to rise sharply due to a sizable share of the expansion of
the electric generation being predicated on gas-fueled power plants. The demand in the first
semester of 2000 reached the level envisaged in the appraisal for end of 1999 (about 5 MMcmd);
while next year the demand (about 10 MMcmd) will be lower than foreseen in the appraisal (13
MMcmd) due to a delay in the closing of financing for the thermal electric program. This delay
in demand growth is expected to be for a short duration and it is estimated that the pipeline
throughput will reach 80% of the maximum capacity in 2003 (24 MMcmd compared to appraisal
forecast of 17 MMcmd).
10.   TBG, the Project company, was formed by PETROBRAS and five other leading
international energy companies to develop, construct, operate and maintain the pipeline to
transport natural gas in Brazil. The project sponsors represent a wide spectrum of companies,
including GASPETRO, a subsidiary of PETROBRAS, state-controlled Brazilian company and
private sector companies from Europe and North America (British Gas, El Paso, Enron,
TotalFinaElf and Shell). In addition to the investment in the pipeline, all of the TBG
shareholders have made significant investments in the region aside from TBG. This combination
of international experience, resources and commitment ensures that the Project has access to a
level of operating expertise that is seldom matched in other similar ventures. The ownership
structure of TBG in Brazil is as follows2:

11.   It is also noteworthy that Project sponsors participating in the Brazilian portion of the
pipeline are also involved in the ownership and operation of the interconnecting Bolivian
pipeline through shareholdings in Gas TransBoliviano S.A. (GTB), the Bolivian company
formed to develop, own and operate the Bolivian portion of the Pipeline. GTB is a joint venture
with 51% controlled by Transredes, and 34% equally shared by Shell and Enron, with the
remaining 15% held by GASPETRO (9%) and BBPP (6%). The cross ownership of the two
transportation companies helps ensure that a common interest in the success of the Project exists
among the owners of the pipelines.

SUMMARY OF CURRENT PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN
12.    The Project, which includes both Brazilian and Bolivian pipelines, is estimated to cost
about US$2,030 million. The project is being financed with equity and a Transportation
Capacity Option ("TCO")3 from PETROBRAS, as well as BNDES. Other key financiers include
the Bank, IDB, EIB and CAF. Approximately 80% of total project cost is related to the Brazil
portion of the pipeline. The debt/equity ratio for the Brazil portion is projected to be
approximately 60/40, with TCO payments included in the equity portion. As shown below, the
current financing plan of the Project is in line with the financing plan approved by the Board in
December 1997.

PROPOSED BANK GUARANTEE
13.    To complete the financing plan of the Project, it is proposed to issue Notes in the US
capital market supported by the Bank's PCG (see Annex I for the Term sheet) to mobilize
US$180 million. TBG has obtained short-term bridge loans to avoid project slippage to continue
the construction of the project with the understanding that the Bank would only provide the PCG
when the market conditions would make the issuance feasible. The guarantee will help catalyze
private financing for the project through debt financing from the capital markets. The proceeds
of the Notes issue would be used to reimburse the bridge financing used to pay for eligible
expenditures.
3The Project has created an option for an additional six MMcmd of firm capacity over and above the TCQ
(Transport Contract Quantities). PETROBRAS, as purchaser of the TCO has agreed to pay a total of US$383
million, of which about US$302 million would be used towards the initial construction of the pipeline in Brazil in
lieu of payment of future capacity charges.

14.   The proposed Notes instrument is a fixed rate issue of a maturity of 18 years, with the
principal amortizing over a three year period (years 16 to 18) in three equal installments. The
PCG of the World Bank would cover 100 percent of the amortizing principal repayment at
scheduled maturities, on a non-accelerable basis. In addition, the World Bank would also
guarantee two annual coupons on a rolling and non-accelerable basis. This particular structure
results in a substantially longer 'grace period' as compared with the grace period of 4-5 years for
a typical Bank loan, and an average life5 much longer to that of a Bank loan (currently estimated
to be about 7.4 years).
15.  In the proposed structure, two scheduled annual interest payments are separately
guaranteed by the World Bank. As described in detail in Annex I, the reinstatable or rolling
nature of each of the interest guarantees is contingent upon the World Bank being reimbursed by
TBG or Brazil. In the event the World Bank makes a payment under an interest guarantee, the
World Bank would have the option of demanding immediate reimbursement from TBG or Brazil
or extending repayment terms. In the case of two defaults by TBG on annual interest payments in
a scenario where the World Bank demanded immediate reimbursement, if TBG or Brazil did not
repay the World Bank within the stipulated 60-day period, the interest guarantees would fall
away and the Noteholders would face uncovered TBG interest payment risk i.e. project risk
thereafter. In circumstances where the World Bank elects to grant terms to Brazil for
reimbursement, the relevant interest guarantee would be reinstated only in the event the World
Bank receives full reimbursement of the interest payment made five days prior to the next annual
Notes interest payment date. Brazil is providing an indemnity to the World Bank for any
payments or liabilities incurred by the World Bank, however there is no sovereign guarantee
backing TBG obligations with respect to the Notes. The Noteholders are potentially exposed to
the interest payment risk on TBG for sixteen years (years 3 to 18). This is of significance
because TBG (51% owned by GASPETRO which is a fully owned subsidiary of PETROBRAS
and 49% owned by a consortium of private companies) is a single asset company, transporting
gas for a single buyer so far - PETROBRAS in Brazil - and it is perceived by the investors
that the credit risk of the project is higher than that of PETROBRAS and/or Brazil. Unlike
previous World Bank supported PCGs where the investors faced only the borrowing government
or parastatal credit risk, the Noteholders could also face some project risks.
RATIONALE AND BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED PARTIAL CREDIT GUARANTEE
16.   The Project has a long gestation period i.e. the gas market needs to be well established for
the Project to be sustainable in the long-term. Once the market is established, the project is
expected to generate revenues to maintain adequate financial ratios. TBG is unable to tap the
capital markets for US$180 million for long maturities on its own credit or with a sovereign
guarantee. In order to maintain acceptable debt service coverage, long-term and especially back
ended debt is essential, i.e. where the principal can be amortized in the last few years of the debt.
The Bank's guarantee support would result in significant additionality by mobilizing longer
maturities and narrower margins for the Project debt.
17.   Brazilian corporate credits have been experiencing difficulty in tapping the capital
markets particularly for longer maturities. Placement for the TBG Notes at spreads and maturity
that are financially acceptable to TBG is only feasible with an investment grade rating for the
issue. The IBRD rolling guarantee of two interest payments was essential to obtain an
Average Life is the average period of time the loan principal is disbursed and outstanding.

investment grade of BBB+6 for the Notes. This was required because of (i) the below investment
grade country credit; (ii) difficult market conditions; (iii) long tenor of the financing; and (iv) no
direct government guarantees on the Notes.
18.   Based on market feedback, indications are that the Bank's guarantee has resulted in
significant additionality in terms of mobilizing longer maturities and narrower margins for the
project debt. In summary, the proposed guarantee provides:
> Access to capital markets: This operation would enable TBG to obtain market financing
with reasonable spread and longer maturity with enhanced credit.
> Lengthening of maturity: In the current market situation, it is practically impossible for
TBG to go to the capital markets on reasonable terms for any maturity. This operation
enables TBG to extend its available financing considerably beyond current market terms to
18 years, with an extended grace period through a back-ended amortizing structure.
)  Competitive Financing Cost: Borrowing with the support of the World Bank Guarantee
has enabled TBG to obtain attractive terms on the borrowing, reflecting the credit
enhancement provided by the World Bank.
> Leverage: The guarantee (amortized principal and the two rolling interest payments) will
result in an initial exposure to the Bank of about US$56 million, or 31%7 of the face value of
the Notes resulting in an initial leverage of 3 to 1. The maximum exposure from the
guarantee is approximately US$94 million, or 52% of the face value of the Notes or a
leverage of 2 to 1. In comparison, a World Bank loan does not provide any leverage to the
World Bank's support (leverage of 1 to 1).
19.   While pricing the principal component of the transaction, the investors have considered
the World Bank's credit for similar maturities; for pricing the interest component, investors have
considered primarily the sovereign's credit because the World Bank's rolling interest guarantee
is contingent upon the sovereign reimbursing and indemnifying the World Bank in respect of any
payments made by the World Bank. Notwithstanding the significant credit enhancement
provided by the World Bank, the pricing of the PCG Notes has taken into account the fact that if
Brazil defaults to the World Bank (or the World Bank has extended terms to Brazil and there is
no voluntary prepayment), investors face uncovered TBG / Project interest payment risk. In the
worst case scenario, the private lenders would take the interest payment risk on TBG/project
credit for a period of 16 years. In addition, the investors have considered the prevailing spreads
of the underlying sovereign debt and other investment opportunities from the region, both in the
primary and secondary markets. This is because investors view the PCG Notes as a quasi-
sovereign instrument that will share many fundamentals with other Brazilian sovereign debt
issues.
20.   As in the case of other partial credit guarantees, the PCG Notes is priced as an hybrid
credit that is a function of the credits of the World Bank (Aaa/AAA, at spread of approxirnately
50-100 bps over corresponding US Treasuries); the government of Brazil credit and the Project's

21.   The placement agent has successfully obtained commitments from investors to buy the
PCG Notes. The Notes have been priced at 4359 basis points over the 30-year US Treasuries and
the final coupon will be set prior to financial close. An Indemnity Agreement (between the
World Bank and Government of Brazil) and Project Agreement (between the World Bank and
TBG) have been fully negotiated. A summary of the proposed terms of the PCG Notes and the
World Bank guarantee is set out in Annex I. The detailed terms and conditions for the World
Bank Guarantee have been reviewed by counsel to the investors, TBG's counsel and the
placement agent. A placement memorandum has been provided to potential investors, and all
elements of Notes related legal documentation (including the Subscription Agreement, the Fiscal
and Paying Agency Agreement, Warranty Agreement and the Conditions of the Notes) to which
the World Bank is party have been substantially negotiated among the World Bank, TBG and the
investors' counsel. The relevant currency and market consent from the US authorities to the
issue of the guarantee required pursuant to Article IV(i)(b) of the Articles of Agreement is
current.
GUARANTEE FEES
22.   A guarantee fee of 25 bpl° on the average exposure every period, calculated in advance of
each period is being charged for the project. As with past partial credit guarantees, the guarantee
fees would be payable upfront on a present value basis".
CONDITIONS OF ISSUE OF GUARANTEES
23.   Payment of the Guarantee Fee, due execution of the Indemnity Agreement and the
Project Agreement, including ratification by the Brazilian Senate, amendment of the Loan
8   No trading of the Bonds on that date.
9   The semi-annualized spread is based on current commitments (as of Nov 15, 2000).
10  The pricing proposal to be considered by the Board on December 19,2000 (Aligning of charges on IBRD
Guarantees and Loans, R2000-1/2, dated September 15, 2000; see footnote 7) grandfathers the proposed PCG
from the changes in guarantee pricing.
IBRD's cost of borrowing for similar maturities would be used as the discount rate to calculate the present
value.

NEXT STEPS
24.   The Notes documentation is currently being finalized. The coupon for the notes would be
set after all approvals have been obtained. Following approval by the Board, signature and
effectiveness of all legal documentation and the issuance of legal opinions satisfactory to the
Bank the Notes transaction is scheduled to be closed during the week of 25th December. The
expected processing schedule for the guaranteed Notes is as follows:

RECOMMENDATION
25.   I recommend that the Executive Directors authorize the Bank to issue a guarantee for the
proposed Notes to be issued by TBG in accordance with the terms and conditions described in
this Memorandum and in the Attachment hereto. The final terms and conditions of the guarantee
shall be as determined by either the President or the relevant Managing Director, and the
Executive Directors will be informed accordingly. If there is any substantial change in the terms
and conditions of the partial credit guarantee or the Notes from those described herein, the
approval of the Executive Directors will be sought.

ANNEX I: SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES AND TERMS FOR THE WORLD
BANK GUARANTEES
Issuer:                     Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil S.A. (TBG)
Guarantor:                  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the "World Bank") as to the
principal repayments on a non-accelerable basis (the "World Bank Principal
Guarantee") and two scheduled annual interest payments on a rolling and non-
accelerable basis (the "World Bank Interest Guarantee," and together with the World
Bank Principal Guarantee, the "World Bank Guarantees")
Fiscal Agent:               Bank of New York will act as Fiscal Agents and Registrar
Currency:                   US Dollars
Amount:                     US$180,000,000
Price:                      100% of face value of Notes
Use of Proceeds:            The net proceeds of the placement will be used exclusively for partial funding of the
Brazilian portion of the Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline Project.
Target Closing/Funding Date:  Fourth Quarter, CY 2000
Drawdown:                   TBG will receive the full amount of the proceeds less World Bank guarantee and
other fees, commissions and any other expenses for placement agent (including
reasonable legal fees for investors counsel and out of pocket expenses at closing date
of the issue).
Final Maturity:             18 years.
Interest Payments:          Annual basis.
Repayment:                  Three equal annual installments starting in year 16.
Rating (Fitch IBCA):        BBB+
Taxes and Other Deductions:   All payments to be made under or in connection with the issue of the PCG Notes are
to be free and clear of any Brazilian taxes, withholdings or other deductions.
Ranking, amendment and      The PCG Notes will be unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of
redemption of Notes:        TBG. All modifications, save those which have no material adverse effect on the
World Bank's rights and obligations, to the terms of the PCG Notes will require prior
written approval from the World Bank. If any modifications were made without the
World Bank's prior written consent, the World Bank's Guarantees would lapse. The
PCG Notes may be redeemed before maturity for taxation reasons by TBG. Such
redemption will be subject to a negotiated make-whole arrangement between TBG
and the Noteholders.
World Bank Guarantee        Scope: The terms of the World Bank Guarantees will be more fully set out in the
Provisions:                 appropriate documents, namely a Fiscal and Paying Agency Agreement and the
conditions to the Notes. The World Bank Interest Guarantee will not cover default or
penalty interest. Upon either permitted redemption of the PCG Notes by TBG or
upon payment under the World Bank Guarantees, the World Bank will be discharged
unconditionally from all obligations with respect to that redemption or payment. The
World Bank will not guarantee the due execution or authenticity of the PCG Notes
and the World Bank Guarantees will be of payment only, and not of collection of
funds. The obligations of the World Bank under the World Bank Guarantee are not
obligations of any governments, including those of the Federative Republic of Brazil,
and a notation to this effect will appear on the PCG Notes.
Principal Guarantee: The World Bank Principal Guarantee will cover payment of
principal only at scheduled maturities of the PCG Notes and will not be accelerable in
the event of default by TBG prior to stated maturities or under any other
circumstances.
- 11 -



Interest Guarantee: The World Bank will guarantee two annual scheduled interest
payments on a rolling and non-accelerable basis. In the case of a default by TBG in
the payment of scheduled interest, the World Bank will make payment following
confirmation of such default by the Fiscal Agent, provided that there has not been any
breach of the covenant not to amend any provisions of the terms of the PCG Notes or
other related documents without the prior written consent of the World Bank. At any
time during the term of the PCG Notes, the World Bank Interest Guarantee will cover
two future scheduled annual interest payments provided TBG or the Federative
Republic of Brazil has reimbursed the World Bank in full for any previous interest
payments made by the World Bank under its World Bank Interest Guarantee within
the prescribed time limits described below. Subject to the provisions described below
in the section "PCG Indemnity Agreement", if TBG or the Federative Republic of
Brazil fail to reimburse the World Bank within 60 days of the date of demand by the
World Bank for payment of the amount paid by the World Bank in respect of an
interest payment, the World Bank Interest Guarantee will terminate with respect to
one interest payment. Thereafter, only a single annual scheduled interest payment
will be covered, subject always to the same conditions of reimbursement.
Liability Cap: The World Bank's maximum liability under the World Bank Interest
Guarantee will be two scheduled interest payments calculated on the basis of
outstanding principal.
Call: Demand in respect of principal or interest under the World Bank Guarantees
can only be made after notice has been given by the Fiscal Agent to the World Bank
that the Noteholders have not received the required repayment amounts from TBG.
The World Bank will make payment on the second business day af$er receipt of
demand. The Fiscal and Paying Agency Agreement (as early warnig of any
potential call on the World Bank Guarantees) requires TBG to pay interest
installments and principal (at scheduled maturities or on redemption) 2 business days
in advance of the relevant due dates into a designated account with the Fiscal Agent,
with interest on the amounts in such account accruing for the benefit of TBG. Any
call on the World Bank Guarantees must be made no later than 10 days after the
respective due dates.
Subrogation: Upon payment in full by the World Bank of all amounts payable under
the World Bank Guarantees, the World Bank would be immediately subrogated (in
respect of that payment) to the rights of the Noteholders against TBG, regardless of
whether the Noteholders have been paid in full in respect of any interest or other
amounts due and outstanding under the PCG Notes. The World Bank's claims
through subrogation will rank equally to all other Noteholders' claims. Nothing in the
World Bank Interest Guarantee or the World Bank Principal Guarantee shall give the
Noteholders any rights under the PCG Indemnity Agreement between the World
Bank and the Federative Republic of Brazil; the World Bank may exercise its rights
thereunder as it sees fit and without any obligation to account to the Noteholders for
any monies or other proceeds realized.
Currency Indemnity: The World Bank Guarantees will not provide any currency
indemnity to the Noteholders.
Guarantees Status: The World Bank will give a standard negative pledge in relation
to the World Bank Guarantees enjoying the same security as may be granted by the
World Bank in respect of its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The
World Bank Guarantees will rank paripassu with the World Bank's other unsecured
and unsubordinated obligations.
Discharge of Guarantee:     In the event that any PCG Notes are repaid, redeemed, canceled or exchanged, the
World Bank Guarantees will be discharged with respect to such PCG Notes. The
Fiscal Agent will have responsibility for notifying the World Bank on repayment,
redemption, exchange or cancellation of PCG Notes.
- 12 -



Repackaging Arrangements:    The Noteholders will undertak-e to the World Bank that, so long as the World Bank
Guarantees remain in effect, they will not enter into any arrangement pursuant to
which any security or other obligation is created or issued, the economic effect of
which is the separation of rights of payment from the World Bank under the World
Bank Guarantees from the rights of payment from TBG under the PCG Notes.
World Bank Warranties:      The World Bank will enter into an agreement with the PCG Note purchasers,
providing customary basic warranties and an indemnity in relation to (i) the accuracy
of information about the World Bank contained in the placement memorandum issued
by TBG on October 11th 2000 and (ii) the World Bank's legal authority to issue the
World Bank Guarantees.
Offer to Purchase:          Pursuant to its Articles, the World Bank will have the right, upon default by TBG on
any interest payment obligations, to offer to purchase the PCG Notes at par and
interest (accrued and due).Prior to the acceleration of Notes, any such offer may be
accepted or declined at the sole option of the Noteholders. After acceleration of the
Notes, the Noteholders will not have the option of declining the offer. A provision to
this effect will appear in the terms and conditions of the World Bank Guarantees
pursuant to the Fiscal and Paying Agency Agreement and in the Notes.
PCG Indemnity Agreement:    Pursuant to the PCG Indemnity Agreement, the Federative Republic of Brazil will
agree to reimburse and indemnify the World Bank in respect of any amount paid out
in respect of principal or scheduled interest on the PCG Notes (or other liabilities
incurred by the World Bank in connection with the issue of the World Bank
Guarantees) on demand or as the World Bank may otherwise direct. After a default
by TBG on any scheduled interest payment to Noteholders under the PCG Notes and
upon being called to make and after making payment to the Fiscal Agent under the
World Bank Interest Guarantee, the World Bank will either:
(a)    issue a written demand to the Federative Republic of Brazil for immediate
reimbursement, in which case if the Federative Republic of Brazil fails for any reason
to make full reimbursement to the World Bank within 60 days of the date of such
written demand, the World Bank Interest Guarantee in respect of one of the annual
scheduled interest payments will terminate automatically, and will not 'roll' and will
never be reinstated; or
(b)    exercise its discretion under the PCG Indemnity Agreement (in what the
World Bank may determine constitutes exceptional circumstances) not to require the
Federative Republic of Brazil to make immediate repayment. The World Bank will
then notify the Federative Republic of Brazil of the reimbursement terms, set at the
sole discretion of the World Bank and will also notify the Fiscal Agent. The World
Bank will have the right (at its discretion) to direct to the Federative Republic of
Brazil whatever terms and conditions of reimbursement the World Bank considers are
appropriate and to vary those terms and conditions subsequently. Nothing in the
provisions of the World Bank Guarantees will restrict or alter this right.
If the World Bank exercises its discretion in (b) above and the Federative Republic of
Brazil makes specific and full reimbursement to the World Bank of the due amount
pursuant to the reimbursement terms notified by the World Bank at any time prior to
World Bank close of business on the business day five days before the due date for
the next annual scheduled interest payment payable by TBG under the terms of the
PCG Notes, the World Bank Interest Guarantee in respect of the interest payment will
be reinstated. In the event that the Federative Republic of Brazil has (for any reason)
not made full reimbursement as aforesaid to the World Bank by that date, then the
World Bank Interest Guarantee in respect of one of the interest payments will
automatically terminate and not be reinstated. The World Bank Interest Guarantee in
respect of the second interest payment will remain, subject to identical terms.
If the Federative Republic of Brazil makes a payment to the World Bank equal to
reimbursement of all outstanding amounts owed to the World Bank pursuant to the
PCG Indemnity Agreement, the World Bank will allocate and apply that payment as
- 13 -



expressly stipulated by the Federative Republic of Brazil and, failing such stipulation,
will allocate and apply the payment as the World Bank sees fit.
Breach of the PCG Indemnity Agreement by the Federative Republic of Brazil would
entitle the World Bank to declare an event of suspension under all loan agreements
with, and (if such breach is a payment default) all loan agreements guaranteed by, the
Federative Republic of Brazil.
Guarantee Fee:              The fee represents 0.25% per annum, charged on the guaranteed exposure (principal
and scheduled interest amounts) on a present value basis, using the World Bank's cost
of funds at or near the day of the closing of the PCG Notes as the 'discount rate'. The
fees are payable in advance at the closing of the PCG Notes, out of the proceeds of
the PCG Notes. Payment of the fees to the World Bank will be a condition precedent
to the delivery of the World Bank Guarantees and is guaranteed by the Federative
Republic of Brazil.
Governing Law & Jurisdiction: The terms and conditions of the PCG Notes, the World Bank Guarantees and all
agreements with the commercial parties to which the World Bank is a party
(excluding the World Bank Project Agreement) will be subject to the laws of the State
of New York. Non-exclusive jurisdiction will be vested in the courts of New York,
subject to the World Bank's statutory right (22 USC § 236(g)) to transfer any
proceedings to the appropriate U.S. District Court and to certain immunities granted
under its Articles of Agreement concernig jurisdictions in which actions may be
bought against the World Bank; immunity from suit by its members, immunity from
interim attachment or seizure of assets and inviolability of its archives. Noteholders
will be deemed to have assented to these World Bank rights.
The PCG Indemnity Agreement with the Federative Republic of Brazil and the World
Bank Project Agreement will contain the dispute resolution provisions common to all
World Bank agreements with member countries and project agreements with
borrowers, and will follow the usual legal regime for such World Bank agreements.
Legal Opinions:             The World Bank will be an addressee of the relevant legal opinions delivered by
counsel to TBG. The World Bank will deliver the customary legal opinion for the
issue of guarantees under the PCG Programn to the Note purchasers. The World Bank
will receive a legal opinion from Brazil covering the Indemnity Agreement.
Conditions Precedent:       World Bank Board approval, payment of the Guarantee Fee, due execution (including
ratification by the Brazilian Senate) of the PCG Indemnity Agreement and the World
Bank Project Agreement (an agreement between TBG and the World Bank which also
binds TBG to certain covenants also contained in the World Bank Loan Agreement
for the term of the World Bank Guarantee) and delivery of satisfactory legal opinions
and amendment of the World Bank Loan Agreement will be conditions precedent to
delivery of the World Bank Guarantees.
