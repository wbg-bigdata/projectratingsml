FOREWORD
The level of field data gathering during the preparation of this Initial Enviromnental
Examination (EE) was restricted by unrest in some of the areas crossed by the subject roads
in the Mid-Western Development Region.  The initial environmental and engineering
fieldwork was undertaken along the full length of the three roads, but detailed social and
engineering design fieldwork was only undertaken for the Sandhikharka road (59.2 km) and
the initial part of the Kalikot road (87 km).
This EE has been completed based on the above levels of data. Given that all initial
fieldwork inspections were completed, it is anticipated that the uncompleted fieldwork will
not change the type of, or significantly change the extent of, environmental impacts. This
level of assessment has been discussed with and approved by the Department of Roads
(DOR) and the World Bank.
J         The discussion of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed upgrading works has
been structured into a separate section for each road, at the request of DOR.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Road Maintenance and Development Project (RMD Project) involves the construction
of 196 km of new road and 253 km of road upgrading. This Initial Environmental
Examination involves the assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the
proposed road upgrading works
Three existing earth roads will be upgraded in the Western and Mid-Westem Development
Regions of Nepal, as detailed in Table 1.

Road upgrading is designed to bring the roads up to Fair Weather Gravel Track Standard
(DOR, 1997). This will involve the standard works of reforming the road surface and
gravelling to a depth of 150-250 mm, as well as side drain repair and construction. Major
site-specific works will include road widening, retaining wall construction, drain repair and
-,          construction, and bio-engineering.
Bio-physical and socio-economic impacts will result from the upgrading of the roads, but
these impacts will generally be minor in extent and significance. Many of the effects of the
J           proposed upgrading works will be beneficial, particularly relating to road stabilisation and
associated issues. Limited additional land is required to install the proposed works.
POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
j           The primary benefits of road upgrading will be improved access and resulting economic
development. Following the upgrading of the three roads, traffic is projected to increase by
5.05-5.32% annually.
Social development benefits will result from improved access, including economic
stimulation and road construction employment. Roadside communities currently experience
access problems, particularly during the monsoon, due to current road conditions. Improved



access, to markets and health facilities specifically, will therefore be a significant benefit of
road upgrading.
Since the roads cross some of the most underdeveloped districts of the country, their
upgrading may also contribute to (a) improvements in food supply and a reduction in the
cost of consumer items; (b) improved access to health facilities and counseling, leading to
possible improvements in the overall health status of people; and (c) possible improvements
in the position of vulnerable social categories and groups, through the creation and
stimulation of income-generating opportunities and a reduction in social and economic
disparities.
Another benefit that will be derived from road upgrading will be the stabilisation of many
unstable batters along each road. Environrnental damnage is currently resulting from
unstable cut and fill banks. Many existing road banks, primarily cut batters, are highly
unstable and prone to slides and erosion, particularly during the monsoon. The installation
of a large number of retaining walls and drains, and 22.26 ha bio-engineering measures, will
stabilise most road batters, and thereby significantly reduce downslope sedimentation and
damage to features.
ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Adverse environmental impacts are likely to result from the proposed upgrading works, but
these will generally be minor in extent and significance. Adverse impacts will include land
loss, ecological degradation and population displacement.
The total land use change that will occur as a result of road widening will be 18.49 ha over
the combined road length of 253 km. This land use change includes 6.91 ha of cultivation.
This net impact is classed as minor, equating to an average 0.73 m wide strip of land along
the full length of the roads.
Ecological degradation that may occur during road upgrading, or be induced by the
resulting additional traffic, is anticipated to be minor. Only minor forest and shrubland
clearance, estimated to total 5.75 ha, will occur at upgrading work sites. This loss of
vegetation will be directly offset by bio-engineering vegetation establishment on 22.26 ha of
bare or semi-bare land. Work contracts will be limited to 2-3 years duration, and the
workforce will not be at any site for an extended period, therefore illegal forest harvesting
should be minor. In addition, the annual increase in traffic (around 5%) is relatively small,
therefore any additional long-term, road-induced ecological degradation is likely to be
limited. No protected areas or identified sites of ecological significance occur within the
vicinity of the roads.
The disposal of 142,300 m3 of excess fill can potentially create a significant environmental
impact unless it is correctly managed. Excess fill must be transported to suitable fill
disposal locations to ensure that private and public land and vegetation are not damaged by
uncontrolled tipping.  This can be economically achieved using trucks or tractors.
.,



Maximum fill disposal should occur in floodplain borrow pit voids created during the
winning of road upgrading material.
si
Very minor adverse noise, vibration and air quality impacts will occur, either during
upgrading or from the additional traffic resulting from road upgrading.
Asset acquisition and population displacement will be relatively minor given the total length
3             of the roads. Only approximately 6.91 ha of private land will be acquired, as well as an
estimated 112 residential and business structures.
The total number of households affected by upgrading works is estimated at 569 (4,030
persons). The estimated number of households facing displacement is 51 (less than 9% of
total households), consisting of some 385 persons. The additional 518 households (3,645
persons) will be affected through the acquisition of land, commercial establishments and
other buildings.

. j           In the context of road development, the number of affected households is relatively small,
particularly since the Chhedegad road figure is expected to be reduced following additional
engineering and census surveys. The estimated number of displaced households is also low,
amounting to just under 9%  of the affected households.  Nevertheless, involuntary
resettlement is often traumatic, and for those individuals and households being displaced,
i            the disturbances could be highly significant.

1.1 BACKGROUND
Government policy, as detailed in the Eighth Plan (National Planning Cornmission, 1992),
includes the construction of motorable roads to all non-road connected District Headquarters.
The Priority Investment Plan (PIP) Project completed the Master Plan for Strategic Road
Network and Rural Transport in 1997. This Plan identified 10 potential new roads that would
provide connections to 12 districts in the Eastern, Mid-Westem and Far-Westem Development
Regions of Nepal. The PIP Project screened and prioritised these 10 potential new roads, most
of which were under construction as earth roads.
From these 10 roads, five were selected as candidate roads for consideration in the Road
Maintenance and Development (RMD) Project, with a firther three non-PIP roads to District
Headquarters added for consideration. These eight roads were composed of a total of 12
separate candidate road sections for consideration for either construction or upgrading.
_Co Considerable lengths of some of the candidate construction roads had already been constructed
or were well into construction at the commencement of the RMD Project. Accordingly, the
lengths of roads being screened were revised to their current status. All road sections under
construction that were well advanced and scheduled for completion during or by the end of the
1998/99 fiscal year, when the RMD Project will be finalised, were included in the "candidate
upgrading roads" group.
In the initial RMD Project report, the Inception Report (SMEC, 1998), seven candidate roads
were considered for construction (356 km) and five candidate roads were considered for
upgrading (281 kin) in the Western, Mid-Westem and Far-Westem Development Regions.
The aim of this study was to screen the roads down to approximately 500 km for detailed
design.
The candidate roads were screened based on economic, environmental and social factors. The
*            Inception Report recommended five roads totaling 204 km for detailed construction design to
fair weather earth standard, whilst four roads totaling 265 km were recommended for
U            upgrading design to fair weather gravel standard.  These recommended roads were
subsequently approved by the Department of Roads (DOR) and the World Bank.

1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The RMD Project has the primary objective of advancing "the planning and preparation of
selected components from among the recommendations of the PIP Master Plan to form the
basis of a further Road Project" for World Bank funding (DOR, 1998). This work involves the    I
preparation  of road  designs, economic assessments, environmental assessments and
resettlement and compensation planning for the construction and/or upgrading of sections of
the strategic road network.
This Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) assesses the potential impacts that are likely to
result from the upgrading activities proposed for the three selected upgrading roads (see Table
1.1 and Figure 1). The environmental assessment for the five selected construction roads has
been undertaken separately in the form of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and is not
included in this IEE.

Throughout this IEE, each of the above roads will be referred to by its destination town only
(e.g. "Kalikot" instead of "Surkhet-Kalikot").
The length of the road sections proposed for upgrading was determined by the status of road
construction in November 1998. Since the PIP Project was completed, an additional 16 km of
the Chhedegad road had been constructed therefore this was included in the length of road
proposed for upgrading.
The three roads are proposed for upgrading to Design Standards for Feeder Roads (DOR,
1997) "Construction Development Stage III (FWGT) - Fair Weather Gravel Track" standards
for hilly terrain (see Appendix 1). This road standard represents a "construction stage to
improve the road to dry season access of gravel standard", effectively upgrading it from fair
weather earth track (FWET) standard.

1.3 AIMS OF INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION
This single IEE has been prepared for the environmental assessment of the three proposed
upgrading roads given the similarity of proposed works and potential environmental impacts
that may result, as identified on the RMD Project Interim Report (SMEC, 1998).
The IEE has the dual role of a planning tool and a mechanism for decision-making. Its
principal aims are to:
1.    Assess the significant potential environmental impacts associated with the project;
2.    Assess alternative project designs and provide input into project design; and
.3.    Design practical mnitigation and management measures to avoid or reduce adverse
_-7                impacts.
1.4 PROPOSED UPGRADING WORKS
The proposed road upgrading works include standard works that will be undertaken along the
length of the road and major site-specific works undertaken where a significant road formation
feature has to be improved. Standard works include:
* Road surface reformation and grading;
*  Road surface gravelling;
- Side drain construction.
Major works include:
* Road widening;
* Embankment stabilisation - by earthworks or retaining walls;
*  Cross-road drain construction and repair;
* Bio-engineering.
Upgrading works will generally be undertaken during the dry season, from October to mid-
June.
Standard Works
The existing road surface will be graded to reform an even road surface. The road will then be
surfaced with a compacted gravel layer with a thickness and composition as specified in the
contract documentation. The gravel layer is likely to be between 100-250 mm thick.
New side drains will be constructed at many sites along the proposed upgrading roads, whilst
existing side drains which are damaged or undersized will be repaired or replaced to improve
road surface drainage and reduce erosion.

Major Works
The major proposed road upgrading works will have site-specific environmental impacts (see
Sections 7.2, 8.2 and 9.2).
Road widening is generally proposed at sites where the road surface is less than 4.5 m wide. I
The road will be widened to a minimum width of 4.5 m, generally by excavating the cut batter.
Provision will be made to allow short sections of narrower road width to be maintained at sites U
where the cost of road widening to full width is excessive or the likely resulting slope
destabilisation will lead to high road maintenance requirements.
Cut slope banks will be stabilised where slope instability is occuring, with the most appropriate
rnitigation measures determined during the final design stage. Stabilisation measures may
include flattening the cut bank, constructing retaining walls, constructing of breast walls and/or
bio-engineering.
Existing major cross-road drains will be repaired where they have been damaged. Additional i
major and minor cross-road drains will be installed where existing drainage is inadequate.
Bio-engineering measures will be undertaken on soil batters, both cut and fill, where they will
help stabilise these slopes and reduce erosion.
Associated Activities
A number of activities associated with the upgrading works will be undertaken at ancillary     -
sites away from the road corridors. These activities will include:
Extraction of material from quarries and borrow pits: construction materials, primarily for
road gravelling and retaining wall construction, will be excavated from quarries and borrow
pits generally located in close proximity to the specific roadwork requiring the materials. Rock  ]
will be sourced from currently exposed road cuttings, riverbeds and other adjacent sites, and be
transported to the crushing plant and/or work site mainly by truck.
Material crushing and storage: sites are required for the crushing and storage of construction
materials in close proximity to work sites. Identified sites along the roads will be reserved for  |
these purposes, and these activities will be restricted to the reserved sites.
Worlkforce camps: despite the use of some local labour, temporary workforce camps will be
established along the roads to provide living quarters in close proximity to work sites. The
location and number of camps required for the upgrading of each road will be determined
based on daily travelling times to/from the work sites.

1.5 EXISTING AND PROJECTED ROAD TRAFFIC
Existing road traffic usage was estimated by taking counts for 24 hours at two locations on
*             each of the proposed upgrading roads during September/October 1998, then seasonally
adjusting the results and averaging vehicle numbers per day (see Table 1.2). The location of
the manual classified vehicle counts (MCVC) and their frequency was determined based on the
homogeneity of road sections.

II           Annual traffic growth rates for the three roads are projected at similar levels, between 5.05-
5.32%.
U            Given that the proposed upgrading works do not include the construction of bridges, there will
continue to be a significant seasonal variation in traffic along different sections of each road.
On the Kalikot and Chhedegad roads there will continue to be no year-round vehicle
movements across the Lohore and Bheri Rivers respectively, following upgrading works.

*SMEC
On the Sandhikharka road, substantial additional traffic is expected within a few years
following upgrading if a proposed limestone extraction operation is developed 50 km north of
Gorusinge. On the Chhedegad road, observed traffic volumes were very low, attributed to the
fact that this road is not the preferred accessway for an estimated two-thirds of the population
in the road catchment who use alternative routes to the east and west. The projected traffic
volumes for this road have been based the assumption that the whole population of the road
catchment will use the road following upgrading.

2  LEGISLATION, POLICIES AND STANDARDS
This lEE has been prepared in accordance with IHRMGN and World Bank requirements for the
envirornmental assessment and management planning of the three upgrading roads.
I            A single IEE has been prepared for all three project roads because of their similar locations,
types and extent of works, and potential environrnental impacts. Accordingly, these road
alignments cross similar topographic and geologic features, land use and forest types, and areas
with similar social structures, as identified in the RMD Project Inception Report (SMEC,
1998).
2.1  HMGN LEGISLATION
- i          The primary IIMGN statutory requirements that have to be adhered to in the preparation of an
IEE for the upgrading of the subject roads are the Environment Protection Act (EPA) 1996 and
the Environment Protection Regulations 1997. The Regulations took effect on 26 June 1997,
and supersede the 1993 National Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines.
IUnder Section I Regulation 3 (relating to Appendix 1) of the Regulations, an IEE is required
for the proposed road upgrading works.
The Act and Regulations make public consultation a pre-requisite for all prescribed projects.
This provision provides local people with the opportunity to voice their concerns and issues
from the project scoping stage through to the approval of an IEE report.
2.2 WORLD BANK REQUIREMENTS
The World Bank requires EIA and/or IEE level assessments for proposed roadworks,
depending upon whether the works are classified as either:
a)    Roadworks with major environmental issues which should be the subject of a full and
detailed environmental assessment (EA);
b)    Roadworks with little to no potential impact and hence requiring a limited
environmental analysis.
The proposed roadworks have no major environmental issues and have therefore been
classified as category (b) and deemed to require a limited environmental analysis.
IiJ          This World Bank classification of the roads and the corresponding requirements for
environmental assessment are similar to HMGN's classification and requirements for
environmental assessment, therefore this single IEE satisfies both requirements.

QwSMEC
Since the RMD Project will entail acquisition of privately-owned land and buildings, this IEE
has been prepared in compliance with the World Bank's GP/BP/OP 4.12 guidelines
(previously issued as Operational Directives 4.20 and 4.30) concerning involuntary
resettlement, impacts on indigenous groups and rehabilitation of affected populations. It has
also been prepared in accordance with the following World Bank guidelines:
-     Operational Directive OP 4. 01: Environmental Assessment, 1999.
-     Operational Policy OP 4.04: Natural Habitats, 1995.                           p
-     Ernvironmental Assessment Sourcebook, 1991.
-     Roads and Environment: A Handbook, 1997.
2.3 DEPARTMENT OF ROADS STANDARDS
DOR has issued several standards for the environmental management of road projects,
including the Draft ES Guidelines for the Road Sector (1997), which was prepared under the
broad framework of the National EJA  Guidelines (1993).  This publication sets out
environmental assessment requirements for road construction and upgrading projects.
Schedule 1 of these Guidelines, relating to the level of assessment required for different project
types, is almost identical to the 1997 Environment Protection Regulations. As the National
EL4 Guidelines have now  been superseded by the Environment Protection Act and
Regulations, the draft road sector guidelines are unlikely to be revised.                 I
DOR has also issued the Environmental Management Guidelines (DOR, 1997) (EMG), which
provide guidance to the Proponent on the integration of environmental mitigation measures
into the project. This specifically deals with the management of quarries, borrow pits, material
stockpiling and spoil disposal, camp operation, earthworks and slope stabilization, and
environmental pollution. It is the main set of operational guidelines that must be complied
with.
2.4  NATIONAL POLICIES                                                                    |
HMGN has accorded high priority to the development of infrastructure, including road
construction, in the current Ninth Plan (NPC, 1998). Environmental issues in Nepal are a
prominent part of development projects. Inadequate terrain-specific and environmentally
suitable road designs and construction practices have been recognised as causing high road  I
rehabilitation and reconstruction costs. Recognising this, HMGN has formulated a policy of
intemalising environmental management in sectoral development projects and programs,
including road construction. The RMD Project aims to achieve this by incorporating measures  I
to avoid and mitigate potential impacts throughout the project's development phases (i.e.
upgrading design, upgrading works and post-upgrading).                                     j

3 METHODOLOGY
This IEE was prepared in accordance with HMGN legal requirements, based on a driveover
-           inspection of each proposed alignent and consultation with local people and officials. The
u           principal steps undertaken in the IEE methodology were:
*  IEE scoping;
*  Road inspection;
*  Additional fieldwork; and
*  Assessment of issues.
3.1   IEE SCOPING
IEE scoping was undertaken in accordance with the Environment Protection Regulations 2054
(1997) to inforn stakeholders about the proposed project, receive their comments on relevant
environmental issues and identify priority environmental issues for assessment in the IEE.
Scoping included a literature review, publication of a Public Notice, inspections of the
proposed alignments and discussions with local people, and convening a Scoping Workshop in
N    -      Kathmandu.
A review of relevant guidelines and technical references was undertaken, followed by
I           publication of a Public Notice, as per the Environmental Protection Regulations 2054, Rule
4(1) and 4(2), in the national Nepali newspaper Gorkhapatra on 8/6/2055 (24/98). The
Notice sought "opinions and suggestions from all concerned parties to identify potential
primary environmental impacts relating to the proposed roadworks as part of the Scoping
exercise to be undertaken for EL4 and IEE studies".
No responses were received to the Public Notice call for comment.
I          Driveover inspections of the proposed upgrading roads were undertaken by the Environment
and Social teams in September-December 1998 to identify the main potential impacts of the
J           roads and to discuss the environmental issues and impacts with local people. Informal
discussions were held with community representatives and other people along the roads.
I           A Scoping Workshop was held in Kathmandu on 30/10/98 to provide Kathmandu-based
Governent and non-government organisations with an additional opportunity to identify
potential primary environmental issues. The meeting was attended by nine Govenmment and
three NGO representatives (see Appendix 2).
A Scoping Report was then submitted to DOR outlining the main issues to be investigated in
the IEE (see Appendix 3).

3.2 ALIGNMENT INSPECTION AND INFORMATION COLLECTION
Driveover inspections of the 253 km of proposed roads for upgrading were undertaken by the
-Environment and Social teams, a Road Engineer, Geologist, Surveyor and associated
professionals. The three aims of the inspections by the Environment and Social teams were to:
1.   Identify potential environmental impacts and collect sufficient local data to fully
predict, and quantify wherever possible, these likely impacts;
2.    Formulate road design recommendations; and
3.    Identify other practical environmental mitigation measures.
The driveover inspections commenced in September and were completed in December 1998 at
the rate of approximately 16 kan per day. Where roads were blocked by landslides following
the monsoon, these sections of road were walked. The inspection of proposed upgrading roads
following the monsoon enabled inadequate drainage and associated damage to be easily
identified.
Local information was collected by physical and social site assessments of the proposed
upgrading roads and ROWs during the driveover inspections.  Standard IEE Log Sheets
(Appendix 4) were used to collect data on proposed major works, land use alongside the ROW,
social features and other major environmental features along the full length of the proposed
upgrading works.
A road inventory team then inspected each road, marked out chainage lengths and prepared
inventory survey maps of alI standard and below standard road features.
3.3 DESIGN OF UPGRADING WORKS
An upgrading design team inspected the full length of the Sandhikharka road and the initial 87
km of Kalikot road between December 1998 and April 1999. During these inspections, major
upgrading works were proposed and located on the inventory survey maps of each road.
Where additional land was identified as being required for a major works, the land type
required was noted, the approximate area required was estimated and owners were identified
where possible. Likewise, where structures were located on these sites they were identified.
The desktop design of the major works proposed in the field was then completed.

3.4  SOCIAL ASSESSMENT
The social research methods used on the RMD Project are detailed in the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP). In surummary, a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was undertaken as part of the
I           EIA for new roads and the IEE for upgrading roads. The following key social issues were
identified for investigation:
*  loss of private property and other assets (e.g. cultivation land and houses) and
compensation modalities for these losses;
*  population displacement; and
*  construction employment opportunities and other general social development benefits
associated with road upgrading.
The SIA was undertaken in two phases, in accordance with engineering design studies: a
sample socio-economic survey, and a follow-up census of potentially affected persons and
their assets.
3.4.1    Sample Socio-Economic Survey
Fieldwork commenced with initial driveover investigations, following which a socio-economic
survey of a sample of potentially affected households was undertaken. The questionnaire
covered the following topics:
*  household composition and demographics;
* household assets and resources;
* type of impact and entitlement options; and
* views on the project.
The household survey was supplemented with interviews with a sample of business owners
located along the roads, and group discussions with residents of selected roadside settlements.
These were designed to gather information on existing social and economic activities, and the
potential impact of road upgrading on these activities. Finally, a settlement checklist was
completed for each of the villages located along the roadside.
The survey sample is detailed below. The interviewed households and business owners
]            represent approximately 20% of the potentially affected households.

An asset recording exercise was also undertaken in conjunction with the sample socio-
economic survey, with the aim of documenting all potentially affected private assets (land,
buildings and trees) and ownership details on Summary Asset Registers. The exercise was
constrained by two lirnitations. Firstly, DOR has not legally acquired the right-of-way (ROW)
on most of the upgrading road sections and, consequently, does not possess strip maps or other
documentation showing ROW boundaries. Secondly, engineering design of upgrading works
is at feasibility level only, while accurate identification and quantification of affected assets
requires detailed engineering designs. It was therefore agreed to select two potential impact
corridors (namely 7.5 m and 15 m from the road centerline) to indicate the magnitude of asset
acquisition and population displacement associated with the establishment a 15 m and 30 m     a
ROW. A third scenario (consisting of an impact corridor of roughly 8 m) was developed after
completion of the initial engineering road inventory surveys to show the potential social
impacts if land take is lirnited to actual areas required for road upgradingj.
3.4.2    Census and Asset Verification
A  census of potentially affected persons was undertaken in March-April 1999 for the
fimalisation of a Resettlement Action Plan. The census was based on the agreed objective of
minimising population displacement by liniting asset acquisition to areas required for
upgrading. The census teams, consisting of enumerators, DOR representatives and District
Land Survey officials, were accompanied by engineering staff who identified upgrading    
requirements (e.g. road widening) and likely areas of land acquisition.
The resulting lists of potentially affected persons provide a good baseline description of the  j
existing social environment (see Appendix 5). Because of the nature of the current engineering
studies (namely feasibility level), the lists should be verified and updated during the detailed  I
design phase (to be undertaken as part of the construction supervision contract) to reflect the
persons actually affected by road upgrading.

1  SMEC
The census, completed for all potentially affected persons, entailed:
* recording household size, composition and related demographic features;
* recording household assets (land, buildings, trees);
*  identification and joint verification of affected assets (type and size);
*  numbering, photographs and drawings of affected buildings and structures; and
* recording landowners who had already donated land for the initial construction of the road
sections included in the RMD Project.
3.4.3   Interviews with Other Stakeholders
Interviews were held with district officials (e.g. Chief District Officers, Local Development
Officers, Health Officials) and corrmunity representatives to identify and discuss key social
issues and development opportunities associated with road upgrading (see Appendix 6).
Structured interviews were conducted with 22 Contractors (Category A-D) to obtain their
i           views on the employment of local labour in the road construction sector.  Discussions
concentrated on recruitment and employment preferences and practices, availability of local
labour, benefits and constraints associated with the employment of local labour, and general
labour management practices.
3.4.4    Limitations
Some of the limitations placed on the social aspects studies have already been alluded to
above. These include the absence of documentation related the ROW, and the fact that
accurate identification and quantification of affected assets require detailed (as opposed to
*           feasibility) engineering designs.
Additionally, both fieldwork phases were affected by incidences of civil unrest and the
upcoming national elections. On the Kalikot road, the sample household questionnaire survey
and initial recording of affected assets were terminated at approximately 85 km, following
incidences of civil disturbances. For similar reasons, the subsequent census survey could also
11           not progress beyond 85 km. Initial fieldwork was completed on the Chhedegad road, but the
census survey could not be undertaken because of civil unrest and potential security problems.
-The results presented in this report are based on the detailed census survey for Sandhikharka
road and the initial 85 km of the Kalikot road, as well as the initial fieldwork for the
3            Chhedegad road.

4  BIO-PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.1 PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGIONS
The primary indicator of the types of environments that the roads pass through is the division
of physiographic regions of Nepal. These zones, with their unique geology, elevations and
slope characteristics, provide an indication of general climatic conditions, slope stability and
vegetation types.
The five physiographic regions (LRMP, 1984) run latitudinally along the length of the country.
The general altitude range of each region, from south to the north, is described Table 4.1
Table 4.1: Physiographic Regions of Nepal

Source: LRMP, 1984.
The majority of the upgrading roads are located in the Middle Hills (76.6%) (see Table 4.2).
The remaining lengths of roads are located in the Siwaliks (22.2%), with minor lengths located
in the Terai and High Mountains.

4.2 TOPOGRAPHY
The Kalikot and Chhedegad roads follow major river valleys of the Kamali and Bheri rivers
respectively. The roads predominantly run parallel to the rivers, except where major features
such as landslides and deep tributary valleys are negotiated. The Sandhikharka road does not
follow a river valley, instead ascending a hill slope to Narapani.

All three roads are almost exclusively located on hill slopes, above the flood level of major
rivers and streams (except where crossings are required) and above landslides on the lower
slopes near nvers. The alignments generally cross 10400 slopes, although steeper sections are
traversed along all alignments (see Table 4.3). The steepest section of alignment is located on
the Kalikot road, where slopes of up to 70-80° are traversed.
The three roads are all located between elevations of 120 m (at 9 km north of Gorusinge on the
Sandhikharka road) and 1,700 m (at Sandhikharka).

4.3 CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY
The proposed upgrading roads traverse a number of macro and micro climate zones which are
broadly described in terms of temperature and rainfall characteristics in Table 4.4.
Average annual rainfall across the three roads ranges from 700-2,500 mm, with nearly 80% of
the total annual rainfall falling during the four months of the monsoon, from June to
September. The proposed road alignments cross areas with very high rainfall intensities,
-ranging between estimates of 175-400 mm for a 24 hour period (ICIMOD, 1995). The highest
intensity rainfall along the road alignments is likely to occur on the Middle Mountain section
of the Sandhikharka road.

4.4 GEOLOGY
Regional geology in the Nepal Himalaya is divided into four geo-tectonic zones. These zones,
arranged latitudinally from north to south along the length of the country, are:
*  Tibetan Tethys Himalayan Tectonic Zone                                                |
* Higher Himalayan Tectonic Zone
*  Lesser Himalayan Tectonic Zone                                                        3
*  Sub-Himalayan Tectonic Zone
The upgrading roads lie in the Sub-Himalayan and Lesser Himalayan tectonic zones. The Sub-
Himalayan zone is comprised of weakly indurated sandstone, mudstone and conglomerates.
The rock formations commonly called Siwalik Formations are highly friable and yield to
weathering very easily. Structurally, a number of longitudinal upright and thrust faults dissect
this zone, repeating the geological sequence. The Sub-Himalayan zone is delimited to the
south by the ill-defined Main Frontal Thrust from the Gangetic alluvium of the Terai. To the
north, the rocks of the Lesser Himalayan tectonic zone are brought tectonically over the Sub-
Hiinalayan zone by a well defined and regionally discemable Main Boundary Thrust.
The Lesser Himalayan tectonic zone is comprised of allocthonous (foreign transported rock
mass) Kathmandu Group and autocthonous (in situ) to para-allocthonous (partially transported)
Midland Group rock successions (DMG, 1987). These rock groups range in age from          U
Precambrian to as late as Tertiary. Regionally discernible thrust faults involving brittle
shearing and ductile folding separate the relatively high-grade metamorphic rocks of overlying
Kathmandu Groups from the underlying low grade, mostly unfossiliferous metasediments of
the Midland Group. The rock succession of both the Kathmandu Group and Midland Group
have been further embricated and faulted locally and regionally, complicating the geological  I
sequences found in the Lesser Himalayan tectonic zone.
The specific geological characteristics along each proposed road alignment are described
below.
Kalikot: the initial topography crossed by the road from Surkhet to Baddichaur consists of
floodplain and gently rolling hills, followed by moderate slopes up to Syaule. From Syaule to
Septi, the terrain is very steep and rugged. The road then passes through a wide valley across  I
moderately sloping hills before reaching steep hills towards Sirane.
Geologically, the road passes through the Siwalik hills, with rocks consisting of conglomerate
beds, red shales, mudstone and sandstone of Siwalik Formation up to Baddichaur. North of
Baddichaur, the road crosses the Main Boundary Thrust and ascends on moderately sloping
hills with sheared reddish shale and quartZ rocks. Towards Kalikot, the road traverses
quartzite, greyish green phyllite, metasandstone and schistose amphibolite rocks. This rock

*SMIEC
sequence repeats a number of times along the longitudinal faults. The last section of the road
up to Sirane village consists of quartzite, which forms steep cliffs.
Chhedegad: the road generally crosses Lesser Himalayan rocks consisting of shale, limestone,
dolomite and quartzite, and isolated terrace conglomerate, which appear to be stable. Near the
i            Chedegad River, the road crosses very steep terrain formed by metasandstone and river terrace
conglomerates which form 50-60 m high sub-vertical cliffs. Most of the terrace conglomerates
are cemented. Above these terraces, red lateritic soil 1-3 m thick has formed. Most of the
alignment is stable because it runs north-south, across the geologic strike.
Sandhikharka: the road crosses 1.4 km of Terai, followed by Sub-Himalayan and Lesser
Himalayan tectonic zones. The Terai is comprised of loose quatemary deposits consisting of
--.          sand, gravel and boulders. The Sub-Himalayan section of the road, up to the lowest point
along the descent to Thada, crosses SiwaIik formation. From this point onwards up to
Sandhikharka the alignment crosses rock formations of the Lesser Himalayan tectonic zone
over-ridding the Main Boundary Thrust. The rock consisting of Midland Group comprising
I            slates, phyllites and dolomitic limestones. Dolomitic limestone is found near the summit of the
ascent to Narapani area. The entire section is made up of highly friable slates and phyllites. In
general, rock formations crossed by the Sandhikharka road are highly susceptible to erosion
and weathering,-particularly across the fragile Siwaliks. The road is subject to large landslides
X            across steep slopes.
4.5 LAND STABILITY
The Kalikot and Chhedegad roads were constructed 2-10 years ago, whilst the Sandhikharka
road came into operation as a fair weather road about a decade ago. Major stretches of these
three roads pass through marginal land between forest and other land use types.
The risk of slope failure along these roads was assessed from Land System maps (LRMP,
-i            1982-84) (see Appendix 7). The Kalikot road has the highest slope failure risk, followed by
the Sandhikharka road (see Table 4.5). The Chhedegad road has been assessed as being the
s ,I        most stable.

4.6 NATURAL HAZARDS
The Kalikot and Chhedegad roads mostly run close to the river banks of the Kamali and Bheri
Rivers respectively. River bank erosion or flood risk hazard is categorised into three groups
(i.e. none, moderate and high) based on Land System maps (LRMP, 1982-84) (see Appendix           I
8). Contrary to the general terrain, the proposed upgrading roads traverse no riverbank erosion
or flood risk areas. Stretches of the proposed upgrading roads prone to riverbank erosion and
flood risks are presented in Table 4.6.

4.7  LAND USE
Land use alongside the road ROWs was assessed off LRMP Land Utilisation maps (1982-84)
and is detailed in Table 4.7.

The roads mainly cross cultivation, forests and grasslands on hilislopes. Hillslope cultivation
is the main cultivation type, consisting of rainfed level terraces, rainfed sloping terraces and
irrigated level terTaces.
Approximately 11% of the roads cross rainfed level and sloping terraces, which are mainly
used to grow maize/upland rice in summer and wheat in winter. Approximately 17% of the
roads cross irrigated valley floor cultivation. which is mainly used to grow rice followed by
wheat. This land type is more productive than hillslope cultivation and therefore used to

produce high value crops such as wheat and transplanted rice. These fields are generally
irrigated from side tributaries of the main rivers. This cultivation type commonly includes tars,
mountain foot slopes and alluvial fans. The Sandhikharka and Chhedegad roads mainly cross
rainfed level and sloping terraces. Some sections of the upgrading roads cross rainfed terraces.
j            Approximately 16% and 6.1% of the roads cross forests and shrublands respectively. The
majority of these forests are immature, with crown coverage of about 50%. Shrub species are
generally less than 5 m in height and are commonly associated with grasslands and degraded
forests with less than 10% crown cover. Shrublands are usually located on cliff faces and steep
slopes with grades in excess of 200 and commonly have low vegetation species diversity.
Approximately 47%  of the roads cross grasslands located on steep to very steep slopes
generally in excess of 20°. Short sections of the roads cross rock outcrops, riverbeds, screes
-;           and accumulated debris, and cliff faces, comprising 3% by length.
4.8 FOREST COVER
J           Between 543% of each of the roads by length pass through forests, either Government or
Community managed. The majority of these forests are immature and degraded, with crown
coverage of less than 50%. The dominant forest species in the lower valley areas below 1,200
m elevation are Sal, Saj, Chir pine and tropical mixed hardwood species, whilst the dominant
species above 1,200 m are Chir pine and mixed hardwood species.
District forest cover by type and forest distribution by physiographic region for the seven
v1          districts crossed by the roads are detailed in Table 4.8 (WECS, 1995). These forest cover areas
are cumulative figures for all forests with crown densities within the range of 10-70%. The
estimated change in district forest stock over the period from 1979 to 1994 is also presented on
an average cumulative basis for all forest cover types.
* I          FRIS (1996) report that the main impacts on forests come from domestic cattle grazing, tree
i            lopping for fodder and fuelwood collection, followed by forest fires. It also identified that
human impact on forests is greatest between the altitudes of 1,000-2,500 m
The demand for fuelwood is mainly for cooking purposes. The per capita consumption of
x            fuelwood by enduse for the districts crossed by the proposed roads is detailed in Table 4.9.

4.9 WATER QUALITY
Rivers and springs that cross or are in the vicinity of the upgrading road ROWs appear to be
free of organic and chemical pollutants. Due to poor sanitation practices, stream and spring
water near settlement areas may be contaminated with animal and human faeces, making the
water microbiologically unsuitable for drinking. In the wet season, river water is turbid, due to
high sediment loads, whereas spring water may be microbiologically  contaminated
mnicrobiologically due to mixing with surface water.
The snow-fed Karnali River is turbid even in the hot surnmer months due to melting snow and
associated sediment, and continues to be turbid until the end of the monsoon in
September/October.
4.10 AIR AND NOISE POLLUTION
Ambient air quality in the upgrading road areas is generally good due to a lack of air polluting
industries and allied urban activities. However, haze occasionally covers the entire region
during both the winter and summer seasons. This usually results in reduced visibility in the
mountains for up to several weeks at a time. Haze is caused by high airborne dust generated
by winds passing over agricultural fields, and from smoke from forest and grassland fires.
Vehicular emissions and dust generated from earth roads are the main sources of air pollutants.
The quantity of dust emissions from an unpaved road varies linearly with the volume of traffic.
In addition, emissions depend upon the average vehicle speed, vehicle mix, surface texture and
surface mixture that characterise the condition of the road and the associated vehicular traffic
(U.S. EPA, 1975).
As current traffic volumes on the upgrading roads are minor, up to 128 per day, vehicular
emissions are of an insignificant volume to cause any marked local air quality deterioration.
Dust generated from the unsealed roads can cause a localised deterioration in air quality, but
this is minor and of a short duration. Hesketh and Cross (1981) reported that fugitive dust
from unpaved roads amounts to about 21 kg/vehicle kilometer (Canter, 1996).
Noise in the proposed upgrading road areas is predominantly generated by vehicle movements,
3            natural conditions (i.e. from  insects, winds and rivers flows) and human activities in
settlements. Noise from vehicles exceeds low background levels, whilst settlement noise
levels can be high during the day due to radios and cassette players.
It is assumed that noise levels within a 50 m distance of the roads currently exceed 65 dBA
c:j         (US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1985, in Canter, 1996) during vehicular
transit. Some 200 m distance from the roadway, vehicle noise levels are presumed to be at
background level. Given the low present traffic volumes, noise generated by traffic is not a
major concem.

5.1 REGIONAL AND DISTRICT CONTEXT
The three roads are generally situated in the Middle Mountains, with the exception of the
Sandhikharka road, which runs from the Terai through the Siwaliks into the Middle Mountains.
Two of the roads are situated in the Mid-Westem Development Region (MWDR) and one in
the Westem Development Region (WDR). The roads cross six districts (Table 5.1), while a
further four neighbouring districts may benefit from the improved access resulting from road
upgrading (i.e. where the upgraded roads are used as the primary route out of the hills).

A number of studies have been undertaken to assess the social development status of Nepal's
districts and development regions (see for example, Gurung, 1998). Without exception, these
studies point to the underdeveloped nature of the mountain/hill areas in general, and the Far-
Western Development Region (FWDR) and MWDR in particular. One of the most recent
studies (undertaken by ICIMOD  in 1997) rated Nepal's 75 districts according to 39
development indicators, broadly categorised as follows:
*  poverty and deprivation;
*  socio-economic, institutional and infrastructure development;
*  women's empowerment; and
*  natural resource endowment and management.

The key development indicators and ratings from the ICIMOD study are detailed in Table 5.3.
This shows that, with the exception of Surkhet District, the road districts situated in the
MWDR are poorly rated. The two WDR road districts (Kapilbastu and Arghakhachi) are rated
lower than Surkhet District, but are not in the 30 worst performing districts of the country.

The recently published Human Development Report (UNDP, 1998), which groups the
*     _     country's districts according to a Human Development Index (HDI), arrives at similar
conclusions. The HDI consists of three human components: longevitv (as a proxy for health-
related capabilities), education (as a proxy for knowledge and information-related capabilities)
and income (as a proxy for capabilities to acquire a particular level of living) (UNDP,
1998:33). The 1996 HDI value of 0.378 for the country indicates an overall low level of
human development (1.0 being the highest level of human development). Of the road districts,
Kalikot District has the lowest HDI (less than 0.2); Dailekh, Salyan and Kapilbastu Districts
are placed in the group of districts with the second lowest HDI (0.2-0.3), while most of the
country's districts (including Arghakhachi and Surkhet) have HDIs of between 0.3-0.4. Only
six districts have HDIs above 0.4 (UNDP, 1998:42).
5.2 DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILES AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
Table 5.4 summarises key population figures for the six road districts. The total projected
1998 population for the districts is 1,443,430. Kapilbastu District (situated in the Terai) has
the highest projected population figure for 1998, followed by Surkhet, Salyan and Dailekh
Districts. Population densities (based on 1991 population figures) vary considerably between
the road districts. Kapilbastu District has a population density of nearly 314 person/cm2, while
Arghakhachi, Dailekh and Salyan Districts have densities of between 124 and 152
persons/km2. Kalikot District has the lowest density at 51 persons/kM2.

Table 5.6 shows that the Chhetri ethnicfcaste group is in the majority in most of the districts.
Other major ethnic/caste groupings are Bahun (Arghakhachi, Kalikot and Dailekh Districts),
lMagar (Surkhet, Salyan and Arghakhachi Districts), Kami (Surkhet, Dailekh and Salyan
Districts) and Thakuri (Kalikot District). A significant percentage of the population in the
districts is classified as other, constituting various smaller ethnic groupings. Kapilbastu
District, in particular, consists of numerous small ethnic groups, with the most dominant being
Muslim (16.8% of the population), Tharu (I 1.8%) and Yadav (9.8%).

Table 5.7 lists key demographic features of the population recorded in the sample survey. A
total of 1,231 persons were recorded in the 213 households, giving an average household size
only slightly higher than the national average (5.8; minimum of two, maximum 22).
jouseholds predominantly consist of nuclear families (78.5% of the household population) and
other relatives such as grand-children, daughters-in-law and parents (18.2%). The age cohort
15 years and younger constitute about 42% of the household population, and the potentially
economically active population (16-65 years) some 57%.

Settlement patterns in the project areas generally reflect the distribution of arable land and the
development of market areas along trade routes. Accordingly, most of the areas exhibit a
scattered settlement pattern, interspersed by few large settlements. Apart from their trading
role, the larger settlements often have important administrative and service functions.
The primary hill/mountain centres in the project areas are the municipality of Birendranagar
(Surkhet District) and other district headquarters such as Salayan and Dailekh. The larger
urban centres of Nepalgunj and Butwal are located in the Terai, outside of the i=mediate
project areas. These Terai towns nevertheless are "critical junctures for trade and commnerce",
fimctioning as gateways into the Himalayan hills and mountain zones (Allan, 1998).
3            Migration from the hill areas to the Terai (lowlands) is a common demographic feature in
many hill/mountain districts, reflecting people's desire to gain access to agricultural land,
services and trade and employment opportunities.  Gurung's (1998) analysis of census
information shows that 86.2% of the out-migrants (i.e. place of enumeration different from
place of birth) reported in the 1991 census, originated in the mountain and hill zones. Out-
-            rnmigration from the hill zone constituted 72% of total internal migration, up by 10.7% from the
1981 census.  Out-migration from the more remote mountain zone, on the other hand,

decreased from 30.3% in 1981 to 4.2% in 1991. This dec==a.eis partly related to the fact that
the government practice of promoting and sanctioning settlement on forest land in the Terai
was discouraged from about 1980 and officially prohibited by 19S85. The continued movement
of hill people to the Terai, however, reflects the more direct economic, social and cultural links  -
between the hill and Terai zones.

The economy of Nepal centers around subsistence agriculture, with a small percentage of the
population formally employed outside the agricultural sector. Table 5.10 summarises the
occupational status of the population (1991) older than 10 years in the six road districts,
showing that the vast majority (90%  or more) of the population are recorded in the
farming/agricultural sector. The exceptions are Kapilbastu and Surkhet Districts, which have a
higher incidence of people recorded in the administrative, service and production labour
categories.

The socio-econornic survey generally confirms the district-level statistics. Of interest is the
percentage of persons involved in local commercial enterprises, with a corresponding decrease
in participation in subsistence agriculture. Occupational status also indicates an incidence of
labour migration (around 3%).
S   -   It should  be noted, however, that people  generally  do  not exclusively  practice  one
"occupation" but rather use a variety of strategies for their livelihood (Section 5.3.3 gives an
U              indication of the range of income-generating activities used by households during the past
year).

5.3.2    Agriculture and Land Tenure
Table 5.12 shows the number of registered landholdings and combined landholding area for the
six road districts for 1991. Average landholding sizes vary considerably, from 1.76 ha for the
Terai district of Kapilbastu, to 0.3 8 ha for the hill districts of Dailekh and Kalikot. The Nepal
Living Standards Survey (of 3,373 households) (CBS, 1996) recorded the following            I
landholding sizes:
*  Average for national sample    :    1.09 ha
*  Average for hill households  :     0.9 ha
*  Average for Terai households   :    1.3 ha
*  Average for MWDR             :      1.21 ha
*  Average for WDR              :     0.87 ha
The study also reveals the skewed distribution of land ownership. In the hill area, for example,
approximately 7% of the sampled households own/operate landholdings of 2 ha or larger,
constituting 36% of the total reported hill cultivation area. In the Terai, the 20% largest
landowners occupy more than 55% of the cultivation area (CBS, 1997). These statistics imply
-   that-large numbers-of households have marginal landholdings (less than 0.5 ha) that are
insufficient for household subsistence.

The socio-economic survey reveals a similar pattern of differentiation in landholding sizes,
which is concealed by the mean household landholding size (1.06 ha). For instance, the
number of landholders with reported holdings larger than 2.5 ha, constitute only 7.5% of the
sample but own more than 31% of the total reported landholdings. On the other hand, the
landholders with holdings of 0.5 ha or smaller, make up nearly 34% of the sample, but own
only 8.4% of the total landholdings.

Land tenure is mostly in the form of simple freehold (raikar). Cultivation land is registered in
terms of the Land Act 2021 (and amendments). Owners are issued land certificates (lalpurja)
and details are retained at district Land Survey and Land Revenue Offices, along with cadastral
- _     -maps. The land allocated to the original landowner is mostly inherited within the family,
although land transactions between non-related persons do  occur.   Fragmentation  of
landholdings is common, with household landholdings often consisting of a number of
dispersed land parcels.
Although private ownership is the dominant forn of land tenure (approximately 85% of
cultivated land is owner-operated; UNDP, 1998), other forms of tenure occur. These include
tenancy, mate or bandaki (essentially an informal loan system with the land parcels held as
surety by the money lender) and share-cropping. Low castes groups such as the Kami (iron
smith), Damai (tailor) and Sarki (shoemaker) are often landless or marginal landholders who
depend for their subsistence on other landowners.l
Cereals are the dominant crops and include rice, maize, wheat, millet and barely. Other crops
include lentil, mustard, and potato.
Livestock raising is the second most important production activity after cropping. Livestock
provide meat, milk, eggs and a cash income. Large livestock are also an integral part of
cropping activities, providing draught power and producing organic fertiliser. Livestock most
commonly held are cattle, water buffalo, goats and sheep.
Slavery was officially abolished in Nepal in 1924, yet the system of bonded labour (kamaiya) still prevails in the
Mid- and Far-Western Terai. According to officials figures there are approximately 15,000 kamaiya households in
the country, mainly in the Far-Western Terai districts (Kathmandu Post, 24/11/98). Debt-bonded agricultural
labourers (haliyas), mostly from low caste groups, are also found in the Mid-Western and Far-Western hills
(UNDP, 1998: 110-11I).

Notwithstanding the subsistence orientation of the agricultural sector, the majority of the
country's 75 districts (55 in 1995, including most of the road districts) experience food deficits
and the country has to import significant quantities of grain. Reliable officials figures are not
available, but estimates show a caloric shortfall of approximately 5% per person/day (UNDP,
1998: 65).
5.3.3   Income and Expenditure
In 1994, Nepal had a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of US$ 200, reflecting its status
as one of the poorest countries in the world. The Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS)
recorded a per capita income of US$ 143 for the country as a whole and US$ 131 for rural
areas (CBS, 1996). Within the rural areas, the incidence of poverty is higher in the hills than in
the Terai, and more concentrated in the westem parts (MLD, 1997). The NLSS per capita
income (in 1995/96 NRs) for the MXDR is some 22% lower than the national average, while
that of the WDR is much closer to the national average:
*  MWDR: NRs 6,038                                                                              -

Household income derives mainly from farm income, particularly in the MWDR where it
constitutes 71% of household income. Off-fa-rm income-generating opportunities are mainly
limited to such activities as general stores, restaurants/tea shops and the conveying of goods
(porters, sheep/mule trains).

Labour migration figures are not available at district level, but the incidence of both seasonal
(circular) and permanent labour migration is reported to be high, particularly in the MWDR.
Push/pull factors leading to migratory employment in India, the Terai and other areas of Nepal
include lack of work in the mountain/hill zones during the slack agricultural season and low
wage rates in the local off-farm economic sector (UNDP, 1998: 104). The incomes of these
migrant labourers are important components of household income and the local economy.

The main features of the reported sources of income and expenditure recorded in the socio-
itI           economic survey are as follows
_  Mean annual income of NRs 29,139, ranging from a minimum of NRs 1,200 to a maximum
I                 of NRs 163,700 (median NRs 20,000). While a wide range of strategies are used to gain
access to a cash income, few are used extensively. The most frequently listed sources
include income from own conmmercial establishments (e.g. tea shops), income from service
.-sJ              positions (e.g. teacher), income from the sale of agricultural and livestock products, and
income for trade (e.g. tailor).
*  Mean annual expenditure of NRs 30,254. The most commonly reported expenditure items
were kerosene, clothing, festivals/marriages, transport, health and food.
EJ
- It should be noted that the measurement of income and expenditure by means of questionnaire surveys is limited,
Questions on income may be seen as an invasion of household privacy, and the data collected is entirely
dependent on respondent recall and integrity.

5.4  KEY SOCIAL SERVICES AND FACILITIES
Table 5.19 summarises educational facilities and student enrolment for the road districts.
These figures show that the hill districts of Kalikot, Dailekh and Salyan in particular suffer
from inadequate secondary and tertiary educational facilities. Kalikot District, for example,
had only 13 secondary schools in 1994195 and secondary school students comprised less than
5% of the total student population. The same pattern is evident in Dailekh and Salyan
Districts.  In Surkhet, Kapilbastu  and Arghakhachi Districts, secondary  school students
constituted between 6% and 7% of the total student population.

Gross enrolment rates recorded in the NLSS show that primary school attendance is highest in
the WDR, followed by the Eastern Development Region and the MWDR. For lower secondary
and secondary schools, however, gross enrolment rates drop significantly (CBS, 1997). The
high student drop-out rate in the country is attributed to the following:
*  household work burden of children;
* irregularity of school operation;
N               *  household income poverty;
*  physical distances to schools;
l* ow perceived relevance of education; and
*  caste/ethnic discrimination and neglect of mother-tongue in school (UNDP, 1998).
Literacy rates therefore remain low, particularly in the MWDR which has one of the lowest
literacy rates in the country (31.89; 46.94 for males and 17.60 for females). The WDR, on the
other hand, has the highest literacy rate of all the Development Regions, namely 44.47 (58.24
for mnales and 32.82 for females) (UNDP, 1998).

5.5  HEALTH
The average life expectancy in Nepal was estimated at 55 years in 1994. Factors contributing
to this low life expectancy include:
* limited access to health facilities;
U               *  low level and quality of nutrition; and
*  acute sanitation problems (INDP, 1998).
3               Table 5.20 gives and indication of the problems that people in the road districts experience
with regard to access to health facilities. All the districts have few hospitals, health centers and
]4             primary health centers. Accordingly, people mainly rely on health posts and health sub-posts
that are often inadequately staffed and experienced to deal with the full range of health cases
and issues.

6 IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
a
6.1   IMPACTS
The potential direct and indirect environmental impacts associated with the proposed road
upgrading works are relatively minor in comparison with impacts resulting from the
construction of the road. Most direct ROW irnpacts have already occurred along the roads
proposed for upgrading as a result of large-scale vegetation clearance, major earthworks and
-~ 1rock blasting during construction. Likewise, indirect impacts associated with road use have
commenced, and it is assumed that, as a result of the proposed upgrading roadwork, traffic will
only increase to a marked degree in the post monsoon months of October and November, when
currently impassable roads will be made passable.
The likely environmental impacts from upgrading works are a function of the type and extent
of works that are likely to be undertaken. The proposed road upgrading to FWGT design
-       -standards (see Appendix 1) will involve the reforming of the existing road surface and the
application of a 3.5 m wide strip of gravel to the formation surface if these roads are currently
I            at FWET standards. At FWET standards, the roads already have a 4.5 m wide formation set
within a 30 m wide ROW, the samne specifications required for FWGT roads.
Unfortunately many sections of upgrading road are below FWET design standards, therefore
major site-specific works are proposed (see Sections 7.2, 8.2 and 9.2).
6.2 POTENTIAL BIO-PHYSICAL IMPACTS
i           In general, road upgrading activities will stabilise the road surface and formation and thereby
result in a number of environmental benefits, including improved slope stability and reduced
|           erosion and sedimentation. These types of benefits, together with the potential negative
impacts that will result, are described below.
*            Land Use Change
The standard upgrading works of road formation grading, gravelling and side drain
I            construction will not require an increase in the road formation width and therefore will not
require additional land. Site-specific major works, such as road widening, bank stabilisation
I           and drainage improvement, will generally require additional land for the road formation within
the ROW.

QjQSMEC
In practice, agricultural and forest land use is permitted by DOR within the road ROW as the
'full 30 m or 50 m width (for Major Feeder Roads and National Highways respectively) has
generally not been cleared or used for the road formation. Although this area is supposed to be
owned by HMGN as ROW, it has not paid compensation or taken permission for ROW use.
The proposed road widening will require the permanent use of additional land within the
ROW, which will result in the loss of productive private land, although the total area involved
will be minor.
l
Temporary ancillary sites are also required for the road upgrading works, including quarries
and borrow pits for gravel and rock extraction, material crushing and storage areas, and
workforce camps. Potential borrow pit sites have been identified, but the actual sites used will
only be decided upon once the contracts have been awarded.
Borrow pit sites will be chosen according to the availability of suitable gravel material and
their proximity to the associated roadworks. For quarries, where alternative sites are available,
the lowest value production land will be selected. Accordingly, land use change at these sites
will be temporary and generally involve lower value land. Again, the total area involved will
be relatively small, and the sites will be rehabilitated soon after use. However, it is customary
that once a quarry is opened its use may continue for an extended period after the proposed
roadworks.
Landform Stabilisation
The main bio-physical environmental benefit from the proposed road upgrading works will be
the stabilisation of the existing road formation, including cut and fill banks and drains. This
will be achieved primarily by reducing batter grades, constructing retaining walls, improving
drains and bio-engineering soil batters (revegetation). As a direct result of these works, batters
prone to landslides and erosion will be substantially stabilised, significantly reducing the
downslope sedimentation of agricultural land, watercourses, settlements and other features.
Ecological Degradation
Ecological degradation is only expected to increase marginally as a result of road upgrading.
Upgrading activities will directly cause minor degradation of the local ecology through the
clearance of srnall areas of vegetation at major work sites and ancillary sites.
A short term impact on ecology along the upgrading roads is likely to occur in and around the
quarry sites, material stockpiling areas and workforce camps during the construction period
due to minor vegetation clearance and the illegal harvesting of forest resources by the
workforce. A permnanent but relatively minor impact on ecology is likely to occur due to the
land use change and additional harvesting associated with an increased traffic volume along
the road corridors.

@SMEC
Road upgrading is expected to result in a minor traffic increase, based primarily on an increase
in access in the post-monsoon months of October, November and December. This will
indirectly result in ecological degradation as a result of an increase in traffic volume and
associated service industries over the life of the works.
Upgrading works are proposed to be undertaken by local labour, therefore only minor
additional local demands are expected to be placed on local natural resources for human use or
consumption during the contract period. This will include some additional illegal fuelwood
gathering in forests adjacent to upgrading roadworks by the workforce during construction.
Despite this range of ecological impacts, their cumulative impact on the local ecology is
expected to be minor, as the major impact was brought about by road construction.
6.3  POTENTIAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
Road upgrading under the RMD Project may have a direct impact on private, community and
government property. These impacts will be considerably less than in the case of new road
construction, being mainly limited to the areas required for actual upgrading works.
Nevertheless, the following different types of losses may occur within each category.

Through the acquisition of private and community assets, the RMD Project is expected to
affect titleholders (i.e. owners of registered land), tenants, squatters and encroachers.
Indirect social impacts may include: impacts on local cultural practices; effects on community
organisation; and the potential for general social development in the post-construction period,
primarily through better access to services, facilities and job opportunities, as well as      I
stimulation of the local economy.
This section describes the potential social development benefits that are likely to be provided
by the proposed upgrading works, whilst an assessment of the direct impacts (asset losses and
population displacement) are presented for each road in Sections 7.4, 8.4 and 9.4 by road
section.
6.3.1    Social Development Potential
HMGN's Eighth Plan (NPC, 1992), as well as the 4gricultural Perspective Plan, emphasise
the importance of rural road linkages in the development process. The lack of appropriate      j
levels of infrastructure (of which rural roads are a key component) is seen as a major
impediment to community development. The rural population, in particular, is restricted from
participating in economic growth, because of inadequate access to health, education, transport,  i
communication and market facilities.  Apart from  the periodic upgrading, repair and
maintenance of highways, the Eighth Plan, therefore, proposed the construction of new rural
roads, tracks and trails (MLD, 1997). As a component of this infrastructure development
programme, the RMD Project is anticipated to aid the Government's poverty alleviation efforts
as detailed in the Ninth Plan (NPC, 1998).
This emphasis on the role of roads in economic growth and poverty alleviation highlights the
fact that roads create opportunities for development: for example, by stimulating new or
enhanced income-generating opportunities. These indirect impacts are often much more
significant than the direct impacts caused during road construction or upgrading, since they
may induce enduring socio-economic changes.
The positive reaction of roadside communities and district officials to road upgrading,        i
underscores the importance attached to these indirect impacts. It was frequently stated, for
example, that improved roads would improve access to market areas and enhance opportunities
for the export of crops and livestock. Community support of the project does not imply a lack
of concern over possible property losses, but a belief that the development potential associated
with road upgrading outweighs direct adverse impacts.                                          3

Improved Access
The most obvious benefit associated with road upgrading is improved access to social services
and other facilities for the estimated 145,847 people in the 25 road VDCs. The population in
the roads' wider zones of influence, as well as more distantly-located persons, should also
benefit fTom road upgrading, since their journey times to services and opportunities in the
Terai and elsewhere may be reduced.
Nearly two thirds (65.7%) of the household respondents believed that their living standards
would be enhanced, through the improvement of access to social services and facilities. The
majority of respondents stated that the upgraded roads would improve their access to market
centres and health services, while improved access to schools (often located in the village or
sunrounding settlements) was considered less likely.

Substantive increases in levels of human development depend not only on improved access to
these types of facilities, but also on accompanying developments in the non-road sector (e.g.
; j           increases in the number of health facilities and schools). While it is difficult to separate road-
induced impacts from  other regional/national development efforts, evidence from  other
hill/mountain roads, nevertheless, suggests that roads do have a development effect. Earlier
reports on the impacts of the Lamosangu-Jiri Road Project (LJRP) and the multi-focused
Integrated Hill Development Project (IHDP), for instance, did not observe significant
j1            differences between national improvements in socio-economic indicators and those recorded in
the project area (SDC, 1990; 1991). Four years later, though, the final monitoring report found
that people in the area considered the road to have "induced more lasting and relevant changes
than the IMDP".  It has opened up the area, stimulated the creation of new business
opportunities and reduced the prices of imported goods. Accordingly, "many of the mega-
3             trends observed in the development of the regional economy can be attributed to the road"
(SDC, 1995).
This conclusion underscores the fact that development projects such as the IHDP are
interventions that rely on continued effort, and are often constrained from serving more than a
selected number of beneficiaries. In contrast, all-weather roads, such as the Lamosangu-Jiri
road, are permanent and their primary benefits (increased access and mobility) are available to
a wide pool of people.

ASMEC              E
The LJRP-IHDP reports, along with other studies <DOR, 1995; 1996; 1998), also note the
social development effects associated with improved access and mobility. Since the roads
cross three of the most underdeveloped districts (Kalikot, Dailekh and Salyan), their upgrading
may contribute in a similar manner to:
*  possible improvements in food supply and a reduction in the cost of consumer items;
*  possible improvements in the overall health status of people and a reduction in child
mortality rates, through improved access to health facilities, counseling and information;
*  possible improvements in the position of vulnerable social categories and groups, through
the creation and stimulation of income-generating opportunities and a reduction in social
and economic disparities.
The literature also points to a range of other socio-cultural effects (both positive and negative)
that may result from improved access, particularly to previously isolated areas. For instance,
the LJRP-IHDP monitoring reports found that younger people in the project area strived for an
urban lifestyle, that women from poorer households increasingly assumed farm management
responsibilities while their husbands migrated in search of seasonal work, and that labour
shortages and access to new economic opportunities have lead to a shift in occupational
patterns across caste/ethnic lines (SDC, 1991; 1995).
Many of these changes are already underway along the upgrading roads, particularly at the
more densely populated market areas on Sandhikharka and Chhedegad roads. As a result, the    I
group discussions on these roads elicited few responses about potential adverse socio-cultural
impacts. On the recently constructed Kalikot road, on the other hand, respondents were
concerned about the potential influx of workers and squatters, and the impact that this may
have on their lifestyles.
Economic Stimulation and Adjustment
The household interviews show that people are aware of the potential effects of road upgrading
on local agricultural production and off-farm income-earning activities and opportunities.
Even though the existing roads may already have induced local-level economic adjustments,
the majority of respondents, nonetheless, believed that upgrading of the roads would enhance
economic opportunities, such as small business development or crop exports. Only a small
percentage was concerned about a potential decrease in income from non-vehicular transport   I
provision.
Similarly, a relatively small percentage of the respondents believed that additional land
acquisition for road upgrading would have an adverse, effect on their agricultural production
levels.

The group discussions and interviews with business owners confirm many of the household
responses. For instance, it was commonly stated that the improved roads would stimulate the
l           development of local businesses, provide more reliable access to market areas for the
purchasing of merchandise, and increase the buying power of customers. Participants also
stated that cultivation and animal husbandry practices would be improved through more
X           reliable access to agricultural inputs and veterinary services. A more reliable road network to
the Terai would also stimulate the export of crops and livestock products.
However, these changes are not necessary automatic, nor do they occur in a short period of
time. The Lamosangu-Jiri road studies, for example, found that, apart from the export of seed
potatoes, there had been no "major export trend observable since the road opened". There had
i            been considerable production increases in the project area in the period between 1975-1995,
similar to increases reported for other hill areas. These increases were considered to be the
result of "many small changes in the agricultural system", an important one being the
introduction of chemical fertiliser following the opening of the road. While production of
potato and oranges had increased substantially, that of other staple crops had apparently
stagnated (SDC, 1995).
A  profit-maximising response to new  and enhanced commercial opportunities in the
j            agricultural sector is, therefore, not necessarily automatic. It is more likely where there already
is an established commercial agricultural sector, together with associated credit services, input
supplies and marketing arrangements. Additionally, subsistence farmers may (understandably)
be averse to diverting resources away from a known and secure form of farmning practice to a
commercial one which carries considerable risks. Thus, while road upgrading may enhance
the potential for economic diversification, it may take time for it to be fully realised.
As with the household interviews, participants in the group discussions were of the opinion
that road upgrading would not have a significant adverse impact on the incomes of non-
vehicular transport providers. Rather, most participants felt that these income-generating
activities may be enhanced, since the improved roads will increase the import of goods into the
districts and provide additional opportunities for porters and other transport providers to
convey goQds to off-road settlements. One of the LJRP-IHDP monitoring reports reached a
similar conclusion: porters undertake goods conveying over shorter distances, but because of
increased imports, their work opportunities remain more or less the same (SDC, 1990).

Finally, the group discussions show that although people are willing to make additional land
available for road upgrading, they are concemed about compensation for these losses,
particularly to small, marginal landholders. Participants were also dissatisfied that the land
already acquired for the initial construction of the roads had not been transferred to the
Govemment, alleging that they are still required to pay land taxes for this land.
Road Construction Employment
Access to construction employment opportunities is often regarded as an important (albeit
short-term) beneficial impact associated with a development. On large-scale projects with
significant local impacts and large numbers of construction jobs (e.g. hydroelectric projects),
the employment of local workers is often a sensitive issue. In the road sector, however,
construction and upgrading is generally undertaken through the annual allocation of small
contracts and it may take a number of years to complete a short road. This implies a relatively
small construction labour force per contract, in contrast to, for instance, the Arun road project,
where it was estimated that the road contractor would employ a labour force of more than
6,700 during peak dry seasons. Access to construction employment opportunities, while not
nearly at these levels, is nevertheless a potentially important beneficial impact.
The maximisation of local participation in road upgrading should be encouraged. From
discussions with a sample of contractors, the biggest constraint to achieving this aim appears to
be the unavailability/irregular supply of local workers resulting from agricultural obligations.
Cultivation is a key factor in household survival, and agricultural work therefore takes
precedence in decisions about the allocation of household labour.  However, because
subsistence agriculture is seldom sufficient for household survival, people also seek other
income-earning opportunities during the slack season. During these periods, the employment-
seeking decisions of people (men, mostly) are influenced by the returns they expect to get from
their efforts. Seasonal migration to the Terai and India probably offers the best chance of    -
earning a cash income, as opposed to potential work on road contracts that are awarded
according to the availability of government funds.
The household interviews would seem to suggest indifference to employment on road projects.
However, the group discussions show that rather than being unwilling to work on road
upgrading, people are concerned about wage rates offered by contractors. It was commonly      l
stated that people would be prepared to work on road upgrading if they are paid fair wages.
The employment of local job seekers will also reduce the social impacts associated with the    I
presence of a foreign workforce. These range from greater demand for, and pressure on, social
services and facilities (e.g. health, educational and water supply facilities and systems),
increases in the incidence of diseases (e.g. alcoholism, STDs and tuberculosis), to disturbances
to the social practices and fabric of local communities (e.g. changes to the position of women
and vulnerable groups; pressure on local authorities to maintain autonomy).                     1

The occurrence and significance of these imnpacts are a function of workforce size and
composition: the larger and more foreign the workforce, the higher the anticipated social
disturbances. The "development status" of local comnmunities, similarly, determines the extent
to which social disturbances may occur: the more isolated and underdeveloped the area, the
higher the anticipated disturbances.
Contract packaging for the upgrading road sections will consist of a single contract for each of
p            the roads, executed through international competitive bidding.   To maximise local
participation, consideration is being given to the preferential employment of local job seekers.
If implemented in this manner, the impact of foreign workers on the local social environment
will be significantly reduced. Nonetheless, some or all of the impacts referred to above may
occur, albeit at a reduced scale. For those individuals and households affected by these
impacts, the disturbances could be highly significant.
6.3.2    Loss of Assets and Resources
Given the context of local subsistence farming practices, the acquisition of land within a ROW
as specified in DOR design standards (30-50 m), will have far-reaching effects on roadside
households and conmnunities. A basic principle to be adopted by the project is, therefore, to
3     _   minimise land acquisition as far as possible. Accordingly, the corridor of impact (COI) on the
upgrading road sections is defined as the road formation plus a safety zone where necessary.
Asset acquisition will only take place where required for upgrading purposes (e.g. road
iwidening and realignment) or safety reasons.  It is anticipated that this COI will vary
(according to topography and upgrading requirements) between 6 m and 9 m.
The potential direct impacts associated with road upgrading are assessed under the headings:
- i         *  loss of buildings and structures;
* loss of cultivation land and other natural resources;
*  population displacement.

Information is drawn from (a) the detailed census survey undertaken on the Sandhikharka road
and the portion of the Kalikot road up to 85 kim, and (b) initial fieldwork undertaken on the
Chhedegad road during November-December 1999. The latter survey was undertaken prior to
the completion of the engineering feasibility studies. Estimates were made of assets located
within a 15 m and 30 m C01. The information gathered for the 15 m COI is presented in this
report, together with (reduced) estimates for asset acquisition associated with actual upgrading
]           works (i.e. a COI of roughly 9 m).

7 KALIKOT ROAD
7.1 EXISTING ROAD CONDITION
The Kalikot road commences at Bangesimal (km 0+000) in Surkhet District and ends at Sirane
(132+000) in Kalikot District. Although classified as an upgrading road, the latter portion of
the road is not yet fully constructed. The road has been divided into three sections, based on
existing surface and construction conditions:
*  Bangesimal-Syaule (0+000 to 40+000): this is the only gravel paved section of the road. It
generally has a formation width of 5.5 m and is motorable throughout the year. The only
settlement of note along this section is Baddichaur bazaar (km 26).                      ]
*  Syaule-Ramgadh (40+000 to 94+000): excavation of the road formation has been
completed, but because of landslides, this section is only motorable for part of the year.
Roadside settlements include Septi, Bagura, Dhungeshwor, Pali and Ramgadh.
*  Ramgadh-Siraner(94+000 to 132+000): this section has only been partly excavated. It
follows the left bank of the Karnali River through the settlements of Saigaon, Rakam, Jaksi
and Bheltadi.
The initial section of the road runs north-west past Syaule to the left bank of the Karnali River.
The road then runs northwards along the left bank, with the majority of the road located
approximately 100-150 m above the river level, although a few road sections from the Ramgad
Khola onwards are as low as 10-15 m above the river.                                         ]
In general, the road up to 94.000 km is in good condition and meets most DOR Major Feeder
Road design standards for earth roads once it has been cleared following the monsoon. The   ]
road generally crosses stable landforms on gentle gradients over the initial 40 km. Along this
section the road has sufficient width, at an average of 5-6 m wide, and a road gradient
generally below the 12% limit for Major Feeder Roads. From Kalyan to Lohore, the road
crosses unstable slopes. In the Lohore-Ramgad section, excluding the Paduka Khola, the road
alignment is relatively stable. However, the disposal of excess fill along this stretch will be
difficult due to steep terrain. After the Ramgad Khola, the road runs parallel to the Kamali
River, crossing hard rock areas slopes in excess of 600.
Along some road sections, retaining walls for slope stabilisation have been installed and cross
drainage structures, although not adequate, have been provided. Due to the extent of these
measures the road is relatively stable in comparison to other earth roads in the Middle     ]
Mountains of Nepal, however side drains do not exist along most of the road. In addition, the
existing road surface is of poor quality.                                                    ]

Unstable cut and fill embankments occur along approximately 4.6 km of the road. In addition,
mass wasting in the form of landslides is also occurring on cut batters in excess of 4 m high.
Since the road runs immediately upslope of the Kamali River, the wasted mass is generally
washed into the river, with minimal sedimentation occurring between the road and the river.
7.2 PROPOSED MAJOR WORKS
3            The proposed major upgrading works include road widening, slope stabilisation, drainage
improvement and the improvement of road geometry, including curves and gradients. All
proposed upgrading works are summarised in Table 7. 1.

m to 5.7 m. In addition, passing bays will be constructed at approximately 300 m intervals
along the road. These works will involve the extraction of an estimated total of a 300,000 mn3
of earth and rock.
A total of 4.623 km of retaining walls are proposed to stabilise the road formation where the
fill embankment has failed or the cut slope requires support.
An estimated 75,000 m3 of excess earth will be created by the proposed road widening works.
This material will be disposed of at low impact sites within or adjacent to the ROW. Rock
material extracted during road widening will generally be utilised to construct retaining walls.

Manual and mechanical methods of extraction will be utilised to extract material from
river/stream floodways without disturbing river banks and the river bed level.
7.2.2    Workforce Camp Sites
Approximately 14-21 workforce camp sites are required along the road. The location of these
camp sites will be determined during the course of the upgrading contract. Given that the
entire length of upgrading works will be accessible by vehicles, the number of camps will be
kept to a minimum. Camps will be located at a minimum distance of 6 km apart. Camp sites
previously used during road construction will be preferred if these sites have not been fully
rehabilitated. No camp sites will be located within forests or where tree clearance is required.

41 SMEC
7.3 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
7.3.1    Land Use Change
Additional land alongside the existing Kalikot road formation is required for the proposed road
upgrading works. This land is primarily required for road widening (9.488 ha), but a smaller
area is also required for constructing retaining walls and major drains, and reducing batter
grades.
Almost all additional land required for road widening is located within the existing ROW.
This land is composed of 1.643 ha of cultivation and 7.845 ha of other land use types. The net
conversion of 9.488 ha of land to road formation is a minor impact.
It should be noted that the proposed bio-engineering measures on 8.20 ha of bare or semi-bare
batters will result in an increase in forest cover within the ROW, offsetting the loss of forest
that will occur from the proposed upgrading activities.
7.3.2    Landform Stability
The main bio-physical impact of the proposed upgrading works will be the stabilisation of
4.623 m of unstable cut and fill banks with 261 retaining walls, 303 drains and 8.20 ha of bio-
engineering measures.
Unstable cut banks are common along the road due to a combination of steep grades, poor
drainage and unstable sub-surface geology. The installation of the proposed retaining walls,
drains and bio-engineering measures will substantially reduce landslides and erosion on road
banks, and thereby significantly reduce downslope sedimentation and damage to vegetation,
cultivation land and other features.
Landslide material deposited onto the road is currently pushed over the downslope side of the
road during clearing activities. Landslides will continue to occur along the road, but their
extent will be substantially reduced. Accordingly, downslope sedimnentation will also be
greatly reduced.
7.3.3    Ecological Degradation
The Kalikot road ROW does not pass through any protected areas or sites of identified
3           ecological significance.
An impact on local ecology will occur directly from the minor clearance of forest and
shrubland from the proposed upgrading works sites, and will potentially indirectly occur from
additional forest harvesting related to temporary workforce activities and the estimated annual
I          increase in traffic.
Road Maintenance and Development Project             47
Initial Environmental Examination of Upgrading Roads
May 1999



*SMEC
The potential ecological impact from the clearance of an estimated 3.9 ha of forest and
shrubland will be minor. This will be offset by bio-engineering vegetation growth on 8.20 ha
of currently bare or semi-bare batters, as well as a reduction in downslope sedimentation
damage to vegetation over time as a direct result of bank stabilisation.
The Kalikot road has been operational during each dry season for approximately 3-10 years. It
is reasonable to assume that some indirect impact on the local ecology within and neighbouring
the road ROW has resulted, and is continuing, due to improved access in the area and the
establishment of road induced activities, but it is not possible to quantify this impact. An
annual increase in traffic of 5.05% is expected to increase the existing annual indirect impact
on local ecology by a similar minor degree.
Accordingly, whilst some ecological degradation will result from the proposed upgrading
works, it is expected that this will be minor in both extent and significance, and be offset by the
long-term stabilisation of banks with vegetation.
7.3.4    Other Significant Features                                                       j
No significant geographical, archaeological or cultural sites are located within the road ROW
or in the vicinity of the road alignment, except the Karnali River, which is followed by the road
for approximately 92 lkn.
7.3.5    Noise
Noise is generated during road upgrading by blasting, hammering and other excavation
activities, material crushing and truck movements. The most significant noise that will be
generated by the proposed works will come from blasting. Blasting produces a high level,
short lived noise in the range of deafening (100-140 dBA) near the source (US Department of
Housing and Urban Development, 1985). Since blasting will not be produced regularly during
upgrading and will be carried out during the daytime, the associated noise pollution is
considered to be minor to moderate. The labour based construction techniques of hammering
and excavation generally produce a minor noise increase over background levels, therefore
these activities will not create any significant noise problems for local communities.
Material crushing by hand will not create a noise impact, but crushing in a plant will create a
minor to moderate localised, but short-term, impact.
During road operation, vehicle noise levels within 50 m of the roads are expected to slightly
exceed 65 dBA (US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1985, in Canter, 1996).
Approximately 200 m from the roads, vehicle noise levels will only be marginally above
background levels. Since the total number of vehicle movements per day are projected to
increase by in the order of 5% annually, the noise impact from additional traffic will be minor.

-   7.3.6   Vibration
Strong vibrations are produced from road blasting, which can damage nearby houses and other
-          structures. Controlled blasting using low volume charges will reduce the potential for damage
to structures, whilst owners of houses that will obviously be damaged will be fully
*            compensated.
During road operation, heavy vehicle movements can cause vibration damage to nearby house
structures. However, these vibrations will have a minor impact on houses located further than
50 m from the roadways unless the vibrations are accentuated by local geological conditions.
Approximately 4 additional heavy vehicles (tractors, mini trucks, trucks, mini buses and buses)
per day are projected to use the roads in the first year following upgrading, therefore the total
additional vibrations produced by these vehicles will be negligible.
7.3.7    Air Quality
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
upgrading and operation will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Air quality will not
be significantly affected because of the limited duration of upgrading activities at any one site,
and the limited number of additional vehicles (5 each day in the first year) and the dispersed
nature of traffic that will utilise the road in an area with generally good air quality.
Dust
- |         A deterioration in air quality from upgrading activities will primarily occur from  dust
generated by road excavation, spoil transportation and disposal. These activities will primarily
be labour based, with excavation mainly undertaken by hand, therefore dust generation is
anticipated to be minimal due to the small area of soil disturbance at any one time. In addition,
activities will progressively move along the ROW, so a prolonged deterioration in air quality
will not occur at any one site. The minor volumes of dust generated will cause a short-term
LJ          localised problem through settlements. Road construction workers will be exposed to minor
dust emissions over the construction period, with the quantity of dust partly dependent upon
wind conditions.
The generation of dust from road operation is expected to decrease from current levels due to
road surface gravelling. According to Hesketh and Cross, 1981 (in Canter, 1996), average dust
emissions from unpaved roads amount to approximately 21 kg per vehicle kilometer, whereas
3            emissions from the gravelled road are likely to be in the order of 2.25 kg per vehicle kilometer.

Exhaust Emissions
Exhaust emissions from additional traffic utilising the road will be minor. The estimated
additional vehicles during the first year following road upgrading will average only 5 extra
vehicles per day. Exhaust emissions from this traffic, calculated from Resource Institute data
(in Canter, 1996), are detailed in Table 7.3. These emissions, released over 132 km, will be   i
well dispersed.

Source: Canter, 1996.
Note: emissions were calculated by categorising traffic types into two groups: (1) gasoline cars
with average occupancy; and (2) diesel buses (transit). Cars and motorcycles were counted as
"cars", whilst all other vehicles were counted as "buses".
7.3.8    Drinking Water Catchments
Most villages along the ROW  obtain their water via gravity-fed reticulation systems from
upslope streams or springs.  In the settlements close to major rivers, where community         |
drinking water supply facilities do not exist, people draw drinking water directly from the
river.
Where damage to drinking water supply facilities and a reduction in water quality has resulted
from catchment destabilisation brought about by past road excavation, the upgrading works
will generally improve water quality by reducing erosion and landslides.
Minor erosion and sedimentation relating to the proposed road works are inevitable. During
periods when hillside streams are naturally clear (generally non-monsoon periods) this is likely
to result in turbidity and may cause blockages to supply lines.
Coarse and suspended sediment deposition in strearns will be minimised by rapidly
revegetating completed road batters and strictly controlling the disposal of excess fill.

7.4 POTENTIAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
7.4.1     Loss of Buildings and Other Structures
The nine VDCs crossed by the Kalikot road have the highest combined number of households
(12,881) of the three upgrading roads, and accounts for more than 45% of the population in the
road VDCs.  However, most of these households (estimated at 5,918) are located in the
municipality of Birendranagar, and the upgrading section traverses a small portion of the
municipality. The remainder of the road corridor is relatively sparsely populated.
The first section of the road, up to approximately 87 km, requires little widening. The impact
on buildings is, therefore, minimal: only 11 buildings are affected up to Nepa VDC. Since
some widening is required from km 87+00, it is estirnated that an additional 10 buildings will
be affected from this chainage up to the upgrading end-point.

Of the total of 11 buildings affected up to km 85+00, four are houses and six are commercial
enterprises. One kitchen is also affected. Most of these buildings are classified as kachhi.3
There are no affected community buildings or other structures on this section of the road.
I
3 Buildings in Nepal are often grouped into three categories, according to the type of building materials used:
Jhupro is a "rural hut" made of wood, bamboo or stone with mud mortar, and a thatched roof; Kachhi is a "semi-
urban structure" made of stone with mud mortar, and clay, timber, slate or corrugated iron roofing; Pakki is a
",permanent structure" made of bricks with mud or cement mortar, and slate, corrugated iron or RBC/RCC
roofing.

7.4.2     Loss of Land and Other Natural Resources
According to the engineering estimates, a total of 4.702 ha is required for road widening along
the area already surveyed (i.e. km  0+00 to km  87+00). Approximately 0.203 ha of this is
privately-owned cultivation land, located in four VDCs. In all four VDCs land take is fairly
insignificant, with the largest occurring in Nepa VDC (some 1, 150 m2 of rainfed cultivation).
It is estimated that a further 4.786 ha will be required for road widening from km 87+00 to km
132+00 (i.e. the area still to be surveyed). Of this, some 1.44 ha is taken to be cultivation land.

Table 7.7 shows that the cultivation land required between km 0+00 and km 85+00 is spread
over 26 land parcels. These parcels belong to 23 owners, most of whom are located in Nepa
VDC. There are no tenants or squatters on this section of the road.
It is estimated that road widening from km 87+00 to km 132+00 may affect an additional 156
3            landowners.

The Entitlement Framework established for the RMD Project makes provision for the payment
of cultivation disruption allowances to households whose production levels are severely
affected by land acquisition. With respect to land losses, a severely affected project family
(SPAF) is defined as: a household from whom land acquisition exceeds 25%  of its total
landholdings, in the case of landholdings larger than 0.25 ha, or 10% of its total landholdings,
in the case of landholdings of 0.25 ha or smaller, or where land losses lead to the remaining
landholding not being economically viable (as identified through the participatory application
of context-specific criteria; see Section 10.2).
Table 7.8 shows that none of the landowners are expected to be severely affected by land
losses.

7.4.3     Population Displacement
The results of the census survey (up to km 85) show that property acquisition for upgrading of
the Kalikot road is fairly insignificant: 10 owners will lose buildings only, 22 will lose land
only, and 1 will lose both land and buildings. Nepal is the worst affected of the VDCs along
this section of the road, with a total of 16 affected owners.
Because the remaining road section up to km  132+00 requires considerable widening, it is
estimated that an additional 158 property owners may be affected by upgrading activities,
through the acquisition of buildings, land or both.

Table 7.10 details population displacement estimates for Kalikot road upgrading. Along the
area already surveyed, population displacement and involuntary resettlement is minimal: out of
a total of 33 affected households (312 persons), only 4 (74 persons) will require resettlement
because of the acquisition of their residential properties.4 It is estimated that an additional 10
households (64 persons) will be displaced along the remaining 47 km still to be surveyed.

All of the affected households along the section surveyed are willing to make their land
available for road upgrading. While some respondents expressed a willingness to donate the
required land, the majority requested compensation (in replacement land or cash).5 Similarly,
cash compensation was the most common preference for affected buildings.
While there was a concern over the loss of cultivation land, few respondents believed that land
acquisition would significantly affect their agricultural production levels.6 It was commonly
stated that road upgrading will increase agricultural and livestock farming activities in the area,
through an improvement in access to markets and agricultural support services.
Respondents were also hopeful that land prices along the road may increase following road
upgrading.

5The group discussions conducted during the initial fieldwork also highlighted people's dissatisfaction with land
donated for the initial road construction still being registered in their names (i.e. owners still liable for taxes on
land acquired by the roads). A total of 98 persons have already donated land (up to km 85+00) for the initial
construction of the road.
6 Of 32 affected landowners interviewed up to km 85, only six (19%) indicated that their production is sufficient
for their annual subsistence requirements. The majority indicated food sufficiency of between four and six
months.

8 CHHEDEGAD ROAD
8.1 EXISTING ROAD CONDITION
The section of the Chhedegad road proposed for upgrading starts at Bhulke, Surkhet District,
24+500 km from Chhinchu, and ends at Dhaira, 61.5 km from Bhulke. The road follows the
left bank of the Bheri River up to Salli Bazaar (45 km), passing through Dharapani, Sangrahi  p
and Sallibazaar villages in Salyan District, before crossing to the right bank into Surkhet
District (a ferry service operates during the winter and dry months).
After the crossing, only 15 km of the road is motorable, with the remaining length under
construction. The road runs parallel along the right bank of the river, passing through the
villages of Rakam, Jamune Bazaar, Bali, Pusta, Agrigaon, Kakretara, Thanti Bazaar, Lukai,
Lirta, Thara, Ali, Bhutchaur, Phera and Chhedegad, before reaching Dhaira. The majority of
the road runs approximately 50 m above the river level, although a few sections are as low as
8-10 m above the river (i.e. at Dharapani, Lirta and Bhutchaur).
In general, the road is in good condition, although it does not meet all DOR Major Feeder  U
Road design standards for earth roads. The road width along most sections is narrow, in the
range of 3-4 m wide, with a gradient generally below the 12% limit for Major Feeder Roads.
The road generally crosses stable landforms on gentle gradients, however, some short sections
of the road have high gradients.
Along some road sections retaining walls for slope stabilisation have been installed and cross
drainage structures, although not adequate, have been provided. Due to these measures the
Bhulke-Sallibazaar road section is relatively stable in comparison to other earth roads in the
Middle Mountains of Nepal, however side drains do not exist along most of the road. In
addition, the existing road surface is of poor quality.
Unstable stretches of cut and fill batters occur along the road corridor near the Simta Khola,
Gajedagaon, Balikhola and Kakretaragaon. In addition, mass wasting due to sliding is
occurring at some sites where the cut batter is in excess of 4 m high. Since the road corridor
passes parallel to the Bheri River, the wasted mass is generally being washed into the river,
with minimal sedimentation occurring between the road and the river.
The road runs mostly through marginal lands, and has had minimum impact on cultivated lands
and settlements. Very few slope stabilisation retaining walls and cross-road drains have been
installed. Likewise, no side drains exist along the road and the existing road surface is of poor
quality.

of earth and rock.
A total of 770 m of retaining walls are proposed to stabilise the road formation where the fill
embankment has failed or the cut slope requires support.
An estimated 25,500 m3 of excess earth will be created by the proposed road widening works.
This material will be disposed of at low impact sites within or adjacent to the ROW. Rock

8.2.1    Proposed Extraction Sites
Gravel aggregates, stones, boulders and sand required for the upgrading works will be mainly
sourced from major rivers and tributaries close to the roadworks. The main borrow pits
proposed and the maximum extraction volumes from each site are detailed in Table 8.2.

river/stream floodways without disturbing river banks and the river bed level.               ]
8.2.2    Workforce Camp Sites
Approximately 14-21 workforce carnp sites are required along the road. The location of these
camp sites will be determined during the course of the upgrading contract. Given that the
entire length of upgrading works will be accessible by vehicles, the number of camps will be
kept to a minimum. Camps will be located at a minimum distance of 6 km apart. Camp sites
previously used during road construction will be preferred if these sites have not been fully
rehabilitated. No camnp sites will be located within forests or where tree clearance is required.
8.3  POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
8.3.1    Land Use Change
Additional land alongside the existing Chhedegad road formation is required for the proposed
road upgrading works. This land is primarily required for road widening (6.922 ha), but a
smaller area is also required for constructing retaining walls and major drains, and reducing
batter grades.                                                                                ]

Initial Environmental Examination of Upgrading Roads
May 1999



#0SMEC
Almost all additional land required for road widening is located within the existing ROW.
This land is composed of 3.880 ha of cultivation and 3.042 ha of other land use types. The net
conversion of 6.922 ha of land to road formation is a minor impact.
It should be noted that the proposed bio-engineering measures on 2.80 ha of bare or semi-bare
batters will result in an increase in forest cover within the ROW, easily offsetting the loss of
forest that will occur from the proposed upgrading activities.
8.3.2    Landform Stability
The main bio-physical impact of the proposed upgrading works will be the stabilisation of
4.623 m of unstable cut and fill banks with 41 retaining walls, 105 drains and 8.20 ha of bio-
engineering measures.
>1         Unstable cut banks are conmmon along the road due to a combination of steep grades, poor
drainage and unstable sub-surface geology. The installation of the proposed retaining walls,
drains and bio-engineering measures will substantially reduce landslides and erosion on road
banks, and thereby significantly reduce downslope sedimentation and damage to vegetation,
cultivation land and other features.
Landslide material deposited onto the road is currently pushed over the downslope side of the
road during clearing activities. Landslides will continue to occur along the road, but their
extent will be substantially reduced. Accordingly, downslope sedimentation will also be
greatly reduced.
8.3.3    Ecological Degradation
The Chhedegad road ROW does not pass through any protected areas or sites of identified
ecological significance.
An impact on local ecology will occur directly from the minor clearance of forest and
shrubland from the proposed upgrading works sites, and will potentially indirectly occur from
additional forest harvesting related to temporary workforce activities and the estimated annual
increase in traffic.
The potential ecological impact from the clearance of an estimated 1.5 ha of forest and
shrubland will be minor. This will be offset by bio-engineering vegetation growth on 2.80 ha
of currently bare or semi-bare batters, as well as a reduction in downslope sedimentation
damage to vegetation over time as a direct result of bank stabilisation.
The Chhedegad road has been progressively constructed over the last 6 years. It is reasonable
to assume that some indirect impact on the local ecology within and neighbouring the road
ROW has resulted, and is continuing, due to improved access in the area and the establishment
of road induced activities, but it is not possible to quantify this impact. An annual increase in

QSMEC             U
traffic of 5. 10% is expected to increase the existing annual indirect impact on local ecology by
a similar minor degree.
Accordingly, whilst some ecological degradation will result from the proposed upgrading
works, it is expected that this will be minor in both extent and significance, and be offset by the
long-term stabilisation of banks with vegetation.
8.3.4    Other Significant Features
No significant geographical, archaeological or cultural sites are located within the road ROW
or in the vicinity of the road alignment.
8.3.5   Noise
Noise is generated during road upgrading by blasting, hammering and other excavation
activities, material crushing and truck movements. The most significant noise that will be
generated by the proposed works will come from blasting. Blasting produces a high level,
short lived noise in the range of deafening (100-140 dBA) near the source (US Department of
Housing and Urban Development, 1985). Since blasting will not be produced regularly during
upgrading and will be carried out during the daytime, the associated noise pollution is
considered to be minor to moderate. The labour based construction techniques of hammering
and excavation generally produce a minor noise increase over background levels, therefore
these activities will not create any significant noise problems for local conmmunities.
Material crushing by hand will not create a noise impact, but crushing in a plant will create a
minor to moderate localised, but short-term, impact.
During road operation, vehicle noise levels within 50 m of the roads are expected to slightly
exceed 65 dBA (US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1985, in Canter, 1996).
Approximately 200 m from the roads, vehicle noise levels will only be marginally above
background levels. Since the total number of vehicle movements per day are projected to
increase by in the order of 5% annually, the noise impact from additional traffic will be minor.
8.3.6   Vibration
Strong vibrations are produced from road blasting, which can damage nearby houses and other
structures. Controlled blasting using low volume charges will reduce the potential for darnage
to structures, whilst owners of houses that will obviously be damaged will be fully
compensated.
During road operation, heavy vehicle movements can cause vibration damage to nearby house
structures. However, these vibrations will have a minor impact on houses located fiurther than
50 m from the roadways unless the vibrations are accentuated by local geological conditions.
Approximately 3 additional heavy vehicles (tractors, mini trucks, trucks, mini buses and buses)

#SMEC
per day are projected to use the roads in the first year following upgrading, therefore the total
additional vibrations produced by these vehicles will be negligible.
8.3.7    Air Quality
j            The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
upgrading and operation will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Air quality will not
be significantly affected because of the limited duration of upgrading activities at any one site,
E            and the limited number of additional vehicles (3 each day in the first year) and the dispersed
nature of traffic that will utilise the road in an area with generally good air quality.
Dust
A deterioration in air quality from  upgrading activities will primarily occur from  dust
generated by road excavation, spoil transportation and disposal. These activities will primarily
be labour based, with excavation mainly undertaken by hand, therefore dust generation is
anticipated to be minimal due to the small area of soil disturbance at any one time. In addition,
activities will progressively move along the ROW, so a prolonged deterioration in air quality
will not occur at any one site. The mninor volumes of dust generated will cause a short-term
localised problem through settlements. Road construction workers will be exposed to minor
dust emnissions over the construction period, with the quantity of dust partly dependent upon
wind conditions.
The generation of dust from road operation is expected to decrease from current levels due to
road surface gravelling. According to Hesketh and Cross, 1981 (in Canter, 1996), average dust
emissions from unpaved roads amount to approximately 21 kg per vehicle kilometer, whereas
emissions from the gravelled road are likely to be in the order of 2.25 kg per vehicle kilometer.
Exhaust Emissions
J            Exhaust emissions from additional traffic utilising the road will be minor. The estimated
additional vehicles during the first year following road upgrading will average only 7 extra
vehicles per day. Exhaust emissions from this traffic, calculated from Resource Institute data
(in Canter, 1996), are detailed in Table 8.3. These emissions, released over 132 kIn, will be
*            well dispersed.

Note: emissions were calculated by categorising traffic types into two groups: (1) gasoline cars
with average occupancy; and (2) diesel buses (transit). Cars and motorcycles were counted as
"cars", whilst all other vehicles were counted as "buses".
8.3.8    Drinking Water Catchments
Most villages along the ROW obtain their water via gravity-fed reticulation systems from
upslope streams or springs. In the settlements close to major rivers, where community
drinking water supply facilities do not exist, people draw drinking water directly from the
river.
Where damage to drinking water supply facilities and a reduction in water quality has resulted
from catchment destabilisation brought about by past road excavation, the upgrading works
will generally improve water quality by reducing erosion and landslides.
Minor erosion and sedimentation relating to the proposed road works are inevitable. During
periods when hillside streams are naturally clear (generally non-monsoon periods) this is likely
to result in turbidity and may cause blockages to supply lines.
Coarse and suspended sediment deposition in streams will be minimised by rapidly
revegetating completed road batters and strictly controlling the disposal of excess fill.
8.4  POTENTIAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
8.4.1    Loss of Buildings and Other Structures
Chhedegad is the least populated of the three upgrading roads, accounting for less than 25% of
the population resident in the 25 road VDCs. Nonetheless, in contrast to Kalikot, the road
corridor is characterised by numerous small settlements, while the area around Salli Bazaar has
a considerable concentration of people.
Table 8.4 shows that a COI of 15 m would affect an estimated 119 private and six community
buildings, located across all nine of the road VDCs. By limiting the COI to actual areas
required for upgrading, an estimated 46 private and three community buildings will be
acquired.

8.4.3    Population Displacement
The Chhedegad road census survey (terminated because of potential civil unrest and security
problems) is scheduled to be completed by mid-June 1999. It is, consequently, not possible to
give accurate figures pertaining to population displacement. Based on the initial fieldwork, it
is estimated that some 23 households (140 persons) will be displaced by road upgrading. This
represents a significant reduction over the 15 m COI scenario, where an estimated 54
additional households (324 persons) would have been displaced.

* Based on an average COI of between 7-9 m; SMEC-CEMAT Field Surveys, 1998/99.
Affected households were generally willing to make their land available for road upgrading.
IWhile some respondents expressed a willingness to donate the required land, the majority
requested compensation (in replacement land or cash).7 Similarly, cash compensation was the
most common preference for affected buildings.
While there was a concern over the loss of cultivation land, few respondents believed that land
|_           acquisition would significantly affect their agricultural production levels. Some stated that
road upgrading would increase agricultural and livestock farming activities in the area, by
improving access to markets and agricultural support services.
Respondents were also hopeful that land prices along the road would increase following road
upgrading.
7 The group discussions conducted during the initial fieldwork also highlighted people's dissatisfaction with land
donated for the initial road construction still being registered in their names (i.e. owners still liable for taxes on
land acquired by the roads).

J`
9.1  EXISTING ROAD CONDITION                                                               3
The section of the Sandhikharka road proposed for upgrading starts at Birpur, Kapilbastu
District, 9 km north of Gorusinge. It crosses several kilometers of Terai before ascending at
Patharkot through hill terrain to Thada. From Thada, the road descends to Sitapur, then runs
on the left bank of the Supa Khola. The road crosses the Supa Khola then ascends over rolling
terrain to reach Narapani, the highest point of the road. From Narapani, the road descends to
Sandhikharka, the headquarters of Arghakhachi District. The road corridor passes through the
villages of Dote, Rachhe, Chakla, Thada, Budichaur, Sitapur, Bhanipata, Supadeuralri,      2
Ghumti, and Dhadkhola.
In general, the road is in poor condition and does not meet most DOR Major Feeder Road     ;
design standards for earth roads. The road has an average width of 5-6 m up to Dote village
then narrows to 3.0-4.5 m in some sections. The Toad has a gradient generally below the 12%
limit for Major Feeder roads.
The section from Patharkot (km 2) to Narapani (km 59) is prone to landslides during the rainy
season. The section from Narapani to Sandhikharka generally passes through stable land areas
and experiences few landslides. In general, the existing road surface is of poor quality. The
surface of the Pattharkot-Supa Khola and Ghumti-Sandhikharka sections of the road have
mainly been formed from red soils. When these soils are wet they are slippery and retain
moisture, whilst when dry they are hard and provide a durable road surface. The Supa Khola-
Ghumti section of the road crosses a limestone formation.
Along some road sections, retaining walls for slope stabilisation have been installed and cross-
road drainage structures, although not adequate, have been provided. At many locations cross-
fall, drainage of hairpin stacks and side drains are not adequate and need to be improved to
safely discharge greater volumes of storm runoff and maintain the road surface condition all
round the year.
Unstable cut and fill banks occur along approximately 12.6 km and 13.3 km of the road |
respectively. In addition, mass wasting in the form of landslides is occurring at 14 major sites
with cut batters in excess of 4 m high.

Bio-engineering                        7,033     11.26
A total of 18.711 km of road, consisting of 49 separate sections, will be widened, generally
from 3.0-4.5 m to 5.7 m. In addition, passing bays will be constructed at approximately 300 m
intervals along the road. These works will involve the extraction of an estimated total of
130,569 m3 of earth and rock, creating an estimated 41,782 m3 of excess fill. This material
will be disposed of at low impact sites within or adjacent to the ROW, or at borrow pits or
quarries. Rock material extracted during road widening will generally be utilised to construct
retaining walls.
A total of 205 retaining walls (7.745 km) are proposed to stabilise the road formation where fill
embankments have failed or cut slopes require support. New drains consisting of 119 pipe
culverts and 31 floodways will also be installed.
Bio-engineering measures will be implemented on all bare or semi-bare cut and fill earth
batters to help stabilise them, totalling 11.26 ha.

9.2.1    Proposed Extraction Sites
Gravel aggregates, stones, boulders and sand required for the upgrading works will be mainly
sourced from major rivers and tributaries close to the roadworks. The main borrow pits
proposed and the maximum extraction volumes from each site are detailed in Table 9.2.      1

Manual and mechanical methods of extraction will be utilised to extract material from
river/stream floodways without disturbing river banks and the river bed level. Blasting may be
required at the Deurali and Narapani extraction sites for the material extraction.
9.2.2    Workforce Camp Sites
Approximately 6-9 workforce camp sites are required along the road. The location of these
camp sites will be determined during the course of the upgrading contract. Given that the
entire length of upgrading works will be accessible by vehicles, the number of camps will be
kept to a rriinimum. Carnps will be located at a minimum distance of 6 km apart. Camp sites
previously used during road construction will be preferred if these sites have not been fully
rehabilitated. No camp sites will be located within forests or where tree clearance is required.
9.3  POTENTIAL BIO-PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
9.3.1    Land Use Change
Additional land alongside the existing Sandhikharka road formation is required for the
proposed road upgrading works. This land is primarily required for road widening (2.08 ha),
but a smaller area is also required for constructing retaining walls and major drains, and
reducing batter grades.

*SMEC
Almost all additional land required for road widening is located within the existing 30 m wide
ROW. This land is composed of 1.386 ha of rainfed cultivation and 0.694 ha of other land use
types. The net conversion of 2.08 ha of land to road formation is a mninor impact.
It should be noted that the proposed bio-engineering measures on 11.26 ha of bare or semi-bare
3J           batters will result in an increase in forest cover within the ROW, easily offsetting the loss of
forest that will occur from the proposed upgrading activities.
9.3.2    Landform Stability
The main bio-physical impact of the proposed upgrading works will be the stabilisation of
7.745 m of unstable cut and fill banks with 205 retaining walls, 150 drains and 1 1.26 ha of bio-
engineering measures.
Unstable cut banks are common along the road due to a combination of steep grades, poor
drainage and unstable sub-surface geology. The installation of the proposed retaining walls,
drains and bio-engineering measures will substantially reduce landslides and erosion on road
banks, and thereby significantly reduce downslope sedimentation and damage to vegetation,
cultivation land and other features.
Landslide material deposited onto the road is currently pushed over the downslope side of the
road during clearing activities. Landslides will continue to occur along the road, but their
extent will be substantially reduced. Accordingly, downslope sedimentation will also be
greatly reduced.
9.3.3    Ecological Degradation
The Sandhikharka road ROW does not pass through any protected areas or sites of identified
ecological significance.
An impact on local ecology will occur directly from the minor clearance of forest and
shrubland from the proposed upgrading works sites, and will potentially indirectly occur from
additional forest harvesting related to temporary workforce activities and the estimated annual
increase in traffic. The Pattharkot-Thada section of the road, which runs through an area of
good forest cover, is likely to be more vulnerable to ecological degradation, particularly from
the upgrading workforce.
The potential ecological impact from the clearance of an estimated 0.35 ha of forest and
shrubland will be minor. This will be offset by bio-engineering vegetation growth on 11.26 ha
of currently bare or semi-bare batters, as well as a reduction in downslope sedimentation
damage to vegetation over time as a direct result of bank stabilisation.

Q*SIMEC 
The Sandhikharka road has been operational during each dry season for several decades. It is
reasonable to assume that some indirect impact on the local ecology within and neighbouring
the road ROW has resulted, and is continuing, due to improved access in the area and the
establishment of road induced activities, but it is not possible to quantify this impact. An
annual increase in traffic of 5.32% is expected to increase the existing annual indirect impact
on local ecology by a similar minor degree.
Accordingly, whilst some ecological degradation will result from the proposed upgrading
works, it is expected that this will be minor in both extent and significance, and be offset by the
long-term stabilisation of banks with vegetation.
9.3.4   Significant Features
Supa Deurali temple, situated within the road ROW near Narapani, is a locally important
archaeological site. It was reported that the temple was renovated in 1984. Many Hindu
devotees visit and worship daily in this temple, and Baishakh Purnima (full moon day) is the
main festival celebrated. The site is situated on a hard limestone rock mass which is proposed
to be partially excavated for road widening. Accordingly, all excavation will be undertaken
manually, and some additional rock excavation will be undertaken to provide additional space
for devotees to congregate. Providing that excavation is undertaken carefully, the proposed
upgrading works should not harrn the temple and should provide a community benefit.
9.3.5    Noise
Noise is generated during road upgrading by blasting, hammering and other excavation
activities, material crushing and truck movements. The most significant noise that will be
generated by the proposed works will come from blasting. Blasting produces a high level,
short lived noise in the range of deafening (100-140 dBA) near the source (US Department of
Housing and Urban Development, 1985). Since blasting will not be produced regularly during
upgrading and will be carried out during the daytime, the associated noise pollution is
considered to be minor to moderate. The labour based construction techniques of hammering
and excavation generally produce a minor noise increase over background levels, therefore
these activities will not create any significant noise problems for local communities.
Material crushing by hand will not create a noise impact, but crushing in a plant will create a
minor to moderate localised, but short-terrn, impact.
During road operation, vehicle noise levels within 50 m of the roads are expected to slightly
exceed 65 dBA (US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1985, in Canter, 1996).
Approximately 200 m from the roads, vehicle noise levels will only be marginally above
background levels. Since the total number of vehicle movements per day are projected to
increase by in the order of 5% annually, the noise impact from additional traffic will be minor.

9.3.6    Vibration
Strong vibrations are produced from road blasting, which can damage nearby houses and other
structures. Controlled blasting using low volume charges will reduce the potential for damage
to structures, whilst owners of houses that will obviously be damaged will be fully
X            compensated.
During road operation, heavy vehicle movements can cause vibration damage to nearby house
structures. However, these vibrations will have a minor impact on houses located further than
50 m from the roadways unless the vibrations are accentuated by local geological conditions.
Approximately 16 additional heavy vehicles (tractors, mini trucks, trucks, mini buses and
buses) per day are projected to use the roads in the first year following upgrading, therefore the
total additional vibrations produced by these vehicles will be negligible.
9.3.7    Air Quality
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
upgrading and operation will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Air quality will not
be significantly affected because of the limited duration of upgrading activities at any one site,
and the limited number of additional vehicles (7 each day in the first year) and the dispersed
nature of traffic that will utilise the road in an area with generally good air quality.
Dust
A deterioration in air quality from  upgrading activities will primarily occur from dust
generated by road excavation, spoil transportation and disposal. These activities will primarily
be labour based, with excavation mainly undertaken by hand, therefore dust generation is
anticipated to be minimal due to the small area of soil disturbance at any one time. In addition,
activities will progressively move along the ROW, so a prolonged deterioration in air quality
will not occur at any one site. The minor volumes of dust generated will cause a short-term
localised problem through settlements. Road construction workers will be exposed to minor
dust emissions over the construction period, with the quantity of dust partly dependent upon
X            r wind conditions.
The generation of dust from road operation is expected to decrease from current levels due to
road surface gravelling. According to Hesketh and Cross, 1981 (in Canter, 1996), average dust
emissions from unpaved roads amount to approximately 21 kg per vehicle kilometer, whereas
emissions from the gravelled road are likely to be in the order of 2.25 kg per vehicle kilometer.

OSMEC
Exhaust Emissions
Exhaust emissions from additional traffic utilising the road will be minor. The estimated
additional vehicles during the first year following road upgrading will average only 7 extra
vehicles per day, although the composition of traffic will change. Exhaust emissions from this
traffic, calculated from Resource Institute data (in Canter, 1996), are detailed in Table 9.3.
These emissions, released over 59 km, will be well dispersed.

Source: Canter, 1996.
Note: emissions were calculated by categorising traffic types into two groups: (1) gasoline cars
with average occupancy; and (2) diesel buses (transit). Cars and motorcycles were counted as
"cars", whilst all other vehicles were counted as "buses".
9.3.8    Drinking Water Catchments
Most villages along the ROW obtain their water via gravity-fed reticulation systems from
upslope streams or springs. In the settlements close to major rivers, where community
drinking water supply facilities do not exist, people draw drinking water directly from the
river.
Where damage to drinking water supply facilities and a reduction in water quality has resulted
from catchment destabilisation brought about by past road excavation, the upgrading works
will generally improve water quality by reducing erosion and landslides.
Minor erosion and sedimentation relating to the proposed road works are inevitable. During
periods when hillside streams are naturally clear (generally non-monsoon periods) this is likely
to result in turbidity and may cause blockages to supply lines.
Coarse and suspended sediment deposition in streams will be minimised by rapidly
revegetating completed road batters and strictly controlling the disposal of excess fill.
The Sandhikharka road passes along the bank of a natural pond in Thada village. It was
reported that the pond has a depth of 2-2.5 m and a perennial water source. Local people use  j
the pond for bathing, washing and stock watering. Stormwater runoff laden with a high
sediment load is filling the pond at an excessive rate. The existing road formation has
increased the rate of sedimentation. The improvement of road drainage at this site, coupled
with road bank stabilisation, will reduce the current rate of pond sedimentation.

9.4 POTENTIAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
9.4.1    Loss of Buildings and Other Structures
the Sandhikharka road is the most heavily populated of the upgrading roads. Major settlements
a            and market centres include: Patharkot, Chakla, Amarai, Thada, Sitapur, Narapani, Ghumti,
Fudwang and Sandhikharka.
Because of this population concentration along the road, there is a significant reduction in
building acquisition by limiting land take to actual areas required for upgrading (as opposed to
a 15 m COI). Table 9.4 shows that a total of 69 buildings will be affected by upgrading,
consisting of 65 private buildings and four community buildings. Three water points will also
be affected.
Thada, Khanchikot and Sitapur are the most heavily affected VDCs.

The majority of the 65 private buildings (namely 30) are combined residential/business

Most of the affected buildings are classified as kachhi and jhupro. Only seven of the buildings

9.4.2     Loss of Land and Other Natural Resources
According to the engineering estimates, a total of 2.08 ha is required for road widening on the
Sandhikharka road. Approximately 1.4 ha of this is privately-owned land, located in six of the                  I
seven road VDCs. All of the affected land is classified as rainfed, although it should be noted
that most of the land take will occur in market areas where land prices are considerably higher.
Private land losses are concentrated in three VDCs: Thada (an estimated 0.9 ha), Sitapur (0.18
ha) and Sandhikharka (0.17 ha).

The Entitlement Framework established for the RMD Project makes provision for the payment
of cultivation disruption allowances to households whose production levels are severely
ii            affected by land acquisition. With respect to land losses, a severely affected project family
(SPAF) is defined as: a household from whom land acquisition exceeds 25% of its total
landholdings in the case of landholdings larger than 0.25 ha, or 10% of its total landholdings,
in the case of landholdings of 0.25 ha or smaller, or where land losses lead to the remaining
landholding not being economically viable (as identified through the participatory application
of context-specific criteria; see Section 10.2).
Table 9.8 shows that 61 (ust over 36%) of the affected landowners have holdings of 0.25 ha or
*            smaller. Of these, 24 will lose more than 10% of their total landholdings, thus qualifying for
the allowance described above. None of the landowners with holdings larger than 0.25 ha are
expected to be severely affected by land losses.

9.4.3    Population Displacement
Table 9.9 shows that a total of 192 owners will be affected by upgrading works on the
Sandhikharka road: 46 will lose buildings only, 127 will lose land only, and 19 will lose both             _
land and buildings.
VDCs where a significant number of property owners will be affected are: Thada (95 affected
owners), Sitapur (37 affected owners), Sandhikharka (26 affected owners), and Khanchikot (18
affected owners).  Appropriate resettlement and rehabilitation support measures will be
necessary in these VDCs. Adguri and Narapani VDCs are only marginally affected, while
Mahendrakot VDC will not be affected by upgrading works.

All of the affected households indicated a willingness to make their land available for road
upgrading. While some respondents expressed a willingness to donate the required land, the
majority requested compensation (in replacement land or cash).9 Similarly, cash compensation
was the most conmmon preference for affected buildings.
3             While there was a concern over the loss of cultivation land, few respondents believed that land
acquisition would significantly affect their agricultural production levels.'0 Some stated that
I             road upgrading would increase agricultural and livestock farming activities in the area, by
improving access to markets and agricultural support services.
Respondents were also hopefuil that land prices along the road would increase following road
upgrading.
:
9 The group discussions conducted during the initial fieldwork also highlighted people's dissatisfaction with land
donated for the initial road construction still being registered in their names (i.e. owners still liable for taxes on
land acquired by the roads). A total of 289 persons donated land for the initial construction of the road.
10 Of the 192 affected landowners, the majority (38.5%) indicated that their agricultural production provides
between 4-6 months of food sufficiency, while a considerable percentage (nearly 19%) indicated food sufficiency
of 3 months or less.

10 IMPACT MITIGATION
10.1 MITIGATION OF BIO-PHYSICAL IMPACTS
The main bio-physical environmental mitigation measures that are proposed to be adopted to
avoid or minimise adverse environmental impacts are described below. Implementation of
these mitigation measures will be the responsibility of the Contractor and/or DOR, as specified
in the Environmental Management Action Plan (EMAP).
10.1.1    Vegetation Clearance
Vegetation clearance shall be confined to the minimum area required for upgrading activities
within the ROW in order to limit the loss of production resources, limit damage to surrounding
features and limit ground disturbance and the associated erosion hazard.  This shall be
achieved by clearly marking out the extent of the proposed clearing and ensuring that clearing
is only undertaken within these areas. Trees within the boundaries of ancillary sites shall be
retained wherever possible.
10.1.2   Fill Disposal
The proposed upgrading works will generate an estimated total of 142,300 rn3 of excess fill.
This large volume of material will be disposed of at low impact sites in order to minimise
damage to environmental and social features. Excess fill will be transported to suitable fill
disposal locations, including:
*  floodplain borrow pits:
*  building sites;
* erosion gullies to be rehabilitated; and
*  major riverbeds.
Major riverbeds can be used to dispose of excess fill, particularly borrow pit voids, as long the
fill is not placed directly into dry season river flows (November to May). Fill shall be placed
in the monsoon flood zone so that it is removed during periods of high sediment flow without
diverting flows into river banks or other features.

4ISMEC
10.1.3    Quarries and Borrow Pits
To reduce land destabilisation, borrow pits in the floodways of streams and rivers will be used
in preference to hillslope quarries.
]            All borrow pits and quarries shall be located in accordance with the following criteria:
*  Restricted to small areas;
* Preferably located at existing quarry sites;
*  Preferably located on sites without any tree cover;
* Located at least 60 m from any dwelling;
* Located at least 200 m from any identified archaeological, religious or cultural site.
Impacts on riverine geomorphology and ecology will be minimised by limiting the volume of
extraction at any one borrow pit so that excessive volumes of boulders, gravel and sand are not
I F        removed. Extraction will not go below the existing bed level of the river (beneath its low-level
flow path). The extent of extraction will be set back from the toe of river/stream banks by a
minimum of 5 m, and no disturbance of banks will occur except for access purposes.
Sediment shall be controlled at each site by ensuring that the base of the quarry or borrow pit
drains into a sediment trap prior to discharging from the site.
10.1.4    Workforce Camps
Workforce camp sites shall be located in accordance with the following criteria:
*  Above flood level and at least 10 m from any drainage line;
* Away from potential landslide areas;
*  Preferably on degraded land of low production value;
*  On cleared land requiring no or minor vegetation clearance;
*  Not immediately upslope of local drinking water off-takes;
J           *  Only one camp site per contract or 3 kn length of alignment.
3            Proper drinking water, sewerage and waste disposal facilities shall be supplied and maintained.
In water deficient areas, drinking water shall be provided from outside the area. Solid waste
generated at the camp shall be recycled or disposed of as directed. Appropriate facilities shall
3            be provided for women, where they are employed on the contract.

10.1.5    Revegetation
All banks less than 4 m vertical in height should be hand seeded as soon as the Supervising
Consultant has approved the upgrading excavation or fill work with the standard cover crop
seed mixes recommended in the EMAP.
Disturbed areas shall be revegetated following upgrading activities, with bio-engineering
measures used extensively to stabilise cut and fill banks. Vegetation stabilises banks and other  U
disturbed ground surfaces by providing ground cover to protect against raindrop impact and
reduce overland runoff velocities, and binding soil through plant root development.
Batters and disturbed areas shall be progressively stabilised in order to rapidly reduce the
erosion hazard of the site. Revegetation shall be undertaken in two stages following
upgrading:
1.    Cover crop sowing;
2.    Long-term vegetation establishment.
Revegetation has been split into these two phases in order to ensure that the cover crop is sown  U
as soon as possible following construction and that a specialist Bio-engineering Consultant is
responsible for the establishment and maintenance of long-term bio-engineering measures.
The establishment of initial ground cover with a cover crop is the first priority of revegetation.
The cover crop provides some rapid erosion protection and creates a micro-climate favourable
for the establishment of other vegetation. The establishment of long-tenn vegetative cover
requires the use of a range of specialist bio-engineering techniques and adequate follow-up
maintenance, including replanting.
10.1.6    Material Crushing and Storage
Stone crushers shall be located away from settlement areas, drinking water supply intakes and
cultivated land.  Appropriate dust control devices shall be fitted in accordance with
manufacturer's specifications. The operation of the plant shall be prohibited during the night
hours. Storage of construction materials should be in an appropriate place which neither
disturbs natural drainage or cause erosion and sedimentation.

10.2 MITIGATION OF DIRECT SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
10.2.1    Objectives
The RMD Project is being prepared under HMGN policies and World Bank guidelines. Bank
*           policy emphasises the need to avoid or minimise involuntary resettlement on development
projects. Where the acquisition of private property is unavoidable, involuntary resettlement
should be an integral part of project design and preparation (Operational Directive
4.30/Operational Policy 4.12).
HMGN policy, too, acknowledges the importance of avoiding adverse socio-economic impacts
in road design and construction: "in fixing the road alignment, an attempt should be made to
avoid areas of small land parcels, homes, shops and other structures, and to minimise the
number of people who will have to be resettled ... judgement must be used when agricultural
land is utilised for road construction ... the acquisition of strips of prime agricultural land from
a small farm could make farming unprofitable" (HMGN, 1 997d).
The preparation of the RMD Project has been guided by these Govemment and Bank
objectives. A key objective directing the development of the project's Resettlement Action
3           Plan (RAP) is to ensure that the pre-project living standards of affected persons are restored
(and where possible irnproved) at no cost to themselves. This will be achieved through the
measures specified in the project's Entitlement Framework, The successful implementation of
these measures requires an enabling, supportive environment. This will be achieved through
the following objectives:
(a) Ongoing community consultation will occur to ensure that people's views, concerns and
suggestions, particularly those of vulnerable groups, are satisfactorily incorporated into
implementation procedures.
(b) An institutional framework will be developed as an integral part of the project to ensure
that appropriate social impact management mechanisms are set up and maintained during
implementation. These mechanisms and arrangements will ensure that compensation,
3               resettlement and rehabilitation are carried out timely and effectively.
(c) Upgrading work will commence on road sections only after acquisition procedures, as
detailed in the Entitlement Framework, have been successfully initiated.

10.2.2    Entitlement Framework
Through the Entitlement Framework (detailed in the RAP), the project is committed to ensure
that the livelihoods of project-affected persons are at least restored to pre-project levels, with
the opportunity to improve on living standards where possible (see Appendix 9).  The
Framework addresses the following adverse impacts associated with road construction and
upgrading:
* loss of land and other privately-owned assets;
*  adverse impacts on subsistence/livelihood or income-earning capacity; and
*  collective adverse impacts on groups (e.g. through the loss of communal resources and
assets).
To mitigate unforeseen effects on roadside communities and promote general upliftment,
rehabilitation and support measures will be extended to include vulnerable social categories
who may be adversely affected by road upgrading.
The Entitlement Framework will cover all road sections approved for Bank funding under the
project and will come into force on contracts awarded from the date of funding approval.
Procedures have been established for the transfer of titles of land acquired for the initial
construction of the upgrading road sections. In addition, owners who are affected by current
construction activity within the defined road section start and end points, will be considered as
project-affected persons and eligible to entitlements and support as detailed in the Entitlement
Framework.
Entitlements have been developed according to domestic legislation and supplemented, where
necessary, with additional measures to comply with World Bank specifications. Entitlements
are organised around categories of loss (e.g. cultivation land, residential structure, commercial
establishment) to ensure that persons who suffer more than one type of loss, receive
compensation or rehabilitation support for each type of loss.
Those project affected families (PAFs) who are severely affected by land acquisition will
qualify for additional rehabilitation and support measures. A severely affected project family
(SPAF) is defined as:
*  a household who has to be resettled because of the acquisition of its house, business
enterprise, or rented accommodation; or
*  a household from whom land acquisition exceeds 25% of its total landholdings, in the case  i
of landholdings larger than 0.25 ha, or 10% of its total landholdings, in the case of
landholdings of 0.25 ha or smaller, or where land losses lead to the remaining landholding

not being economically viable (as identified through the participatory application of
context-specific criteria).
10.2.3    Entitlements for Land Losses
31          Throughout Nepal, cultivation land is at a premium and replacement land is, accordingly, not
readily available. Areas not under cultivation are generally not suitable for crop production
(due to slope, poor soil quality, etc.), while agricultural resettlement on government-owned
forest land is prohibited. Entitlements for land losses will, therefore, mainly be in the form of
cash compensation. Every effort will, nevertheless, be made to provide additional land-based
options to households whose production levels are severely affected by land acquisition. This
will primarily be achieved through Local Consultative Forums (LCFs), established at VDC-
level to assist with the identification of suitable privately-owned cultivation land in the vicinity
for purchasing by affected households.
Temporary occupation of privately-owned land will be undertaken within the framework of the
Public Road Act. A temporary occupation contract will be signed with affected landowners,
specifying:
*  the period of occupancy;
-  the formula for the calculation of production losses (the market value of crops normally
3               produced on the land) and annual inflation adjustments;
*  the frequency of compensation payment; and
*  land protection and rehabilitation measures.
10.2.4   Entitlements for Building Losses
For buildings, as well, compensation will be in cash. For fully acquired houses, two
approaches will be followed. Displaced households with alternative accommodation will
receive a cash lump sum payment. Displaced households who do not have alternative
accommodation will receive their compensation in two installments: an initial payment and a
final payment after the construction of replacement housing has commenced.
Formal resettlement planning will be undertaken where more than 10 households from the
same settlement/residential area have to be relocated.
10.2.5   Crops and Other Natural Resources
Construction works will, as far as possible, be planned to allow for the harvesting of crops
before land is acquired. Where crops can not be harvested or the destruction of crops is
unavoidable, cash compensation will be paid, based on crop market values as determined by
the Compensation Determination Committees (CDCs). All other resources from privately-
owned trees (e.g. timber/fuelwood) will remain the property of the concerned owner.

g*SMEC
Compensation will also be paid for the loss of future production from individually-owned fruit,
fodder and timber/fuelwood trees, and perennial crops. Compensation rates will be calculated
by the CDCs, based on five years annual net production for fruit and fodder trees, and three
years annual net production for timber/fuelwood trees and other perennial crops.           -
10.2.6    Community Assets and Resources
Affected community buildings and facilities will be repaired to their previous condition or
replaced in areas identified in consultation with affected communities and the relevant
authorities. These include schools, temples, health posts, water points, irrigation canals, water
mills and footbridges.
It is not envisaged that the project will have a significant impact on communal land (e.g.
grazing land). However, where such land is acquired by the project, the Departments of
Agriculture and Forestry will assist affected communities in the improvement of remaining
grazing areas and fodder resources to ensure that pre-project levels are maintained or improved
upon.
Where community-owned trees are acquired, the Department of Forestry will consult with user
groups regarding future production losses and compensation modalities. These consultations  I
will be formally recorded to ensure equitable access to rehabilitation measures. User groups
will also be assisted with the reestablishment of new trees/perennial crops and the
establishment or improvement of community forestry programmes.
Loss of trees in the COI will furthermore be mitigated by afforestation (as specified in the
Public Road Act), to be undertaken by DOR in consultation with local communities and the
Department of Forestry.
10.2.7    Rehabilitation Measures
In addition to compensation for asset losses, SPAFs will be entitled to the following
allowances:
*  a Housing Displacement Allowance for households who are required to relocate;
*  a Business Displacement Allowance for owners of commercial enterprises who are
required to relocate;                                                                   I
*  a Cultivation Disruption Allowance for households whose landholdings are no longer
economically viable as a result of land losses (as defined above);
*  displaced households of rented accommodation will receive a Rental Stipend.

-SMEC
Apart from theses allowances, the rehabilitation of SPAFs will additionally be supported
through the following measures:
* counselling regarding project impacts, compensation alternatives and risks, and
resettlement options (where required);
I            *  assessment of current economic activities and potential for improvement to these activities,
as well as alternative income-eaming opportunities;
*            *  assistance with training in life skills (e.g. household health and sanitation practices,
household economics and resource management, and household micro-enterprises); and
*  assistance to gain access to national poverty alleviation and credit programmes.
These rehabilitation measures will be extended to vulnerable groups in the vicinity of the road
corridor who may be adversely affected by the project, even though they do not lose assets
within the COI.  These social categories will be identified in consultation with local
communities and may include:
-  porters and other non-vehicular transport providers;
-  tribal groups; and
*  landless households.
Finally, through the establishment of Local Consultative Forums (LCFs), PAPs and local
conimunities will be able to discuss the position of severely affected and vulnerable people
within their communities, monitor their rate of reestablishment, and recommend additional
corrective measures where necessary.
10.2.8    Land Acquisition
PAFs will be given written notice of the intent to acquire their properties in accordance with
the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. They will fairthermore be given written notice to
I           vacate their properties not less than 35 days prior to the intended acquisition date.
HMGN will not take possession of any private property prior to the full payment of
_rJ 1        compensation entitlements and, where applicable, initiation of relocation arrangements and
economic rehabilitation measures. The project will make every effort to ensure that displaced
3            households have access to replacement housing prior to their evacuation from the COI, through
appropriate advance compensation and shifting allowance payments at the time of serving the
notice to vacate, or other forms of relocation assistance agreed with the concerned households.
All government taxes and duties related to the acquisition and registration of affected assets
will be the responsibility of the project.

12.1 IEE SCOPING
Public consultation during IEE scoping involved publication of a Public Notice, discussions
with local people along the proposed aligrnents, discussions with Government officials at
destination District Headquarters and a Scoping Workshop in Kathmandu.
A Public Notice was published in the national Nepali newspaper Gorkhapatra on 8/6/2055
(24/9/98), as per the Environmental Protection Regulations 2054, Rule 4(1) and 4(2). The
Notice sought "opinions and suggestions from all concerned parties to identify potential
primary environmental impacts relating to the proposed roadworks as part of the Scoping
exercise to be undertaken for EIA and IEE studies". The Public Notice was then mailed to the
Chief District Officer of each district crossed by the roads, to ensure that it was brought to their
attention. No responses were received to the Public Notice call for comrnment.
Interviews were then conducted with key Government departments at all destination district
headquarters to introduce the project and scope the main IEE issues.  Government
representatives interviewed included Chief District Officers (CDOs), Local Development
Officers (LDOs) and chairmen of District Development Committees (DDCs) (see Appendix 6).
A Scoping Workshop was held in Kathrnandu on 30/10/98 to provide Kathmandu-based
Government and non-government organisations with an additional opportunity to identify
potential primary environmental issues. The meeting was attended by nine Govemment and
three NGO representatives (see Appendix 2).  The issues raised in the meeting were
incorporated into the Scoping Report.
12.2 DATA COLLECTION
Driveover inspections of the proposed road alignments included discussions with local people
to collect sufficient local data to estimate the likely major environmental impacts.
A rapid assessment of potential impacts on private and community assets (e.g. houses,
cultivation land, schools and temples) was undertaken during the driveover surveys. All
potentially affected assets were recorded on Summary Asset Registers during the subsequent
socio-economic survey. This included recording of asset types, ownership details (where
available) and estimates of asset sizes.

S:SMEC
The socio-economic survey also included questionnaire interviews with a sample of 213
households and 120 businesses to:
*  Establish average household size and composition, landholding sizes, local reactions to
potential population displacement and resettlement preferences;
* Gain an understanding of local agricultural and economic activities, obtain individual
reactions to assets losses, and discuss possible compensation/mitigation options;
* Establish the willingness and availability of local residents to work on the road
construction. The employment of local labour was also discussed with community
representatives during the walkover surveys and settlement group discussions, as well as
with district officials.
The subsequent census and asset verification exercise (completed for the Sandhikharka road
and the Kalikot road up to 85 Iam) also afforded potentially affected persons the opportunity to
indicate their compensation preferences for the loss of assets.
The socio-economic survey interviews were supplemented with group discussions at selected
settlements. These discussions covered topics such as: perceived benefits and disbenefits of
the roads; impacts on local agriculture and livestock farming; impacts on natural resource use;
impacts on local businesses and economic activities; and compensation options and          I
preferences.
12.3 FORMULATION OF MITIGATION AND IMPROVEMENT
MEASURES
In addition to the above consultation, structured interviews were conducted with 22
Contractors (seven category A, three category B, 11 category C and one category D) to obtain
their views on the employment of local labour in the road construction sector. Discussions
concentrated on recruitment and employment preferences and practices, availability of local
labour, benefits and constraints associated with the employment of local labour and general
labour management practices.
The assessment of the potential for general district-level social development involved      |
structured interviews with district officials (e.g. Chief District Officers, Local Development
Officers, health officials) to discuss the key social issues and explore development
opportunities associated with road upgrading (e.g. stimulation of the local economy and
improved access to markets and social services).
The household interviews and group discussions provided people the opportunity to
identify/discuss potential local development benefits associated with the road construction and
operation.

13 CONCLUSIONS
Bio-physical and socio-economic impacts will result from the upgrading of the Kalikot,
Chhedegad and Sandhikharka roads, but these impacts will generally be minor in extent and
significance.  Many of the effects of the proposed upgrading works will be beneficial,
I           particularly relating to road stabilisation and associated issues. Limited additional land is
required to install the proposed works.
13.1 BIO-PHYSICAL IMPACTS
The three roads proposed for upgrading are currently causing environrnental damage at
locations along their lengths, primarily due to unstable cut and fill banks.
The proposed upgrading works will provide a significant environmental benefit within and
adjacent to the ROWs by stabilising numerous unstable batters along each road. Many existing
road banks, primarily cut batters, are highly unstable and prone to slides and erosion,
particularly during the monsoon. The installation of a large number of retaining walls and
drains, and a large area of bio-engineering measures, along each road will stabilise most road
batters.
The total land use change that will occur as a result of road widening will be 18.49 ha over the
combined road length of 253 km. This land use change includes 6.91 ha of cultivation. This
net impact is classed as minor as it equates to an average 0.73 m wide strip of land along the
full length of the roads.
Ecological degradation that may occur during road upgrading or be induced by the resulting
additional traffic is anticipated to be minor. Only minor forest and shrubland clearance,
estimated to total 5.75 ha, will occur to enable the installation of upgrading works. This loss of
vegetation will be directly offset by vegetation establishment on 22.26 ha of bare or semi-bare
areas through bio-engineering. Work contracts will be limited to 2-3 years duration, and the
workforce will not be at any site for an extended period, therefore illegal forest harvesting
should be minor. In addition, the annual increase in traffic (around 5%) is relatively small,
therefore any additional long-tern, road-induced ecological degradation is likely to be limited.
No protected areas or identified sites of ecological significance occur within the vicinity of the
roads.
The disposal of 142,300 m3 of excess fill can potentially create a significant environmental
impact unless it is correctly managed. Excess fill must be transported to suitable fill disposal
locations to ensure that private and public land and vegetation are not damaged by uncontrolled
tipping. This can be economically achieved achieved by using trucks or tractors. Maximum
use should be made of floodplain borrow pit voids created during the winning of road
upgrading material.

Apart from the Kamali and Bheri Rivers, the only identified significant feature near the roads
is Supa Deurali temple on the Sandhikharka road. Controlled road widening excavation at this
site should not harm the temple, and should provide a community benefit by creating an
additional area for meeting.
Very minor adverse noise, vibration and air quality impacts will occur either during upgrading
or from the additional traffic resulting from road upgrading.
13.2 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
The proposed upgrading works will have a number of social development benefits that will
result from  improved access, including economic stimulation and road construction
employment.
The social benefits associated with road upgrading may be considered to be less significant
than those resulting from new road construction. However, the responses of roadside
communities show that people do experience access problems, particularly during the
monsoon, because of current road conditions. Improved access, to markets and health facilities
specifically, will therefore be a significant benefit of road upgrading.
Since the roads cross some of the most underdeveloped districts of the country, their upgrading
may also contribute to (a) improvements in food supply and a reduction in the cost of
consumer items; (b) improved access to health facilities and counseling, leading to possible
improvements in the overall health. status of people; and (c) possible improvements in the
position of vulnerable social categories and groups, through the creation and stimulation of
income-generating opportunities and a reduction in social and economic disparities.
Asset acquisition and population displacement will be significantly reduced by limiting land
take to actual areas required for upgrading works, as opposed to a 15 m COI. In summary, the
following estimated reduction will be achieved:
* a reduction in the acquisition of private land, from 55.37 ha (if a 15 m ROW had been
established) to approximately 6.89 ha;
* a reduction in the acquisition of residential and business structures, from 435 (if a 15 m
ROW had been established) to and estimated 112 actually affected by upgrading works.

The number of households affected by upgrading works on the three road sections is estimated
at 569 (4,030 persons). The estimated number of households facing displacement is 51 (less
than 9% of total households), consisting of some 385 persons. The additional 518 households
(3,645 persons) will be affected through the acquisition of land, commercial establishments
and other buildings.

In the context of road development, the number of affected households is relatively small,
particularly since the Chhedegad road figure is expected to be reduced following additional
engineering and census surveys. The estimated number of displaced households is also low,
amounting to just under 9% of the affected households. Nevertheless, involuntary resettlement
is often traumatic, and for those individuals and households being displaced, the disturbances
could be highly significant.
