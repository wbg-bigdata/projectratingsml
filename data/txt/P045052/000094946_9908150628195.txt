1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
This Environrmental Management Action Plan (EMAP) has been prepared for the
Department of Roads (DOR) to set out the environmental management requirements for
U            final detailed road design and pre-construction, construction and post-construction activities
associated with the construction of five new roads under the Road Maintenance and
*            Development Project (RMD Project).
This EMAP has been developed based on the inspection of recently constructed hill roads,
the review of a number of road design and construcdon references for Nepal and the
findings of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
Examples of both good and poor road designs and construction methods can be found in
Nepal. Poor roads with significant environmnental impacts appear to commonly result from
the sub-standard construction of approved road designs or the initial construction of
insufficient retaining walls and drains. Recognising this, this EMAP provides details on
design principles, construction prograrnming and methods and site supervision.
1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Five proposed roads which form part of the strategic road network in the Mid-western and
Far-western Development Regions of Nepal will be constructed under the RMD Project
(Table 1). The proposed roads lead from existing earth roads to five district headquarters.

* Source: Classification and Design Standards. DOR, 1994.
The five roads will be constructed to "Construction Development Stage II(ii) (FWET) - Fair
Weather Earth Track" standards for hilly terrain (DOR, 1997a). This initial construction
U            Road Maintenance and Development Project



stage is aimed at providing a "basic level of dry season vehicular access". With ford
crossings of all rivers.
Preliminary road designs, economic assessments, an EIA and Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) have been prepared for these roads.
1.3 AIMS OF THE EMAP
Thiis EMAP has four primary aims, namely to:
1.    Define the environmental management principles and guidelines for the pre-
construction, construction and post-constuction phases of road development;
2.    Describe the practical -mitigation measures that shall be implemented on all road
construction and ancillary sites to prevent or mitigate environmental impacts;
3.    Establish the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in the implementation
of environmental controls;
4.    Establish a supervision, monitoring, auditing and reporting framework.
The EMAP clearly sets out environmental goals and management measures, and is to be
used by DOR, the World Bank, the Final Design Consultant, the Supervising Consultant
and Contractors.
Environmental impact mitigation measures have been incorporated into the RMD Project to
date during preliminary road design, including alignment refinement and structure design
(see Section 3.1). This EMAP takes effect during three stages of the project: detailed road
design, road construction and road maintenance (Figure 1).
The environmental requirements contained in this EMAP only relate to the detailed design,
construction and post-construction maintenance of the roads infrastructure. The mitigation
of long-term operational impacts of roads and road-induced activities on the environment
are not addressed in this plan, but covered in the EIA.

1.4 STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES
A number of statutory requirements and guidelines shall be complied with for the
environmental management of road construction and rehabilitation works in addition to the
conditions in this EMAP. These include:
* Land Acquisition Act, 2034 (1977) - the permanent acquisition of private land and
buildings have to be acquired in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
* Putblic Roads Act, 2031 (1974) - temporary land acquisition must be in accordance with
Section 14 of the Act. Section 16 of the Act, DOR are obliged to plant trees on either
side of public roads according to need. Concerned villages and town Panchayats are
then required to look after and protect the trees. Under Section 17, DOR are permitted
to obtain earth, stone or sand from any land adjoining the right-of-way.
The principal DOR guidelines, which have to be complied with, are:
- Environmental Management Guidelines (DOR, 1 997b).
* Bio-Engineering  information  -  Rate Analysis Norms  (Interim), Standard
Specifications (lnterim), Lists of Species and Supporting Information (DOR, 1996).

2. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EMAP
2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ROLES AND
RESPONSIBILITIES
Responsibility for environmental management associated with road construction work-s
involves a number of parties, each with specific responsibilities for particular activities.
The six main parties responsible for the design and implementation of mitigation measures
prior to, during and following road construction are:
* DOR;
* World Bank;
* Final Design Consultant;
* Supervising Consultant;
* Construction Contractor;
* Bio-engineering Contractor.
DOR, as the project proponents, have the ultimate responsible for the supervision of all
project construction and environmental management works. Implementation of the RMD
Project will be the responsibility of the DOR Project Manager.
The Final Design Consultant will prepare final detailed designs based on the preliminary
road designs and EMAP design recommendations.
The Supervising Consultant will supervise the day-to-day activities of the construction
Contractor on behalf of DOR. The Supervising Consultant will be responsible for the
technical supervision of road layout, overseeing contract implementation and certifying
works for payment.  The duties of the Supervising Consultant will include overall
management responsibility to ensure the effective implementation of EMAP by the
Contractor, with reporting direct to the Project Manager. The Supervising Consultant shall
undertake regular inspections and compliance audits of all aspects of work as specified in

2.2 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Local participation in environmental management during road construction will initially
occur through consultation between the Supervising Consultant, Contractor and affected
landowners and local communities prior to construction. Discussions will be held regarding
the cutting, temporary reconnection and reinstatement of services, the location of minor
drains, the use of loose rock from adjacent private land and the general construction
programme.
A principle of the RMD Project is the employment of local people. Local people will be
employed in construction, bio-engineering and maintenance works. This will provide a
direct economic benefit to the area through employment, but more importantly it will
establish local skills to enable the effective and timely maintenance of the roads following
construction.
A cormmon feature of many recently constructed roads inspected was a lack of maintenance,
primarily of drainage works, during the monsoon. The establishment of local maintenance
crews is proposed to enable the rapid repair of works following monsoon storms. Likewise.
the maintenance of bio-engineering works by local crews is also proposed as maintenance is
more likely to be performned in a timely manner by a local team with an interest in
protecting their land than by an outside team that only periodically visits the site.



2.3 INTER-DEPARTMENTAL INVOLVEMENT
Most of the environmental improvement works proposed in Section 7 will require the
involvement of the Government department responsible for that particular activity.
DOR will liase w-ith and formulate the proposed improvement programmes with the
|             Department of Forests, Department of Soil Conservation, Ministry of Housing and Physical
Planning and relevant VDCs. DOR support for these programmes will be limited to
providing the necessary funding and monitoring expenditure and progress against the agreed
goals or works.

3. ROAD DESIGN
Road design, including alignment selection and structure design. offers the initial and main
opportunity to avoid or mitigate environmental impacts. If mitigation measures are not
incorporated into road designs many resulting impacts cannot be mitigated by implementing
measures following road construction.
3.1 PRELIMINARY DESIGN
The avoidance or mitigation of environmental impacts commenced in the preliminary
design phase, when major mitigation design features were incorporated in the road desian.
The preliminarY design involved alignment refinement and the design of major structures.
It was undertaken using the two overriding requirements of:
1.   "Fair weather earth track" design standards;
2.    Low cost roads.
As required by DOR, these two design requirements were paramount, setting the basis for
road design. Within these requirements, where possible, environmental mitigation measures
have been incorporated, as described below.
The preliminary design process involved reaching a compromise between short-term cost
savings on road construction and long-term  environmental damage and high road
maintenance and repair costs.
3.1.1 Alignment Refinement
Road aligmnents were planned based on the DOR recommended alignments derived from
initial design studies and RMD Project aligrnment refinement undertaken during the
walkover surveys and detailed engineering surveys.
Road alignment refinement commenced with a joint walkover survey by a Road Design
Engineer, Geologist, Surveyor, Environmental Specialist and Sociologist (as well as a DOR
representative where available). The team set an agreed alignment based on the followAing
bio-physical and social selection criteria:
1.    Geology     -  avoidance of landslide hazard areas to achieve long-term road
stability.
2.    Topography - not floodprone;
-  lower slope land to minimise cut and fill and construction costs;
-  avoidance or minimal disturbance of stable embankments.
i



I..
3.    Land use    -  shortest possible alignment length to minimise land take;
- avoidance of religious sites, large settlements and high-value
production land, in the following order of sensitivity:
*  archaeological, cultural and religious sites - at least 60 m setback wherever
possible;
*  villages - at least 15 m setback from the centreline of the road (potential ROW
vwidth);
*  individual houses - at least 15 m setback from the centreline where possible
-(potential ROW width);
*  irrigated cultivation;
*  high conservation value forest (including Community Forests);
*  rainfed cultivation;
*  degraded forest;
*  grassland;
*  degraded bare land;
*  existing tracks/trails.
Primary consideration was given to the selection of the most stable alignment. Active
landslides and areas with a high landslide hazard were avoided. Non-floodprone land was
selected where possible. Lower slope land was also comrnmonly selected in order to
minimise construction costs, reduce excavation and the need for retaining walls. The next
I            main factors considered were road length minimisation in order to limit construction costs
and the total land take, and the utilisation of the lowest value land in terms of structural
features, production or ecological values.
Where possible, alignments were located on or near existing main trails. Road construction
along these alignments will achieve maximum road utilisation by all forms of transport
given the existing use of these routes.
The refined alienments incorporated variable road grades to minimise the road length and
avoid significant features. Road grades were increased to reduce the number of switchbacks
J            and low grades (less than 2%) were used where possible to cross cultivation terraces to limit
the area of disturbance.
U           The walkover survey generally set the alignment to within 20 m horizontal and 10 m
vertical of the final preliminary alignment location.
Following the walkover survey, a detailed survey was undertaken of each alignment. Using
the DOR design specifications for fair weather earth tracks and the above selection criteria.
]1          the walkover aligrinent was refined. The detailed survey alignment generally followed the
walkover alignment, but occasionally differed substantially due to the need to fit standard
road specifications or avoid features that had not been previously noticed.

£
Utilising the detailed survey data, the preliminarv design alignrnent was set within the
surveyed corridor using CivilCad. The CivilCad Road Designer set the alignment by
following the shape of the terrain, both horizontally and vertically, wherever possible
(within DOR design specifications) in order to minimise earthworks and the number and
size of retaining structures. Minimum horizontal curves of 12.5 m radius were used. as well
as ascent/descent gradients of generally up to 5-7% (although grades as steep as 12% were
used for short distances).
EarthworLk quantities were calculated using a standard road width of 4.5 m plus an average
of 0.6 widening (5.1 m total), although this was increased to 6.1 m to accommodate a
trapezoidal side drain where required. An additional 10% earthworks (cut) allowance was
made to accommodate 3 m wide passing bays.
Cut and fill equalisation was adopted as a major road design principle in the preliminary
design where it was economically possible within DOR road specifications. Where this was
not possible, the aim was to minimise excess fill. Equalisation of cut and fill reduces
excavation and reduces the total land take by the road formation.
Figure 3: Impact Areas of Different Road Construction Techniques
Wid.h of impact
Width of impact
Full Cut and Sidecasting                        Cut and Fill Balancing
The incorporation of cut and fill equalisation was primarily achieved by locating the
alignment centreline horizontally near to the natural slope surface on slopes of less than 60'.
This helped to ensure that the volume of fill required to construct the downslope earth  j
embankment or backfill the retaining wall was close to equalling the volume to be cut. As
the centreline is moved horizontally further into the slope, the available fill volume
decreases whilst the cut volurne increases.



3.1.2  Structure Design
Major road structures were designed in the preliminary design, including earth
*-             embankments. retaining walls and major cross-road drains, as described below. Quantity
estimates for each road were then prepared based on these designs.
Embankments and Retaining Walls
In the preliminary design, all cut and fill batters were designed using the principles
described below. The final design batters at anv particular location will only be known
once the final design investigations have been completed.
Embankrments and retaining walls were designed to achieve long-term road stability and to
attempt to equalise cut and fill or to minimise excess fill. At the same time, a "low cost"
road was designed, incorporating earthworks on lower slopes as they are generally cheaper
than rock or masonry retaining walls, and can be effectively constructed on these grades.
Accordingly, preliminary road designs were based on the minimisation of excavation, the
use of compacted earth fill embankments wherever possible and the extensive use of rock
retaining walls on slopes that are too steep for earth embankments. The general design
specifications adopted for cuttings, fill embankments and retaining walls were primarily
based on slope angle and surface materials, as summarised in Table 2.

Note: For estimating purposes during preliminary design, cut batters through all rock slopes
were designed with a 10:1 (V:H) slope.
The preliminary design specifications for embankments and retaining walls attempted to
balance "low cost" design standards with the minimisation of environmental impacts. They
are primarily based on the following principles:
*  Utilisation of compacted earth fill embankments wherever possible (i.e. generally on
slopes of less than 250), where sound construction is achievable and the land take
Tequired is minimal.
9



* Increasing cut batter grades through rocky areas in order to reduce excavation. slope
disturbance and construction costs.
*  Use of hill side retaining walls and breast walls to reduce earthworks where high cut
batters are required through soil.
*  Minimum excavation of slopes above 600. These steep slopes will either be stable (i.e.
stable rock) or prone to slides (e.g. overlying colluvial material). If a site is prone to
slides, material can be removed from the road once it has fallen, thus saving significant
excavation costs.
* Use of gabion or dry stone retaining walls on the hill side where the road passes through
irrigated cultivation land prone to seepage and land slips.
* Minimising the amount of excess fill mater"ial.
Quantity estimates for costing purposes were based on the following design features.
Compacted earth fill embankments were preferred on all slopes below 250. These
embankments can be effectively built on slopes of up to 250 by benching the slope then
layering and compacting fill, using a standard 1:1.5 (V:H) batter grade.
Retaining walls were preferred on the valley side of the road on slopes between 25-600 in
order to attempt to equalise cut and fill and create a stable road formation. Dry stone
retaining walls were considered where the vertical height was less than 3 m. Gabion walls
were considered for heights above 3 m.
Drainage
Major cross-road drains were designed at all locations where defined flowlines on 1:50,000
topographic maps cross the proposed alignments. Cross-road drains were designed for
specific sub-catchment sizes and the specific cross-sectional shape of drainage lines, with
the provision of 1 in 10 year discharge capacity. Side drains were designed with a 1 in 5
year discharge capacity. These design return periods were selected as a compromise
between flow capacity and cost given that intense monsoon storms occur every year.
Fords have been preferred to pipe culverts for major cross-road drains due to their reduced
likelihood of blockage, lower maintenance requirements and large capacity. The main type
of ford structure designed was a causeway weir. Where fords were not been practical due to
steep gully crossings, pipe culverts were designed.
Existing drainage lines were used as drain locations wherever possible in order to collect
concentrated flows where they meet the road and dispose of them immediately at stable
disposal locations, preventing darnage to other downslope features.



Lined side drains were designed at the base of cut slopes where the cut was not through
sound rock and road grades exceed 5%.
3.2 FINAL DETAILED DESIGN
The final detailed design of the proposed roads, based on the preliminary road designs, will
be prepared by the Detailed Design Consultant. The Detailed Design Consultant shall
follow all the design principles adopted in the preliminary design, as well as the additional
principles outlined below.
3.2.1 Cut and Fill Equalisation
The detailed design shall attempt to equalise cut and fill by fixing the alignment centreline
to try to achieve half cut and half fill on all slopes below 60°, as in the preliminary design.
Excavated fill will be primarily used in compacted earth embankments and to backfill
retaining walls.
At sites where major unstable areas are crossed by the alignment, a reduction in standard
DOR road w%idth specifications shall be considered (e.g. a decrease in width from 4.5 m to
3.5-4.0 m), without side drains or passing bays. Reducing the width of the road will reduce
slope excavation and hence slope destabilisation.
3            3.2.2  Embankments and Retaining Walls
In addition to following the preliminary design principles for embankment and retaining
wall design, breast walls shall considered at all sites where alignments cross irrigated
cultivation and the cut bank is over 1 m high. The breast wall shall consist of a gabion wall
two thirds the height of the cut batter in order to provide a stable, free draining embank-ment
toe whilst minirnising costs. This will enable the unprotected batter grade above the wall to
be reduced to 1:1 (V:H). The breast wall will protect these colluvial slopes which are prone
to saturation, and reduce the loss of high value land.
3.2.3  Drainage
Minor cross-road drains and road cross-fall shall be designed in the detailed road design.
3            These designs shall be based on reducing the concentration and velocity of runoff, and
reducing the potential for drain failure, and hence reducing drain maintenance.
Accordingly, the following drain design criteria and specifications shall be used in the
detailed design.
*  Existing drainage lines shall be used as drain locations wherever possible to collect
concentrated flows where they meet the road and dispose of them immediately at stable
disposal locations, preventing damage to other downslope features.
i.



b.
Figure 4: Location of Road Drains at Natural Drainage Sites
* Allowing for the above design criteria, minor cross-road drains shall be provided
between major drains. These drain spacings also approximately coincide with the length  3
of overland flow where significant rill erosion will commence, which is critical on road
grades of less than 5% that will not have lined side drains. As a general rule, side drains
should not carry water for more than 200 m without disposal.
*  The provision of outfall cross-fall drainage shall be considered at sites where compacted
fill embankments are less than 2 m high, where retaining walls occur or on exposed rock
slopes, providing a traffic hazard will not be created. Outfall cross-fall reduces the
concentration of runoff and the reliance on cross-road drains remaining operational
during intense storms. It also reduces construction costs by reducing the number of
culverts and length of side drains.
*  infall cross-fall drainage shall be provided where outfall cross-fall is not provided.
*  Lined side drains shall be provided at the base of cut slopes where the road grade
exceeds 5% and infall cross-fall drainage is provided, unless the road cutting is through
rock.
*  Minor cross-road drains and side drains shall be approximately sized according to the
sub-catchment area.

3.2.4 Construction Programme
The construction of the project roads shall be staged over four years, thus limiting the extent
of construction in any one year to manageable lengths (between 4-20 kmn). Individual
contracts shall be limited in size to enable each contract to be completed in a single dry
season (over 9 months from  mid-September to mid-June) by labour-based construction.
Individual contracts will be issued for 1-3 km lengths of road.
Full construction over a single dry season will minimise the overall site landslip and erosion
hazard prior to the installation of all designed retaining walls, drains and the majority of
Tevegetation works.
Construction contracts will include a one year defect period effective from the completion
of road construction.

4. ROAD CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
Environmental management measures shall be implemented to mitigate negative impacts
during pre-construction. construction and post-construction phases of road development.
These measures are described below for each phase of development, together with the
responsibilities of each party.  All required actions, timing and responsibilities are also
summarised in Appendix 2 for use as a site checklist.
Good environmental management during construction comrnmences with the correct siting of
proposed works. The strict supervision of works within the pegged sites and in accordance
with approved practices is then required, followed by the final rehabilitation of sites
according to prescribed practices.
Contractors need to recognise that the road is part of the broader environment. The road
runs next to private and public land that heeds to be maintained. Road construction must be
limited to the minimal ROW area required and construction activities must minimise off-
site impacts.
-4.1 PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE
Prior to the commencement of construction, land and building acquisition, permits and
permission to undertake certain construction activities, training and worksite survey,
pegging and approval have to be undertaken or obtained.
4.1.1 Land Acquisition
Private land and buildings have to be acquired within the ROW prior to road construction.
Acquisition shall be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition
Act, 2034 for permanent land acquisition and the Public Roads Act, 2031 for temporary land
acquisition. These provisions have been supplemented with additional guidelines contained
in the RMD Project Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Together, the provisions and
guidelines require the successful initiation of land acquisition procedures before the
commencement of construction work.
Responsibilities
DOR, as the project proponent, shall ensure that the necessary land acquisition procedures
are initiated prior to the commencement of any related works, including:
* Notice to inform concerned landowners of project activities;
* Identification of all affected land parcels and census of affected owners;
* Verification and quantification of land and building losses;
* Finalisation of the list of entitled persons for publication;
*  Publication of the acquisition notice specifying the evacuation period and compensation
arrangements;
RPnn'J Afnintonl7nrp nnd [ Pvplnnn?ent Prniect



*  Where households and business establishments are displaced, payment of displacement
allowances and compensation shall occur not less than 35 days prior to taking
possession of the properties;
*  Payment of compensation for other acquired properties shall occur within the periods
specified in the Resettlement Action Plan.
DOR shall provide copies of the RMD Project land acquisition procedures to the
U            Supervising Consultant and Contractor. The Supervising Consultant and Contractor shall
adhere to these procedures.
DOR shall provide a list of affected property owners to the Supervising Consultant and
Contractor.
4.1.2 Permits
Permits are required from HMG to fell trees, undertake quarrying and undertake certain
other construction activities. Permission from private landholders is also required to
undertake activities on their land.
Responsibilities
DOR, recognised as the proponent of the road development work, shall obtain all necessary
permits prior to the commencement of any related works, including:
*  Permit to Fell Trees - a request letter must be sent to the District Forest Office for a
permit to fell trees in Government or Community Forests.
*  Permit for Quarrying - a request letter must be sent to the District Forest Office or the
District Development Committee to establish and operate a quarry.
DOR shall also obtain written permission from each Community Forest User Group for the
clearing of the alignrment through Community Forests.
DOR shall provide a copy of all permits and permissions to the Contractor. The Contractor
shall adhere to the termns and conditions of the permits and comply with all statutes relevant
to environmental management at the site.
The Contractor shall obtain permission in writing from all private landowners on whose
land construction activities are to occur.  Permission shall be obtained prior to the
commencement of these activities and copies shall be provided to the Supervising
Consultant.

4.1.3 Training
Limited training appears to have been given to Contractors' Field Supervisors and
construction workers in the past, which has been reflected in the use of pOOT construction
practices. Most construction skills appear to have been gained in the field.
In order to help improve the quality of road construction and environrmental management
work to the standard required on the RMD Project, construction and environmental
management training and accreditation is required for Consultants' Field Supervisors.
A training workshop shall be provided in the implementation of the main approved road
construction and environmental management measures, including site survey and
delineation, retaining wall and drainage construction, slope excavation, excess fill disposal,
initial revegetation techniques, and environmental monitoring and reporting. The workshop
will also include approved land acquisition procedures, as detailed in the Resettlement
Action Plan.
A second training workshop shall be provided in controlled blasting techniques.
Responsibilities
DOR shall organise and convene a 5-7 day "Road Construction and Environmental
Management Training Workslhop" and a shorter "Controlled Blasting Training Workshop"
at least I month prior to the commencement of the first RMD Project construction contract.
The Contractor shall ensure that his/her Field Supervisor/s attend the "Road Construction
and Environmental Management Training Workshop" and receive accreditation before
commencing work at the site. The Contractor shall also ensure that his/her Blaster/s attend
the "Controlled Blasting Training Workshop" and receive accreditation before comunencing
work at the site.
The Supervising Consultant shall ensure that all of his/her field staff attend both Training
Workshops prior to commencing site duties.
4.1.4 Worksite Survey, Pegging and Approval
The proposed roads (including the full extent of works) and ancillary sites shall be surveyed
and pegged prior to any construction or related activities to ensure that they are correctly
sited in accordance with the detailed road designs and permits. This allows previously
unnoticed design and environmental issues to be recognised prior to construction, and either
avoided or mitigated. It also allows the final verification of affected persons and assets, to
be undertaken prior to the commencement of construction.
All roadwork survey and pegging shall be undertaken with a level to ensure that works are
correctly located.



.3
The pegging of the road formation areas and ancillary sites enables works to be confined to
the minimum area required, reducing the area of disturbance and loss of productive
resources. Construction workers can clearly see the proposed extent of work and
;           landow"ners can recover or harvest resources prior to construction.
Responsibilities
X             The Supervising Consultant shall survey at least 500 m of the proposed road alignment with
a level and peg the road centreline and extent of all works prior to the commencement of
U             road construction. The Supervising Consultant and Contractor shall than jointly inspect the
surveyed alignment and road formation area. The Supervising Consultant shall continue to
survev and peg at least 500 m of alignment in front of the furthest extent of road
construction work underway.
The Contractor shall locate and peg each ancillary site prior to the commencement of any
ancillary site activities (including fill disposal sites, quarries and borrow pits, stockpile sites,
workforce camps and storage areas). Sites shall be located in accordance with the following
criteria:
*  No ancillary site shall be sited within 100 m of an identified archaeological, religious or
cultural site (see Appendix 1);
*  Ancillary sites, except fill disposal sites, shall be sited above flood level and at least 10
m away from watercourses.
Ancillary site areas shall be kept to a minimum to reduce the area of vegetation clearance
and ground disturbance. The Contractor shall seek approval to commence work at each
ancillary site from the Supervising Consultant prior to commencing any related activities.
Note: all requirements to survey, peg and seek approval for proposed roadworks relate to
the initial 500 m of road alignment or the minimum 500 m of alignment in front of road
construction at any one point in time, not to the entire contract length of road.
4.1.5 Additional Road Design
Additional road design is required prior to and during road construction in order to account
for site-specific features.
Prior to road construction, services that cross the road alignment have to be identified for
temporary connection during construction and for reinstatement following construction (see
Section 4.2.7). The type and quantity of these works will only be determined during the site
inspection immediately prior to construction (see Section 5.1).

The foundation materials underlying some retaining wall sites will only be known once
excavation has occurred during construction. Accordingly, many retaining wall types will
only be selected following foundation excavation, with dry stone walls generally used on
stable sites and gabion walls used on unstable sites.
During and following construction, local conditions may dictate the need to delav the
construction of some designed works or the need for additional works. Where major
landslides are likely to occur following road excavation, the construction of associated
retaining walls may be delayed for 1-3 years to prevent their loss. Where sub-surface
seepage occurs from cut batters, additional retaining or breast walls may be required to
stabilise these sites.
Following the first monsoon season after road construction, the design of additional works
may be required if batters have failed due to insufficient retaining wall protection.
4.2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE
Road construction methods largely dictate the degree of direct environmental impact that
will result from the new Toads. The key principles that have to be adhered to are limiting
the area of disturbance and land take, sequencing construction activities to save the double
handling of materials, installing all major retaining and drainage works in the initial year of
construction (prior to the monsoon) and progressively revegetating the completed batters.
The key construction methods and programme required to minimise environmental impacts
are described in detail below.
4.2.1 Vegetation Clearance
Vegetation clearance shall be confined to the minimum area required for construction
activities within the ROW in order to limit the loss of production resources, limit damage to
surrounding features and limit ground disturbance and the associated erosion hazard. This
shall be achieved by clearly marking out the extent of the proposed clearing and ensuring
that clearing is only undertaken within these areas. Trees within the boundaries of ancillary
sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall clearly mark out the extent of clearing with pegs at 25 m intervals or
less, staying strictly within the approved worksite areas. The Contractor shall also identify
and mark individual trees within the extent of clearing that shall be retained. The
Contractor shall seek approval for vegetation clearance from the Supervising Consultant at
least 1 week prior to the intended conmmencement date. The Supervising Consultant shall
only approve clearing once DOR has obtained a permit to clear and written permission from
affected Community Forest Users Groups.



The Contractor shall instruct all construction work-ers to restrict clearing to the marked areas
and not to harvest any forest products for personal consumption.
The Contractor shall ensure that all clearing is undertaken by hand within the extent of
approved sites only. Vegetation clearance along each section of the alignment shall only be
undertaken within I week prior to the associated road excavation works in order to
minimise the period of erosion hazard created by ground disturbance and the removal of
vegetative cover.
Where possible, the Contractor shall stockpile cleared shrub foliage within the ROW  for
later use as a brush layer for batter revegetation.
The Contractor shall protect all remaining vegetation within the road ROW  and at ancillary
sites by ensuring that:
* -'         *  No spoil or topsoil is removed or added to the base of remaining trees;
a  No harmful materials are placed adjacent to the remaining vegetation;
*  No vegetation is harvested by construction workers for their personal use or sale.
4.2.2  Retaining Wall Construction
Retaining walls shall be constructed prior to the bulk excavation of the hill slope above the
wall site so that backfilling of the wall can occur at the time of excavation. This will save
the double handling of fill and reduce the likelihood of fill sidecasting below the road
formation area.

At sites where large landslides are inevitable in the first few years following road
excavation, retaining walls shall only be installed once the major slides have occurred in
order to avoid significant damage to retaining walls. These slides are most likely to occur in
the initial three years following excavation.
Responsibilities
The Supervising Consultant and Contractor, prior to construction, shall identify sites where
large landslides are inevitable, and agree upon the delay of retaining wall construction until
the slides have occurred (see Section 5.1.1).
The Supervising Consultant shall survey and peg all retaining wall sites as per the detailed
designs prior to any road excavation, ensuring that they are correctly sited horizontally to
provide sufficient backfill voids. The Supervising Consultant and Contractor shall then
jointly inspect all pegged retaining wall sites.
The Contractor shall progressively construct retaining walls prior to commencing each
associated cut bank excavation. Cut bank excavation above each wall and the backfilling
behind the wall shall only be commenced once the Supervising Contractor has certified the
retaining wall. Backfilling shall then occur in layers no deeper than 150 mm. with each
layer compacted with a small mechanical compactor or hand held tamper before the next
layer is applied.
4.2.3 Excavation and Embankment Construction
Cut batters are commonly constructed on grades steeper than the design standards, whilst
fill embankments are often not adequately compacted. These unstable features result in
slides and erosion, off-site sedimentation, road closure and high maintenance costs.
All cut and fill banks shall be strictly constructed to design specifications to ensure that
correct batter grades. road widths and earth compaction are achieved. This shall be
achieved by filly surveying and pegging roadworks prior to construction and strictly
inspecting and certifying them against the detailed designs following construction.
Responsibilitics
The Supervising Consultant shall survey and peg the crest of all cut batters and the toe of all
earth embankments prior to any related excavation. The Supervising Consultant and
Contractor shall then jointly inspect all pegged banks.
The Contractor shall bench the natural surface foundation of earth embankments prior to
filling to enable the keying in and compaction of earth. Filling shall then occur in layers no
deeper than 150 mm, with each layer compacted with a small mechanical compactor or
hand held tamper before the next layer is applied.
Road Mainienance and Development Project                                        22



Note: the use of a small mechanical compactor is recommended as it can achieve quick,
consistent compaction.
4.2.4 Drainage
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that storm
runoff across the proposed roads causes minimal damage to the road and downslope
features.  Cross-road drainage shall be provided by causeways and culverts to pass
catchment flows past the road, either over or beneath it., Road surface drainage shall be
provided by infall or outfall cross-fall and lined side drains to direct runoff off the road
surface
All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to
ensure that the high erosion hazard created bv road excavation through drainage lines is
minimised.
Drive-over earth crossbanks will be extensively used to provide road surface drainage
during the initial three years following construction. These structures provide inexpensive
and effective surface drainage that is unlikely to block and is easily inspected.
U            Responsibilities
3            The Supervising Consultant shall survey and peg all designed drainage works prior to the
commencement of construction. Wherever possible, drains shall outlet into stable drainage
lines. Wrhere this is not possible, the Supervising Consultant shall consult with adjoining
I           downslope landowners on mutually acceptable locations for drain outlets.
The Supervising Consultant and Contractor shall then jointly inspect all pegged drainage
works.
The Contractor shall construct all designed drainage works prior to, during or immediately
following road excavation in order to minimise the erosion hazard.
The Contractor shall construct earth cross-banks in May, prior to the commencement of the
monsoon. The banks shall outlet according to the provision of infall or outfall and shall be
spaced between causeways as indicated in Table 3. If infall is provided the banks should
outlet at or immediately upslope of minor cross-road drain inlets. The bank-s will provide
additional road surface drainage during the monsoon. preventing long distance rilling along
]            wheel ruts.

The Contractor shall inspect the construction site for drainage and erosion problems after
each major stormn event during the period of construction, and shall repair all failed drains
and take other appropriate action as directed by the Supervising Consultant.
4.2.5 Topsoil Saving and Re-use
Topsoil is a valuable resource for the revegetation of cut and fill banks. Accordingly, it
shall be saved from all ROW sites that will be disturbed during road construction.
Topsoil shall be stripped from each site prior to any associated flling or sub-surface
excavation. It shall be saved by either stockpiling it adjacent to the proposed road
formation batter sites, either immediately upslope or downslope of the extent of works, or
by stripping it from the road section about to be excavated and respreading it immediately
onto the previously completed adjacent section of road.
The preferred method is topsoil stripping and respreading immediately.  This has the
advantages of only single handling the material and using topsoil when it is fresh, when soil
fertility and seed viability have not been reduced by stockpiling.
If topsoil is to be stockpiled it shall only be done above the excavation site to avoid mixing
it with excavated sub-soil.
Topsoil shall only be respread on batters with a grade of 1:1 (V:H) or flatter. Topsoil
spread on steeper batters will not stay in place.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall save all available topsoil from construction sites within the ROW and
re-use this material on completed road formation batters approved by the Supervising
Consultant. Topsoiling of a batter shall not occur until the Supervising Consultant has
approved the completed batter.
The Contractor shall also strip and stockpile topsoil from all temporarily acquired ancillary
site areas that are to be disturbed.



If topsoil is to be stockpiled, it shall be kept separate from other materials.
The Contractor shall sow a cover crop on each topsoiled batter within 2 days of topsoiling.
4.2.6 Fill Disposal
I            Despite the incorporation of cut and fill equalisation into the road designs wherever
possible, road construction will produce excess fill. Excess fill will be derived from the
excavation of the road on slopes above 600, at sites where box cuts are required to achieve
design specifications and at other sites where cut and fill equalisation can not be achieved.
The disposal of excess fill at low impact sites shall be undertaken to minimise damage to
*           environmental and social features. Excess fill shall generally not be sidecast over the edge
of the excavation or placed in small drainage lines, above houses or at other sites where it is
likely to cause damage to natural features or structures. Sidecasting will only be allowed on
steep slopes in excess of 60° located immediately above major rivers, where a permissable
fill location is not available within 300 m of the excavation site.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall identify and peg out permissable fill disposal locations. Permissable
fill disposal locations include:
* Building sites;
* Erosion gullies to be rehabilitated;
*  Major riverbeds;
3 Road widening sites on low value land.
Major riverbeds can be used to dispose of excess fill as long the fill is not placed directly
into dry season river flows (November to May). Fill shall be placed in the monsoon flood
zone so that it is removed during periods of high sediment flow without diverting flows into
river banks or other features.
The Contractor shall seek approval from the Supervising Consultant for the use of these
sites prior to construction (see Section 5.1.1). Where permissable sites are not available
within 300 m of the excavation site, the disposal of fill will be at the discretion of the
Supervising Consultant, but shall not be undertaken on private land.
The Supervising Consultant shall inspect and approve all correctly located disposal sites.
The Contractor shall instruct the construction workforce on the approved locations for fill
disposal and shall strictly supervise the correct placement of fill at these locations.
Note: the Contractor must construct all roadworks in accordance with the detailed designs.
The generation of excess fill by excavating a full cut where an earth embanklnent or
~~~~--ovU:    A     N     rt^^ )-XhD-



retaining wall is designed is not permitted. Works not strictly constructed according to
approved designs will not be certified for payment (see Section 4.4).
The use of tractors and trailers by the Contractor shall be encouraged to economically and
efficiently transport excess fill to disposal sites.
4.2.7  Reinstatement of Services                                                            |
Local services, including water supply lines, drainage ditches and trails, are commonly cut
during road earthworks. These services are required by local people for crop production.    I
drinking water supply and access, and have the potential to damage road works. These
services are often either inadequatelv reconnected or not reinstated at all.
All irrigation canals, water supply lines and stand pipes, drainage ditches and walking trails
shall be maintained during construction or, if necessary, temporary services shall be
arranged or the owner/user's permission for temporary cessation shall be gained. Services
shall be progressively reinstated as soon as road excavation has been completed.

I~ ~ ~ C  Lnpieblw~~ 
Responsibilities
The Supervising Consultant, accompanied by the Contractor, shall inventory all services to
be reinstated during Pre-construction Inspection 1 (see Section 5.1.1).
The Contractor shall liase and reach agreement with affected landowners and local people
regarding which services must be maintained, which services can be temporarily cut, the



lI
timing of cuts and reinstatements, and the location of reinstated services. The Contractor
shall obtain written permission from affected people to temporarily cease any services.
As agreed, the Contractor shall maintain or provide temporary services during construction.
The Contractor shall make temporary provision for water supply and irrigation and drainage
channels interrupted by road excavation. The Contractor shall progressively reinstate all
interrupted services imrnmediately following earthwork completion, ensuring that reinstated
or repaired services operate to their previous capacity.
The Supervising Consultant shall inspect and certify the adequate reinstatement of all
previously inventoried services to be reinstated.
4.2.8 Quarries and Borrow Pits
The construction of the proposed roads will require hard rock for dry stone and gabion
retaining walls and weirs, as well as side drains and some cross drains. This rock will
primarily be sourced from road formation excavation sites. Where insufficient rock is
available from the road excavation, additional rock shall be sought from neighbouring
landholders willing to dispose of loose rocks on their land. If additional hard rock is
required it will be sourced from local sites suitable for extraction.
Potential borrow pit and quarry sites include exposed hillside rock faces and river beds.
Sediment shall be controlled at each site by ensuring that the base of the quarry or borrow
pit drains into a sediment trap prior to discharging from the site.
Responsibilities
DOR shall obtain all necessarv permits to quarry prior to quarrying (see Section 4.1.2).
The Contractor shall locate and peg out the full extent of proposed extraction areas prior to
the use of a quarry or borrow pit, other than an approved road formation excavation site.
The Contractor shall locate all quarries and borrow pits in accordance with the following
criteria:
*  Restricted to small areas;
* Preferably located at existing quarry sites;
Preferably located on sites without any tree cover;
I            *  Located at least 60 m from any dwelling;
* Located at least 200 m from any archaeological, reliaious or cultural site identified in
Appendix 1.
The Contractor shall estimate the quantity of material required and period of extraction, and
seek approval for use of the extraction site from the Supervising Consultant.
i



The Supervising Consultant shall inspect and approve all correctly located quarry and
borrow pit sites.
The Contractor shall restrict all extraction activities to the approved site, undertaking
minimal vegetation clearance to enable safe rock extraction. The Contractor shall strip and
separately stockpile all topsoil and sub-soil overlying the rock to be extracted. Quarry and
borrow pit operations shall be restricted to the hours of 7.00-18.00.
Where possible, the Contractor shall ensure that each quarry or borrow pit drains into a
sediment trap before runoff discharges from the site.
4.2.9 Stockpiling
The stockpiling of rock, topsoil, sub-soil and other materials will be required during road
construction. These materials shall be stockpiled to prevent damage to local features which
can be caused by diverting runoff and creating sedimentation.
Stockpiled materials shall be stored on non-hazardous sites, away from both habitation and
drainage lines to minimise off-site sedimentation and protect off-site features.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall locate and peg stock-pile sites in accordance with the following criteria:
* At least 10 m away from drainage lines and out of flood level;
* On land with less than a 100 slope;
* On sites already clear of trees and shrubs;
* Not above houses or other structures;
* Further than 2 m away from vegetation to be retained.
If stockpiling is planned on private land, the Contractor shall obtain written permission from
the landowner for use of the site. The Contractor shall seek approval from the Supervising
Consultant for the use of stockpile sites prior to commencing the related extraction
operations. The Supervising Consultant shall inspect and approve all correctly located sites.
The stockpiling of fill material shall not be permitted during the monsoon season unless it is
appropriately covered. Where topsoil is to be stock-piled for longer than one month the
stockpile shall be seeded with an appropriate cover crop.
_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



4.2.10 Blasting
Uncontrolled blasting can cause extensive enviro=nental damage.  Excessive rock
fracturing on previously stable slopes has been common as a result of the overuse of
explosives on hard rock cuts on mountain roads. This has caused severe long-term stability
problems (e.g. Chhinchu-Jajarkot road - FRR, 1998).
Blasting shall only be conducted where hand excavation will take an excessively long time.
Controlled blasting shall be used to limit the volume and extent of rock throw, and to reduce
the disturbance of local people.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall seek approval for blasting from the Supervising Consultant. The
Supervising Consultant shall inspect proposed blasting sites and approve where appropriate.
The Contractor shall ensure that his/her Blaster strictly undertakes all blasting in accordance
J           with the principles set out in the DOR "Controlled Blasting Training Workshop". The
Contractor shall restrict all blasting to the hours of 9.00-16.30.
The Supervising Consultant shall inspect blasting operations at least three times during the
course of construction and report on these activities in the Weekly Reports.
4.2.11 Workforce Camps
Workforce camps are temporarily required during the period of construction. Only one
camp will generally be required along each 1-3 km contract length of road. Camps shall be
located on low impact sites where temporary damage to local resources is minimised.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall locate and peg workforce camp sites in accordance with the following
criteria:
Above flood level and at least 10 m from any drainage line;
.  Away from potential landslide areas:
* Preferably on degraded land of low production value;
*  On cleared land requiring no or minor vegetation clearance;
I            *  Not immediately upslope of local drinking water off-takes;
* Only one camp site per contract or 3 km length of alignment.
The Contractor shall seek approval for the use of the camp site from the Supervising
Consultant. The Supervising Consultant shall inspect and approve all correctly located
camp sites.



The Contractor shall ensure that proper drinking water, sewerage and waste disposal
facilities are supplied and maintained. In water deficient areas, the Contractor shall provide
drinking water from outside the area. Solid waste generated at the carnp shall be recvcled or
disposed of as directed by the Supervising Consultant. Appropriate facilities shall be
provided for women, where they are employed under contract.
4.2.12 Workforce Management
A principal of the RMD Project is the employment of local people. Despite this, workers
will generally live in temporarT workforce camps in close proximity to the roadworks and
numerous local communities.
Workers shall act in a responsible mamner during and after working hours, respecting the
rights, property and practices of local people.
Workers shall not undertake prohibited activities (i.e. wildlife hunting and forest harvesting,
including tree felling and the collection of forest products).
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall liase with affected communities regarding proposed construction
activities. The Contractor shall ensure that workers act in a responsible manner toward
local people and do not harvest or take personal resources.
The Contractor shall ensure that workers do not fell or cut trees or other vegetation for
fuelwood or any other purpose. The Contractor shall ensure that construction workers do
not hunt, trap or trade in wildlife.
The Contractor shall ensure that no wood is burnt by any workers on or off site by providing
kerosene to workers for all cooking needs.
Working hours shall not extend outside the hours of 7.00-18.00 to ensure that local people
are not unduly disturbed.
The incidence of child labour shall be monitored in consultation with local communities and
officials to prevent exploitation.
4.2.13 Air and Noise Pollution
Dust generation will cause air contamination during road construction. Construction will be
primarily labour based, therefore dust emissions will be minimal. However, construction
workers will be exposed to this low level of dust during the period of construction.
Noise levels generated from construction activities will generally be low due to hand
construction, although blasting will produce high level, short duration noise.



Responsibilities
The Contractor shall ensure that construction works do not generate unacceptably high
levels of dust.
The Contractor shall control noise pollution by restricting work hours to between 7.00-
18.00, restricting blasting hours to 9.00-16.30 and prohibiting the use of air horns on
construction vehicles in settlement areas.
4.2.14 Hazards and Hazardous Materials
The mishandling and incorrect storage of explosives, combustible and toxic materials such
as petrol, diesel, oil and lubricants can lead to explosions, spills and leaks wlhich pose a
safety hazard to workers and may cause soil and water contamination. Minimal amounts of
these materials will be used during the labour-based construction.
1          Responsibilities
The Contractor shall safely handle and store hazardous materials in accordance with the
following requirements.
- Hazardous materials shall be stored above flood level and at least 20 m from any
3               watercourse;
3  Explosives shall be stored in strict accordance with HMG regulations;
*  Hazardous liquid substances (e.g. petrol, diesel, oils) shall be stored on top of sealed
a_J             plastic sheets in a secure, flat bunded area. Bund walls shall be at least 25 cm high.
The Contractor shall seek directions from the Supervising Consultant regarding the disposal
of hazardous materials. Used lubricants and oils shall be collected and disposed of or
recycled without causing pollution or a hazard to worker safety.  Spills of hazardous
materials within or outside bunded storage areas shall be cleaned up immediately.
Contaminated and tom or worn plastic sheets shall be disposed of appropriately.
Li           The Contractor shall suppress fires on or adjacent to construction or ancillary sites.
|            4.3- POST-CONSTRUCTION PHASE
4.3.1  Revegetation
Disturbed areas shall be revegetated following construction activities, with bio-engineering
measures used extensively to stabilise cut and fill batters. Vegetation stabilises batters and
other disturbed ground surfaces by providing ground cover to protect against raindrop
impact and reduce overland runoff velocities, and binding soil through plant root
development.
i~ ~~~..-r  _.,_..r  



The only batters disturbed during construction where bio-engineerinc will not be undertaken
following initial construction will be slopes prone to major landslides and rock slopes.
Slopes prone to major slides in the first few years following road construction will be
revegetated once the slides have occurred and the slopes have reached a relatively stable
angle of repose. Rock slopes or slopes with predominantlv rocky materials will not be
revegetated.
Batters and disturbed areas shall be progressively stabilised in order to rapidly reduce the
erosion hazard of the site. Revegetation shall be undertaken in two stages following
construction:
1.    Cover crop sowing by the Contractor;
2.    Long-termn vegetation establishment by the Bio-engineering Consultant.
Revegetation has been split into these two phases in order to ensure that the cover crop is
sown as soon as possible following construction and that a specialist Bio-engineering
Consultant is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of long-term bio-
engineering measures.
The establishment of initial ground cover with a cover crop is the first priority of
revegetation. The cover crop provides some rapid erosion protection and creates a micro-
climate favourable for the establishment of other vegetation. The establishment of long-
term vegetative cover requires the use of a range of specialist bio-engineering techniques
and adequate follow-up maintenance, including replanting. Vegetation maintenance is
essential to the success of batter revegetation, therefore bio-engineering maintenance will
occur for a 2 year period.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall progressively sow all disturbed construction and ancillary site surfaces
with a cover cTop mix immediately following the completion and certification of each batter
or final use of each ancillary site, including all fill disposal sites.
The Supervising Consultant shall notify the Bio-engineering Contractor where bio-
engineering works shall be delayed until large landslides have occurred (see Section 5.1.1).
The Bio-engineering Contractor shall progressively implement works as per the Bio-
engineering Plan on all cut and fill batters. This shall commence in the correct planting
season as soon as an initial 400 m of road has been completed and certified.
The Supervising Consultant shall regularly monitor the effectiveness of bio-engineering
measures.



4.3.2 Ancillary Site Rehabilitation
All ancillary sites have to be rehabilitated following their temporary use in order to stabilise
the sites, ensure that they are non-polluting and return them to their previous condition.
Responsibilities
The Contractor shall ensure that ancillary sites (stockpile sites, quarries and borrow pits,
*            workforce camps) are fully rehabilitated within 1 month of the final day of use. This shall
involve the removal of all structures except permanent buildings that the landowner has
requested to remain and the Supervising Consultant has permitted. All refuse, stockpiles
and other temporary features shall be removed.
The Contractor shall spread all previously stripped overburden and topsoil across the site,
with all topsoil spread evenly on the surface. The Contractor shall provide temporary
surface drainage on sites that are prone to erosion prior revegetation. This drainage shall be
in the form of small catch drains Or earth banks located immediately above and at intervals
no greater than 50 m down the slope. The drains shall have 0.5-1% grade and outlet at a
stable disposal sites.
Where possible, the Contractor shall restrict access to these sites by placing rocks to form a
barrier to vehicle access. The Contractor shall then revegetate the site by hand broadcasting
a cover crop and planting appropriate long-term vegetation (see Section 4.3.1).
4.3.3 Roadwork Maintenance
The maintenance of roadworks shall be undertaken under a separate contract to the
construction contract, commencing at the end of the defect liability period. This will cover
the construction of additional roadworks not included in the detailed design but deemed
necessary to stabilise or maintain the road.
The Contractor will be responsible for any defects in his/her construction work for a period
of one year following the completion of road construction.
4.4 Certification of Completed Works for Payment
The correct construction of designed roadworks is most effectively achieved by basing
contract payments on the actual volumes of designed works constructed, and non-payment
for sub-standard constructed works.
The Contractor is able to make considerable cost savings by constructing a full cut instead
of constructing half cut and half fill with retaining walls. Likewise, labour costs can be
reduced by formning batters steeper than the design standards or sidecasting excess fill.
i.X



Responsibilities
Construction contracts shall specify payment per unit of designed work constructed, as well
as non-payment for sub-standard construction below the detailed design specifications.
The Supervising Consultant shall strictly certify, constructed roadworks against the detailed
road designs and the EMAP conditions.

5. SITE SUPERVISION, MONITORING AND
REPORTING
The strict supervision of road construction activities is required prior to, during and
following construction to ensure that works are constructed in accordance with the approved
I            designs and that envirorunmental impacts are fully mitigated in accordance with the EMAP.
A standard system of site inspections, reporting and approvals shall be undertaken during
U            the life of the project, as described below.
The Supervising Consultant shall undertake the following site inspections, in conjunction
with the Contractor where specified, to assist in site plamning, to oversee construction and to
certify (where necessary) the completed works and controls for payment.
-1
_J         5.1  PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE
Two pre-construction inspections of each section of the alignrnent and all ancillary sites
shall be undertaken by the Supervising Consultant and Contractor.
Pre-construction Inspection 1 - the initial inspection shall involve a site review of
between 500-1,000 m of the pegged centreline of the alignment and any identified ancillary
sites required by the Contractor. It will serve to:
* Confihm the alignment;
*  Identify site-specific construction or environmental problems;
* Identify highly unstable alignment sections where retaining wall construction and/or
bio-engineering work will be delayed;
Identify services that are required to be reinstated;
Identify fill disposal sites;
*  Identify sources of rock for retaining wall construction;
* Identity workforce camp sites; and
*  Plan the phasing of construction along the alignment.
Prior to this inspection the Supervising Consultant shall survey and clearly peg the
centreline. During the inspection the Supervising Consultant and Contractor shall discuss
and agree upon the factors listed above, including the services that are to be reinstated and
acceptable fill disposal sites.
The Supervising Consultant shall document the type and location of all services that are to
be temporarily reconnected and reinstated by the Contractor, and provide a copy of this to
the Contractor.

*  Local houses and land   - no falling rock or landslide damage to houses;
- no major landslide or sediment deposits downslope of road.
A standard report covering the above features shall be completed for each road by the Geo-
enviromnent Unit following each inspection. This report shall be submitted to the relevant
district DOR Supervisor and the relevant DOR section in Kathmandu within two weeks of
the inspection.
Environmental features such as noise, air and water quality will not be monitored as they
are only likely to be minor impacts.



6. RECORDS, AUDITS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION
6.1 EMAP RECORDS
In order to demonstrate compliance with the EMAP. the Contractor shall keep records
regarding environmental management issues at the site. Records must be kept for the site
with a list of each category which has been checked and monitored.
The Contractors' records shall include:
* All necessary permits, including private landowners' permission for activities on their
land;
* Proof of Contractor Field Supervisor training;
* All written instructions and reports provided by the Supervising Consultant, including
Weekly Reports, Monthly Reports and Audit Reports;
: *         *  A register of audit non-conformances and corrective actions;
L 3         *  Correspondence.
All records shall be kept at site prernises and maintained in a legible state for the full period
of construction. Records will be made available to the DOR Project Manager and the
Supervising Consultant upon demand.
The Contractor must immediately report all environmental hazards or incidences to the
Supervising Consultant, such as the thief or misplacement of explosives, damage to
structures or land, construction activities that have occurred outside approved sites, spills of
hazardous materials, forest or grassland fires or other incidents which are likely to cause
pollution, other detrimental environmental effects or loss or damage to private resources.
6.2   SITE AUDITS
A full compliance audit of the Contractor's operations and all construction and ancillary
sites shall be conducted by the Supervising Consultant (Auditor) once every 3 months.
Envirom-nental compliance will be audited against the conditions of the contract and EMAP,
based on the phase of road development.
The audit shall be conducted by the Supervising Consultant in conjunction with the DOR
Project Manager, and shall be attended by the Contractor.
The audit will involve a review of all sites currently in use or used since the previous audit,
any construction and related activities in progress and the site records. An Audit Report
describing the results of each audit shall be prepared bv the Supervising Consultant and
submitted to the Contractor within 2 days of the completion of the audit.  Non-
conformances will be described and corrective action/s will be reconimended with an
identified date for completion.
I



6.3 CORRECTIVE ACTION
The Contractor shall implement the corrective action/s recomnmended by the Supervising
Consultant in the time specified.  The Contractor shall then notify the Supervising
Consultant of the completion of the corrective action/s.
The Supervising Consultant shall varify the satisfactory implementation of corrective
actions during the following Weekly Inspection and sign off on the non-conformance/s if
satisfactorily rectified, or make a further request is unsatisfactory.
6.4 FINAL AUDIT SUMMARY
The Supervising Consultant shall prepare an Audit Summary Report at the completion of the
Contractor's contract. The report will provide a summary of the type and number of non-
conformances found during the course of the contract, the type of corrective actions
recommended and undertaken and the Contractor's diligence and response time to corrective
actions.
The report shall be used to assess the effectiveness of contract conditions and the EMAP,
and identify' areas where these documents need strengthening in the future. It will also be
used to assess the perforrnance of the Contractor.



7. IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS
Practical proposals for the rehabilitation of degraded land, for the enhancement and
development of environmental assets, and for the mitigation of induced impacts were
identified during road alignment inspections and discussions with local people and District
officials, in line with the requirements of the World Bank TOR. Six improvement proposals
are described below.
.t Ja72 7.1 IMPROVEMENT OF DEGRADED ENVIRONMENTAL
FEATURES
7.1.1  Community Forest Establishment and Support
A major potential induced environmental impact of the proposed road construction is the
degradation of forests in the road ROIs over time. This may result from improved access
to/from forests, thereby enabling easier natural resource access and removal, as well as
X            additional forest product demands from an increased localised population near the roads and
new roadside service industries.
It is proposed to assist in the creation of Community Forests within the ROIs and to provide
some extension support to FUGs in the initial two years of their operation in order to
3            achieve greater protection of ROI forests prior to and following the operation of the
proposed roads. This will help to improve the livelihoods of forest users by helping to
achieve the sustainable use of forest resources.
This proposal involves two separate phases:
*- 2        1.    The establishment of Community Forests;
2.    The support of Forest User Groups (FUGs).
Phase 1: Community Forest Establishment
The RMD Project will assist in the establishment of Community Forests in road ROIs over
the initial 2.5 years of the project. This will involve establishing a separate programme
within the Department of Forests under which the following additional Departmental
Foresters will be employed to promote and assist with the establishment of Community
Forests in the ROIs.

* - given the limited size of the Mangalsen ROI, the Forester responsible for this area will also cover the u
southern end of the Martadi ROI.
Full-time Foresters will be funded for a period of 2.5 years.  Each Forester will be
responsible for an ROI area of between 130-230 km2. The programme will cover the entire
ROI areas but will focus on forests within 5 krn of each of the destination district
headquarters, with particular emphasis on the diverse forests around Martadi and Jumla.
Community Forests will be established by the following methodology:
1.    Identification of ROlforest distribution and existing Community Forests
The Forester responsible for each ROI shall delineate the ROI on air photos, identify forest
distribution within this area and map established Community Forests.
2.    Promotion of Community Forestry
Commencing at the destination district headquarters and based on ROI forest distribution
and the location of existing Community Forests, the Forester will visit all villages that
heavily utilise Government Forests within the ROI. He/she will inspect the forest and
determine the traditional users of that forest, then organise a meeting of users in conjunction
with the local VDC/Ward representatives.  At the meeting the Forester will provide
briefings on the different aims, benefits and responsibilities associated with Community
Forests, and outline the legal process to form a FUG.
If some initial interest is shown by local people, the Forester will make a date to return
within 3 months to facilitate a prospective Forest Users' Group meeting.
This initial stage of promoting Community Forestry will take approximately 3 months to
complete.
3.     Prospective Forest Users Group Meeting
The Forester will facilitate prospective Forest Users Group meetings. The meetings will
raise awareness and start discussions amongst local forest users. The focus will be on the
users' common aims and management capacity, two criteria that are used by the DFO to
decide upon the handover of national forests to local users. The Forester will fully explain



,X1-
Community Forest policy, the legal requirements for ownership, the User Conmnittee
formation process and the forest handover process.
4.    Formation of the Forest Users Group and Users Committee
Interested local forest users shall form a Forest Users Group and then constitute the Users
3            Committee by voting to elect committee members. The Users Committee is recognised as
the working authority in relation to the management of the local forest that is to be duly
handed over by the DFO upon fulfillment of the legal requirements.
With the assistance of a local organisation (e.g. VDC), the Forester will act as a facilitator in
assisting the Users Committee to prepare its Constitution: the working rules that govem
user members in terms of Community Forest development and related issues.
5.    Registration of the Forest User Group and Committee
The Users Committee is required to submit an application to the DFO to register the Forest
Users Group and Committee. Having found the Users Group, including its Committee,
constituted in accordance with its 'Constitution', the DFO shall register it and issue a formnal
'Users Group Certificate' after having a bond to comply with the Forest Act 1993 and Forest
Regulations 1995.
3            6.    Preparation of an Operational Plan
Once the Users Group Certificate has been issued, the Forester shall return to assist the
J           Users Group/Committee to prepare the Operational Plan. The Operational Plan provides a
brief description of forest conditions, protection measures to be adopted. forest and wildlife
1 I         harvesting management, the proposed use of income from the sale of forest products and
penalties for forest offences by user members.
]            7.    Handover of the Local Forest to the Forest User Group
Upon completion of the Operational Plan, the Forester will assist the User Group to make
application to the DFO for the handover of the forest. The DFO, upon investigation into the
application and after alteration (deemed necessary) with the consent of Users' Group, shall
3            issue the 'Handover Certificate' to the Users' Group.
Phase 2: Forest User Group Support
The RMD Project will assist with the support of the Community Forests that it assisted to
establish within the ROIs, following the establishment phase, up until the Foresters' two
I            year terms of employment are completed. Extension support shall be tailored to meet each
Forest User Group's Operational Plan objectives and their requests for support. This
support will most likely include:
I~~_., ,*_,   _A



- Silvaculture workshops - advice on the management of forests to promote
regeneration and biodiversity, and optimise production. This shall include discussion on
sustainable harvesting rates and forest regeneration techniques (including species
selection and seedling planting).
* Nursery establishment workshops - advice on establishing nurseries for the replanting
of Community Forests, degraded areas and other sites. This shall include advice on all
necessary techniques for growing different seedling species.
7.1.2 Trail Improvement
After the proposed roads have been constructed, a number of major existing neighbouring
trails will continue to be used, with some trails leading to the roads actually increasing in
usage. Some of these trails will divert runoff onto the roads, thereby causing damage.
It is proposed to improve two sections of the main trail to Mangalsen and four separate trails
that lead to the proposed Jumla alignment in order to provide better, more stable access and
to prevent the diversion of large volumes of runoff onto the roads.
Mangalsen: a 500 m section of the main Mangalsen trail that runs southwards down a ridge
towards the Kailash Khola foot bridge, is eroding due to uncontrolled runoff. It is proposed
that this section of trail be stabilised by constructing permanent, rock-lined drains across the
trail at intervals of 50-80 m, depending upon the slope. As this section of the trail is
generally located on the ridge, drains will only have to be 10-30 m in length. Additionally,
no settlements or cultivation land is located on this ridge therefore drain outlet points will be
easy to locate.
In addition, it is proposed that the final 2,000 m of the main trail leading southwards up to
Mangalsen also be stabilised by the construction of rock-lined drains. This section of the
trail has severely eroded and is now 1-3 m below the level of the adjacent hillside. If left
unchecked, part of this section of the trail, will divert runoff onto the proposed road, which
meets the trail at least once.
Rock-lined drains should be constructed at 50-80 m intervals to divert channalised runoff
off the trail. These drains should generally be located at changes in slope and where the
track level is similar to or higher than the level of the adjacent hillside. Drains should outlet
into stable drainage lines, not onto agricultural fields or similar production areas. In
addition. steps will be constructed down road cut and fill batters from/to the trail to reinstate
sections of the trail cut by the road formation.
Jutmla: four existing trails that lead from nearby major settlements to the proposed Jumla
road will form primary accessways to/from the road. These trails are generally eroding due
to uncontrolled runoff. It is proposed that 5,200 m of these trails (Table 6) be stabilised by
constructing rock-lined drains at 50-80 m intervals across the trails to divert channalised
runoff off the trails, as proposed for the Mangalsen trails.

Sirangaon to Chati                 1,000
Roadside to Manma                  3,000
Roadside to Kalikot                 500
Roadside to Ghoriyana               700
Total                              5,200
These proposed works include the improvement of the trail to Manma, the Kalikot District
headquarters.
The proposed Mangalsen and Jumla trail improvement works shall be undertaken by VDCs,
with DOR providing technical advice and overseeing the quality of work.  Separate
contracts shall be let to a number of VDCs, with the total length of trail under a single
contract limited to 3,000 m in order to distribute employment. Implementation shall be
carried out during the associated road construction.
7.1.3 Revegetation of Degraded Land
A 1.5 ha area on the low ridge on the main Mangalsen trail, immediately north of the
Kailash Khola foot bridge, is bare and severely eroding. It is proposed to construct
permanent drains on the trail that runs through the centre of this area to stabilise it (see
Section 7.1.2), but vegetative cover is also required to stabilise the site.
]           It is proposed to stabilise this 1.5 ha site by constructing earth cross drains and planting tree
and shrub species. This would be achieved by employing a forester to approach the local
forest users and seek their support to revegetate the site. Earth drainage banks would then
be constructed by hand on a very low grade off the contour (i.e. I%) every 40 m down the
degraded hillside, outletting to each side. These works would link into the proposed trail
stabilisation rock-lined drains. A brush fence will be constructed around the site to prevent
grazing. The site would then be planted out and maintained for a period of 2 years.
The forester would provide technical advice, arrange planting stock and oversee the work.
The works will be funded by DOR, including labour, tree stock and other materials, whilst it
is proposed that it is managed by the Department of Forests, who would employ the forester
and oversee the quality of the work.
7.1.4 Landslide Stabilisation
A landslide stretching for approximately 200-300 m below Dhand Bhikhma village,
adjacent to the Jumla alignment, will eventually destabilise the village and adjoining
agricultural fields. The slide will also eventually impact upon the proposed road alignment
if left unchecked. It appears that the landslide can be stabilised by vegetative means and
sufficient interest exists in the village to provide labour.



It is proposed to stabilise the landslide if it is cost effective to do so. An initial assessment
of the site will be undertaken by a Geotechnical Engineer to assess the slide, design works,
discuss stabilisation options with the affected people and estimate costs for the most cost-
effective method of stabilisation. If the cost of works is under NRs. 250,000 utilising local
labour (half donated and half voluntarv) the works shall be undertaken, funded by DOR.
It is proposed that the Department of Soil Conservation oversee the work, coordinating with
the local VDC. Implementation of this proposal should commence as early as possible,
when Jumla road construction commences.
7.2 IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO THE PROPOSED ROADS
7.2.1 Road Head and Market Centre Planning
Following the construction of new roads, businesses and dwellings commonly encroach
upon the roads, particularly at road heads, existing market centres or where main trails cross
the alignments. Buildings are usually constructed well inside the 30 m ROW, particularly
in steep terrain, often reducing the road width to less than 15 m. In addition, the narrowed
road is used for commercial activities, including the loading, storage and sale of materials.
This unpaved/ungravelled road surface is usually poorly drained, and results in a boggy area
during the monsoon and localised excessive dust in the dry season.
At each of the five proposed district headquarter road heads and at major existing or
potential market places along the proposed alignments, market centre planning shall be
undertaken. This shall involve:
1.    Planning: a Town Planner shall walk each alignment prior to road construction to
identify potential major market centres. An assessment will be made of the likely
activities and structures that will develop at these potential sites, as well as at
existing major markets and the proposed road heads. A basic market place plan will
then be formulated in consultation with each local VDC, which will include a
minimum main road width of 25 m, the location of the bus park, the drainage plan
and access laneways between building sites.
Note: due to local personal interests regarding increased land values, the Town
Planner shall select the best market place site prior to seeking VDC input. Selection
shall be based on finding a flat site, where possible, which can be adequately
drained.
2.    Survey: the Town Planner shall survey, peg and sketch each proposed market
centre and road head site, providing the VDC with a copy of the plan and walking
them through the pegged area and development restrictions. Painted rocks or tree
trunks shall be used to delineate the site.



*- 3. Construction contract: following road head and market place planning, the
*                proposed road formation and graveling specifications will become part of the
forthcoming road contracts.
4.    Road formation, drainage and gravelling: road formation and drainage shall be
constructed in accordance with the market place plan. The road shall then be
|                  gravelled to a depth of 250 mm through the market place and for a distance of 60 m
on either end. The width of gravel will be 25 m through the market area. The edge
u                  of the graveled area will be clearly defined by masonry drains and/or peg or markers
following graveling.
Two Town Planners will be employed to undertake the above planning. One planner will
cover the Darchula, Martadi and Mangalsen roads, whilst the other will cover the Jumla and
Jajarkot roads. They will be employed for a period of four months each.
This proposal will be funded by DOR, whilst it is proposed that the employment and
l          management of the Town Planners be undertaken by the Ministry of Housing and Physical
Planning. The implementation of the road plans, including road formation, drainage and
graveling works will be undertaken by road construction Contractors and managed by DOR.
Planning should be undertaken prior to any road construction so that rational, unencroached
road head and market centre areas can be selected. The works at these sites should be
5           undertaken at the start of the contract for each section of road leading to a planned site so
that they are established well prior to the first traffic.
7.2.2 Cash Crop Development
The construction of the proposed roads will enable perishable agricultural produce to reach
new markets and will reduce the cost of the transportation of produce. It should also reduce
the cost of some agricultural inputs. Accordingly, there will be opportunities for the
development of cash crops where suitable land and climate types exist within the road ROIs.
It is proposed that DOR fully brief the Department of Agriculture about the location and
programming of RMD Project new road construction as soon as project funding has been
approved. This will enable the Department of Agriculture to integrate the agricultural
3           production and market development opportunities that will be provided by this development
into its long-term extension programme.
j           The briefing will be undertaken by the preparation of a summary report on the proposed
road construction programme and a briefing meeting.

8. BIO-ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES
8.1 PRINCIPLES
Bio-engineering will be undertaken on all cut and fill batters, except on rock slopes, along
the extent of roadworks to achieve the long-term stabilisation of these slopes.
Bio-engineering stabilises the ground surface to prevent surface erosion, but will not
stabilise inherently unstable slopes that are excessive steep, poorly drained or poorlv
consolidated. Bio-engineering will only be successful where the bulk stability of a slope
exist prior to treatment. Slopes have to be formed to stable grades, adequately compacted
and adequately drained prior to bio-engineering otherwise revegetation will not be
successful.
Bio-engineering commences following the certification of roadworks to the correct design
standards by the Supervising Consultant. Batter revegetation is then undertaken in two
phases:
1. Cover crop establishment will be undertaken by the Construction Contractor who
will be responsible for hand broadcasting seed imrnediately following certification
of each batter by the Supervising Consultant, prior to the monsoon.
2. Long-term vegetation establishment will be undertaken under a separate contract by
an experienced Bio-engineering Contractor during the optimum plant establishment
season/s.
The establishment of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover
reduces raindrop impact, binds the soil surface and creates a micro-climate favourable for
the establishment of other vegetation. The timely implementation of this activity is best
undertaken by the Contractor.
The establishment of long-term vegetative cover requires the use of a range of specialist
bio-engineering techniques and adequate follow-up maintenance, including replanting. This
is best undertaken by a skilled Bio-engineering Contractor. In addition, the employment of
local people by the Bio-engineering Contractor is required to create local employment and
establish a skilled local workforce that can be employed to maintain the works.
Vegetation maintenance is essential to the success of batter revegetation, therefore bio-
engineering contracts will include a two year maintenance period. Protection of the
vegetation from grazing shall also be a condition of bio-engineering contracts.
Rock slopes or slopes wkith predominantly rocky materials will not be revegetated, although
where exposed areas of soil occur between rocks these areas may be revegetated, depending
upon their size, slope and erosion hazard.



8.2 ROAD EMBANKMENT SPECIFICATIONS
Road embankments and associated works have generally been designed to provide stable
slopes once appropriate bio-engineering techniques have been applied. The only exception
to this is where slopes exceed 500, where excessively steep cut batters with 6:1 (V:H)
grades have been designed to save on excavation costs.
On slopes of less than 500, cut batters have been designed at a 2:1 (V:H) grade through
*            colluvial soil and a 6:1 (V:H) grade through hard rock. All fill batters have been designed
at a 1:1.5 (V:H) grade. Other embankment design features include:
*  Compacted earth embankments are generally designed on natural ground slopes up to 0-
300.
3  Fill bank retaining walls are generally designed on natural ground slopes between 30°-
450.
J  Breast walls are designed at the toe of cut batters through irrigated cultivation and will
be designed in the field at permanent seepage sites.
? Diversion channels will be installed to divert water from the irrigated cultivated land
above cut slopes to stable disposal areas.
8.3 DESIGN PARAMETERS
The optimum bio-engineering technique for each site must be selected based on site-specific
conditions. Site conditions vary greatly therefore it is difficult to generalise about optimal
techniques. The Construction Guidelines for Low Cost Feeder Roads (DOR, 1995) uses
four parameters to select bio-engineering techniques: slope length, slope angle, material
drainage and site moisture. These factors may vary across a single site therefore the
average features are usually considered.
j            In addition to these four factors hillside land use must also be considered. Overland
drainage patterns and sub-surface moisture are generally different for cultivation land in
comparison to other land types. The surface runoff pattern on cultivated land is often
I            altered when a new crop is sown. The edges of bunds that have been stable for long periods
may fail due to a change in runoff pattern. Runoff from cultivated land above cut slopes
needs to be safely diverted. In addition, the soil profile of cultivated land is often saturated
during the monsoon or during periods of irrigation, lowering the shear strength of the
.-          profile.
A rapid indirect assessment of slopes to select appropriate bio-engineering techniques can
be made by considering land use above the site, based on classifying land as either
'cultivation' or 'other land types'. Most cultivation land in the hills is located on colluvial
soils that are commonly prone to failure following road excavation. Even if the alignment



does not pass through cultivation, but the land above the alignment is under cultivation, it
can reduce cut slope stability due to greater surface and profile saturation during the
monsoon and periods of irrigation. If cultivation land is under paddy, springs may appear
on the cut slopes during the monsoon.
The main parameters considered in the design of site-specific bio-engineering techniques
are described below.
8.3.1 Slope Length
Slope length is defined as the length of the batter slope. The longer the slope, the gareater
the volume of runoff on the batter and therefore the greater the erosion hazard. Longer
slopes are more prone to rill and gully erosion. Different bio-engineering techniques have.
been recommended based on slopes either in excess of or less than 15 m. Slope lengths in
excess of 15 m often require combinatibn of vegetative and physical measures to achieve
stabilisation due to their high erosion hazard, whilst slopes shorter than 15 m can generally
be stabilised with a simpler method of vegetation establishment
8.3.2 Slope Angle
Slope angle is the grade of the slope. Steeper slopes are generally more difficult to stabilise
using vegetative methods due to planting difficulties and a higher erosion hazard produced
by greater runoff velocities.  Slopes above 50° are considered to be steep, with a
significantly greater erosion hazard. Different combinations of slope length and angles
require different bio-engineering techniques. For example, a long slope of less than 50°
could be as equally difficult to stabilise as a short slope of greater than 50°.
8.3.3 Material Drainage
Material drainage is a measurement of the porosity of soil and rock material. It has been
classified as either good or poor, with highly coarse material, such as sand, having good
drainage, whilst soils with a high clay content have poor drainage. Poorly drained material
in road cuttings tends to slump as moisture accumulates. At these sites measures are
required to improve drainage, such as bolster cylinders in combination with grass and
tree/shrub plantings. On steep slopes where bolsters can be installed, interplanting with
grasses and rill strengthening with rip rap or palisades is required to prevent the erosion of
establishing vegetation.
8.3.4 Site Moisture
Site moisture is a measurement of the dryness of the site as affected by the external factors
of rainfall, aspect, altitude, slope location and exposure to wind. Site moisture is also
affected by land use above the site. On dry sites, the retention of soil moisture is required
for plant growth, whereas on moist sites drainage is crucial to ensure that the slope is not
loaded.



8.3.5 Hillside Land Use
As discussed, cultivated land above a cut batter can alter drainage patterns. Hillside land
use also has a bearing on likLely sedimentation onto the road formation. A high rate of
erosion is common on rainfed outward sloping terraces. Eroded sediment from these fields
can cover cut batters and thereby reduce plant growth. Similarly, terrace failure, wvhich is
I  common on terraces higher than I m, can result in the deposition of a large volume of
sediment onto cut batters, damaging establishing vegetation and the stability of the slope.
On all long, steep cut batters below cultivation vegetation establishment must promote
drainage. Similarly, breast walls are usually required at the toe of the cut slopes below
irrigated cultivation to provide a stable sub-surface drainage point.
8.4 OPTIMAL BIO-ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES
Thirteen optimal bio-engineering techniques are recommended for the stabilisation of
batters, either as single treatments or in combination (Table 5). Four techniques involve
, j         planting grass lines, four techniques involve tree or shrub establishment, whilst the
remaining five techniques involve techniques to assist vegetation establishment and site
drainage. These techniques are illustrated in Drawings 1 and 2.
8.4.1  Downslope Grass Lines
I            Downslope grass lines are planted down the cut slope. Grass slips are planted at 20 cm
intervals, with lines generally spaced at 50 cm intervals (although line spacings will depend
on the distance between any existing rills). Downslope grass lines follow the natural fall of
the slope. If the slope has already developed rills, lines follow the ridges between rills.
Where areas between grass lines are likely to nill, sealing with rip rap or palisades is
|I         recommended.
This grass planting pattern is recommended for very moist slopes and on sites where
j            significant overland flows spill onto the batter. Downslope grass lines rapidly and safely
dispose of runoff. Grass slips form clumps that develop matty roots and stabilise the ground
surface.
8.4.2 Contour Grass Lines
Contour grass lines are planted on the contour at line spacings of 50 cm, with slips planted
at 20 cm intervals. This grass planting pattem is recommended for all dry slopes as it
I            retains moisture by reducing runoff velocities and spreading surface flows. Sediment is
retained above the lines which intum retain whilst holding eroded moisture.

8.4.3 Diagonal Grass Lines
Diagonal grass lines are planted at an angle of between 30-45° off the horizontal, across
the slope. Grass slips are planted at 20 cm intervals, with lines generally spaced at 50 cm
intervals.
I            This diagonal configuration is recommended on steep slopes where low volumes of runoff
occur (i.e. where a small overland catchment exists above the road). This planting pattern
N            prevents rill formation and retains eroded soil on the slope, helpinc to build humus and fine
soil slope deposits.
8.4.4 Chevron Grass Lines
Chevron grass lines are planted as converging diagonal grass lines at an angle of between
30'.400 off the horizontal. This grass planting pattern is recommended on steep, badly
rilled slopes with coarse surface soils. It is used to direct surface runoff to stable disposal
areas such as a rill or rip rap channel, or a natural drainage line, thus utilising the natural
drainage pattern. The chevron planting pattern can also be reversed to divert runoff to the
centre of the batter and thereby promote infiltration.
8.4.5 Tree/Grass Planting
3            Trees are planted on 0.5 m wide contour terrace benches at 2 m intervals on the lower part
of cut slopes or damaged areas. Shrubs are planted on the upper slopes at a similar spacing.
7X           Grass species (including Babio, Khar and Vetiver) are planted in between brush layers.
Grass planting on gentle slopes is undertaken as indicated on the attached drawing.
This technique is recommended on all bare slopes and fill deposits. Planting trees on slopes
increases the dead load, therefore shrubs are planted on the upper batter slope to avoid the
additional load. Shrubs also eventually provide live fencing to farms.
8.4.6 Shrub/Tree Live Staking
--A         Cuttings of vegetatively propagated shrubs and/or trees are staked into gentle slopes and
interplanted with grass lines. Live staking produces bushy plants with high deep roots in a
short period. Bush growth on steep slopes does not add a significant load to the slope, but
the deep roots effectively hold soil. Cuttings are collected locally.
This technique is reconmmended for moist, gentle slopes with a slow creeping tendency.
.1
I~~~~~~    



8.4.7 Palisades
Woodv cuttings are planted at 10-15 cm intervals next to each other in lines across the
slope, usually on the contour, to form palisades. They form a strong barrier that holds
eroded soil, ultimately forming small terraces suitable for the establishment of vegetation.
Palisades are recommended for all slopes except where minor slumps are likely. The SALT
technique of soil conservation, developed in the Philippines for hill agriculture up to 350, is
based on this technique.
8.4.8 Fascines
Fascines are made of vegetatively propagated plant cuttings tied together into 15-20 cm
bundles and dug into slopes on the contour to this depth. Fascines are recommended to
stabilise small, critical slopes, and to protect rip rap on slopes. Fascines irnmediately
provide a physical barrier to hold surface soil as well as a drainage path, whilst cuttings
rapidly develop roots that bind the slope. Fascines also help to drain water to some extent.
8.4.9 Bolster Cylinders
Bolster cylinders made of gabion wire cylinders filled with stones are laid on the contour,
across the slope. Bolster cylinders are recomnmended on slopes greater than 350 that have
minor slumping due to high surface moisture. They provide reinforcement to the batter
surface whilst acting as drainage conduit. Vegetation is established between the bolsters.
8.4.10 Mulching
Mulching involves the laying of woody shrub and herb cuttings on the batter surface.
Depending upon the slope, mulch is fixed using either wooden or wire pegs or pegged jute
netting. Mulching is recommended on steep sites with highly erodable soils, especially
fresh deposits. Mulch protects the bare surface against raindrop impact and wind erosion,
and improves soil moisture retention. Abundantly available local species such as Titepati
are used.
8.4.11 Jute Netting
Jute netting is used to hold mulch in place, usually on steep slopes. A wide jute netting (10
x 10 cm) is pegged over the mulch layer.
8.4.12 Diversion Channels
Diversion channels cut by road excavation are reinstated to prevent water spilling over cut
batters and to reconnect water supplies. Diversion channels are required at the toe of
cultivation land, immediately above cut batters, in order to divert overland runoff to a stable
disposal area. These channels are seeded with local grass species, and farmers are advised
on how to seaI cracks that develop.



8.4.13 Brush Layering
Brush layering consists of layers of vegetatively propagated plant cuttings placed crosswise
on 1 m deep terraces. The terraces are dug on a grade of 10°-30° to the horizontal across
the slope. Plant cuttings are then placed on the terrace and the lower three quarters of the
cutting lenoths are covered with soil. Brush layer terraces are spaced at I m intervals down
5            the slope, with the interval planted with grass slips.
Brush layering is recommended on fill slopes and other loose batters. It reinforces loose
surfaces, reducing surface failure. The cuttings develop into bushes rather than into trees
due to their angled planting, providing good vegetative cover whilst not significantly
I           loading the slope. They form a large volume of roots deep inside the slope in a short period.
Planting trees on steep slopes is not desirable because they add surcharge to the slope.
8.5 SPECIES SELECTION
Species shall be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation.
Cover Crop Species
A cover crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species shall
3            be used to rapidlv establish ground cover as soon as each batter is completed.
Millet should be broadcast at the rate of 25 kg/ha from March to August, whilst wheat or
another winter cereal should be broadcast from September to February. At least two species
of local grasses should be sown with the cover crop, with at least one species being
stoloniferous.
Permanent Vegetation Species
Perrnanent revegetation species have to be selected from the following species list Table 7
according to site elevation. A combination of 2-3 species of each vegetation type should be
used at each site as required under the recommended bio-engineering techniques.

9.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION COSTS
3               The cost of environmental mitigation measures has been estimated in Table 8.  No
allowance has been made for mitigation measures that are included in the standard road
designs, including drains, retaining walls and other standard road works. In addition, the
cost of the supervision of environrnental mitigation works by the Supervising Consultant
has also not been costed in this section as it is covered in the total cost of project

The total estimated cost of environmental mitigation measures in NRs 61.633,000.
The area of bio-engineering required along each road has been estimated by multiplying
batter areas for different slope class cross-sections by the associated raod lengths, except for
.,              Jajarkot where the total batter area was estimated.
The average cost per m2 of road batter to be bio-engineered was calculated by estimating the
based on extent of each of the recommended techniques along the proposed roads. The unit
rates for each technique are provided in Table 9. It is estimated that bio-engineering will
cost an average of NRs. 70/m2. This cost includes the maintenance of planting for 1 year (1
15%  allowance), which covers the replanting of areas or individual plants that have not
I1              survived due to normal conditions. The replanting of slides due to slope instability is not
included in this estimate.

The number of standpipes required has been estimated at one standpipe per 2 km  of
settlement/cultivation land use along each road. The distance of settlement or cultivation
crossed provides a good indication of the number of water supply lines that will be cut.
The number of trail steps that need to be constructed has been estimated for each road based
on the number of significant trails that cross the proposed road and will continue to be used
following road construction.
The number of major irrigation and drainage channels requiring reconnection by either
pipes or channel reconstruction has been estimated by doubling the number of these features
recorded in the 15 m wide ROW  during the field survey.
9.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT COSTS
The costs estimates of environmental improvements proposed in Section 7 are summarised
in Table 10. The total estimated cost of environmental improvements is NRs 10,914,000.

APPENDIX 3: Bio-engineering Application Methods
This section describes the planting and construction methods for the proposed bio-
engineering vegetative structures.  Planting and construction shall be undertaken as
indicated in the attached drawings or as directed by the Site Engineer.
X            1. Edge Cutting
a)  Mark the distance to be cut from the upsper slope edge (about 2 m).
;--Ih           b)  Start cutting the edge at an angle of about ,0° until the mark is reached.
c)  Deposit the soil at the base of the slope, forming a 300 slope.
2. Grass Planting
Grass planting shall be carried out when the ground is moist.
rj 1a)  Trim offthe long roots and shoots in excess of 10 cm from the grass slips.
b)  Make planting holes in the ground, just big enough to fit the roots without bending
them. Holes can be made using a stick.
c)  Plant the slips in the holes, pressing from both sides to compact the soil.
3. Tree Planting
a)  Diga30cmx30cmx30cmpit.
b)  Cut the poly tube on two sides along its length using a razor blade, without
removing the poly tube.
c)  Place the plant into the pit.
d)  Backfill the pit with soil while holding the plant upright.
e)  Compact around the plant by foot.
f)   Water the plant within 2 hours.
4. Live Staking
a)  Take 2-3 cm diameter, 30 cm long cuttings from  healthy tree branches of
vegetatively propagated trees. Prepare cuttings using sharp knife so that the bark
U                    of the cutting is not damaged while cutting the branch. Cuttings shall be prepared
when the ground is moist for planting at the onset of the monsoon.
b)  Mark out the planting lines on the slope.
c)  Drive a crowbar to make the holes in the ground along the marked lines at
intervals of 1 m.
d)  Insert the cuttings into the holes and pack the surrounding soil by foot or with a
wooden tool.
..1



5. Palisades
a)  Mark out the lines to be planted.
b)  Using a pointed crowbar, make holes along the marked lines that are slightly
bigger than the cuttings and deep enough to take at least two thirds of their lengths.
c)  Place a cutting in each hole, burying two thirds of its lengcth then compact the hole.
d)  The tops of the protruding cuttings can be netted with Jafri to hold eroding soil.
6. Brush Fascines
a)  Mark the proposed fascine lines on the slope.
b)  Form the fascines by binding 6-18 month old cuttings into a 15-20 cm diameter
bundle.
c)  Dig a 5 m length of trench, place the fascines end to end in the trench, then
imrnediately backfill and compact the trench.
d)  Secure the fascines by hammering wooden or bamboo pegs on the lower side of
the fascines at 50 cm spacings.
e)  If possible, water the fascines to achieve a better contact between them and the fill
material.
7. Bolsters
a)  Excavate a trench on an angle of 1 0-30O to the contour, to a depth of 20 cm (a little
less than the diameter of the bolster).
b)  Lay the gabion bolster into the trench, ensuring good contact between the panel
and the bed of the trench.
c)  Fill the panel with stones no bigger than 20 cm diameter.
d)  Bend the top wire flap over and secure it with pegs.
e)  Backfill over the bolster and compact it.
f)  Fix the bolster by driving 12 mm diarneter iron bars at right angles to the slope at 2
m spacings.
8. Rip Rap
a)  M;lark out a 1.2 m wide channel in the depression.
b)  Dig a 20 cm foundation at the base of the depression for laying the stone into.
c) Place stones in a stair configuration starting at the bottom and continuing uphill.
Lay the stones in a concave formation so that water will run down the middle of
the rip rap. Secure the stones by driving wooden pegs in at 2 m intervals or as
directed by the Site Engineer.
d)  Fill the gaps between the stones with dirt and small stones and make sure the
stones do not move.
e)  At the point of bifurcation ensure that the rip rap branches out at about 600 from
the main channel.
f)  Place brush fascines on both sides of the rip rap and cover with soil.



9. Brush Layering
a)   Dig a 1 m wide terrace with an inward slope of 10-30°, 1 m above base of the
slope.
b)   Place a layer of cuttings crosswise on the terrace, leaving about one fourth the
cutting lengths sticking out of the ground.
c)   Construct the second terrace, as in (a), 1 m above the first terrace.  Use the
excavated soil from this terrace to cover the brush layer on the first terrace until
the original batter slope is formed.
e)   Continue step (c) up the slope.
