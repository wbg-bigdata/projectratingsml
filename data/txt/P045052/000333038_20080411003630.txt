                              F. RESULTS FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

1.      The original project development objectives (PDOs) as outlined in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) were to:

(i)     achieve sustainable maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction of economically
        justifiable roads in the strategic road network (SRN) within the Priority Investment Plan
        (PIP) framework;
(ii)    improve access to district headquarters not currently served by road, and reduce vehicle
        transport costs, and delays in project areas;
(iii)   promote more sustainable funding and more efficient public sector management of road
        maintenance;
(iv)    adopt and disseminate environmentally sustainable road construction and maintenance
        practices; and
(v)     generate rural employment through adoption of labor-based technologies and long-term
        employment for the additional generated economic activity.

2.      According to the PAD, success of the project was to be monitored by the following set of
performance indicators:

(i)     Share of population provided with basic motorized access increases in the project
        districts;
(ii)    Number of person-days of employment created in the project districts;




                                                  ii

(iii)   Overall maintenance allocation as per agreed project covenants and road user share
        increase as per agreed plan between Roads Board Nepal (RBN) and Ministry of Works
        and Transport/Department of Roads (DoR);
(iv)    Maintenance allocations for both Strategic and District networks made available in time
        and in sufficient amounts, as outlined in the Credit Agreement;
(v)     Allocations actually and efficiently used for the planned purpose;
(vi)    RBN and Fund established, regulations approved, annual programs implemented and
        audited;
(vii)   Average travel time reductions and transport cost reductions achieved as per appraisal
        estimates;
(viii)  Detailed technical, social and environmental and economic feasibility studies to be
        carried out as part of project preparation and followed;
(ix)    Share of strategic network in poor condition reduced to 20%;
(x)     Reduced unit costs for works by type of road and activities;
(xi)    Improved average road condition and quality of road works;
(xii)   Reduced throughput time for procurement decisions;
(xiii)  Environmentally sound, low cost construction and methods becoming standardized
        approach within DoR;
(xiv)   DoR human resources development policy and strategy, staff development program and
        training plans in place and being implemented;
(xv)    Annual in-country short-term courses, overseas short-term courses/study tours, and in-
        service courses implemented;
(xvi)   Annual in-country training, overseas short courses on Project Management Reporting and
        procurement for staff in Ministry of Finance (MoF), Office of the Auditor General
        (OAG), Financial Comptroller General's Office (FCGO) and Ministry of Law and Justice
        (MLJ);
(xvii)  Systems and procedures for preparation of environmental and social assessments and
        action plans in place;
(xviii) EMAPs and RAP being prepared and implemented;
(xix)   Marketing program for commercialization of DoR's mechanical training operations
        prepared and being implemented; and
(xx)    Annual training of equipment operators, mechanics/electricians and supervisors.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

3.      The PDOs were not revised, but reworded in 2004, because the original wording of the
PDOs was found to be overly complex and tended to mix project outputs with the PDOs. This
was recognized as a minor restructuring and, thus, the project did not go to the Board for approval,
but was approved by the Regional Vice President in accordance with South Asia Procedures for
Portfolio Management on April 5, 2004. The PDO became "to provide sustainable and efficient
road service on the Strategic Road Network". The rewording of the PDOs did not affect changes
in expected outcomes and benefits. During that project restructuring the number of performance
indicators was reduced to reflect amendments to the project components and to more effectively
monitor the project progress.

                 1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1      Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. The project was prepared at a time when Nepal was undergoing frequent changes in government
and political unrest, notably a Maoist insurgency, which was on the rise. Since the 1994 parliamentary
election, there has been a series of shifting coalitions, with no government able to last more than a year
and a half, and many much less. Development programs suffered as key decisions were not made on time
or not adequately implemented and GDP per capita fell in 1998 for the first time in a decade. In 1998 the
fifth Government, in less than four years, was making an increased effort to control the Maoist insurgency
that was threatening development efforts in a number of districts.

1.1.2. In 1998 over nine million (40%) of the population were below the poverty line with most living
in rural areas. The 1995-96 Living Standards Measurement Study revealed that the rural poor lived on
average more than five hours away from the nearest dirt road. The lack of transport infrastructure ­ rural
roads in particular1 ­ constrained the potential for agriculture, as it resulted in an increase in the cost of
inputs and a reduction in the value of marketable outputs. The country has a difficult topography with
mountains and rugged hills covering 75% of its land area, which makes road engineering unusually
challenging and contributes to very high unit costs. Nepal under funded its road maintenance
requirements for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and as a result its road network deteriorated, requiring
costly rehabilitation and reconstruction. Most projects supported by government and its development
partners in the 1990s focused on getting the existing network to a maintainable condition in order to
reduce transport costs and prevent the road network from becoming a drag on economic growth. Yet,
while the focus on maintenance and rehabilitation was critical and the correct strategy at that time, it had
the effect of keeping resources away from the much needed network expansion to remote parts of Nepal,
which delayed bringing economic opportunities and services to these isolated communities.

1.1.3. A 10-year sector investment strategy for the road sector had been developed during the
preparation of the Priority Investment Plan (PIP) in 1997, which became the road master plan and called
for a balanced investment in rehabilitation and maintenance of existing assets complemented with cost-
effective and environmentally sound construction and maintenance approaches for feeder roads. The
Road Maintenance and Development Project (RMDP) was designed to provide assistance in the
implementation of Nepal's road sector strategy by addressing such main sector issues as (i) road
management and finance; (ii) road maintenance; (iii) decentralization of responsibilities for village and
district roads; and (iv) community participation to ensure sustainability of the newly-built roads. The
project also sought to contribute to poverty reduction in rural areas by improving rural access (about
500,000 beneficiaries) in remote hill areas of the Western, Mid-Western and Far Western regions, which
had an over-representation of Nepal's poor.




1        In 1998 Nepal's road network was about 15,000 km (including rural roads). Road density was 0.6 km per
         1,000 people in Nepal, compared to 1.6 in Pakistan, 1.7 in Bangladesh and 2.5 in India (based on the World
         Bank Development Indicators for 1998).

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1. The original PDO as outlined in the PAD consisted of five parts:

(i)    achieve sustainable maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction of economically justifiable
       roads in SRN within the PIP framework;
(ii)   improve access to district headquarters not currently served by road, and reduce vehicle transport
       costs, and delays in project areas;
(iii)  promote more sustainable funding and more efficient public sector management of road
       maintenance;
(iv)   adopt and disseminate environmentally sustainable road construction and maintenance practices;
       and
(v)    generate rural employment through adoption of labor-based technologies and long-term
       employment for the additional generated economic activity.

1.2.2. The original PDOs were to be monitored by a long list of performance indicators:

·      Share of population provided with basic motorized access increases in the project districts;
·      Number of person-days of employment created in the project districts;
·      Overall maintenance allocation as per agreed project covenants and road user share increase as
       per agreed plan between RBN and Ministry of Works and Transport/DoR;

       procurement for staff in Ministry of Finance, Office of the Auditor General, Financial Controller
       General's Office and Ministry of Law and Justice;
·      Systems and procedures for preparation of environmental and social assessments and action plans
       in place;
·      Environmental Management Action Plans (EMAPs) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) being
       prepared and implemented;

1.3     Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority),
        and Reasons/Justification

1.3.1. The PDOs were reworded in 2004 to consolidate the original PDOs, which were found overly
complex and tended to mix project outputs with the PDO. This was recognized as a minor restructuring
and thus the project did not go to the Board for approval but was approved by the Regional Vice President
in accordance with South Asia Procedures for Portfolio Management on April 5, 2004. The PDO became
"to provide sustainable and efficient road service on the Strategic Road Network". The rewording of the
PDOs did not affect changes in expected outcomes and benefits.

1.3.2. During the restructuring in 2004, the number of performance indicators was reduced to reflect
changes in the project components and to more effectively monitor the project progress. The amended
indicators comprised:

(i)     Share of the SRN in bad condition2 reduced to 20% by EoP;
(ii)    Ex-post economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for major road works is on average 12% by EoP;
(iii)   Legal Framework for Road Fund established and becomes operational: Roads Board and a
        sustainable road maintenance fund to be established;
(iv)    Improved efficiency and effectiveness in public sector management of road investments: Medium
        Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) used to prioritize and allocate investment in the road
        sector;
(v)     Reduced backlog of rehabilitation and implementation of sustainable maintenance on strategic
        network: Periodic maintenance of 676 km; rehabilitation of 258 km and upgrading of 125 km of
        earth roads and 141 km of gravel roads to bituminous seal;
(vi)    Improved Institutional Capacity in DoR: DoR human resources development (HRD) policy and
        strategy, staff development and training plans in place and being implemented, IT facilities set up,
        Institutional Development Strategy for DoR to operate in a corporate manner developed by EoP.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1. The primary target group as outlined in the PAD included road users and the rural population in
six districts ­ Darchula, Achham, Kalikot, Jumla, Jajarkot and Bajura, that would benefit from lower
freight and passenger transport costs, with resulting benefits in reduced fares, prices of goods, and better
accessibility to district headquarters. As a result of the two minor restructurings in 2003 and 2004, the
construction of new roads was cancelled in the districts of Darchula, Jumla, Jajarkot and Bajura, where
blasting operations were restricted and not possible due to the worsening security problem. While this
reduced the number of potential beneficiaries in these particular districts, the total rural population who
benefited from the project increased because the restructurings made the project more flexible and
targeted the improvement of road accessibility (through upgrading, and construction of community roads)
in other areas where blasting were not required for civil works.

1.4.2. Other beneficiaries of the project included the staff of DoR, an institution which was then in a
transitional stage from a traditional, public sector organization moving towards a modern road agency.
The restructuring in 2004 placed even greater emphasis on developing the institutional capacity of DoR to
deliver higher standard services within the road sector.




2       The criterion for roads in bad condition is IRI>8m/km.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1. Originally, the project had five components:

(a)     Policy reform to setup the Roads Board Nepal (RBN), amend regulatory framework and develop
        the Road Fund (US$0.40 million). This component was expected to finance consulting services
        and technical assistance required by the Implementation Committee and RBN once established,
        study tours to functional Road Funds elsewhere for key decision makers, support to private sector
        capacity building activities lead by the RBN, and office equipment support for the RBN.

(b)     New Road Construction and Upgrading Component (NRDUC) (US$45.8 million). This
        component targeted construction of dry-weather feeder road construction (197 km) and upgrading
        to gravel standard (253 km), and also intended to support resettlement assistance, environmental
        monitoring, and technical assistance for design, project coordination and construction supervision,
        and civil works for improvements to training and office facilities.

(c)     Rehabilitation of 160 km of strategic highway and feeder road network (US$6.8 million). This
        component targeted rehabilitation of three priority roads of SRN ­ Tansen-Syangja, Tansen-
        Tamghas and Kothi ­Taulihwa road.

(d)     Periodic maintenance of strategic roads (470 km) (US$6.60 million). This component was
        expected to finance periodic maintenance of 470 km on SRN comprising national highways and
        inter-district feeder roads in various parts of the country.

(e)     Institutional strengthening and training (US$4.8 million). This component intended to support
        consulting services for institutional strengthening/training of DoR and third party operational
        audits of works, five-year training and HRD for DoR, and Ministry of Works and Transport,
        equipment for office modernization, equipment for training and pre-investment and socio-
        economic impact of road construction studies.

1.6     Revised Components

1.6.1. Due to the intensifying security situation in the country, which severely affected implementation
within the original scope and objective of the project, a minor restructuring of the project took place in
February 2004. It led to the cancellation of the construction of new roads under the NRDUC and addition
of two new components which were not threatened by the security problem:

·       Community road works (45 km); and
·       Emergency repair of flood damaged roads (36 km).

1.6.2. Additional adjustments were made to the scope and scale of other components, which are
        described in detail in section 1.7.

1.7     Other Significant Changes

1.7.1. During implementation, the project had to undergo two minor restructurings to adapt to the
changing country conditions. Specifically, the intensifying insurgency which disrupted civil works in the
project areas and a public sector budget crisis in the country which affected the Borrower's funding share
of the project and stable and adequate financing of road maintenance. The first restructuring was in 2003
and was approved by the Country Director; the second one was in 2004 and was approved by the
Regional Vice President in accordance with the South Asia Regional Procedures for Portfolio



                                                       4

Management. The most significant changes made in these two restructurings included: (i) changes in the
scale and scope of works in different components; (ii) increase in IDA's share of funding (during the first
restructuring); and (iii) reallocation of unspent funds from the cancelled activities to components which
could be implemented successfully but had been under-funded due to public sector budget crisis.

1.7.2. The Credit closing date of the project was extended twice and approved by the Regional Vice
President. During the second restructuring, it was extended by 24 months from December 31, 2004 to
December 31, 2006 to complete the increased scope of work, which had been added in the first
restructuring. The Credit closing date was extended for the second time by six months from December 31,
2006 to June 30, 2007 to complete the remaining works which had been disrupted during the intensified
conflict and ensuing political disturbances in 2005 and early 2006.

1.7.3. First Restructuring. The mid-term review (MTR) carried out in November 2002 recommended a
minor restructuring due to the prevailing security situation and public sector budgetary constraints. While
the PDO and components remained the same, adjustments were made to the scale and scope of works
under the following components:

(a)      NRDUC: carrying out of (i) construction work of 50 km of dry-weather feeder roads (versus 197
         km planned at appraisal) to provide motorable road access to two district headquarters (versus
         five as planned) EoP; and (ii) upgrading of about 200 km of existing earth roads (versus 253 km
         planned at appraisal) to gravel standards to connect one district and improve access in two other
         districts by EoP (same as the original targets). The construction of new roads was dropped in
         three districts ­ Jumla, Jajarkot and Bajura ­ where DoR was unable to arrange blasting
         operations and prepare the sites for private contractors to undertake civil works due to the
         ongoing insurgency in these project areas.

(b)      Road Rehabilitation Component: expanding the component to include financing of high priority
         rehabilitation works on 227.7 km (versus 160 km planned at appraisal) of SRN. The additional
         scope of work envisaged rehabilitation of another 86 km of gravel roads to bituminous standard,
         and provision of otta seal to 144 km of rehabilitated gravel roads mostly in environmentally
         sensitive hill areas, where light bituminous surfacing helps reduce erosion and cuts down on
         maintenance costs.

(c)      Periodic Maintenance Component: Implementation of (i) periodic maintenance of about 650 km
         of the strategic highway and feeder road network (versus 470 km planned at appraisal), and (ii)
         support of DoR's annual routine and regular maintenance for about 2,700 km of strategic
         highway and feeder road network in FY2002-2003 and about 1,500 km in FY2003-2004 as well
         as emergency maintenance, which would enable the DoR to meet urgent maintenance needs until
         the Road Fund was capable of fully financing the maintenance requirements by FY2004-2005.

1.7.4. During the first restructuring IDA's financing share of civil works was increased from 80% to
85%, because the public sector faced a budgetary crisis and was incapable of meeting its counterpart
funding requirements. As a result of the cancellation of several contracts under the NRDUC, the
uncommitted funds from this component were distributed to the maintenance, rehabilitation and
institutional strengthening components, which were progressing satisfactorily (Table 1).

1.7.5. Second restructuring. During the second restructuring in 2004, the following adjustments in terms
of scope and scale of works were made to the components:

(a)      NRDUC: carrying out of (i) construction work of 50 km of dry-weather feeder roads (versus 197
         km planned at appraisal) to provide motorable road access to two district headquarters (versus
         five as planned) by EoP; and (ii) upgrading of about 213 km of existing earth roads (versus 253
         km planned at appraisal) to gravel standards to connect one district and improve access in two
         other districts (same as the original targets) by EoP.

(b)      Road Rehabilitation Component: carrying out of: (i) rehabilitation work to about 248 km of the
         strategic highway and feeder road network (versus 160 km planned at appraisal); (ii) upgrading
         work to about 125 km of feeder roads to bituminous standard; and (iii) provision of bituminous
         seal to about 141 km of rehabilitated gravel roads.

(c)      Periodic Maintenance Component: implementation of (i) periodic maintenance of about 676 km
         of the strategic highway and feeder road network (versus 470 km planned at appraisal); (ii)
         performance-based maintenance of about 114 km of strategic highway; and (iii) routine and
         regular maintenance of strategic highway and feeder road network as well as emergency
         maintenance.

1.7.6. During the second restructuring, savings from the cancelled activities under NRDUC were
reallocated to the other project components, which were progressing satisfactorily but were under-funded
due to the public sector's budget constraints. Table 2 provides the allocations planned at appraisal and the
revised allocations by component-wise in 2004:

                   2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1. Background Analysis, Preparation and Design. This project followed on from a previous Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project and the lessons learned from that operation were reflected in the
design of this project. In particular, the project design took into account the importance of continued
support to develop capacity within DoR, and bolster local capacities in environmental assessment, geo-
technical survey and bio-engineering. Other lessons taken into consideration revolved around (i) the
comprehensive preparation of environmental, social and institutional aspects of the project involving local
participation; (ii) strengthening of basic institutional capacities for effective project management in the
early life of the project; (iii) bolstering of procurement capabilities from the project design, with initial
contracts based on completed designs, strict qualification criteria and awards planned before project
effectiveness; and (iv) timely availability of project sites before handing over to contractors.

2.1.2. Participatory Processes. The project used a participatory approach to involve beneficiaries and
other stakeholders in consultations on environmental and social aspects, and preparation of the policy
reform component. In addition, continuous engagement on policy reform was planned with stakeholders,
including the private sector, public sector representatives and major donors. The selection process for the
new roads, implementation of civil and other community works and monitoring and evaluation activities
also engaged local communities through involvement with District and Village Development Committees.
While the team planned at appraisal to pursue user and community participation to the fullest extent
possible both for information dissemination purposes and generation of strategic network ownership, it
recognized that community participation in SRN would be more difficult than participation in district or
village roads where ownership and benefits of participation are more keenly felt.

2.1.3. Risks and Mitigation Measures. The majority of identified risks focused on the delay in either
delivery of the physical infrastructure (due to weak institutional and contractor capacity) or the enabling
policy environment. The identified mitigation means for these risks were well thought through and
utilized previous experience although in the early years of the project these risks were considered causes
for delays in delivery. The possibility of the intensifying civil conflict, despite the fact that two of the
project districts ­ Jajarkot and Kalikot ­ were controlled by the Maoists at the time of project appraisal
and the potential impact of inflexible project design on implementation, were not considered likely during
project preparation. Both subsequently contributed to delays incurred and extension of the project
duration.

2.1.4. Quality at Entry Assessment. A quality at entry assessment of the project carried out by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in January 2000 rated quality at entry as "Highly Satisfactory". It
commended the project team for incorporating the sector experience and lessons from previous operations
in the project approach and design, adequate analysis and treatment of environmental impacts, public
consultations on the environmental aspect, addressing the financial management aspects in a clear,



                                                            7

practical and common sense manner and others. However, the quality at supervision assessment of the
project conducted on August 23, 2004 noticed that the Quality at Entry Assessment Panel had failed to
note that the detailed design had been based on computerized modeling rather than field surveys. During
implementation, it became quickly apparent that this approach was inappropriate for the country's
extremely difficult terrain and the resulting need to rework the tender documents entailed considerable
delays. Furthermore, the appraisal team and the Quality at Entry Assessment Panel had failed to consider
the deteriorating security situation that had been already prevailing at the time of appraisal as a risk,
although the Bank management had recognized the threat of the Maoists insurgency to development
efforts in the Country Assistance Strategy for Nepal, 1999-2002, issued in 1998. The Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) team concurs with the Quality of Supervision Assessment Panel's
comments and in addition, considers that the original PDOs, although relevant and responsive to the
country's development priorities, were too complex and ambitious for the Borrower to achieve under the
then prevailing circumstances in the country.

2.2     Implementation

2.2.1   Implementation was satisfactory in the first year of the projects but right before the MTR - in
2001- 2002 - it was downgraded to unsatisfactory due to lack of progress in NRDUC, which comprised
69% of the original project cost estimate. The first restructuring after the MTR led to short-term
improvements but the project was soon again downgraded to unsatisfactory. The second restructuring in
2004 enabled significant improvement in implementation and the project remained satisfactory until its
closure. The following were the main factors that affected implementation in the project life:

(a)     Deteriorating Security Situation. The Maoist insurgency in Nepal entailed unprecedented security
        problems in some of the project districts especially those under Maoist control. This made it
        difficult for contractors and consultants to execute new construction works and supervision, for
        NGOs to monitor implementation of social safeguards and for DoR to arrange blasting operations,
        monitor the performance of cost centers, implement environmental safeguard provisions and
        carry out overall project supervision. Nineteen new road construction contracts were terminated
        due to the poor security situation.

(b)     Unstable Political Environment and High Political Influence. Frequent changes at high levels of
        government contributed to delays in the creation of RBN. Originally planned for December 2001,
        it became fully operational at the end of 2003. However, once in operation this organization also
        failed to achieve the objective of raising and managing funds for road maintenance due to
        political interference in RBN's decision making. The Board is dominated by political
        representatives and chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works
        (MPPW) who also has responsibility for the Department of Roads. This undermines a central
        pillar of efficient Road Fund Boards: independence from public sector road departments. The
        IDA team conducted an assessment of RBN's performance in 2005 and its recommendations
        have been incorporated in a draft amendment to the Roads Board Act, which is under review by
        the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs for subsequent cabinet approval. In the
        meantime, an administrative fiat has been approved providing temporary measures for the Board
        to function more efficiently until the amendments to the Act are approved by the Parliament.

(c)     Budgetary Constraints. The budget crisis faced by the public sector adversely affected the
        outcome of the PDOs and compliance with policy-related legal covenants. The allocation for
        maintenance of the SRN, which was half the amount planned at appraisal, was not transferred to
        DoR. As a result of the insufficient funding, maintenance works were stopped, which posed a
        threat to the sustainability of the country's road assets and provision of the only access to many
        parts of the country. This issue was resolved through increasing IDA's share of the project


                                                      8

         funding and reallocating of some funds from the project activities which were cancelled during
         the first restructuring. Ongoing negotiations between the World Bank and MPPW have secured a
         number of important changes to prevent similar problems in the future including consolidating
         maintenance funds through RBN and more guaranteed level of funds in the follow-up Road
         Sector Development Project (RSDP) which was approved in December 2007.

(d)      Geotechnical Problems of the Project Roads. While the engineering and procurement documents
         for the first year's activities were completed by appraisal, it turned out that engineering design
         which, at the request of Borrower had utilized computer-aided design, was insufficient to account
         for all local conditions and provided poor drainage design. Specifically as a result of insufficient
         data, the design included an alignment which significantly underestimated the level of rock
         cutting and earthworks required.

(e)      Close Collaboration between the Nepali and IDA Project Teams. The high commitment of the
         Borrower and pro-active response of the IDA supervision team as well as the long and positive
         relationship between IDA and the client entailed close collaboration of the combined team and
         was key to the prompt and timely restructurings of the project. The combined project team was
         able to properly identify relevant issues and find feasible solutions to react to emerging
         circumstances and restructure deliverables in a positive way.

2.2.2    Quality at Supervision Assessment. QAG rated the supervision of the project as satisfactory and
praised the task team for taking a flexible approach in readjusting the project's components to elements
that had a chance of being implemented despite the ongoing insurgency in the country. QAG accepted the
project restructuring in 2004 as a formal change. The supervision team was also commended on the
thorough job of the project restructuring and re-formulation of the development objectives, which QAG
then assessed as more realistic and with a better likelihood of being achieved. However, while it found
Financial Management supervision highly satisfactory and responsive to the minor project restructuring
undertaken during the MTR and the restructuring in 2004, it noted that a more pro-active supervision in
assessing the issues of out-migration could have improved compliance with the Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) conditions.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. Overall monitoring and evaluation was the responsibility of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
in DoR.     It has been generally rated satisfactory by supervision missions. The effectiveness of
maintenance programs was monitored throughout the project to assess the quality of civil works, effective
life of various treatments, and overall changes in road asset conditions. The monitoring program included
an annual survey of road and visual condition rating on at least 50% of SRN, and dissemination of the
results available in a public Road Condition Report. In addition, the PCU also arranged project benefit
monitoring and evaluation surveys of select roads to assess socio-economic impact of roads which were
upgraded and built involving local communities.

2.3.2. The original project identified too many performance indicators, and their number was reduced
during the second restructuring in 2004 to reflect the changes in the project components and more
effectively monitor the project progress. The indicators chosen were well established and the unit has
been able to measure outputs easily. While the overall capacity of the DoR to undertake such monitoring
and the effective use of these tools has improved over the course of the project, DoR needs to improve its
approach to collecting consistent data relevant to socio-economic impacts of road projects and analyzing
and storing them for further use.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards Compliance is rated moderately satisfactory

2.4.1. Environmental Aspects. The project was classified as Environmental Category A at appraisal,
because it planned the construction of five new roads and upgrading of three roads. In this regard, a
detailed Environmental Impact assessment (EIA) was carried out in compliance with Nepal's legal
requirements (Environmental Protection Regulations 2054) and the Bank's Guidelines and Operations
Policy, Good Practice, and Best Practice 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. A screening and scoping
exercise was undertaken to inform the stakeholders, including local residents and officials, about the
proposed project, receive their comments and identify priority environmental issues for assessment.
Scoping was required and constitutes a good practice in EIAs to help focus on priority environmental
issues.

2.4.2. The output of the EIA included an Environment Management Action Plan (EMAP), which
comprised a framework for implementation including institutional responsibility, management roles and
public participation, mitigation measures to be undertaken, including planning, design, pre-construction,
post construction, costs of mitigation, time frame and contractual clauses, environmental management
monitoring and reporting measures, and bio-engineering recommendations. In the early stages of project
implementation, the EMAP compliance was considered to be lacking due to poor contractor camp
facilities and poor environmental engineering design within the existing contracts. As implementing
parties built up their experience, it was improved resulting in an overall satisfactory rating. DoR plans to
build awareness on environmental issues by providing training on EMAP implementation to contractors
and including EMAP-related costs in the schedule of rates in order to ensure EMAP compliance by
contractors in future projects.

2.4.3. Social Aspects. A Social Assessment was carried out as part of project preparation and completed
in a timely and professional manner by project appraisal despite unrest and security constraints. It
covered new roads and roads subject to upgrading and consisted of: (i) early screening and social impact
assessment as part of project feasibility studies; (ii) public consultation; (iii) preparation of a project
specific resettlement and rehabilitation entitlement framework consistent with Government and Bank
policies; (iv) census and baseline socio-economic survey of the potentially affected population; and (v)
preparation of a time-bound RAP.

2.4.4. The social aspects of the project were rated unsatisfactory at different stages of the project
because the security situation hampered implementation of social safeguards. However, by the closure of
the project all social mitigation measures including compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation were
completed in compliance with the agreed RAP. The compensation disbursement is almost 100% of the
budgeted amount while all 103 families displaced have been provided with a resettlement allowance.
However, on the Jumla-Kalikot road, the ownership transfer of lands and properties compensated has
been completed for over 98% of land plots and only few cases are outstanding due to the absence of
owners (who moved out of the area during the insurgency and DoR cannot trace them), without whom
ownership transfer cannot be completed. Nevertheless, DoR will have annual budget allocated to make
payments for compensation claims from the remaining asset owners if required.

2.4.5. A key success factor of the satisfactory implementation of the safeguards was the support of the
Geo-Environmental and Social Unit (GESU) within DoR, which was established prior to appraisal with
the mandate to cover bio-engineering, geo-technical issues and environmental assessment. In November
2002 it was expanded to also cover the implementation of the social aspects. It ensured the adoption of an
Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for road projects under DoR's management
which enabled the closer supervision of contractors and provided a knowledge resource within DoR.


                                                    10

Fiduciary Compliance is rated satisfactory

2.4.6. Disbursement. In the early stages of implementation, the project observed some challenges,
including delays in reconciliation of accounts, lack of monitoring of expenses at the field level, slow
disbursement and delays in submission of financial management and audit reports. Much of this was
mainly due to the lack of qualified staff, as well as the inability of DoR headquarters staff being unable to
visit the field to monitor the cost-related accounts due to the growing threat of insurgency. After the
MTR, thanks to a training/orientation program on financial management for all managers, unit chiefs, and
accounts staff in all cost centers as well as increased monitoring of and guidance to costs centers staff,
DoR managed to improve the performance of financial management. That led to timely submission of
trimesterly project management reports. Audit reports did not include significant audit observations.
There are no outstanding audit reports.

2.4.7. Close collaboration between the technical and accounts teams in the DoR has also generated
significant improvements in the financial management system throughout the project. The DoR has
recently started introducing a computerized Financial Management Information System (FMIS) at the
DoR central office, which was developed under the Institutional Strengthening Component. A key to
success was application of a holistic approach to financial management that is harmonized and aligned
with the public sector's financial management system, instead of a project specific ring-fenced approach.
Following successful piloting at the central office in Kathmandu, DoR plans to extend the application of
the FMIS to other districts and build the capacity of costs centers in those districts in the follow-up RSDP
so that financial information from all DoR cost centers can be consolidated at the central office.

2.4.8. At closing, disbursements stood at SDR38.02 million or 95% against the original credit of
SDR40.10 million. The undisbursed balance of SDR2.08 million (US$3.30 million equivalent) was
cancelled as of November 20, 2007.

2.4.9. Procurement. Procurement of works, goods and services was carried out in accordance with Bank
guidelines, and the bidding processes were conducted in a fair and transparent manner. At the MTR stage,
it was noted that DoR was able to initiate and award contracts within five months demonstrating relatively
good efficiency. Throughout the project DoR performed their procurement role efficiently and proved
proficient in preparing tenders and evaluating bids. The procurement capacity assessment conducted by
IDA in 2007 also recognized that DoR is one of few organizations performing efficient procurement
functions in the country. However, several areas were recommended for improvement under the follow-
up RSDP, including procurement planning, conducting pre-bid meetings, evaluating bids (particularly
consultant's proposals), awarding and signing contracts, observing the code of ethics by the involved
personnel as mandated by the new Public Procurement Act, 2063 (2007) and administrating contracts.
DoR has agreed to establish a dedicated procurement unit staffed with skilled and trained personnel
during the process of implementing the new Procurement Law.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1. Operation and Maintenance. Operation and maintenance of the roads supported by RMDP is
provided by DoR either through in-house implementation or outsourcing of works to the private sector.
Funding of routine and regular maintenance is being provided by the public sector and channeled through
RBN. DoR is responsible for developing its maintenance strategy with implementation based on plans
submitted to RBN for approval and funding.




                                                      11

2.5.2. Follow-up Operation. Supported under RMDP, DoR prepared a new 10-year PIP for the road
sector covering 2007-2016, which outlines the road sections for upgrading and rehabilitation. From this
and in consultation with the Bank, a further project was approved in December 2007, which will enable
297 km of SRN to be improved to all season quality thus continuing to enhance accessibility along the
parameters designated by the authorities. In addition to the ongoing delivery of road improvements the
project will also continue strengthening capacity within the road sector institutions. However, some of
this is dependent on improved performance of RBN, which will need continued supervision and
monitoring.

                                    3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. Relevance of the PDOs. The PDOs remain relevant to Nepal's Tenth Plan and IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2002-2007 and Interim Strategy Note (ISN), February 2007. The Tenth
Plan, CAS and ISN emphasize improvement of SRN as one of the key development targets and, in
particular, give priority to support the development of the road infrastructure in rural areas as well as
maintenance of major roads and highways. The Tenth Plan for the road sector sets the following
outcomes: (i) sustainable road maintenance fund available in accordance with annual maintenance plan;
and (ii) road access increased to 70 districts (only 62 districts were connected with SRN at the time of
planning). The CAS outcomes focus on two key issues: (i) sustainable maintenance funding through
working with key donors to ensure roads are properly funded from fuel levies; operational RBN by
F20Y04; adequate maintenance budget by FY2006; and (ii) improved rural accessibility with the share of
population with close access to roads (half-day walk) increased by 4%, Government's focus on
accessibility and decentralized rural roads management and nationwide accessibility mapping by FY2005.
These objectives continue to be promoted through the ISN with maintaining the accessibility indicator
and reducing the amount of SRN in poor condition to 10%.

3.1.2. Relevance of Design and Implementation. Good governance and community participation are
both equally relevant as they are underscored in the Tenth Plan and CAS. The project supported the
improvement of governance in management of maintenance funds through the establishment of RBN with
the engagement of the private sector and road users. An independent oversight mechanism has been set up
by RBN to monitor the use of maintenance funds by DoR, Municipalities and District Development
Committees, which are now required to publish their maintenance plan and expenditure. The project also
promoted community participation through supporting the involvement of local villagers in the
community road works.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the PDOs is rated Moderately Satisfactory

3.2.1. The rating takes into account the fact that despite significant external factors out of government
control, namely the intensifying insurgency in the country and substantial political changes at the highest
levels, most of activities, which were planned at appraisal or added during the restructurings were
delivered by the project closure and the residents of the project areas benefited from improved road
accessibility. A rating of moderately satisfactory has been assigned due to the lack of improving
connectivity in three districts where the construction of new roads was cancelled due to the security
situation.




                                                    12

PDO Indicator 1: Share of SRN in bad condition reduced to 20% by EoP (Achieved)

3.2.2. The baseline road condition survey conducted prior to appraisal in FY1998-99 determined that
32% of SRN was in bad condition. During the second restructuring the target set for this indicator was to
reduce the share of SRN in bad condition to 20% by EoP. The road condition survey conducted after the
completion of the project found 18% of SRN in bad condition, which indicates that the target was
exceeded by 2 percentage points.

PDO Indicator 2: Ex-post EIRR for major road works is on average 12% by EoP (Achieved)

3.2.3. The economic analysis shows that ex-post EIRR is significantly above 12%, namely 60.5%, for
all completed major road works. More details are provided in Section 3.3 and Annex 3.

PDO Indicator 3: Legal Framework for RBN established and becomes operational (Partially Achieved)

3.2.4. The achievement of the target may be considered partially achieved. The legal framework has
been established and the RBN has become operational. The funds earmarked for maintenance come from
road user charges, fuel levy and direct public sector budget. Annual reports and information on resources
released to different public sector agencies are published on the RBN's website. However, the RBN still
lacks efficient operation and full autonomy. It is unable to generate adequate road maintenance funds due
to administrative and resource constraints. The fuel levy, which had not changed since the enactment of
the Act in January 2003, has just recently been increased. While a draft amendment to the Roads Board
Act is under review by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliament to improve the RBN's performance,
an administrative fiat has been approved providing temporary measures for the Board to function more
efficiently until the amendments to Act are approved by the Parliament.

PDO Indicator 4: Improved efficiency and effectiveness in public sector management of road
investments: Mid-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) used to prioritize and allocate investment in the
road sector (Partially Achieved)

3.2.5. During project implementation the fourth MTEF was developed to prioritize and allocate
investment in the road sector for FY2002-2003 ­ FY2006-2007. Prioritization was made on the basis of
the contribution that each road or bridge project would make to the main element of poverty reduction as
outlined in the Tenth Plan and other elements such as accelerating economic growth, provision of social
services and infrastructure, targeted program and good governance. While investment priorities for the
road sector were clearly identified in the MTEF, resource allocation and actual expenditure did not match
these priorities. The shortfall of resources amounted to about NRs.2.3 billion or 9% of the Tenth Plan
estimated budget. While some of the targets of the Tenth Plan for the road sector were exceeded during
the implementation of MTEF, some of them were not achieved (see Table 3) due to the political problems
and security situation prevailing in the country.

PDO Indicator 5: Reduced backlog of rehabilitation and implementation of sustainable maintenance on
strategic network (Almost Achieved)

3.2.6. The latest road condition survey conducted in FY2006-2007 reported that 82% of the SRN is in
good and fair condition based on Surface Distress Index. Backlog in rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance of the SRN has been reduced with completion of periodic maintenance on 661 km (against
the revised target of 676 km; completion of works on the remaining 15 km is delayed due to the recent
problems in the terai), rehabilitation on 248 km (same as the revised target), and upgrading of 111 km of
earth roads (against the revised target of 125 km) to gravel standard and of 141 km of gravel roads (same
as revised target) to otta seal standard.

PDO Indicator 6: Improved Institutional Capacity in DoR (Achieved)

3.2.7. The activities planned under the Institutional Strengthening Component have been completed,
including some additional activities for the modernization of DoR to ensure improved service delivery in
various core and supporting functions and operation in a corporate manner. The PIP for 2007-2016,
Institutional Development Strategy for 10 years, DoR human resources development (HRD) policy and
strategy, staff development and training plans, ESMF, Quality Assurance System have been developed
and are in place. Training in EMAPs, bio-engineering, procurement, financial management, performance-
based contracting of maintenance works and others have been delivered. Workshops aimed at sensitizing
managers on HRD were conducted and the Road Sector Skill Development Unit staff have been trained in
various aspects of training management. The component has also supported building monitoring and
evaluation and technical audit capacities within DoR and preparing several technical handbooks, design
guidelines and standards. Information and Technology (IT) facilities, except for a few software modules,
have been set up to strengthen DoR's capacity in financial management, personnel management, road
planning and management, and other functions (see Section 3.5.b).

3.3      Efficiency

Efficiency in achieving the project objectives in terms of EIRR is satisfactory.

3.3.1. The ex-post economic evaluation was carried out using the Highway Development and
Management Model (HDM-IV) Version 2.0 that estimates project benefits in terms of reduction in road
user costs (vehicle operating costs plus passenger time costs) based on assumptions as to road conditions
before and after investment and based against a "do minimum" scenario of basic maintenance and
rehabilitation. The detailed economic analysis is given in Annex 3.




                                                       14

3.3.2. The satisfactory rating has been assigned because direct comparison between the analysis
completed at appraisal and the completed project is not possible. This is owing to the major change in
project which included not only physical location but also levels of intervention and technology employed.
The EIRR for the project given in the PAD was 28.2%. The ex-post EIRR is 46% (Table 4).

3.3.3. The main reason of higher than anticipated EIRR for the rehabilitation component is the
introduction of innovative otta seal technology for rehabilitation and upgrading of gravel roads, which has
brought about a technical revolution in Nepal's road sector. In addition to its other benefits (e.g.,
protection of substantial annual gravel washouts in hill roads during monsoon, dust free environment,
smooth driving leading to reduction in travel time), it is found to be cost efficient as it allows saving in
frequent gravelling costs.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1. The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory given the relevance and efficiency of the
revised project, achievement of the revised PDO. The project remains highly relevant to GoN's and
CAS's priorities. While the original PDOs were not achieved, the revised PDO was achieved through
improved road sector maintenance funding from road user fees, improved resource allocation by
implementing a MTEF for SRN, strengthened capacity of DoR and improved condition of SRN. The
project has demonstrated its economic efficiency as its actual average EIRR of 46% at the project
completion exceeded the estimated at appraisal EIRR of 28.2%.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1   The upgrading and community works components have contributed to improvement in
livelihoods of the residents through better road accessibility. Detailed findings of the project benefit
monitoring and evaluation on several sample roads are presented in Annex 5.

3.5.2   Positive impacts have been recorded on Gorushinghe-Sandhikhara road (upgraded to bituminous
standards) where residents living along this road have experienced:

·       Reduction in Transport Costs. Passenger fares have decreased by 31%, and the freight rate by
        66% compared to the pre-project situation. However, it is difficult to completely attribute this
        benefit to the improved road conditions as a result of the upgrading works, because there have
        been other factors affecting changes in transport costs, in particular: (i) regulation of bus fares by
        the Department of Transport Management (DoTM) of the Ministry of Labor and Transport; and
        (ii) decline in freight rates due to the increased competition between trucks and mini-trucks;
·       Reduction in Travel Time. Travel time by bus from Sandhikhara to Gorushinghe has been reduced
        from 8 to 3.5 hours;
·       Decline in Price Commodities. Prices for many commodities have fallen, e.g., by 29% for rice,
        28% for flour, 25% for sugar, 12.5% for cooking oil, 17% for vegetable ghee, as well as for
        construction materials, e.g., 46% for cement, 22% for corrugated galvanized iron sheet and 21%
        for reinforcement bar;
·       Growth of Food Supply. As a result of the improved road accessibility, many new shops and
        businesses have emerged along this road corridor, which have led to an increase in supplies of
        food and other merchandise;
·       Increase in School Enrollment. School enrollment has increased by 41% (29% for boys and 59%
        for girls) along this road corridor; and
·       Improved Health Care Practices by the Local Residents. As communication has expanded outside
        their communities, people have increased awareness of hygiene and sanitation. Thanks to the
        availability of transport services, visits to health centers and health posts have become more
        frequent, and reduced prices for soap and other sanitary products have encouraged greater use and
        more households have sanitation.

3.5.3. The main benefits of the community works component, which was added during the 2004
restructuring, include the following:

·       Generation of short-term employment. Local people from lower social and economic strata were
        involved in the construction of the 36 km Jumla feeder road in Kalikot district. As a result, 73
        community-based organizations were formed, which employed as semi-skilled and unskilled
        laborers about 130,000 local men and women from Dalits and indigenous groups living along this
        road corridor.
·       Increased use of modern technologies. With their increased mobility, local residents have been
        able to find out about modern technologies used outside their communities. As a result, many of
        them have installed solar power technology in their homes and now have electricity to run radio
        and television.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4. The project made a substantial effort to strengthen institutional capacity of the DoR at the central
and field levels through supporting a large number of activities and development of various strategies and
policies. Some of the most significant institutional achievements which have had impacts on longer-term
capacity are:

(i)     Management of the Road Sub-sector in Nepal. Two important strategic documents were prepared
        that will have a long-term impact not only on the institutional aspects of DoR but also Nepal's
        road sub-sector; specifically: (i) Institutional Position Paper; and (ii) Institutional Strengthening
        and Organizational Reform Action Plan for 2007-2016. The Institutional Position Paper outlines
        in detail the institutional arrangements that are needed to ensure the effective and efficient
        management of Nepal's SRN. The Action Plan was designed to provide an overarching
        institutional reform framework for the evolution of DoR towards a National Road Authority in
        the next 10 years. The Bank-financed follow-up RSDP will support the implementation of this
        Plan.

(ii)    Environmental and Social Management Capacity. DoR's GEU was expanded to cover the
        responsibilities for preparing and monitoring social impact assessments and resettlement and
        RAP for road projects. GESU has developed ESMF, which is being mainstreamed in all road
        projects under DoR's management. The follow-up RSDP will continue supporting this.

(iii)   Use of IT in Planning and Management. DoR has made significant improvements in its IT
        capacity through development, use and training of its staff in the application of 16 computer
        information systems. These information systems have not been simply developed and installed,
        but are being used by DoR in planning and management activities. The maintenance strategy was
        developed based on the analysis of the existing and committed SRN using the HDM-IV model,
        which enabled DoR to assess and evaluate alternative scenarios and determine the optimal
        approach. FMIS introduced at the central level of DoR has replaced a manual system and allowed
        shifting the focus from manual to computerized transactions and enables timely and accurate
        financial management and reporting. It is to be expanded to field divisions under the follow-up
        project. Other information systems that have been developed, introduced and are being applied by
        DoR, including road network database, asset management, program and budget, road related law
        database, procurement management, dispute resolution, personnel management, land
        compensation and others.


                       4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

4.1.    A moderate risk rating is based on the fact that while the PIP framework, which is essentially a
road master plan for Nepal, has been set out in the road sector for the next 10 years and will form a basis
for the selection of road projects for the upcoming Eleventh and Twelfth National Plans, there is a risk to
sustainable funding due to the ongoing instability and political change in the country. In addition, while a
more stable funding mechanism for maintenance has been established through RBN, it lacks efficiency
and effectiveness in management of maintenance resources. However, it is expected that an amendment to
the Roads Board Act which is under review by the Ministry of Law and Justice and Parliament will
enable improvements in RBN's operation in the future.

                    5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1. The Bank's performance during the preparation was rated satisfactory. The Bank project team
took into account lessons learned from the previous operations and was advised by the Country
Management Unit in its assessment of the security risk. This project was consistent with other projects
being developed at the same time. However, as noted by the Quality At Entry review panel, there were
flaws in the use of computer aided design which, although innovative at the time, turned out to be
inappropriate for the local conditions in the country and thus led to considerable delays.

(b)     Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2. IDA's performance during supervision is rated satisfactory. The team acted proactively in
identifying issues and threats to the achievement of the PDOs and finding opportunities and solutions.
Such an approach as well as close collaboration with the Borrower and implementing agency enabled the
prompt carrying out of the project restructurings in 2002 and 2004 to respond to the deteriorating security
situation and make the project more flexible and realistic.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3. The overall performance of IDA is rated satisfactory, considering the above assessment with the
outcome ratings given in Section 5.1.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1. The Borrower demonstrated high levels of ownership and commitment to the project during
preparation. They also supported the preparation of PIP, which was adopted as the main road sector plan.
The roads supported by the PIP were included in the project. Resources were allocated from the then
ongoing Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project and a Project Preparation Facility to ensure
financing of feasibility studies and final engineering of the road maintenance and development works. A
draft Road Fund Act was prepared and ready for consideration by the Parliament by project appraisal.
However, during project implementation, only limited commitment and support were provided due to the
political changes and budget crisis, which in particular affected the successful implementation and
operation of RBN and provision of adequate funding of maintenance for SRN.




                                                     18

(b)      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2. The performance of the implementing agency ­ DoR ­ is rated satisfactory. It demonstrated its
commitment to the project through establishing an effective team for project preparation, which adhered
to the original preparation schedule and assured the timely and efficient completion of the preparation
activities. During project implementation and especially during the formal project restructuring, DoR
closely collaborated with the IDA team to identify problems and develop solutions which contributed to
the successful completion of the project. In addition, thanks to emphasis on strengthening of the
institutional capacity, DoR succeeded in not only delivering all relevant activities, but also substantially
improving its capacity in many aspects.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3. The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory, considering the above
assessment with the outcome rating given in Section 5.2.


                                          6. LESSONS LEARNED

6.1.     A project being implemented in a conflict-affected country should have a more flexible design and
implementation plan. The insurgency was spreading across Nepal during project preparation and two of
the project districts were controlled by the Maoists at project appraisal. However, the risk of intensifying
insurgency in the country was not taken into serious consideration. When the security situation
deteriorated in some of the project districts, the PDOs were too ambitious to be achieved and the RMDP
design turned out to be unable to adjust to the changing environment. It did not allow for timely reaction
and major adjustments to the project components could not be made without restructuring: e.g., moving
civil works to non-affected districts or introducing new components that would not be threatened by the
security situation. While restructuring may be a solution to improve project implementation, it may be
less cost and time efficient than if the project had been designed on a program basis. This would require
less resources and time during preparation and allow more flexibility to timely respond and adjust
implementation to the changing circumstances.

6.2.     Field surveys should always be used to complement computerized modeling of engineering
designs of roads in a mountainous terrain. Engineering designs of new roads in RMDP relied exclusively
on computerized modeling and were not accompanied by field surveys. As a result, they had many flaws
and were inappropriate for local conditions. The revision of designs and tender documents of respective
civil works triggered substantial cost and time overruns in individual contracts.

6.3.     Autonomy of a Roads Board is important to ensure stable and adequate funding of road
maintenance. Experience in the South Asia region suggests that creation of a Roads Board is not in itself
sufficient for efficient and effective mobilization and management of maintenance funds. The structure
of the Board must be such that it can work effectively taking into account the prevailing political context.




                                                     19

6.4.     Involvement of technical staff in reporting is essential for effective financial management. RMDP
experience suggests that a close collaboration between technical and financial management staff creates
linkages between physical progress and financial progress and thus is important to ensure satisfactory
financial management.

6.5.     Local contractors and consultants are more effective than international contractors and
consultants in conflict affected areas. RMDP shows that the successful completion of the works in
insurgency affected districts was mainly due to the involvement of local contractors and consultants.
Local communities and NGOs succeeded in conducting objective assessments of the security situations in
project areas and holding effective negotiations with the Maoists to reduce disruption to implementation
of civil works, and social and environmental safeguards.

6.6.     Knowledge and expertise gained in the Bank-funded project are more effectively disseminated
and applied by the staff who are not only engaged in the management of this project but also other
projects of the implementing agency. Rather than setting up a separate implementing unit from scratch,
the project employed DoR staff who would both work on this project and continue their regular duties.
This approach used human and intellectual resources more effectively, meaning that whatever useful
experience or knowledge (e.g. developing the ESMF) the DoR staff gained from implementation of
RMDP, they were able to apply to other DoR projects, hence building institutional capacity.

6.7.     Measurable EMAP-related indicators and a financial incentive mechanism should be built into
the contract in order to ensure contractors' compliance with environmental safeguards. Contractors were
reluctant to follow EMAP and the wording "proper environmental management" in the contract was not a
sufficient incentive. The project experience demonstrated the need to include EMAP-related items in the
schedule of rates and measurable EMAP-related costs in the contract to more effectively motivate
contractors for compliance with environmental safeguards.

                                 ANNEX 2. OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT

1.     The project originally consisted of five components. Two new components ­ community road
works and emergency repair of flood damaged roads - were added during the second restructuring in
2004. The table below provides details on the original and revised targets and actual achievements of the
physical outputs under the civil works components of the project. The following outputs were delivered
under each of the components by the closure of the project:

(a)    Policy Reform. This component supported the establishment of the RBN under a new Act and
       development of a road fund to maintain the strategic and rural roads in the country through the
       collection of road user charges. The RBN became operational under the Act in January 2003. The
       Board has been able to generate partial road maintenance resource requirements. However, some
       direct maintenance funds are still provided through the budget to the road agencies. At the
       recommendation of the Bank's study team, the Act is being amended for its revised structures and
       other administrative improvements.

(b)    New Road Development and Upgrading Component. Of the planned construction of 197 km of
       dry-weather roads, 106 km have been constructed but only 45 km are in a trafficable condition.
       This component could not move ahead because DoR was unable to arrange blasting operations
       due to the poor security situation in the country. Consequently, the project has only been able to
       connect one district headquarter of Achham (Mangelsen district) with motorable road access,
       versus the five targeted during appraisal. The construction of new roads was cancelled during the
       first project restructuring in 2003. Out of the originally planned 253 km for upgrading to gravel
       standards, only 213 km (revised target during the second restructuring in 2004) were upgraded
       due the security problem in the areas.

(c)    Rehabilitation of SRN. This component supported the rehabilitation of 248 km of SRN (against
       the original target of 160 km). As a successful component not affected by the security situation in
       the country, an additional 86 km of rehabilitation works (otta seal standard upgrading works for
       125 km of earthen roads and 141 km of gravel roads) were included in the project during the
       second restructuring. All the planned works have been completed except for about 14 km of road
       section due to the contractor's poor performance. This component has provided all weather black
       topped road access for Baitadi, Arghakhanchi, Gulmi, Achham and Okhaldhunga districts.

(d)    Periodic Maintenance of SRN. This component supported implementation of DoR's five-year
       periodic maintenance works. Due to the satisfactory implementation of this component, the
       second restructuring increased the scope of periodic maintenance works from the original target
       of 470 km to 676 km. By the end of the project, periodic maintenance works were completed on
       661 km of roads. Performance Based Maintenance was successfully piloted on 114 km of
       Naryanghat-Butwal road and two more contracts on Fuljore-Pathlaiya and Pathlaiya-Chaurhwa
       roads (150 km, total) are ongoing, for which GoN will be using its own resources for three more
       years after project completion. As agreed during the first restructuring, this component also
       financed regular maintenance of strategic roads from FY2003 through FY2006 on a declining
       basis.

(e)    Community Road Works. This component was added during the second restructuring in 2004.
       36 km (against the original target of 45 km) of the Jumla-Kalikot dry-weather road was
       constructed through employment of local communities in Kalikot district. Due to the security
       situation in the district, the construction of the remaining 9 km stretch was completed by the
       Nepal Army under public sector financing.


                                                    22

(f)  Emergency Repair of Flood Damaged Roads. This component was added during the second
     restructuring in 2004. It supported emergency repairing of 36 km of roads damaged during the
     2003 monsoon.

(g)  Institutional Strengthening Component. The activities planned under this component have been
     completed, including additional activities for the modernization of DoR to ensure improved
     service delivery in various DoR's core and supporting functions and operation in a corporate
     manner. The component supported the development and application of the: (i) PIP prioritizing
     construction, upgrading, rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works for Nepal's SRN for
     2007-2016, which has been approved by the National Planning Commission; (ii) Institutional
     Strengthening and Organizational Reform Action Plan for 2007-2016, which outlines an
     overarching institutional reform framework for the evolution of DoR towards the National Road
     Authority in the next 10 years; (iii) Institutional Position Paper for SRN Planning and Asset
     Management for 10 years; (iv) DoR HRD policy and strategy; (v) staff development and training
     plans; (vi) ESMF, which is being mainstreamed in DoR's road projects; and (vii) Quality
     Assurance System. These documents have been extensively followed for the preparation of the
     Bank-financed RSDP which was appraised and negotiated in September 2007 and approved in
     December 2007. Training in contract and arbitration management, EMAPs, bio-engineering,
     procurement, financial management, performance-based contracting of road maintenance and
     other topics has been delivered. External training was avoided due to a change in the Foreign Aid
     Policy of not using Credit funds for external training. Assessments of the Management
     Information System (MIS)/IT needs of DoR have been conducted and capacity has been built in
     legal aspects and monitoring and evaluation. The Road Sector Skill Development Unit staff
     members have been trained in various aspects of training management. Support has been
     provided to GESU to revise its guidelines for social and environmental safeguard requirements
     and Mechanical Training Centre to sustain its training capabilities through a more
     commercialized approach. Awareness has been created on the necessity of these units to provide
     professional services but units are facing the problems of frequent staff transfers, lack of service
     demand from other units and lack of adequate budget and other resource allocations. The
     institutionalization of recommended activities and practices still requires further effort for
     improvement, which will be supported under the follow-up RSDP. The component supported the
     preparation of many technical handbooks, design guidelines and standards, which are being
     finalized and will shortly be widely distributed for actual implementation. Most of these
     documents are already available with DoR in the final digital form.

(h)  DoR has made significant improvements in its IT capacity through development, use and training
     of its staff in the application of 16 computer information systems. These information systems
     have not been simply developed and installed but are being used by DoR in planning and
     management activities. The maintenance strategy was developed based on the analysis of the
     existing and committed SRN using the HDM-IV model, which enabled DoR to assess and
     evaluate alternative scenarios and determine the optimal approach. FMIS introduced at the central
     level of DoR has replaced a manual system and allowed shifting the focus from manual to
     computerized transactions and enables timely and accurate financial management and reporting.
     It is to be expanded to field divisions under the follow-up project. Other information systems that
     have been developed, introduced and are being applied by DoR. These include: road network
     database, asset management, program and budget, road related law database, procurement
     management, dispute resolution, personnel management, land compensation and others.

                                  ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Background

1.        At project preparation economic analyses were undertaken for the three different civil works
components of the project. For new road construction and upgrading component the analysis was based
on the "Nepal: Road Maintenance and Development Project: Final Report - Economic Aspects" of June
1999. This utilized a producer surplus methodology for evaluation of benefits. For the road rehabilitation
component a feasibility update was carried out during April-July 1999 following the earlier feasibility
studies completed in 1996/1997 using HDM-III. Similarly, for the periodic maintenance component, a
network-based prioritization exercise was conducted by DOR which gave rise to a prioritized resealing
program for DoR's paved SRN. The feasibility study of the periodic maintenance component was based
on the "Strategic Road Network Resealing Program for RMDP" dated November 24, 1998. The latter
also utilized HDM-III for the economic evaluation.

2.        The ERR for the project given in the PAD was 28.2%. However, direct comparison between the
analysis completed at appraisal and the completed project is not possible owing to the major change in
project which included not only physical location but also levels of intervention and technology employed.
The section below outlines the ex-post analysis and the assumptions employed.

Ex-post Economic Evaluation

3.        The ex-post economic evaluation was carried out using the Highway Development and
Management Model (HDM-IV) Version 2.0 that estimates project benefits in terms of reduction in road
user costs (vehicle operating costs plus passenger time costs). The table below presents the representative
vehicle fleet basic characteristics adopted on the economic evaluation.

8.       The table below presents the average financial road works unit costs per link. Rehabilitation
works represent rehabilitating paved roads with double surface dressings (US$49,200 per km). Upgrading
costs represent paving unsealed roads with Otta Seal (US$39,200 per km). Periodic maintenance works
represent sealing the roads with single surface dressing (US$10,500 per km). These costs were computed
based on the contract values of works of each contract (actual costs). Economic costs were computed by
multiplying the financial costs by 0.92 as done in SWRP, PIP Study. The evaluation assumed that, after
the initial investment, the roads will be maintained with a reseal every six years. The base alternative
considered a do-minimum scenario that includes routine maintenance and rehabilitation when the roads
reach 12 IRI.

                                ANNEX 5. BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS

1.       The project conducted a monitoring and evaluation survey on sample roads to determine impacts
of: (i) roads rehabilitated or upgraded to higher standards; and (ii) roads constructed by local communities
on the beneficiaries. Because surveys were carried out by different consultants, some of them were
inconsistent in terms of collecting data for the identified indicators. Thus, the data for some indicators are
missing. The final results of the surveys are given below.

Results of beneficiary survey on roads rehabilitated or upgraded to higher standards

2.       The project benefit monitoring and evaluation surveys covered the following roads: (i) Bartung ­
Syangja, rehabilitated; (ii) Harthok ­ Tamghas, upgraded from earth to gravel standard; (iii) Kothi -
Taulihawa, upgraded from gravel to bituminous standard; and (iv) Gorushinghe-Sandhikhara, upgraded to
bituminous standard by applying otta seal technology.

3.       The main impacts the rehabilitated and upgraded roads have brought upon the beneficiaries
include the following:

·        Growth of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). As it is seen from the table below, AADT has
         significantly increased compared to the pre-project situation, in particular on those which were
         upgraded from gravel to bitumen standard.           Traffic volumes have grown due to increased
         mobility of labor force, transportation of crops and increase in other activities stimulated by the
         improved road accessibility.

           Table 13. Increase in AADT on select project roads compared to the pre-project situation
                  Roads                       Car     Utility vehicle  Bus    Truck   Mini truck    Average
 Harthok ­ Tamghas (gravel)                   N/A          28%         26%     24%        0%          27%
 Kothi ­ Taulihawa (bituminous)              171%         -66%         21%     63%       660%         62%
 Gorushinghe-Sandhikhara (bituminous)         N/A         173%         56%     106%      100%         112%
 Note: N/A- data is not available

·        Changes in Passenger Fares and Freight Rates.           As the table below depicts, there have been
         consistent decreases in freight rates but various changes in passenger fares on these roads
         compared to the pre-project situation. Although there is a relationship between fares, rates and
         improved road conditions, there are also other factors influencing changes in fares and rates. The
         Department of Transport Management (DoTM) of the Ministry of Labor and Transport typically
         regulates fares to reflect increases in fuel prices but operators have themselves increased fares far
         above those set by DoTM. In the ease of freight, increased competition between trucks and mini-
         trucks has led to the decline in rates. Therefore, it is difficult to determine how much changes in
         passenger fares and freight rates are due to improved road accessibility.

 Table 14. Changes in passenger fares for bus and freight rates on select project roads compared to the pre-
                                              project situation, %
                      Roads                               Passenger fare                 Freight rates
 Bartung ­ Syangja (rehabilitated)                             +14%                        - 130%
 Harthok ­ Tamghas (gravel)                                    - 3%                         - 62%
 Kothi ­ Taulihawa (bituminous)                                 0%                          - 40%
 Gorushinghe-Sandhikhara (bituminous)                          - 31%                        - 66%

4.       Only the survey on Gorushinghe-Sandhikhara focused on collecting the data on travel time, prices
for commodities and education situation. It revealed the following:



                                                       31

·      Dramatic Reduction in Travel Time. Travel time by bus from Sandhikhara to Gorushinghe has
       been reduced from 8 to 3.5 hours.

·      Growth of Food Supply and Decline in Prices for Commodities. Supplies of food have increased
       while prices have declined. After the condition of this road was improved supplies of food and
       other merchandize have grown in the area as many new businesses and shops have opened.
       Improved food security has saved time for the residents who do not need to queue to get rice or
       other food from rationing at the district headquarters. Prices for many commodities have declined,
       e.g., by 29% for rice, 28% for flour, 25% for sugar, 12.5% for cooking oil, 17% for vegetable
       ghee as well as for construction materials, e.g., 46% for cement, 22% for corrugated galvanized
       iron sheet and 21% for reinforcement bar. However, it is unclear whether the decline in
       commodity prices can solely be attributed to the improvement in the road condition, as other
       factors, e.g., price regulation or market forces may have also influenced the decline in prices for
       commodities, but were not captured in the monitoring and evaluation survey.

·      Increase in school enrolment. The improved accessibility along Gorushinghe-Sandhikhara road
       corridor contributed to the growth of schools (from 788 to 1,200) and a subsequent increase in
       school enrolment by 42%. The project area has recorded an increase in literacy rate by 51% from
       1998 to 2005. Especially, significant improvements have been noticed among the female
       population: 59% increase in school enrollment and 41% increase in literacy rate.

Results of Beneficiary Survey on Roads Built by Local Communities

·      Generation of Employment. The community works component, which was added during the
       formal restructuring in 2004, supported the generation of employment through involvement of the
       local people from lower social and economic strata in the construction of 36-km Jumla feeder
       road in Kalikot district. As a result, 73 community-based organizations were formed, which
       employed as semi-skilled and unskilled laborers, about 130,000 local men and women from
       Dalits and indigenous groups living along this road corridor.

·      Improved Health Care Practices by the Local Residents. As communication has expanded outside
       their communities, people have increased awareness of hygiene and sanitation. Thanks to the
       availability of transport services, visits to health centers and health posts have become more
       frequent, reduced prices for soap and other sanitary products have encouraged greater use; and
       more households have sanitation.

·      Increased Use of Modern Technologies. The new road has also contributed to improvement in the
       living standards of those who built it. New houses have emerged along the road corridor; the local
       people have installed solar power technology in their homes and now have electricity to run radio
       and television.

         ANNEX 7. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR


1.      The Borrower has prepared an ICR on the implementation and achievements of RMDP. The
summary is given below; the full report is available in the project file.

2.      The ICR provides an overview of the project components and scope, two project restructurings
and their reasons, major achievements and outputs in each component. Since these Borrower's findings
related to the above mentioned subjects have been found similar to the ones in the Bank's ICR, they are
not included in the summary. The summary covers only those issues and aspects of the project which
were either not discussed in the Bank's ICR or on which the Borrower has a different opinion.

Environmental and Social Aspects

3.      The Borrower indicates that implementation of EMAP was one of the problems at the start of the
project but later was improved. The following are identified as obstacles to EMAP implementation, which
DoR will take into consideration in future:

·       Consideration of EMAP requirements by contractors as an impediment to making progress in
        civil works and their reluctance to follow EMAP;
·       Contractors' and subcontractors' lack of knowledge on EMAP concept;
·       Lack of proper sequencing of road construction activities leading not only duplication of
        construction efforts but also contributing to environmental damage;
·       Unavailability of adequate equipment for contractors to carry out the haulage of soil disposal; and
·       Lack of awareness among the local communities and project affected people regarding adverse
        environmental impacts of construction activities.

4.      Based on the gained experience, the Borrower has found that (i) withholding of and payment
deduction effectively motivate contractors in EMAP compliance; and (ii) site specific training and
workshops to the workers and group leaders for community-based organizations are an efficient means of
building knowledge on bio-engineering works. The following recommendations are proposed for more
effective implementation of EMAP in future:

·       Include EMAP related costs in the schedule of rates;
·       Request contractors to include EMAP associated costs in their bids to ensure EMAP compliance
        during contract execution;
·       Determine a measurable indicator for EMAP compliance and include it in the contract in order to
        create a monetary incentive for contractors to ensure adequate implementation of EMAP;
·       Provide continuous guidance to the local construction industry on the application of
        environmental friendly construction practices; and
·       Create better understanding on EMAP compliance and build awareness among Labor Gang
        Leaders, Supervisors, and Equipment Operators regarding environmental impact of road
        construction.

5.      The Borrower notes significant progress in social safeguard implementation. Prior to RMDP,
RAP had not been implemented in DoR's projects to such an extent. The main accomplishment is
involvement of a large number of stakeholders, including government agencies, local communities,
NGOs, etc. in the consultations on implementation of RAP.




                                                     34

Factors Affecting Project Implementation

6.    The following were found as key factors influencing project implementation:

·     Lack of vehicular access to new road construction sites;
·     Strikes and blockades;
·     Unsafe travel and access to sites;
·     No communication at sites;
·     No medical or emergency evacuation facilities at or near new road construction sites;
·     Lack of the local labor;
·     Delay in the provision of explosives and security;
·     Limited food supplies in some areas;
·     Restriction on transportation of materials; and
·     Contractors' disregard of EMAP requirements.

Main Lessons Learned

7.    The Borrower identifies the following as main lessons learned during project preparation and
implementation:

·     Bids should not be let out based exclusively on preliminary design in order to avoid possible large
      variances in future;
·     Sufficient time should be allocated for survey, design and land acquisition;
·     Provision of seismic tests to determine the depth of the rock below the ground level can be of
      assistance to narrow down variances in the quantity of the rock;
·     A short-term contract should include a provision regarding price adjustments; and
·     Otta seal surfacing is good for roads in the plain area and for roads with low volume traffic
      subject to adequate water management in the hill areas, while it is not suitable for hill roads with
      sharp turning.
