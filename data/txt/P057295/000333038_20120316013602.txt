1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Project Description

1.      The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) was designed in
2000 as a response of the Bank Group to the request of the client for creating a better climate
for private sector development in Rwanda. The project was designed to support the strategic
CAS objective of creating an enabling environment for private investment in Rwanda to
sustain economic growth in the range of 5 to 8 percent per year. The project followed the
closed Rwanda Private Sector Development Project and aimed to help provide the enabling
financial, legal, business and infrastructure environment necessary to foster the development of
a dynamic private sector leading to poverty reduction. The project focused on the following
three areas: (i) strengthening the business environment; (ii) reducing the cost and improving
the efficiency of utility services and (iii) liberalizing the tea industry.


2.     CEDP was designed as a hybrid project with two single tranches of US$ 5 million each
under the first component (Improving the business and legal environment) and an investment
part. The tranches were disbursed to set up a start-up fund of US$ 5 million2 and recapitalize
the Union des Banques Populaires de Rwanda (UBPR). The project was appraised in February
2001, taken to the Board on April 19, 2001, and became effective on December 7, 2001. The
project’s closing date was July 31, 2007 but the Government of Rwanda (GoR) requested a
budget reallocation and extension of the closing date, as it needed additional time to complete
several activities deemed important for the project to reach its development obje ctives. The
extension of the closing date to July 31, 2008 was approved in March 2007. Following the
2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and 2007 Financial Sector Development
Plan (FSDP), GoR requested assistance from the Bank to scale up the reforms in the financial
sector undertaken under component one of CEDP. The project was restructured in 2008 with
an additional financing of US$6.0 million to enable the government deepen ongoing reforms of
the microfinance sector, aid development of auditing and accounting standards as well as
strengthen regulation and supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions.


1.2   Context at Appraisal

3.      After the war and genocide in 1994, the GoR issued its Declaration of Principles,
spelling out its medium term agenda to move to a liberal, market-based economy, with a
reduced role for the state as a means of achieving the transition from conflict and emergency to
peace and sustainable development. In 1998, the Government, with the assistance of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, adopted the first policy framework paper, which
provided the basis for a reform program that focused on measures to establish an enabling
environment for economic growth and poverty alleviation. Specific reforms covered the
following areas: (i) establishment of a framework of regulations and institutions favoring
private sector development; (ii) trade liberalization and improvement of taxation; (iii)
liberalization of domestic prices and marketing for commodities; (iv) public enterprise reform,
including the privatization of about 60 state-owned companies; (v) opening up the water,
energy, telecommunications and tea sectors to competition; (vi) liberalization of the exchange

 The tranche was split in two funds at the request of Government in 2003: Rwanda Small Loan Fund (US$ 1 million)
and Rwanda Risk Capital Fund (US$ 4 million).


                                                       13
regime; (vii) financial sector strengthening, including the Central Bank, and (viii)
improvement of the policy and social security system. Most of these reforms were
implemented with the support of a number of Bank-financed projects, including the Private
Sector Development Credit (PSD, Cr. 2541-RW), three economic recovery credits and two
sectoral operations (the Energy and Telecommunications projects. The GoR also completed an
interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) which emphasized the role of the state in
the promotion of the private sector, lowering factor costs and increasing efficiency and
promoting market-based agriculture.


4.       Rationale for Bank involvement: The GoR recognized the fact that strong growth, led
by private sector investment, was a key to helping the Rwandese population improve their
living conditions and build a solid foundation to reconciliation. The GOR had addressed
certain impediments to improve its legal and regulatory framework; however, a number of
additional measures were needed to remove barriers to entry and growth of private businesses
and to overcome the perception of Rwanda as a high risk market and an unattractive place to
do business. These included: (i) easing administrative and regulatory constraints limiting
business creation; (ii) addressing, systematically, legal and judicial impediments for private
sector development; (iii) reinforcing the financial sector; (iv) strengthening SME institutions to
independently and effectively provide support to SMEs; and (v) easing Rwanda's
transformation by creating prosperity through innovation and competitiveness. The CEDP was
intended to establish an enabling environment for growth and development of the private
sector that would help reduce poverty in Rwanda. The project was designed to create an
investment climate conducive to doing business, provide financial and non-financial services
to emerging or existing SMEs, improve the legal environment and stimulate efficiency in
utilities and tea sectors by lowering costs through privatization. The private sector in Rwanda
was characterized as thin and dominated by informal activities and was not structured as a
strong partner to lead the dialogue on private sector development issues with the Government.


5.      Infrastructure: The war and institutional weaknesses had deeply affected the
functioning of the telecommunications, postal, water and power services. With the assistance
provided by the donor community, Rwanda had managed to recover and re-establish almost the
pre-war capacity of the networks. However, the cost of the services was still high, and
efficiency was below industry standards due to the monopolistic power of government-owned
Rwandatel and ELECTROGAZ. To improve sector efficiency, private sector participation and
privatization over the medium-term were considered to be the most viable solution. The
project intended to provide support to privatize Rwandatel and ELECTROGAZ to improve
their operational and financial performance and set up a multi sector utility regulator. To
consolidate the results already achieved under the previous IDA-financed project, the focus
under this project was to ensure financial self-sufficiency of the National Post Office (NPO)
for sustained delivery of affordable services.


6.      Tea Sector. Tea was one of the two main export crops in Rwanda, contributing to about
30-40 percent of total exports at the start of the project. It was also one of the few crops which
provided regular cash income to farmers. There were ten tea factories in Rwanda with nine of
them owned and managed by the state through OCIR-The. At that time, yields of the tea
estates were low and costs high; price level for tea growers were too low to attract growers to
increase production and the industry lacked factory capacity to process increases in tea



                                               14
production. The Government was committed to the liberalization of the industry and
privatization of state-owned assets. To this end, the GoR prepared and adopted a strategy that
addressed, inter alia, (i) the participation of nationals and key stakeholders (cooperatives,
small-holders, factory employees) in the ownership of tea factories and estates through
privatization; and (ii) accompanying measures, including the empowerment of farmers to take
over management of all commercial and technical activities that were under the responsibility
of OCIR-The; and (iii) the establishment of an independent Tea Board. The focus under this
operation was the completion of the privatization of the tea factories and the establishment of
an independent Tea Board.


1.3   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.     The project objective was to establish an enabling environment for growth and
development of the private sector that would help reduce poverty in Rwanda. The project was
focused on promoting a competitive business climate by (i) streamlining the business
environment; (ii) reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of telecommunications, water
and electricity utilities, and the tea industry; and (iii) improving access to financial and support
services to local entrepreneurs.
8.     The project key outcome indicators were as follows: (i) improved perception of the
investment climate; (ii) growth of local Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs); (iii) reduced
cost and increased efficiency of utility services; and (iv) returns on tea industry. These
outcome indicators were to be achieved through the following output indicators:
       Improved perception of investment climate by private investors measured by share of
       private investment to GDP;
       Increase in export volumes;
       Commercial court established and fully operational;
       All necessary adjustments to legal and regulatory framework enacted;
       Improved financial sector;
       Privatization of Government owned telecom company, RWANDATEL, completed
       through a competitive and transparent bidding process;
       Private Sector Federation (PSF) operating efficiently;
       Multi-sector regulatory agency fully operational;
       9 tea estates offered for sale by end of 2001.


1.4   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
      reasons/justification

9.     The PDO remained unchanged throughout the project. Two restructurings were carried
out; the first one in 2006 to extend the duration of the project by one year and the second in
2008 with an additional financing of US$ 6.0 million to support the strengthening of the
financial sector.


10.   At the design stage, several indicators did not have baseline data. A baseline survey
was carried out in 2006 which set the base data for some of the indicators. It was difficult to
determine in retrospect, 5 years after the start of the project, what the baseline data for some of


                                                15
the indicators would have been.
11.     At the time of the Additional Financing, the project was extended for an additional
three years but the initial targets were not revised to take into consideration the additional time.
The reason was that disbursement reached 90 percent of the credit amount and some activities
were completed3. The additional financing was not intended to finance activities under the
initial project. The following new performance indicators were added for the additional
financing: (i) NBR Supervisory staff able to undertake on-site and off-site supervision of Non
Bank Financial Institutions; (ii) Regulated MFIs are supervised regularly by NBR (once a year
for large MFIs) and NBR is able to maintain reliable indicators; (iii) International Financial
and Reporting Standards (IFRS) implemented by all financial institutions; and (iv) Automated
clearing house (ACH) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) implemented.


1.5    Main Beneficiaries

12.     The main beneficiaries of the program were the private sector, the population at large
and the Government. For the local private sector, benefits were expected to be significant, as
the project focused on completing reforms in key sectors and providing support that would
encourage efficient private sector activities, particularly with respect to reduced transaction
costs and lower entry barriers. The private sector would also benefit from new investment
opportunities created by the divestiture program, and higher competitiveness resulting from
lower cost of electricity, water, and telecommunications. Tea producers would benefit from
higher productivity and share of profits. The consumers were expected to benefit from easier
access to products and services at more affordable prices induced by increased competition,
and be more protected by regulatory and competition institutions from the misuse of
monopoly power.       The project was intended to help make the Rwandese business
environment more competitive. The project, would also permit the inclusion of the rural
population into the economy and public services, and allow better social and business
communications at lower costs; and the restructuring of ELECTROGAZ was expected to lower
production costs and improve service availability and delivery. The local population was
expected to benefit from the creation of job opportunities as well as acquire improved skills
and mobility within the labor force. As for the GoR, it expected substantial revenue from the
privatization of RWANDATEL and the nine tea factories and estates, a reduction in financial
burden of these institutions and that of NPO and an increase in tax collection base. T he project
was also expected to attract a flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) that would create direct
and indirect new jobs, as well as transfer technology and know-how.

  The following activities were completed: 3 commercial courts were created in 2004, UBPR was recapitalized and
became a commercial bank in 2008, CAPMER provided support to 60 SMEs, Rwandatel was privatized for the second
time in 2007, Private management contract for ELECTROGAZ was signed in 2003 but revoked in 2005 due to poor
performance of private operator; multi sector utility regulatory authority was set up; Tea Board was created and 4 tea
estates were privatized.

1.6   Original components

13.     The project consisted of 4 components: (i) improving the business and legal
environment of Rwanda; (ii) improving efficiency and cost effectiveness through the
privatization of the two main public utility companies and the Postal sector; (iii) reducing costs
and improving returns by promoting a market-based tea industry through the privatization of
the nine tea factories and estates; and (iv) providing assistance to the newly-established
institutions, the Private Sector Federation and the PCU. Thus, the project addressed the
following issues that mutually supported each other and were complementary to the results
already achieved:


14.     Strengthening the business environment (US$22.38 million): Further reduction of
business transaction costs was to be sought through streamlining business and administrative
procedures to facilitate private enterprise creation. To this end, the project aimed at (i)
improving the legal environment affecting private sector development through the
implementation of an action plan to remove legal impediments to private sector and the
strengthening of the Arbitration Center; (ii) reducing bottlenecks in the investment
implementation process and improving investor assistance by strengthening the operational
capacity of the newly-established Investment Promotion Center, (iii) supporting emerging
business by strengthening the newly established CAPMER combined with an SME start-up
fund to help remedy the lack of sustainable long-term financing resources; and (iv) laying the
ground work to address limited access of finance to the economy. The project was designed to
provide technical assistance to (a) carry out a comprehensive review of the legal and regulatory
framework to do business; (b) undertake a financial sector assessment; (b) support bankers'
training through assistance to the School of Banking and Finance (SBF) and (c) restructure the
Union des Banques Populaires du Rwanda (UBPR) to enable it to fulfill its function as the
central pillar of the micro-finance sector in Rwanda and participate in its recapitalization.
Furthermore, IFC intended to start due diligence in eligible banks with a view of possible
equity investments, as well as the provision of credit lines.


15.     Reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of utility services (US$14.25
million): To enhance competition in the telecommunication, water and energy sectors, ongoing
reforms in these sectors were to be completed to encourage entry of private operators, lower
factor costs and improve accessibility. To this end, the project, through its support to the
privatization of the utility companies for water, electricity and telecommunication, intended to
improve the delivery and cost of services to business and individual users. Furthermore, the
project would help establish and build capacity of a multi-sector regulatory agency to
effectively deal with a multi-operator market environment. The project also included a
subcomponent on the postal sector to provide technical assistance for a feasibility study of
current and new service provision on a commercial basis, implementation of a mode rn
financial management system and tariff rebalancing; and corporate structure building and
training of Rwanda Post staff.


16.     Promoting a market based tea industry (US$2.36 million): It intended to instill
competition for higher sector efficiency, contribution to economic growth and returns to
owners and farmers, through the privatization of tea factories and estates. The GoR was to
establish and build the capacity of an independent Tea Board for a better stakeholder
consultation on issues pertaining to the marketing, pricing and commercialization of tea.


                                               17
17.    Support to Private Sector Federation and Project Coordination Unit (US$1.55
million): The project planned to (a) provide technical assistance to the information
dissemination campaigns on HIV/AIDS, in collaboration with the Private Sector Federation,
and (b) support the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU).


1.7   Revised components

18.    The project components were not revised but four subcomponents to strengthen the
financial services sector were added to the first component when the project was restructured
for additional financing. The four subcomponents were: (i) improving access to credit and
financial services; (ii) improving accounting and auditing standards; (iii) enhancing NBFI
regulation and supervision; (iv) strengthening the national pension fund, Caisse Sociale du
Rwanda (CSR); and (v) modernizing payments systems.


1.8   Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements
      and schedule, and funding allocations)

19.     Some modifications were brought to the activities initially included at the design of the
project. Some activities were cancelled while others were added. Under component one,
support to RBS, Kigali International Arbitration Centre, Masaka Business Incubation Centre
and the leasing program was added. The HIV/AIDS sensitization campaign under component
two was dropped as the activity was financed by several other donors. Under component four,
several institutions were also supported: Rwanda Housing Bank, National Tender Board,
Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management (KIST), MIJESPOC, Rwanda Office
of Tourism and National Parks and National Insurance Commission. The support was mainly
in the provision of equipment and staff capacity building.


20.     The implementation time was also extended, spanning over a period of ten years as a
result of two consecutive extensions of the closing date. The first one was in 2007 for a period
of one year to allow for the successful completion of project activities that were not yet
implemented. The second extension was in 2008 for a period of three years due to the
additional financing to support the strengthening of the financial sector. The supervision of
the project was originally under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MINECOFIN) and was transferred to the MINICOM in 2005 following recommendations of
the Mid-Term Review.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.    The project was requested by the Rwandan government to support the achievement of
governmental goals and be complementary to the Government's economic reform program at
that time. In particular, it aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability, improving the
competitiveness of the economy and stimulating economic recovery. The project was also
consistent with the CAS dated June 17, 1992, which gave high priority to: (i) supporting the
country's adjustment process; (ii) developing an incentive structure for private sector


                                               18
investment; (iii) reducing the role of the state and improving public resource management; (iv)
developing human resources, building local capacity, and alleviating poverty; and (v) fostering
improved management of natural resources, while protecting the environment.


22.      The project design was based on lessons learned from prior work and major risks were
identified. The project was designed specifically to support Rwanda in its reconstruction phase
after the war. At the time of project design, research and experience wit h prior projects
pointed to broad cross-sector approach to increasing competitiveness. The need to improve
the business environment for private sector growth was also acknowledged. The Government's
strategy for private sector growth was spelled out in its Letter of Development Policy of April
1999 and National Vision 2020. Project design benefitted from a series of studies funded under
the project preparation facility, which effectively helped the PCU meet conditions of
effectiveness and advance different technical components of the project.


23.    Assessment of risk by project team was adequate at project preparation. The team
properly identified risks related to the appropriateness of reforms and adequacy of training
being offered. The design was cognizant of the risks associated with poor institutional and
absorption capacity of key stakeholders to implement reforms. The design embedded intensive
technical assistance and capacity building in the core components of the project to mitigate
these risks. One of the outstanding design features was the emphasis on institutional and
capacity development; and legal and regulatory reforms as a foundation for building a sound
and sustainable business environment in the country.


24.     Quality at Entry: The project’s overall concept was sound and conformed to the
Vision 2020, I-PRSP and the CAS of 1992. The project did not undergo quality at entry
assessment. There was adequate level of analytical work undertaken including participatory
discussions with key stakeholders. However, the results framework was not adequately
designed with the PDO and intermediate indicators too broad to be able to directly attribute
achievements specifically to the project. In this regard, quality at entry is rated as moderately
satisfactory.


2.2   Implementation

25.    The project was implemented over a period of ten years, from effectiveness in
December 2001 until closing on July 31, 2011. It was extended two times to ensure activities
were completed on time and additional financing provided to the project were afforded
adequate time for implementation. The amount of additional financing of US$6 .0 million
equivalent was added to finance activities to deepen financial sector reforms. Four new
performance indicators were added to the results framework under the first component of the
project.   The project was designed as a hybrid project with the disbursement of two single
tranche of US$ 5 million each and the remaining funds utilized for an investment lending
operation. The first tranche of US$ 5 million was used to recapitalize UBPR. The second
tranche was further split in two funds: Rwanda Small Loan Fund (US$ 1 million) that financed
SMEs requiring funds ranging from US$5,000 to US$35,000 through the Business Plan
Competition; and a Risk Capital Fund (US$ 4 million) to provide finance in the range of
US$100,000 to US$400,000 to SMEs that have a potential to grow and become competitive in


                                               19
the export market. This contribution was later made to the Rwanda Enterprise Investment
Company (REIC) that was designed to operate like an equity fund for more promising SMEs.
REIC was restructured in a new SME fund in 2011 4 and signed a management contract with
Business Partners International.


26.     Project implementation was managed by a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), known as
the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development (CEDP) Unit, under the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning. The CEDP Unit had overall responsibility for project implementation
at various periods. The daily management of the project was carried out by the PCU under the
supervision of the Steering Committee. The project activities were implemented by the
institutions considered to be project implementing agencies. Having the Project Coordinating
Unit set up as an autonomous body with fully dedicated staff ensured proper coordination with
close to twenty five beneficiary agencies. Throughout the implementation of the project, the
commitment from the Government was very strong.


27.    A high-level Steering Committee, whose composition was spelled out in the PIP, was
set up to ensure coordination of all project activities at the Government policy level. It was
chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and
comprised the Heads of Implementing Agencies. In 2005, the CEDP Unit was transferred to
MINICOM with the Steering Committee chaired by the PS of MINICOM. The Steering
Committee met on a regular basis to assess implementation progress, provide strategic
orientation to the project and approve annual budgets of the project.


28.    During the first years of project implementation, a small staff composed of a Project
Coordinator, a Financial Manager and a team assistant formed the PCU which was advocated
as a supporting body to the implementing agencies. The procurement and
monitoring/evaluation positions were filled in November 2004 when the number of requests
from implementing agencies to fund activities increased substantially. The project faced a
number of challenges due to the high turnover of focal points in the implementing agencies and
replacing them took some time, with the new staff further needing more time to familiarize
themselves with and master World Bank procedures. The majority of implementing agencies
did not have enough capacity to deal with some aspects of their respective sub-components, in
particular with procurement. This resulted in the plurality of incompatible jobs for the team
and for the smooth running of the project. It was difficult for the PCU to properly plan and
manage activities to be disbursed and monthly reports were also not submitted in time.
Continuity in the PCU and World Bank task management function, especially with a ground
presence, seemed to have contributed significantly to keeping the project on course.


29.    The implementation of the project required some highly specialized technical experts to
guide the project team. There was close collaboration between the different units of the World

 The Fund shareholders include Rwanda Enterprise Investment Company (REIC) with equity of US$4 million,
International Finance Corporation (IFC) with US$1.6 million, DOEN, a Dutch Non Governmental Organization with
US$1.1 million and BPI with US$ 0.5 million. The new SME Fund, now known as Business Partners Rwanda SME
Fund would be managed by Business Partners International and is expected to make equity investments of between
US$50,000 and US$1 million in medium enterprises and provide business advisory services to SMEs.


                                                      20
Bank Group, IMF and other donors at different point in time. The project benefitted from the
expertise of (i) a Postal Services Specialist to work on the restructuring of the National Post
Office, (ii) a Telecommunications Specialist and (iii) an Insurance Specialist. The task team
collaborated with the Electricity Rehabilitation Project team for the setting up of the Rwanda
Regulatory Authority and institutional strengthening of ELECTROGAZ. IFC was involved as
from 2008 in the reforms of the investment climate with their Rwanda Investment Climate
Reform Project, by providing technical assistance to reform areas that had a direct impact on
the Doing Business indicators. IFC was also involved in setting up the leasing program and
investing in the REIC. Since the government program was supported by many donors,
including the Bank, it was difficult to attribute some of the outcomes to the CEDP alone.
Where possible, results that could be directly attributed to the project were described in the
report.


30.     A Mid-Term Review was carried out in February 2005, one year before the original
closure of the project. At that time, implementation progress on all components was
considered “highly satisfactory? except for some delays in the tea sector reform (Tea Board)
and support to MININFRA and NPO. Disbursement was estimated at 52 percent of the
original credit amount. The Mid-Term Review revealed that major functions such as
Procurement and M & E positions were filled in end 2004, three years after the start of the
project. The implementation of the project was affected by lack of appropriate technical staff
at the level of the PCU to ensure proper planning, implementation and monitoring of the
activities. The Steering Committee was also not fully operational as not all positions were
filled. Following the Mid-term Review, the PCU was reinforced and formal training was
provided to the PCU teams, focal points and fiduciary teams of implementing agencies.
Implementation progressed satisfactorily once those issues were addressed. Some internal
budget allocation was also carried out, after approval from IDA, whereby the funds allocated
to some activities were not used due to cancellation of those activities and the funds allocated
to other subcomponents.


31.     The project was coordinated by two different project managers over the implementation
period; and two ministries had oversight responsibilities over the project at different periods.
There were three World Bank Task Team Leaders during implementation. Most components
had a successful and efficient implementation, producing a large number of project outputs.
The main causes for this successful implementation were the commitment of the technical staff
of the PCU and close Bank supervision, with the TTL in the field. Among the other positive
factors that led to successful implementation was collaboration with stakeholders. Given the
various aims of the project, implementation would not have been possible without the
continuous engagement of stakeholders. For example, the project worked closely with the
Municipal Council of Kigali to implement the one-stop-shop to facilitate business processes. In
another example, the PCU contracted local staff to work directly with private sector
beneficiaries such as Centre for Assistance to SMEs (Centre d’Appui aux PME du Rwanda –
CAPMER), Association of Micro Finance Institutions of Rwanda (AMIR), Private Sector
Federation (PSF), National Bank of Rwanda (NBR), Union des Banques Populaires de Rwanda
(UBPR), ELECTROGAZ, National Post Office (NPO), Rwanda Bureau of Standards (RBS),
Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority (RURA), Ministry of Justice (MINIJUST) and Executive
Secretariat of Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), among others, to determine
appropriate technical assistance. The project also worked with various private and public
training institutes to improve training options in various sectors, one of them being the School


                                              21
of Finance and Banking. The project funds were reallocated and the project restructured to
facilitate implementation, maximize impact, and respond to Government requests consistent
with the PDO. The changes were made primarily to direct project resources toward activities
with the greatest potential for impact and proactively respond to changes in Government
priorities. The implementation of the project is rated as moderately satisfactory.


2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     As discussed before, the M&E design of the project had weaknesses stemming from
lack of clarity at the time of the design of the project and an unavailability of baseline data.
The project elaborated a Results Framework that was aligned to the PDO and based on the
information that existed in 2001. This Framework was prepared with the expectation of data
that, although not available at that time, was supposedly going to be generated. However no
surveys were carried out and the Baseline assessment was carried out in 2006, five years after
the start of the project. It was difficult to reconstruct the objectives targeted by the project for
some indicators as the institutions were either dismantled or merged with other structures.
Other institutions were set up after the start of the project and were not included in the results
framework, at any time. The detailed results framework that was developed by the consultants
was not fully implemented by the PCU. A simplified version was adopted which makes it
difficult at the ICR stage to have a complete picture of the achievements that could be
reasonably attributed to the project. At some point during the supervision period, and with the
improvements and new insights into developing and implementing an M&E framework, the
Bank team should have included an M & E specialist in its supervision team. Overall, the
project could have benefited if more than one impact study were conducted throughout the ten
years, including one towards the last year of project implementation to measure overall
increased income and employment creation impact.


33.     Utilization: The monitoring indicators were the principal base for monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) over the duration of the project. The primary source for implementation
progress was data collection by the technical staff of the PCU. Quarterly reports from
implementing agencies to PCU were used to revise work plans, including additional technical
assistance to institutions based on individual strategic needs. Data was also collected from
several sources including project reports, and were periodically verified by external auditors,
financial management team and supervision missions. The final activity report (February 2011)
from PCU and the completion report from the Government were received as input to the ICR.
Based on the above, the design, implementation and utilization of the M&E framework is rated
substantial.


2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.    Safeguard. The project was classified as Category B. An environmental pre-audit was
conducted to determine potential liabilities and rank enterprises according to the need for
comprehensive environmental, partial, or no audit. The environmental pre-audit was approved
by the Bank and the Borrower. It was disclosed in Rwanda and in the Bank Information Center
(Infoshop) in December 2000. Based on this, the potential environmental impacts of this
project are related to the privatization component. Environmental problems associated with
the power utility and water treatment plant operation were not known at the time of the project


                                                22
design. The water treatment station seemed to have sustained limited damage during the war.
The waste management and occupational safety at the water treatment stations were dealt with
through the contract with the private operator, which included a provision for the required
personal protection equipment. Environmental audits were included in the bidding packages
for the privatization of the tea estates to determine the magnitude of the environmental
problems involved and identify measures to mitigate or eliminate them. There were no major
social issues as the privatization did not result in any redundancies.
35.    Financial Management: The PCU kept records on financial management and followed
financial management guidelines as detailed in the PIP. The IFRs and financial audits were
submitted on-time and issues raised by the auditors were addressed by PCU although some
delays in implementation of recommendations from the audit reports were noted. The last
Audited reports (ending October 2011) revealed some recurrent weaknesses in the book
keeping and reporting of some expenses 5. The project financed the procurement of accounting
software, SUCCESS that was used for the accounting functions of the project. However, the
software was not well designed as reports for IFRs and withdrawal application of funds could
not be generated automatically from SUCCESS and had to be prepared manually till the end of
the project. The software was not fully utilized, as financial commitment modules, which
would have enabled the follow-up of the contract implementation and monitoring and
evaluation module were not used. The software did not allow the management of accounts in
more than one currency and it was difficult to reconcile the expenses related to the different
project fund currencies. The staff in charge of procurement, monitoring and evaluation did not
use the Procurement Management module and the Monitoring and Evaluation module of the
software. It was mentioned by the PCU that the software would no longer be used once CEDP
was closed due to its limited functionalities.      The overall performance of the financial
management function is rated moderately satisfactory.


36.     Procurement: At the start of the project, the procurement function was overseen by the
Project Coordinator with the implementing agencies being responsible for preparing action
plans, procurement plan, project proposals and procurement documents. A full time
Procurement Specialist was recruited in 2004 when the implementation of the project was in
full swing. The PCU ensured implementing agencies followed agreed procurement guidelines
and procedures and that the documents prepared were according to World Bank standards.
The PCU was also involved in all procurement process of goods and services. The PCU
prepared Procurement Plan which was approved by the Steering Committee but several
activities, particularly capacity building, that were not in the Procurement Plan were financed
by the project. During the 2007 Implementation Support mission, it was agreed with the PCU
that support to non core activities of the project (such as events, equipment, training and
travel) were reduced. A new action plan with the core activities to be supported under the
remaining project timeframe was discussed. These activities were considered as useful to
complement core activities supported in the past, build capacity and promote the image of the
beneficiaries. It was agreed with the Bank team that the PCU would prepare and get approval
on annual training plans to enable the PCU to better prepare forecasted budget. The Bank’s
fiduciary team undertook several post procurement reviews and two Independent Procurement
Reviews (IPR) were conducted in 2005 and 2008. The 2005 review showed some

 Advance payment guarantee was not implemented; Long outstanding creditors – some from institutions that have
been merged with RDB, Monthly Procurement Report not submitted to Rwanda Public Procurement Authority,
Regular stock reports were not prepared.


                                                       23
shortcomings in the procurement functions of the PCU with mis-procurement declared for
three activities. After explanation provided by the PCU and a second review of the report by
the Bank, mis-procurement was declared on two activities 6 . The outstanding amount of
US$120,045 was refunded to the Bank. These cases arose because the PCU did not have a
dedicated Procurement Officer and the procurement functions were being carried out by the
Project Coordinator. Following recommendation from the World Bank team, a full time
Procurement Specialist was hired and was fully trained in World Bank procurement procedures.
The IPR of April 2008 also highlighted some shortcomings on the selection method, bidding
documents used and evaluation process. World Bank procurement guidelines and procurement
procedures as laid out in the Project Implementation Plan were not being followed 7 . The
overall performance of procurement management is rated unsatisfactory.


2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.     The project financed the establishment and strengthening of the capacity of several
institutions in Rwanda, ranging from the judiciary, regulatory bodies, institutions providing
support to enterprises and SMEs, banks including the Central Bank, specialized training
schools, investment promotion and facilitation agencies to the Private Sector Federation. The
knowledge and experience gained by the beneficiaries through CEDP should contribute to
sustain the reforms and even deepen the reforms in the business environment and financial
services sector. To ensure the sustainability of investment climate reforms which have
contributed to Rwanda improving its ranking on the annual Doing Business survey, the
Government would continue to finance the Doing Business unit which was created under RDB
to oversee Rwanda’s performance with regard to the IFC-World Bank Doing Business
indicators. RDB was well equipped with a strong technical team to carry out investment
promotion activities. The supervision department of NBR and RURA were a few of the
structures that were supported under the project and which were able to perform efficiently,
with the caveat that the staff would still need regular training to keep up to date with new
techniques and technology. It was expected that GoR would be able to finance highly
specialized capacity building programs. For other institutions like AMIR or the Executive
Secretariat of the FSDP, no transitional measures were put in place after the closure of CED P.
These institutions were faced with a financing gap where the Government would have to step
in to contribute to the cost or these agencies would have to reduce the scope of their activities.




6
  The two contracts were procured in violation of the ''Guidelines Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
(published by the World Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January
1999) as well as the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published by
the World Bank in January 1997 and revised in September 1997 and January 1999).
7
  The following were the shortcomings identified in the IPR: poor planning of activities; cost estimated and key staff
not adequate with the scope of the mission, practices which do not always allow transparent competition; a large
number of national shopping procedures mostly includes the purchase of travel tickets (through travel agencies),
office/computer supplies, and services such as hospitality or catering services, and conference hall rentals. Most of the
procedures are conducted in a rush and with a lack of specifications or bidding conditions that would allow for actual
competitive procedures. The result is that a number of them do not comply with basic procurement procedures which
would ensure that the processes are transparent and conducted under economical conditions. Shopping without
indication of submission deadline. Tender document not specifying quantities, award of contracts based on total of unit
prices, evaluation criteria, pre- qualification not adequate, use of contract which lack essential clauses; filing system
still accuse some deficiencies e.g. lack of Minutes of Negotiations, Opening Minutes, and prior reviewed documents


                                                           24
38.    A follow up operation to the CEDP will be presented to Board early 2012 and would
contribute to sustaining the achievements of the CEDP through continued support to selected
government agencies in the areas of export diversification and competitiveness for the
horticulture and tourism sectors.


39.     The African Development Bank is financing CEDP II for the period 2008 to 2012 with
the following components: support to RDB (support to operationalization of RDB, strategic
investment promotion, and enterprise development); support to NBR (improving access to
credit and financial information, strengthening banking supervision) and financing of the PCU.
The Business Plan Competition that was supported by the project for the first three years, from
2004 to 2008, is being financed by the Netherlands, under a special fund and also includes
support to PSF on advocacy and BDS services.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.     The project’s development objectives continue to be highly relevant especially with
Rwanda’s ambition to be a middle income country by 2020. The project components were
relevant and consistent with project objectives as they were aligned to support improvements
which were critical for a strong finance and private sector development. The design of the
project was also relevant to the specific reform agenda that the project sought to promote ,
strengthening business environment, and remains relevant in the current context. The project
design was relevant in terms of outcomes and activities at policy, sector and institutions levels
which were practical and responsive to the immediate and long term development needs of
stakeholders involved in the implementation of the CEDP project. The choice of the
instrument was also appropriate as the hybrid instrument enabled the Bank to invest in two
SME funds, one equity fund and an investment portion, enabled the Bank to fund specific
technical assistance, capacity building, training, study tours, twinning arrangement and
equipment to the beneficiaries. The relevance of this project is rated high as the project clearly
identified improvements to private sector competitiveness and increased private sector
participation in the economy as key to the economic transformation of Rwanda.


3.2   Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41.     The project was implemented after a very difficult period in Rwanda and made an
important contribution in helping the country during the transition from war to peace. In spite
of the extremely adverse country circumstances after the genocide, the project had a significant
positive impact on financial and private sector development. The project was a moderately
large TA loan by IDA standard, covering sectors ranging from energy, telecommunication,
postal services, tea and financial sectors, support to SMEs, investment promotion and
generation, public private dialogue and privatization of government owned enterprises. In
addition, the Project also supported institutional building and strengthening of CAPMER,
RIEPA, RURA, Privatization Unit, RDB, AMIR, NBR and FSDP Secretariat. After project
closure, most of the expected benefits materialized and the country experienced a higher
economic growth fostered by a more efficient financial and private sector.

Improved perception of the investment climate
42.    Under the project, a total of 13 commercial laws 8 were reviewed, finalized and enacted.
The project enabled the creation of a three fully functional commercial courts and an
Arbitration Centre to settle business disputes and reduce the time taken to enforce court
decisions. The time taken to settle a commercial dispute in the Commercial Court was
decreased from 394 days in 2003 to 230 days in 2011. The high success rate in legislative
reform could not be totally attributed to the project as some of the reforms pertaining to DB
indicators were also funded by the IFC Rwanda Investment Climate Reform Project (RICRP).
However it is important to note that the CEDP funded the Doing Business Reform Unit and
paved the way for the IFC RICRP in terms of legislative and investment promotion reforms.
43.    The performance of the banking and non banking sectors was improved and access to
financial services was enhanced through improved service delivery of private commercial
banks, micro finance institutions and new financial products such as leasing were introduced.
CEDP Initial Financing contributed to the improvement of the quality of services offered by
the financial sector in Rwanda. The main achievements can be summarized as follows: (i)
improvement of the portfolio management of BCR after its privatization process; (ii) a better
performing UBPR after its restructuring and recapitalization; (iii) introduction of a new chart
of accounts for the banking sector; (iv) a Credit Reference bureau; (v) the successful
implementation of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and Real Time Gross Settlement
System (RTGS); and (iv) regular on site and off site supervision of commercial banks and
MFIs, including SACOOs. All banks now comply with the minimum capital requirement of
US$ 8.6 million and required minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio of 15 percent. There is now a
more efficient banking system in Rwanda. The performance of the non banking sector also
improved.
44.     The project significantly contributed to improve the perception of Rwanda as an
investment destination through the reforms in the business environment, financial sector and
public utilities. The project also supported investment promotion campaigns to attract foreign
investors in Rwanda. The share of private investment to GDP increased from 3.4 percent at
the start of the project to 14 percent at the end of the project and is expected to grow. Export
volumes increased during the lifetime of the project except for 2009 due in part to the financial
crisis.


Growth of local SMEs
45.     The CEDP financed the Business Plan Competition (BPC) for three years whereby
funding and technical assistance were provided to promising Rwandan entrepreneurs through a
competition. The BPC was successful in promoting and stimulating entrepreneurship
development in Rwanda through sensitization campaigns and assistance to prepare viable
business plans that could attract external financing. The project helped strengthened the
institutions such as CAPMER and AMIR to provide a better service to SMEs. The Rwanda
Standards Bureau helped Rwandan enterprises improve their competitiveness and export

 The legislations are: (1) Law establishing commercial courts, (2) Law on Arbitration, Mediation and Conciliation in
Commercial Matters, (3) Law Establishing the Business Registration Services Agency, (4) Labor code, (5) Law on
mortgages, (6) Law on securities in movable property, (7) Insolvency law, (8) Companies acts, (9) Competition and
Consumer Protection Law, (10) Draft bill on Provisions applicable on Privately Financed infrastructures, (11) Contract
Law, (12) Condominium Law; (13) Law on electronic transactions. The 14th which is Negotiable Instruments Law has
not yet been enacted.

readiness through quality control and quality assurance. There was an increased access of
locally manufactured goods to targeted markets, resulting in an upward trend of exports.


Reduced cost and increased efficiency of utility services
46.     The project financed the preliminary studies for the preparation of the privatization
process of Rwandatel which led to the liberalization of the telecom sector and enabled
participation of the private sector. There was an increase in the number of telecom service
providers, ISPs and other internet-based services which led to a reduction in tariff of telecom
services, an increase in the number of subscriptions and a diversification of the product offer.
47.     Electrogaz embarked on critical reforms with the technical and financial assistance of
the CEDP and the Utility Rehabilitation Project to improve its performance. The achievements
of ELECTROGAZ / ESAWA were: (i) decrease in the queuing of clients to buy power due to
the new management system with electricity prepayment counters, which allowed the
privatization of selling electricity; (ii) significant decrease in the technical and commercial
losses due to the acquisition of loss reduction equipment and privatization of some services;
(iii) decrease in the lead time to water and electricity connection; (iv) decrease in the lead time
to water and electricity damage repair; and (iv) increase in the number of new water and
electricity connections in rural as well as in urban areas.
48.     The establishment of the multi sector Utility Regulatory Authority created the
appropriate environment for increased private sector participation and a more efficient
supervision of telecom and utility companies. The privatization and/or liquidation of public
institutions generated revenues to GoR and caused a reduction in government spending through
reduced subsidies to these institutions. The privatization of state owned tea estates resulted in
an increase in earnings from tea exports; from USS 22.7 million in 2001 to US$ 31.7 million in
2006 and US$ 55.7 million in 2010.


Returns on tea industry
49.     The project provided specialized technical assistance for the creation the Tea Board
which was later incorporated under NAEB and privatization of 7 out of the 9 tea factories and
estates. The selling price of tea per kg increased from US$ 1.49 in 2001 to US$ 2.59 in 2010,
corresponding to a 70 percent increase. The earnings from tea exports increased from
US$ 22.71 million in 2001 to US$ 44.95 million in 2008 and US$ 55.71 million in 2010.


50.     Achievement of development objectives. The project had some major achievements
even if not all KPIs were fully achieved. Had the indicators been better formulated, the
achievement of the PDOs might conceivably have been rated Satisfactory. As it is, the project
is rated as moderately satisfactory.


3.3   Efficiency

51.    At the time of Appraisal, the Net Present Value (NPV) and economic rate of return was
estimated for the duration of the project. The Cost Benefit Analysis carried out after project
closure could not replicate the same methodologies used in the ex-ante economic analysis as
the ICR team was unable to get access to the original detailed analytical working. The file was
not on record. Instead, a different set of assumptions were used based on the actualized


                                                27
benefits. Two benefits were included in the analysis: FDI and earnings from tea export.
However as it was difficult to separate the project’s direct results from those of the macro
economy at large, the net economic cash flow were based on a conservative assumption of 50
percent of FDI flows and tea export earnings; which might explain the lower NPV at the time
of the ICR (refer to Table 1 below).
                    Table 1: ERR and NPV at appraisal and project closure
                                           PAD               ICR
                         ERR               24 %              31%
                         NPV           US$ 31 million    US$ 9 million

52.   Project management was cost effective. At project closure, the actual cost of project
management was 98 percent of appraisal estimates.
                         Table 2: Project Costs at appraisal and closure
                                      Appraisal      Actual / latest Percentage

                                                     (US$ million)
               Project Cost                    41.14          41.23      100.22%
               Additional financing                6           5.02       83.67%
               Total                           47.14          46.25       98.11%

53.    On the basis of revised assumptions, the ex-post benefits were higher than the estimates
at appraisal (ERR 24 percent at appraisal compared to 31 percent at ICR). The project was
economically beneficial to the country and the efficiency of the project is rated as substantial.


3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

54.     The project objectives and implementation were and remain highly relevant to the
country priorities. The project paved the way, through the wide range of activities that were
funded, to change the perception of Rwanda from a conflict affected country to a competitive
and attractive investment destination. It contributed to improving the business environment,
strengthening the financial sector with a more efficient banking system, privatization of the tea
estates, setting up a multi sectoral regulatory body to regulate the telecom and utility sectors
and reinforcing several institutions to improve their service delivery through investment in
equipment and capacity building. Furthermore, the cost benefit analysis showed that the
project resources were efficiently utilized resulting in an ERR of 31 percent. The outcome of
the project is rated as moderately satisfactory due to the fact that not all end -of project
achievements could be attributed solely to the project.


3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
55.    The project was designed and implemented at a time when Rwanda was on its way to
reconstruct the country after the civil war. The objective of the project was to contribute to
poverty reduction by establishing an enabling environment for private sector-led economic
growth. The project brought together several actors of the economy – policy makers,
government officials, institutions working to reduce poverty and the private sector to create an


                                               28
enabling environment that would lead to increased investment, job creation, efficiency in the
system delivery reduction in cost of public goods and disinvestment of the state for a more
efficient allocation of resources. Key performance indicators show the project had a positive
impact on poverty reduction.


3.5.2 Institutional Change/Strengthening
56.    The project was instrumental in fostering the development of several institutions and l
strengthening of others. The project contributed to the establishment of the three Commercial
Courts, Arbitration Centre, One Stop Centre, Doing Business Unit, CAPMER, REIC, ICPAR,
AMIR, RURA, and Tea Authority. The project also contributed to the institutional
strengthening of several agencies within ministries and governmental departments and
agencies. The Drafting department of the MINIJUST, the Investment Promotion department of
RDB (ex-RIEPA), supervisory and Payment Systems Department of NBR, FSDP Secretariat,
SFB, RSB, NPO, RPPA, PSF, KIST, NTB, RHB, Office of Tourism and Conservation,
MIJESPOC, NIC and SSFR were strengthened either through technical assistance, capacity
building program, long term and short term training, study tours, twinning arrangements or
through financing of equipment and software necessary for the entities to operate efficiently.


3.5.3 Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
57.    Rwanda successfully implemented a number of reforms in a relatively short period of
time and was recognized as a top global reformer in implementing doing business reforms in
the Doing Business report. Rwanda emerged as an exporter of knowledge and a key pl ayer in
South-South exchange programs. It hosted several delegations from Africa who visited the
country to learn from the experience of Rwanda in designing and implementing doing business
reforms. Rwanda also confirmed the crucial role of the political economy in the reform
process and how commitment from the highest level in government helps push the agenda
forward.


3.6   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

58.    A half day workshop was held in June 2011 to discuss and validate the Implementation
Completion Report prepared by GoR (refer to Annex 7 for a summary of the report). All
beneficiary institutions attended and provided accurate data and status of their institutions
including sustainable impact of CEDP support.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

59.     Most institutions are operational and are confident that they can sustain themselves
without World Bank financial support. However, a few of them have openly declared that
without the Bank’s support, it would be difficult for them to continue the same way they have
been operating without the Bank’s support. These institutions would either have to get the
funds from Government or review the scope of their mandate. One of the risks that faced by
institutions in Rwanda was the high attrition rate of highly qualified staff.




                                             29
60.    The political situation in Rwanda was relatively stable and there was no risk of reversal
policy reforms that were supported under the project. Furthermore, government showed
ownership of the project and provided the leadership needed to implement the reform program.
This was a strong indication that Government would continue its endorsement and the reforms
would be sustained in the long run. The one risk that could impact on the development
objective was the reorganization of institutions that happened in the past, particularly with
several independent agencies now forming part of RDB: RIEPA, CAPMER and Privatization
Unit. However, RDB has a very strong management team, enjoying support at the highest
hierarchy and would continue with the reform program albeit in a somewhat different manner,
depending on government priorities and response required to changes in the environment. At
project closure, there were some outstanding challenges such as infrastructure and access to
finance that still needed to be addressed but were beyond the scope of the project for a more
vibrant private sector in Rwanda. The risk to the project development outcomes is assessed as
moderate.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1   Bank Performance

5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
61.     The Bank’s performance at design, appraisal and negotiation of the project was
acceptable. The Project was consistent with the Government’s development priorities and the
Bank’s CAS. Possible risks were identified at the preparatory phase of the project and
mitigation measures were outlined. Major lessons learnt from earlier projects were taken on
board and incorporated in the project design. For example there was a strong commitment and
ownership of the reform agenda by the Government and participatory preparation approach
involved all stakeholders. The quality could have been improved by the M&E framework to
facilitate objective data collection and reporting on productivity during implementation. For
example the budget for training and capacity building was substantial but there were no
indicator for capacity building. The project would have gained from more communication
campaigns on the substantive reforms that were carried out. Except for a couple of
information campaigns, the project lacked the development of a proper communication plan
that would have helped inform the targeted stakeholders and the public at large of the reform
agenda and the outcome of the reforms in their daily life. Quality of entry is rated moderately
satisfactory.


5.1.2 Quality of Bank Supervision
62.     Supervision missions were undertaken at least twice a year during project life and were
sometimes supported by sector specialists to address specific implementation issues.
Throughout the ten years of project implementation, there were only three task team leaders
(TTL), which was a relatively low turnover of Bank team leaders. The task team produced
comprehensive aide memoires and issues were promptly brought to Management’s attention
and solutions sought. Moreover, the TTL was based in the field for the latter part of the
project which helped resolve issues as they arose. There was an excellent collaboration
between the Bank’s team, the PCU and implementing agencies. The team should, however,
have been more candid in their ISR assessments which had a “Highly satisfactory? rating for
the IP from 2002 to 2006 despite some major challenges in the implementation of the project.


                                              30
The rating was however downgraded after mis-procurement was reported.                 Quality of
supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.


5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
63.     The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Adequate teams and
resources were fielded during the preparation, appraisal and supervision. The task team
remained pragmatic and flexible by responding positively to GoR’s requests to provide
training and fund capacity building programs to staff of implementing agencies to help achieve
the PDO. The continued Bank engagement and support resulted in additional financing to
scale up the reforms in the financial sector.


5.2   Government Performance

5.2.1 Government Performance
64.     The government was committed to the project and showed effective participation in
project implementation throughout the lifetime of the project, even continuing to support some
critical activities after the closure of the project. GoR showed strong commitment and
ownership in implementing far reaching policy and institutional reforms in a particularly
difficult political and socio-economic context. The government’s completion report of the
project was prepared as requested and submitted to the Bank. The external audits were
submitted to the Bank within the deadline. Government performance is rated satisfactory.


5.2.2 Implementing Agency Performance
65.     The project was coordinated by the PCU with qualified staff, although at the beginning
of the project, the PCU was not fully staffed. As mentioned before, there was a high turnover
at the level of the implementing agencies, making it difficult for the PCU to get well prepared
annual plans and inputs for the procurement plan. Furthermore, there were more than 20
beneficiary agencies during the 10-year life time of the project, rendering the tasks of the PCU
very complex and time consuming. Follow up with each of these agencies, providing quality
assurance in fiduciary functions, preparing IFRs, procurement plan and annual budget was not
an easy task.       After the Mid-Term Review, coordination activities were undertaken
successfully by PCU, especially when it was properly staffed with qualified and experienced
people. And PCU was able to support the implementing agencies in the preparation and
implementation of activities. Submission of annual work programs, yearly budgets, external
audits and other fiduciary functions proceeded in a satisfactorily manner.
66.     Most of the implementing agencies did not have a proper HR plan in place to retain
trained staff and there was a high attrition rate of skilled staff. With no mechanism in place for
the transfer of knowledge, staff had to be retrained causing a delay in the implementation of
some specific activities. Performance of implementing agencies is rated as moderately
satisfactory.


5.2.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
67.    Overall Borrower Performance is rated satisfactory. The government contributed to the
design and implementation of a program that impacted the economy as a whole. Government


                                               31
provided counterpart funding and its performance was satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

Several lessons emerged from this assessment of the project:
68.     Strong political commitment: Aligning operations to country reforms increases the
odds of political endorsement. Political commitment, support and ownership are key conditions
for any operation’s success. To this end, aligning the project’s PDO to current political
priorities increases the probability of securing support from having high level support from
policy the operation to be supported by policy makers. The CEDP was aimed at supporting the
GoR establish an enabling environment for private sector-led economic growth and poverty
reduction in Rwanda. This goal was directly aligned to the priority of the government as it had
embarked on the road to reconstruct Rwanda. Commitment at the highest level to the reform
program provides guidance to the implementing agencies and ensures that everyone was on the
same page. This tends to reduce resistance to change and facilitates dialogue at the technical
level. Strong ownership of the reform program obtained though joint Bank-Government design
of the program linked to the Government’s priority areas of reforms was crucial for fast and
successful implementation, especially when dealing with politically sensitive reforms.


69.    Clear M & E framework: Elaborating a realistic Results Framework with clear
baseline data allows proper monitoring of progress towards performance. In the case of CEDP,
the indicators contained in the PAD’s Results Framework were defined by the Bank team – in
collaboration with the Government – based on uncertain data sources and lacked
methodological clarity. Building the results framework jointly with the Government, and using
Government’s own data, keeping in mind the capacity of public agencies, helps in developing
the monitoring and evaluation culture, and creates the drive for benchmarking. The Doing
Business report is a typical case to illustrate the point made above where everyone knows what
is measured, when and what needs to be done to achieve the outcomes. It is also important to
have a results framework with more tailored KPIs so as to better measure the impact of the
project achievements.


70.    PCU Capacity: The successful implementation of policy and institutional reforms
requires adequate capacity in key areas. This factor will need special attention in the
formulation of future programs. Human capital constraints were a major factor in slowing
down the implementation of some of the program's components and the management of the
project. The PCU also needs to be properly staffed with a trained fiduciary team. One
recommendation is to identify members of the PCU and initiate training on World Bank
guidelines at the design stage such that the PCU team is fully capable of kick starting the
implementation phase as soon as the project is approved.


71.      Decentralization of Project Supervision: In countries with limited institutional
capacity, having the TTL in the field can help to resolve issues as they raise with either the
PCU, Implementing agencies or Government and ensure a constant implementation pace.


72.    Coordination with a wide range of task teams: The project brought together experts


                                              32
across various sectors and units within the World Bank Group and from other donor agencies.
It was challenging to coordinate technical and supervision missions from the different
stakeholders. One recommendation would be to coordinate missions so as to have a common
dialogue on issues to be addressed, action plans to be implemented and agreed roles and
responsibilities of each team.


73.     Innovative support to SMEs: The Business Plan Competition enabled potential
entrepreneurs throughout Rwanda to be aware of the support services provided to SMEs to
start their project. Through this competition, participating SMEs were given mentoring and
hand holding services to conceptualize their business ideas and prepare bankable projects.


74.    Exporter of knowledge: Rwanda was positioned as a pocket of excellence in doing
business reforms and facilitated the replication of the successful reform experiences across the
region through bilateral and regional South-South Exchange programs.

Business and legal environment
The project provided technical assistance to MINIJUST to review obsolete laws in commercial
matters that existed at the start time of the project, and funded legislative drafters to draft the
amendments to existing laws or new laws that were needed. The TA was part funded by the
IFC under their Rwanda Investment Climate Reform project. A total of 13 commercial laws9
were finalized and enacted. The change in legislative framework and implementation of the
reforms allowed Rwanda to be recognized as the world’s top reformer of business regulation in
the 2010 Doing Business Report when the country made it easier to start businesses, register
property, protect investors, trade across borders, and access credit. Three commercial courts
were established and training in commercial matters was provided to judges of commercial
courts and Supreme Court, lawyers, notaries and arbitrators dealing with companies. Rwanda
improved its ranking from 150th in 2008 to 139th in 2009, 67th in 2010, 50th in 2011 and 45th
in 2012.


IFC RICCP provided technical assistance to develop and implement a strategy for promoting
and facilitating private in Rwanda. A new Investment law was enacted and new investment
codes were drafted. As part of the implementation plan, funds from CEDP were transferred to
five Rwanda Embassies in order to support investment promotion abroad and to Canada, China
and India to finance a Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency (RIEPA) Nodal
Office in each of these countries. After the merger of RIEPA with RDB, it was difficult to
obtain investment data that would allow to correctly assess the contribution of CEDP to private
investment flows into Rwanda. However, the Nodal Offices were not very effective in
sourcing investment projects into Rwanda and CEDP stopped its support to these offices
although GoR took over their financing believing that it was important to maintain a presence
in those countries.


The project also contributed to the establishment of the Rwanda Export Investment
Corporation (REIC) to support companies to access long term financing. Since its creation, the
Funds granted only two loans (Kigali Cement Company and VUMA Mines) due to internal
management problems. In May 2011, REIC signed a Management Contract with Business
Partners International and the fund was recapitalized by the shareholders (IFC, SSFR, RHB,
and Rwanda Development Bank) for an amount of US$8 millions. REIC is now expected to
function effectively.


The support of CEDP was critical in the start up activities and service delivery of the Rwanda
Bureau of Standards, even if this activity was not in the included at the design stage. The
project financed the laboratory equipment and chemicals, metrology equipment, office

 The legislations are: (1) Law establishing commercial courts, (2) Law on Arbitration, Mediation and Conciliation in
Commercial Matters, (3) Law Establishing the Business Registration Services Agency, (4) Labor code, (5) Law on
mortgages, (6) Law on securities in movable property, (7) Insolvency law, (8) Companies acts, (9) Competition and
Consumer Protection Law, (10) Draft bill on Provisions applicable on Privately Financed infrastructures, (11) Contract
Law, (12) Condominium Law; (13) Law on electronic transactions. The 14th which is Negotiable Instruments Law has
not yet been enacted.

equipment and necessary software. Four staff members were trained in India and Kenya
Bureau of Standards and consultancy services were financed for in-house mentoring of RBS
staff. At the end of the project, RBS had granted 36 quality certifications (17 Standard Mark
and 19 Excellence Mark) to producers in the area of food processing/agri-business; 480
technical training sessions have been organized in Quality Management System, Food Safety
Management System, and Food Processing for the staff of enterprises. RBS helped Rwandan
enterprises improve their competitiveness and become export oriented.


The CEDP supported the development of a new tariff strategy and a business plan for the
period 2008-2012 with the help of a World Bank Specialist of the Postal Sector. The action
plan was not fully implemented due to lack of funds from NPO.


The project provided support to firm level capacity-building through the Private Sector
Federation and CAPMER (Centre d’Appui aux Petites et Moyennes Entreprises), the Small and
Medium Enterprises support center. Training in entrepreneurship, preparation of feasibility
studies and business plans, marketing and management, Credit Management, organizational
audit and SME diagnosis were funded. The project also supported the setting up of the Masaka
Business Incubation Centre and financing of equipment. In 2008, CAPMER was merged with
RDB, which makes it difficult to assess the impact of the support provided to CAPMER.


Financial Sector
Under the initial financing, the following activities were undertaken: (i) assist NBR in setting
up a Chart of Accountants for the banking sector and a Credit Reference for all business
sectors; (ii) provide technical support to NBR in setting up modern payment system; (iii)
strength the technical capacity of NBR to carry out effective supervision of the banking and
non banking financial institutions; (iv) support the establishment of the School of Finance and
Banking (SFB); and (v) provided US$ 5 million to recapitalize the Union des Banques
Populaires du Rwanda (UBPR) and improve its operational and financial performance.


The recapitalization of UBPR to allow it to write off the portfolio of unrecoverable non
performing loans was a success as it had a net revenue increase to over RWF 900 million in
2005. UBPR graduated to the status of a commercial bank in 2008 when Rabobank became its
strategic partner. With some 500,000 members, the Bank is now the largest financial
institution in Rwanda in terms of market penetration and the third largest in terms of assets
(approximately US$80 million). In addition, the adequacy ratio of the Bank at 19.6 percent in
2010 was higher than the minimum requirement of 15 percent. Two majority government-
owned banks, Commercial Bank of Rwanda and African Continental Bank in Rwanda (now
FINA Bank) were successfully privatized under the project in 2005 through their sale to
strategic foreign investors.


The project provided a fund of US$ 500,000 for the creation of a Leasing Program with the
objective of improving the leasing environment in Rwanda and easing access to finance for
SMEs at reduced interest rates. The Leasing Program was implemented by the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) and by June 2008 there were seven financial institutions providing
leasing finance in Rwanda and the leasing transactions were over US$ 20 million.


                                              37
Technical assistance and equipment were provided to the School of Finance and Banking
(SFB), established in June 2002. Scholarships for lecturers and study tours aiming at
enhancing their capacity, provision of vehicles and all of the equipments required allowed the
new institution to start its activities were funded by CEDP. The SFB started its training
mandate in January 2004 with Bachelors’ and Masters’ degree in Accounting, Finance,
Marketing and Human Resources Management; and ACCA programs. The MBA graduates
have tremendously contributed to enhance quality services in different sector of activities in
the country and the ACCA training have allowed the country to have highly qualified auditors,
accountants and finance managers. Many other tailor-made short courses have also been given
to employees in the financial sector. In addition, the School established a Centre for
Entrepreneurship Development (CED) with a view to foster entrepreneurial skill develo pment
among Rwandans.


Under the Additional Financing, five components were supported by CEDP: (i) improving
access to credit and financial services, (ii) improving accounting and auditing standards, (iii)
contractual savings and non bank financial institutions, (iv) payment systems (ACH and
RTGS), (v) support to the FSDP Secretariat. Activities carried out under the first item were: (i)
support training to Microfinance Supervision Department at NBR; (ii) training MFIs in best
practices (Management, Accounting, Governance, etc); (iii) Accounting and Portfolio
Management Software for selected MFIs; and (iv) institutional capacity building to AMIR
(Secretary General, equipment, software, etc).


The project funded the purchase of office equipment and IT equipment of AMIR, its
accounting software, training and study tours for AMIR’s staff and Board members in Ghana,
Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Burundi. Capacity building of MFIs was carried out with the
support of AMIR and the “Consultative Group to Assist the Poor? (CGAP) prior to the
installation of a Management Information System. The Accounting and Portfolio Management
Software system was implemented in five selected MFI so far and training in the remaining
ones is underway. 468 persons were trained and 35 MFIs staff was certified as trainers to scale
up the training process. There were a total of 103 licensed MFIs at the end of the project and
three reached the status of Micro Finance Banks (Urwego Opportunities Bank, Centre
Financier des Entreprises CFE Agaseke, and IMF UNGUKA). Licensing of new MFIs as well
as off-site and on-site examinations was performed on an ongoing basis.


The inefficiency and lack of soundness of the payment system in Rwanda was contributing to
high transaction costs for businesses. The project supported the NBR in modernizing the
payment systems of the banking sector by putting systems in place to (i) reduce liquidity paid
in cash; (ii) decrease cheques transactions and fraud; (iii) ensure that critical payments are
settled in real time; and (iv) enhance liquidity of banks. More specifically, the following
activities were financed by CEDP: (i) training of NBR staff, including facilitation of staff
participation in local and international seminars; (ii) drafting of a new legal framework for
electronic payments (Automated Clearing House (ACH) and Real Time Gross Settlement
System (RTGS)); and (iii) technical certifications, equipment, software and installation of the
ACH and RTGS system in NBR.

Reducing cost and improving efficiency
The project assisted the GoR in increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the utilities
sector through private corporate management and investment. The project was instrumental in
setting up the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority by financing (i) consultancy studies to
elaborate strategic plan, laws and regulations, ELECTROGAZ measures and tariff; (ii)
capacity building of RURA in specific areas of ICT, Energy, Water, Sanitation and Transport
Sector regulations, short terms courses and participation in seminars; (iii) operational cost and
overhead for office equipment and vehicles. To further strengthen the capacity of RURA, the
Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project provided additional resources to the regulator by
financing additional training for an entire class of RURA and sector staff, led by the Public
Utility Research Center (PURC), at the University of Florida. RURA is now fully able to carry
out its mandate.


The project supported the privatization of Rwandatel in 2005, which was sold for US$15
million which led to an increase of competition in the sector and a greater access to the internet.
In July 2007, the Government, following negotiations with the investor, bought the company
back due to non-compliance with contractual obligations. Rwandatel was once again put up for
sale in November 2008 and was acquired by Lab Green. Rwandatel became the third largest
mobile operator with over 535,000 subscribers, behind rivals MTN Rwanda and Tigo Rwanda,
with 2.3 million and 685,000 users respectively. In April 2011, the mobile license of
Rwandatel was revoked by the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) due to its
failure to meet license obligations, such as quality of service, fulfilling its investment plan, and
increasing its coverage area. In October 2011, the Commercial Court ruled in favour of the
request of Registrar General that Rwandatel be liquidated as it was technically bankrupt and
could not pay off creditors.


The support provided to ELECTROGAZ was as follows: (i) water and electricity production
and distribution equipments; (ii) equipment and expertise in management and communication
systems and for electric pre-payment counters; (iii) training and seminars of staff in water
transport and distribution, quality and standard of hydraulic equipment, human resources
development, power system transmission planning and analysis, study tours in Uganda and
Tanzania Utilities Companies, capacity building hands on in Geographic Information System
(GIS). The project also financed various office equipments and office supplies and a Customer
Information System billing software. ELECTROGAZ (now EWSA) was placed under a five-
year management contract in 2003 to restructure the company prior to partial or full
privatization. The Government terminated the contract in 2005 due to non compliance with
contractual commitments.

           The National Post Office prepared an Action Plan to promote, revitalize and modernize
   postal services; improve the NPO image and management; and strengthen the management
   process (operations, finances, mailings and new products). The project team benefitted from
   the expertise of a World Bank specialist of the Postal Sector in 2006 to improve the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the NPO. After the reforms were carried out, the image of NPO
   among its clients tremendously improved with the last opinion poll made by postal services in
   2009 showing an 88 percent satisfaction rate of post users. A website was created and the
   financial and management system was upgraded through the acquisition of an NPO accounting
   software. Since 2007, the income before tax for three successive years is positive: + 17.1
   million RWF in 2007, + 125.8 million RWF in 2008, and 238.6 million RWF in 2009.


           CEDP financed capacity building of the Privatization Secretariat in Privatization
   Strategy, Asset Evaluation, Financial Audit, Monitoring and Evaluation, Communication, and
   Management of International Contracts. The project also financed consultancy services in
   privatization strategy, audits and asset evaluation for privatization or liquidation. An expert for
   advising the Privatization Secretariat was also recruited and financed by the project. CEDP
   contributed to improve Rwanda’s ability to effectively implement a privatization program.
   The privatization program generated aggregate revenues of RWF 115 Billions, and over of
   97.7 percent of the amount was collected. According to a recent study on evaluation of
   performances of the Privatization Secretariat carried out by RDB, 57 percent are successfully
   operational, complying with their business plan while 43 percent are hardly operating and a
   few of them are not operational at all. The Secretariat is now under RDB after a restructuring
   in 2008.


   The CEDP supported the Private Sector Federation by financing training and study tours to


                                                      40
staff, business association leaders, entrepreneurs and trainers. The project funded an
accounting software package, office supplies and stationary. The number of member
associations increased from 14 in 2001 to 23 in 2010. The project stimulated entrepreneurship
in Rwanda through the establishment of a Guarantee Fund of US$ 400,000 which was used to
reward project developers through a Business Plan Competition (BPC). The BPC contributed
to the creation of 57 SMEs and approximately 285 jobs between 2005 and 2008.


Promotion of a market based tea sector
        The project provided specialized technical assistance for the privatization of the tea
factories and estate. The Tea Board was created, composed of the Director General of OCIR
Thé, the Coordinator of RSSP, Representatives of Tea Cooperatives and Representatives of
Private Business Investors in the Tea Sector. In 2010, the privatization of state owned tea
factories were successfully completed for 7 factories out of the 9 originally selected and the
process is expected to be completed by early 2012 for the remaining two. The price per kilo
for the tea producer increased from RWF 57 in 2001 to RWF 97 in 2010, corresponding to a 70
percent increase. In 2006, when the first privatized tea units became operational, the export
sales increased by 52 percent when compared to 2001. A new body, the National Agricultural
Export Development Board (NAEB) was created in 2009 to oversee the tea sector.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This annex presents the results and methodology followed in the ex-post economic analysis of
the project.

It was difficult to correctly estimate the economic benefits derived from the CEDP as the direct
causal link between the activities funded and the outcomes could not be established. The
project covered a whole range of support to develop a dynamic financial and private sector that
would attract private investment and create jobs with the ultimate objective of reducing poverty.

Two types of benefits accruing to the country were estimated: foreign direct investment flows
and earnings from tea exports. As already mentioned above, the benefits cannot be totally
attributed to the project and for the sake of the analysis and using a conservative approach, 50
percent of FDI and tea export earnings were used. The rationale is that there were 3 main
counterparts involved in achieving the results: the project, GoR and other donors / WB projects.
Furthermore, data weaknesses preclude a more detailed analysis of other benefits to the project.

The financial cost of the project was US$ 46.45 million and was discounted by 10 percent to
estimate the economic cost, which is US$ 41.81 million.

The project benefits resulted in an EIRR of 31.25 percent with an NPV of US$ 8.58 million,
indicating that the project is economically viable and has generated economic benefits to the
country.

The Executive Summary of the Evaluation Report submitted by the Project Coordinating Unit:
1.        The Purpose of the Mission
The purpose of the current mission is to carry out a Final Evaluation of Competitiveness
Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) which is expected to be closed on 31/07/2011. The
CEDP is a 10-year project whose goal is to establish an enabling environment for private sector
led economic growth and poverty reduction in Rwanda. Considering the Additional Financing
received from IDA, the project has supported 26 institutional partners involved in improving the
legal, efficiency and business environment affecting private sector development.
The objective of the final evaluation is to review the support of the CEDP and to carry out an
assessment of the impact of the Project on targets defined under the initial and additional budget.
Specifically, the tasks of the consultant are as follow:
    i)     certify that project implementation will be completed as scheduled;
    ii)    assess the achievements of the project in terms of quality and quantity,
    iii)   evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the means used to achieve the project
           goal;
    iv)    estimate the impact of the project on the reduction of poverty, as well as the project’s
           expected contribution to development and sustainability;
    v)     identify key operational lessons learnt relevant for on-going or future operations both
           for the Government and the World Bank;
    vi)    Re-calculate the economic and financial rates of return to determine the ratio
           costs/benefits of the investments.
2.        The Core Findings of the Evaluation
2.1.      The Project Implementation
The project design was in line with poverty reduction and development objectives defined by the
government. The required supports to implementing agencies were planned and provided,
covering many areas: (i) capacity building through technical assistance and training, (ii)
consultancy services, (iii) equipment and office supplies, (iv) Specific Funds for direct loan or
guarantee, etc. The planned activities were smoothly implemented due to a good collaboration
between the PCU and the implementing agencies on one hand, and the Government of Rwanda
Commitment to accelerate economic reforms toward a more business conductive environment in
Rwanda.
2.2.      Main Achievements and Performances
The project attained its mission and is globally rated satisfactory. At the end of the CEDP, the
project reached the main targets by more than 100 percent compared to the quantified
expectations. All implementing agencies are included in different four (4) levels of performances:

        i.   The former RIEPA is rated highly satisfactory and, due to the performances of
             services offered by RDB investment department, the indicators of “doing business in
             Rwanda? were well ranked in 2010 compared to 2009.
       ii.   Most of the project’s sub-components are rated satisfactory: the implementing
             agencies involved in legal framework, emerging business, financial services,


                                                51
                regulation of public utilities, efficiency in delivering energy and water, privatization &
                private sector, and tea sector.
       iii.     The National Post Office reached its objectives moderately, the limitation encored
                seems to be the financial constraint. The institution did not achieve its objectives
                related to implementation of the business plan and the starting up the integration of
                the financial sector (national and international transfers). The high turnover of
                Managing Directors up to 2006 was also a factor that contributed to the delay of
                implementation of NPO activities.
       iv.      Rwanda Enterprise Investment Corporation is rated unsatisfactory: due to the
                inefficiency in the management.
2.3.         Efficiency and Effectiveness of PCU
Despite some constraints such as high turnover of PCU staff and CEDP representatives in
implementing agencies, the good performances of the project are due to the competence of the
PCU Team, mainly after the project Mid-Term Review. The high level of the disbursement rate
under the Initial Budget (99.9 percent in foreign currency and 106 percent in RWF) indicates
the performance and expertise of the project coordination team in procurement management,
financial management and the good collaboration with implementing agencies.
2.4.         Contribution to poverty reduction, development and sustainability
The project has highly contributed to the economic growth and poverty reduction by
establishing a business environment that contributes to private sector development. The benefits
are more in terms of efficiency, productivity and creation of employment opportunities in the
private sector than the expected reduction of prices.

The project support covered many economic activity sectors and the value of key performance
indicators is beyond planned targets: more SMEs created annually, water and electricity
distributed in urban and rural areas with more rhythm than before CEDP support, financial
benefits from privatization of public enterprises to private investors, etc. In addition to the
economic productivity, the population health was safeguarded through RBS setting standards on
food stuff produced or imported.

The project contributed to the economic development of the Country. It effectively contributed
to the global development objectives, particularly within three macro-economic indicators
during the cycle of project: (i) Average of GDP rate per annum is 9.2 percent (2001-2010), (ii)
Average annual export increment is 13.8 percent during the project period.

3.     Keys Lessons and Recommendations

The following recommendations aim at enhancing the results already achieved, or to reduce
some factors of risks during the sub-components implementation:

3.1.   World Bank/IDA

The closing of the project is scheduled by July 2011. However, by this time, not all components
will have disbursed 100 percent of their allotted budget from the Additional Financing as the
disbursement rate of some sub-components is still low. For instance, the disbursement rate of
“Improving access to credit and financial services? is only 42 percent as of 31/05/2011.
According to CEDP Finance department, the Funds available on 08/06/2011 are RWF 3.12
Billions. As a recommendation, funds reallocation authorization or project extension period
should be granted for the completion of planned activities because some beneficiaries such as
SACCOs, ICPAR, etc are still young and need to be sustained.

3.2.   Government.

       Because the project is closing on July 31, 2011, and due to the weaknesses of SACCOs
       operating at sector level, the Government should negotiate a reallocation of available
       funds under the Additional Financing in order to strengthen their capacity.
        The National Bank of Rwanda does not have enough capacity to supervise all 416
       SACCOs operating in all administrative sectors of the country. Another structure should
       be created for that purpose.
       The implementation of the NPO’s Business Plan requires more support from
       government because its resources are limited. The main challenge is the integration of
       the National Post Office in the financial sector.
       The Government should closely monitor how the contract signed between Business
       Partners International (BPI) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) is implemented.
       The financial resources lie under REIC and are not used for the intended purpose up to
       now (only two credits granted in 5 years) due to the inefficiency in funds management.
       Appropriate loan Funds management tools should be developed to allow managers
       fulfill their tasks.

3.3.    Implementing Agencies:

MINIJUST: Three activity areas need to be reinforced: (i) public sensitization on new
commercial laws, (ii) dynamic harmonization of laws with East African Community and
continuous training on the new laws, (iii) financing of the Documentation Centre to enable all
legal institutions access to updated legal information, business information and case laws.

INVESTMENT PROMOTION (RDB): To accelerate drafting of the law on protection of
intellectual and industrial rights of investors in order to reduce the risk of fraud or piracy in the
East Africa Community manufacturing sector.




                                                 53
National Bank of Rwanda (NBR): In order to fulfill its supervision responsibility over the
Non Banking Financial Institutions, the National Bank of Rwanda needs to reinforce its MFIs
Supervision Department. The current structure of NBR has limited capacity given the
nationwide expansion of MFIs.

Association of Microfinance Institutions of Rwanda (AMIR): To request more funding from
Additional Financing in order to undertake the training program and installing software in
others MFIs not primarily selected.

Rwanda Bureau of Standards (RBS): In view to enlarge the standard control to other areas
with a wide range of products, the RBS should seek more financial support to procure standard
equipment, build the capacity of its staff and continuously keep them updated on the new
technology.

Energy, Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA): This Institution needs to address the
challenge of high cost of energy utility which affects local enterprises competitiveness in the
context of the East African Community. In this regard, EWSA should get more financing and
invest in (i) reducing technical losses of water; (ii) carry out work extension on existing hydro
power plants or build new ones to increase electricity production aiming at price reduction.

Rwanda Private Sector Federation (RPSF): To get financing of the permanent advisor under
the Guarantee Fund managed by Rwanda Development Bank (Monitoring & Evaluation
department). The BPC winners need more sensitization, advice and follow up before and after
starting their businesses.
