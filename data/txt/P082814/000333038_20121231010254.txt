tertiary care facilities, (ii) to increase the effectiveness of the MOH and HIF in formulating and
implementing reforms in provider payments and health system performance, and (iii) to improve
governance and management in the hospital sector.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

                          xiii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Country and Sector Background. Albania’s health care system prior to transition was
characterized by strong central government control over all aspects of the system. Despite a
widespread primary care network focused on antenatal care and immunization, the system was
largely led by secondary care and was highly centralized; the Ministry of Health (MOH) provided
and regulated all health services countrywide, allocated resources and appointed health care staff.
The construction of new facilities was favored over the maintenance and operation of existing
infrastructure, which led to considerable deterioration in facilities and equipment. Inadequate
recurrent expenditures, obsolete drug therapies and outdated medical skills resulted in low quality
of care and inefficient use of resources.

2. Civil unrest and the Kosovo crisis took a heavy toll on the health care system during the
1990s. The violence and civil unrest resulted in extensive damage to health care infrastructure
and in the disruption of essential services, including immunization, surveillance and
environmental health programs. Almost one third of the country’s medical staff abandoned their
posts during the 1997 unrest. The Kosovo crisis in 1999 further strained the system, as over 4,000
refugees were admitted to hospitals, while others were provided accommodation in hospitals for
want of other shelters. Overall, the crisis caused considerable damage, consumed significant
resources, and halted nascent structural reforms in the sector.

3. Overcoming the challenges faced by the health sector required the GOA to consolidate
achievements in health outcomes to date, while establishing the capacity to effectively address the
growing incidence of non-communicable diseases and affording low income groups better
protection from the impoverishing effects of health expenditures. This required fundamental and
systemic changes in the way health care was financed, delivered and organized – specific
improvements are organized among three core pillars: (i) more efficient resource mobilization
and allocation; (ii) improvements in service delivery quality; and (iii) improvements in sectoral
management and stewardship.

4. Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank assistance. The Bank became the key
foreign financier in the health sector in Albania during the 1990s and remained the most
important partner thereafter. The Bank previously supported two health projects in Albania. The
first was successfully completed in 2001 and focused on the reconstruction of the health facilities
network in two regions, as well as limited provider and management training for district health
department staff. The second project closed in January 2005 and was designed to support the pilot
testing of a new organizational set-up in the Tirana region, combined with substantial physical
upgrading at Tirana University Hospital and other facilities in the region. The third project
shifted the emphasis from civil works and pilot testing of reforms to assist in health care policy
formulation and implementation with special emphasis on primary health care and capacity
building.

5. The Bank also completed a health sector policy note that provided key analytical input to
project preparation and supported overall policy dialogue. The Government increasingly looked
to the Bank for support with policy formulation and implementation, and the Bank was well
positioned to offer this based on its extensive experience across the region. The project was an
integral part of the IDA Country Assistance Strategy for Albania, which focused on human

development issues with an emphases on improved service delivery in the social sectors to
appropriately target the poor, continue to address governance and efficiency issues in health and
education sectors and continue supporting the process of decentralization of service delivery
while ensuring appropriate financing levels and controls.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6. The development objectives of this project were (i) to improve both physical and financial
access to and the actual use of high quality primary health care services, with an emphasis on
those in poor and under-serviced areas as well as to diminish the unnecessary use of secondary
and tertiary care facilities, (ii) to increase the effectiveness of the MOH and Health Insurance
Institute (HII) in formulating and implementing reforms in provider payments and health system
performance, and (iii) to improve governance and management in the hospital sector.

7. The wording of the PDO was the same in the main text and Annex 3 of the PAD. Although it
was slightly different in the Financing Agreement, the difference in wording did not alter the
substance.

8. Key performance indicators were:

       At least 70 percent of the population is enrolled with a primary health care provider and
        use him/her as their first source of health care;
       Reduced percentage of households who do not seek necessary health care because they
        cannot afford it and reduced share of household expenditure for primary care services;
       Increased patient satisfaction with Primary Health Care (PHC) treatment and improved
        outcomes for defined health conditions;
       HII is able to live within its overall budget, without additional allocations from the
        Ministry of Finance (MOF);
       Based on agreed key performance indicators, hospitals using new governance approaches
        perform better than those who do not.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9. The project development objectives were not revised.

10. However, the Results Framework was changed in May 2010 to reflect new priorities and
activities included in the project as part of the restructuring. In practice: (i) an additional PDO
indicator on the number of visits to the PHC centers was added, and (ii) two original PDO
indicators regarding financial sustainability of HII and hospital governance were removed.

11. The Intermediate Outcome Indicators were also revised. New output indicators were added to
reflect the new activities included in the Project as part of the restructuring, specifically to
measure: (i) improved managerial capacity of hospital administration, (ii) improved capacity of
all regional hospitals receiving essential medical equipment, (iii) strengthened hospitals’ capacity
to diagnose breast cancer and to dispose of medical waste, (iv) the development of a plan for
privatization of all non-medical activities in regional hospitals, and (v) the development of
hospital rationalization plans. Three indicators were reworded and 14 indicators were deleted
entirely.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12. Project investments directly benefited the Albanian population as a whole through
increased access to primary health care and improved quality of care. PHC workers benefited
directly from upgraded knowledge and skills, improved availability of essential equipment and
increased salaries linked to good performance. Hospital managers benefited from health
management training and improved capacity of health facilities to properly diagnose and treat key
diseases. Health sector institutions benefited from interventions designed to improve governance
through: (i) institutional capacity strengthening to carry out M&E functions and maintain critical
health information systems, development of health care quality improvement system, establishing
continuing medical education (CME) system, computer hardware, software and training; and (ii)
the HII developing its capacity as the sole purchaser of health services and the introduction of
improved provider payment mechanisms that are generating incentives for provider efficiency.
Improved governance and health policymaking are expected to benefit society in the long term
through an assurance of the extension of health care access and quality.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13. The project consisted of the following three components:

14. Component A - Strengthening Sector Stewardship, Financing and Purchasing (base cost
US$6.9 million, total cost US$7.7 million) would help the HII develop its capacity as the sole
purchaser of health services, and would support capacity building to strengthen the stewardship
role of the MOH, the IPH and the HII. Activities would include: (i) capacity building in the HII
and its local branches; (ii) strengthening the policy formulation and performance monitoring
functions within the MOH and the IPH; (iii) development of health information systems to
support payment and management reforms; (iv) development and implementation of a system to
monitor provider performance (both clinical and financial); (v) establishing a licensing scheme
for physicians and health facilities, and an accreditation program for hospitals; (vi) development
of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) capacity; and, (vii) building up MOH capacity in
financial management, procurement and project coordination.

15. Component B - Improving PHC Service Delivery (base cost US$8.9 million, total cost
US$10.1 million) would support institutional reforms and limited investments aimed at
improving quality of care among health care providers and in health facilities. The program
would: (i) facilitate registration of the population with the HII and enrollment with a primary care
physician, together with related public information campaigns; (ii) build practice management
capacity at the primary care level; (iii) develop and introduce clinical guidelines with an initial
focus on primary care and the primary-secondary care interface and the most pressing health
issues (e.g., child health, antenatal care, respiratory infections); (iv) establish a continuing
medical education system (CME) and link this to the re-licensing scheme; (v) retrain existing
general practitioners and pediatricians in evidence based treatment of common conditions and
rational drugs use, based on clinical guidelines; (vi) provide basic equipment to physicians who
complete the retraining program; and (vii) establish a grant facility to fund proposals from
primary care providers in support of quality of care and continuum of care improvement
initiatives.

16. Component C - Strengthening Hospital Governance and Management (base cost US$1.2
million, total cost US$1.3 million) would initiate improvements in hospital operations and
direction by focusing on: (i) the development and introduction of accounting and internal control
structures for hospital care providers and training in hospital management; (ii) developing the


                                                16
regulatory framework, including bylaws and regulations to support the move of MOH hospitals to
the status of autonomous public entities; and (iii) piloting reforms of hospital management and
governance structures in selected hospitals.

1.6 Revised Components

17. See Section 1.7.

1.7 Other significant changes

Project Restructuring.

18. The project has undergone Level II restructuring three times.

(i) First restructuring: May 2010

19. The restructuring included: (i) a revision of the results framework; (ii) a revision, cancellation
and addition of activities, as well as the corresponding reallocation of credit proceeds; and (iii) an
18-month extension of the original closing date from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012.

20. Although the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) remained unchanged, the results
framework was modified to reflect the new activities included in the Project as part of the
restructuring and the unanticipated difficulties in measuring certain indicators. As detailed in
section 1.3 above, one PDO indicator -- on the number of visits to the PHC centers -- was added
and two original PDO indicators regarding financial sustainability of HII and hospital governance
were removed. Six new Intermediate Outcome indicators were added, three output indicators
were reworded and 16 indicators were deleted entirely.

21. Changes in project activities that affected the results framework and required a reallocation of
credit proceeds were as follows:

    (a) New Project activities were added: (i) development of a National Communication
        Strategy and implementation of a national communication campaign (Component 2 -
        Improving PHC service delivery); and (ii) privatization of all non-medical activities in
        the regional hospitals (Component 3 – Strengthening Hospital Governance and
        Management);
    (b) Three Project activities under Component 2 were revised, including: (i) purchasing
         specialized medical equipment (mammography equipment for four main hospitals and
         autoclaves for seven main hospitals); (ii) purchasing medical equipment for the regional
         hospitals; and (iii) production of health identity cards for enrollment in primary health
         care services; and
    (c) The activity Quality Improvement Grants (Component 2) was cancelled and the reasons
         for which are explained in section 2.2 below.

22. The restructured Project included an increase in expenditures for goods to finance the
purchase of hospital equipment, as well as an increase in foreign expenditures for consultants’
services to finance technical assistance supporting the national communications campaign and the
strategy for privatizing all non-medical activities in the regional hospitals.




                                                 17
23. The project’s closing date was extended for 18 months from September 30, 2010 to March
31, 2012 to complete: (i) the procurement of medical equipment for the regional hospitals; and
(ii) the health insurance IT system, including health identification cards for ages 0-16 years old.

(ii) Second restructuring: October 2011

24. The restructuring included the following changes in Project activities:

        (a) A new Project activity -- Testing of the hospital rationalization strategy on a pilot
        basis, in two selected districts, through the provision of consultancy services -- was
        added to the Project;

        (b) As a result of significant delays in the procurement of software (mainly as a result of
        the HII not making a decision about how to go about developing the health insurance
        information system), the Project no longer included procurement of software. However,
        procurement of hardware was financed under the Project as planned, while the GOA
        obtained a commitment from the Government of Austria to finance purchasing of the
        software; and

        (c) The activity -- The facilitation of the registration and enrollment of the population to
        receive primary health care services, through the provision of Unit Costs -- under
        Component 2 was cancelled.

25. The restructured Project included an increase of expenditures (local and foreign) for goods to
finance the purchase of additional medical equipment for hospitals. In addition, it included a
reduction of expenditures (local and foreign) for goods under Component 1 – Strengthening
Sector Stewardship, Financing and Purchasing (since the Bank no longer financed the HII IT
software), as well as a reduction of expenditures under goods as a consequence of the cancelation
of the unit costs under Component 2 – Improving PHC Service Delivery (for primary health care
enrollment).

26. In addition, the Bank declared mis-procurement and cancelled US$1.1 Million from Category
3 (Component 2 – Improving PHC Delivery) as result of a violation of the Bank’s Procurement
Guidelines.

27. Tables 1 and 2 below detail the reallocation of funds as a result of project restructuring:

28. Two new risks were identified during restructuring that might jeopardize achievement of the
restructured Project Outcome targets: (i) the Government does not have an appropriate
distribution/utilization plan for the newly introduced medical equipment for regional hospitals;
and (ii) slow implementation due to possible staff turnover in the MOH. Therefore, the risk rating
was ranked as Average, and mitigation measures were identified and put in place.

(iii) Third restructuring: February 2012

29. A second extension of the project’s closing date to June 30, 2012 was granted in February
2012 to ensure successful completion of two big procurement packages on medical equipment
(amounting to US$3.2 million).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

30. The ICR team rates Design and Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory on the basis of
the following:

31. Financing Instrument. The project was financed through a Specific Investment Loan (SIL)
of US$15.4 million, a Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Co-financing Grant of
US$1.6 million for project implementation, and a Government contribution of US$2.1 million. A
SIL was considered to be the most appropriate instrument since the Government was relatively
new and not yet able to commit to (and thus achieve) the specific triggers that would be needed
for an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). However, to assist the MOH and HII to move towards an
APL and/or a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) in the future, project activities were organized into
“annual work programs? with specific milestones that would trigger the following year’s
activities.

32. Project Design. Despite the range of issues facing the health system, the project was designed
to tackle those which: (a) were most critical to the long-term success of the health reform
strategy; (b) had the potential to have the greatest impact on improving health service access and
the health status of the poor and those in rural and remote areas; and (c) begin to address essential
governance and management issues.

33. Project interventions in the areas of quality of care were targeted at priority areas of
preventable morbidity and mortality, and were expected to contribute to improving the health
status for conditions where Albania lagged behind neighboring countries.

34. Quality at Entry. The project’s quality at entry was Satisfactory based on the following:

35. Soundness of background analysis. As part of project preparation, significant analysis was
undertaken to identify the main issues faced by the health sector, as well as the behavior and
challenges faced by the intended beneficiaries in health care access and quality. The main sector
issues were analyzed in depth and summarized in the Albania Health Sector Note, Report No.
32612-ALB. The Government’s strategies to deal with health care reform issues were also
considered. Further, a social analysis was conducted to examine care-seeking behavior by
socioeconomic groups and the expected social impact of the project; the study focused on four
criteria: (i) access to care; (ii) utilization of care; (iii) out-of-pocket payments; and (iv) patient
satisfaction. Data from the 2002 and 2004 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) and
findings from other qualitative and quantitative studies were also taken into consideration.

36. Assessment of Project Design. The project was designed to build necessary competence to
tackle systemic issues in the health sector that were identified as crucial for the achievement of
better health outcomes for the population (data sources include the National Long Term Health
Strategy approved in 2004, and others). While the design was technically sound and based on
global and country-specific knowledge, it was a complex and challenging operation addressing
the major institutional reforms (health financing and provider payment reform, M&E of health
system and provider’s performance, licensing and accreditation, HTA, health information
systems, and hospital planning and management) with counterparts who had limited policy and
stewardship capabilities. The previous Bank-financed health project in Albania clearly showed
the danger in attempting too many disparate institutional reforms within a single operation. The
Bank team fully realized the risks and tried to make project design straightforward but the level of


                                                 20
local capacity was still overestimated. For example, the project started quite well on all
components and activities, including IT. However, shortly after project launch, the head of the IT
department left, and the new people managing the department (and involved in project activities)
were much less competent; as a result, the implementation of IT activities lagged.

37. A number of project design alternatives were considered. Initially, the team envisioned a
project with expanded scope to include major hospital reform and pharmaceutical policy reform.
This idea was discarded due to the identified policy and stewardship deficiencies of the MOH and
HII, which required strengthening before undertaking a project of the proposed magnitude. A
SWAp alternative was also rejected at project appraisal, but the possibility to restructure the
Project using a SWAp was included in the Financing Agreement. That possibility was not
realized because the MOH had not achieved the fiduciary capacity to disburse funds against
activities and was not strong enough to effectively manage and coordinate a SWAp with donors.
It was also concluded that the DPL alternative would likely separate the Bank from the
operational aspects of health reform implementation; removing the Bank from this aspect of
project implementation was not feasible due to the limited policy analysis and implementation
capacities of the MOH and HII.

38. The project was scheduled to be implemented by the MOH using existing structures and staff.
A decision was made by the Country Management Unit (CMU) to eliminate Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) and this project would be the first one to do so. In principle, this
was the preferred approach and followed the region’s CAS and the Paris Declaration. In reality,
because of the limited fiduciary and procurement capacity of the MOH, the proposed approach
was not implemented. Only the Project Director function was fulfilled by MOH staff -- 4 local
consultants were hired to support him in project implementation and international consultants
were hired to train local consultants on Bank procedures.

39. Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects. The project design addressed
several key lessons learned from the implementation of the previous health projects in Albania, as
well as other health reform projects in the ECA Region. Lessons included the following:

       Contributions from other donors should not be reflected in the project costing and
        activities schedule unless firm commitments have been obtained. In the absence of this,
        explicit arrangements should be included in the Credit financing agreement to ensure that
        these activities can be continued if donor financing does not materialize.
       The inclusion of large infrastructure investments should be carefully considered in
        projects that support substantial sector restructuring. Infrastructure investments may
        divert attention from reforms to service delivery, especially in cases where the line
        agency was still substantially engaged in service delivery and financing of service
        provision rather than policy formulation and governance.
       Monitoring and evaluation indicators should include key benchmarks and decision points,
        especially when activities require substantial implementation time. Time schedules
        should be carefully constructed, allowing an appropriate length of time for each step of
        the process, and should also reflect the experience and expertise of the implementing
        agency.
       Small punctuated Technical Assistance (TA) interventions achieve little, as they fail to
        substantially engage counterparts, do not build up a longer term relationship of mutual
        trust, and do not result in the TA activity becoming an integral part of the implementing
        agency’s work program. A more comprehensive, coherent and longer-term technical
        assistance program is usually necessary.



                                               21
40. Risk Assessment. The PAD identified four potential risks, with ratings ranking from Modest
to Significant, and appropriate mitigation measures were identified. For three out of the four
identified risks, mitigation measures were adequate. However, they were not adequate in relation
to changing the payment method for PHC physicians from salary to capitation. The capitation
payment for PHC was not introduced as planned during project implementation; instead a salary
plus performance-based bonus system was utilized. The introduction of capitation was restrained
by a slow enrollment process and a lack of reliable data needed to calculate the age-sex adjusted
capitation payment.

41. In addition, the PAD did not anticipate nor include a risk associated with possible staff
turnover and lack of capacity in the MOH, which substantially slowed down Project
implementation. The working groups established by the MOH during project preparation were
not functional during the first three years of Project implementation and became operative only
after the 2009 changes in government. This risk was added during the 1st project restructuring and
mitigation measures were identified. An additional risk associated with complex health IT system
implementation was not identified at the PAD stage. The establishment of an integrated HIT
system clearly requires advanced local capacity and strong collaboration between official
government bodies, especially between the MOH and HII. None of these conditions existed in
Albania at the PAD stage, thus this risk should have been identified and risk mitigation measures
detailed and implemented.

42. Adequacy of participatory processes. Project preparation was a collaborative effort between
many stakeholders and with active participation by national working groups. This operation was
prepared in close coordination with other development partners involved in the Albanian health
sector, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swiss
Development Cooperation (SDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Commendable
efforts were made during project preparation on the part of the task team and engaged leadership
of the Ministry to involve working groups from implementing departments, assess reform
feasibility and phasing, agree on annual performance reviews and budget long term technical
assistance.

43. Adequacy of government commitment. At project preparation, the government demonstrated
a high level of commitment to the objectives of the project: (i) objectives of the project were
consistent with the National Long Term Health Strategy; (ii) working groups were established at
the MOH to support project preparation; (iii) the National Center of Quality, Safety and
Accreditation of Health Institutions was established in 2005 -- it played a key role in developing
the Quality Improvement component and establishing a hospital accreditation system, and had
already undertaken substantial work on the establishment of quality standards for hospitals; and
(iv) the MOH committed to extending the contracts by two years for the financial management
specialist and procurement specialist from the previous Bank-financed health project.

2.2 Implementation

44. The ICR team rates implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. The project was successful
in delivering most of the outputs under the three components, albeit with delays that necessitated
the extension of the closing date by 21 months. It was mostly successful in achieving PDO
indicators and almost all intermediate indicators (see details in Table 1, Annex 2, Section 3.2, and
data sheet). The Project was rated either Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory during its life, in
terms of both Development Objective (DO) and Implementation Progress (IP). The exceptions
were a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for DO and IP in December 2008 (as a result of the Mid-
Term Review) and a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for IP in February 2008. Project


                                                 22
implementation had a slow start - the most serious delays were experienced in the implementation
of two main project activities, including: (i) purchasing of the IT system for the HII; and (ii)
production of health cards for the entire population. This led to a level II project restructuring in
May 2010. The MOH also decided not to pursue the implementation of the "quality improvement
grants" designed to finance local government initiatives to improve primary health care services.
Instead, the funding was used to strengthen the capacity of the regional hospitals with medical
equipment (including mammography and autoclave specialized equipment). Following the
restructuring, project implementation showed good progress overall. All project activities were
carried out as planned, with the exception of the software and hardware for the HII. By project
end, procurement of the hardware for HII was successful, while the GOA obtained a commitment
from the Government of Austria to finance purchasing of the software. This change in financing
arrangements led to the second level project restructuring, which was requested by the Republic
of Albania and approved by the Bank in September 2011. The funds originally planned to procure
the software for the HII information system were reallocated to support the reform in the hospital
sector by providing medical equipment for regional hospitals and testing the national
rationalization plan for hospitals in two pilot regions.

Positive factors and events that influenced project performance

45. Flexibility was exercised within the parameters of the PDO to give priority to pressing
issues. Both the MOH and the Bank team demonstrated flexibility at various stages of
implementation that allowed for adjustments to make project interventions more focused, better
reflective of evolving needs, and more closely aligned with the overall reform agenda. For
example, in order to overcome delays in the implementation of the quality improvement grants
and health cards, funds were reallocated during the first restructuring to purchase mammography
equipment and autoclaves for the regional hospitals. Similarly, the second restructuring in
September 2011 reallocated funds from the procurement of software for HII to further support
hospital sector reform.

46. Close coordination and collaboration with development partners helped keep key activities
on track and ensured complementarities of interventions. The Project was implemented in close
coordination with other donors, including USAID, WHO and SDC. The Project complemented
activities of the USAID-funded Primary Health Care project focused on health care financing and
systems strengthening, health information systems, and improved PHC service delivery and
access in five regions. To improve the PHC providers’ knowledge and skills in the main areas of
PHC services, the Project supported the scaling up of Family Medicine training successfully
piloted by the USAID project. The Project collaborated with SDC in establishing a Center of
Continuing Education for the health sector. To maximize the development impact agreements
were reached and implemented in providing specified inputs (e.g., equipment), while other donors
provide technical assistance or training services.

Less effective factors and events that affected implementation

47. Frequent management and institutional changes. Project implementation suffered a slow
start, mainly due to frequent changes in the leadership of the MOH. Shortly after the onset of
project implementation, April 2007, the Minister of Health was replaced, and the new minister
subsequently removed all of the directors of the MOH, except the Director of the Economic
Department, who was also the Project Manager. In addition, senior staff who were part of the
working groups and responsible for component implementation were replaced early on during
project implementation, causing significant delays. During the project period, the Minister of
Health changed six times, and with each change, there were changes in senior level positions in


                                                 23
the Health department and hospitals. Because of these frequent changes, the task team had to take
time to introduce new Ministers and staff to the Project, which adversely affected and, ultimately,
delayed project implementation.

48. Weak project management capacities in MOH caused delays. Implementation was delayed
in the early years due to weak project management capacity. To bring the Project back on track,
the Bank requested the MOH to pay special attention to the performance of the Project
management structure and establish working groups. As a result of weak institutional capacities,
disbursements reached only 8.6 percent of Credit proceeds at the time of the MTR (December
2008) and the rating for overall implementation progress was downgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

49. Lack of ownership. According to the Financing Agreement for the HSMP between the Bank
and the Government of Albania, “three Working Groups shall oversee the technical
implementation issues relating to: (i) health financing; (ii) health quality improvement; and (iii)
hospital governance and management. Each Working Group shall be comprised of representatives
of the MOH, the Health Insurance Institute, the Institute for Public Health, and other stakeholders.
The Working Groups shall be responsible for the coordination and technical management of the
Project activities.? These working groups were not established until MTR; a negative result of
this delay was a good portion of technical work was done and reports were written with
recommendations that were never read and never implemented. Thus, it was agreed during the
MTR with the Minister that these three working groups would be institutionalized immediately
with Terms of Reference and a work plan. The need for continuity and commitment among
Project Coordinators was also highlighted.

50. Lack of cooperation and coordination between the MOH and the HII was a major
bottleneck in the implementation of the IT component. There was a delay in completing the
Information Technology (IT) system for the Health Insurance Institute, including production of
health cards for group ages 0-16 years old (estimated at US$4.5 million equivalent). While there
was good progress in proceeding with procuring the hardware that formed part of the IT package,
procurement of the software suffered significant delays. Key reasons for the delay were: (i)
change in Government decision on producing the health cards for the whole population; and (ii)
lack of decision from the HII and MOH on the required software for developing the health
insurance information system. The GOA obtained a commitment from the Government of Austria
to finance purchasing of the software. However, the purchasing is currently still in process.

51. Quality Improvement Grants were cancelled. The quality improvement grants
subcomponent was expected to finance initiatives in primary health care at the local level. The
government demonstrated a clear lack of ownership and interest in implementing this activity by:
(i) not establishing the required unit responsible for fiduciary matters; (ii) leaving undefined
eligibility and selection criteria grant procedures; and (iii) not carrying out a public information
campaign nor promotion or sensitization activities. Thus, the decision was made to reallocate
proceeds to other priority activities.

52. Delays with procurement also affected implementation at various stages. The Project
suffered implementation delays due to procurement complaints received at various stages of the
procurement process for medical equipment, e.g. bidding period, evaluation and contract award.
The investigation related to the activity that was mis-procured largely affected the timely
completion of the entire medical equipment tendering process.




                                                24
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

53. M&E design. Specific indicators of progress toward achieving development objectives were
carefully developed in collaboration with the Borrower and reflected a pragmatic, staged
approach. For example, the key PDO was capacity building to deliver quality primary health care
services to underserved populations, especially in rural and remote areas. The main activities for
reaching this PDO were the procurement of basic medical equipment, enhancing the management
and clinical skills of general practitioners and reducing the financial barrier to accessing medical
care – all of which bolster the government’s ability to effectively deliver quality, affordable
health care to those who need it most.

54. The initial Results Framework included a number of targets that were too ambitious both in
terms of the ability to achieve them and the ability to monitor them correctly. The first
restructuring simplified the Results Framework by deleting 14 key performance indicators,
however the process by which improvements in outcomes for defined health conditions was to be
measured was not clearly defined nor appropriate indicators set -- it is hard to confirm now if
targets were achieved.

55. The Results Framework also did not set forth indicators to measure increasing efficiency in
the system like reducing Average Length of Stay (ALOS) and level of hospitalization.
Furthermore, the set of PDO Indicators and Intermediate Outcome Indicators does not include
any indicators to measure: (i) improved capacity of HII and its local branches; (ii) strengthening
MOH capacity in financial management, procurement and project coordination; and (iii)
improved hospital governance.

56. M&E implementation. The MOH regularly collected data to track progress towards
achieving the Project outcome indicators and intermediate outcome indicators developed during
project preparation. However, the Project team experienced difficulties collecting the data for
certain indicators due to delays in carrying out the Living Standards Measurement Survey and
Household Budget Survey.

57. M&E utilization. M&E was used under the Project not only as a management tool to evaluate
the status of the implementation of activities, but also to inform policy makers to help prioritize
activities to support the reform agenda. One of the challenges faced by the Project was the
introduction of a well-defined M&E framework with performance indicators by which the MOH
and HII could monitor the effectiveness and quality of service provision in primary, secondary
and tertiary care. With technical assistance provided under the Project, a working group led by
the MOH developed a vision, framework and health system performance outcome indicators for
monitoring health sector policies, programs and institutions. 137 indicators were agreed upon and
the regional institutes of public health were put in charge of completing the forms and data entry.
The working group is responsible for analyzing the status of the indicators and producing the
Annual Health System Performance Assessment Report for policy makers to identify areas where
policy changes are needed. To date, data on 60 indicators have been collected and included in the
annual report.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

58. Safeguard issues. There were no safeguard issues as this Project only financed consultant
services, training and limited low-technology equipment. This Project was assigned a Category C.




                                                25
59. Financial Management. The Project’s financial management arrangements were satisfactory
throughout the implementation of the Project – necessary internal controls were in place, as well
as adequate disbursement, staffing, reporting and auditing arrangements. Audits of the Project’s
financial statements were completed on time and results did not show any major irregularities.
The quarterly unaudited financial reports were submitted in a timely manner, with few exceptions.
Such reports were generated automatically from a specialized project management software
package, developed and customized by an Albanian Company. Furthermore, the financial
specialist responsible for the Project had the appropriate skills and abilities to manage the
Project’s financial management and disbursement issues. The Project management unit also had
adequate internal controls for the Project, including regular reconciliation of bank accounts,
adequate segregation of duties, and performed monthly reconciliation of the Bank’s disbursement
summaries with project accounting records. The counterpart financing received from the
Government was satisfactory during the project life.

60. Procurement. The PMU had the appropriate skills and abilities to implement the project.
However, they did not have sufficient capacity to prepare technical specifications for medical
equipment, which caused delays in preparing bidding documents. Despite the enormous amount
of complaints (and the Bank declaring mis-procurement on one lot) received on procurement of
medical equipment, the PMU was still able to complete the procurement of all packages in the
procurement plan. However, the PMU performed very well in the selection of consultants.

61. In August 2011, the Bank declared mis-procurement for the activity set out under
Component 2 – Improving PHC Service Delivery with regards to procurement of medical
equipment, as a result of a violation of the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines. In accordance with
Section 6.03 of the applicable General Conditions incorporated by reference in the Financing
Agreement, the Bank cancelled US$1.1 million from Category 3 (Goods).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

62. Transition arrangements. The transition arrangements for the future operation of the Project
appear to be adequate, as demonstrated by the following:

       Policies. The Government has approved the Health Financing Law and Rationalization
        Plan for hospitals and is in the process of implementing it. In order to further strengthen
        and sustain the reforms, the Government will need strong support from the Bank.

       Budgeting, staffing and management. There are no issues as these areas are functioning
        effectively due to hands-on experience managing the Project. Adequate staff is in place
        and management has the necessary skills, experience and training to continue manage the
        Project.

63. Impact Evaluation. It is important to conduct an impact evaluation one year after project
closing in order to assess the sustainability of the Project’s achievements, as well as to gain
insight into the type of support the Government may need from the Bank.

64. Follow-on project. The Government is interested in a follow-on project that will further
support the on-going reforms in the sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

65. The objectives of the Project are fully relevant to the country’s social and economic
development, as well as timely and appropriate to the needs of Albania. The PDOs were fully
relevant to the priorities of the Government in reforming the health sector (including the National
Strategy for Development and Integration, as well as the National Long Term Health Strategy). In
addition, the PDOs have served to outline a framework against which key sector reform
challenges can be overcome, which clearly falls under one of the main pillars of the current
Country Partnership Strategy for Albania for the period FY11-FY14 (Report No. 54188-AL)
focused on broadening and sustaining social gains by improving education and health services
and establishing an adequate safety net.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

This evaluation rates achievement of PDO as Moderately Satisfactory. Although the Project
achieved all 4 outcome indicators according to the information provided by the MOH and based
on the results of the Household Survey conducted in May-June 2012, there is no strong evidence
suggesting that the PDO target related to patient satisfaction and improved outcomes for defined
health conditions was achieved. Additionally, this evaluation finds that the PDO indicators did
not attempt to measure results of improved capacity building. The ICR evaluation was based on
analyses of outcome indicators and data linked to the development objectives of the Project, as
well as on an evaluation of how project activities were linked to the achievement of the PDO.
Table 3 illustrates how individual PDO indicators and intermediate outcome indicators were
linked to the achievement of each of the three PDOs.

66. Achievement of PDO 1: Improve both physical and financial access to and the actual use
of high quality primary health care services, with an emphasis on those in poor and under-
serviced areas as well as to diminish the unnecessary use of secondary and tertiary care
facilities. All four PDO indicators were linked with PDO 1. The Project has led to important
achievements in: (i) improvement of overall access and actual use of PHC services; (ii) increased
patient satisfaction with PHC treatment; (iii) reduced percentage of households not seeking health
care because of financial burden and reduced share of household expenditures for primary care
services; (iv) expanded enrollment with a PHC provider; (v) provision of essential medical
equipment to PHC centers; and (vi) re-training existing general practitioners and pediatricians in
evidence-based treatment of common conditions.

67. It is important to highlight positive achievements in the actual use of PHC services by the
Albanian population. The number of visits per capita per year has met the target of 2 visits (based
on the preliminary results of the Population and Housing Census 2011). The number of people
who visited their PHC doctor for the first time increased by 1.5 times for the period 2008-2011.
And, the total number of visits to PHC physicians increased by 1.4 times for the same period.

68. This positive trend could be attributed to a number of different project-related factors: (i) the
introduction of new payment methods for PHC physicians that linked their performance to
results; (ii) better quality of PHC services due to improved knowledge and skills; (iii) the
introduction of new evidence-based clinical guidelines; (iv) improved equipment in PHC centers,
(v) strengthening the enrollment process; and (vi) an informed population due to the reform’s
communication strategy.

69. The household survey conducted by the Albanian Institute of Public Opinion Studies 2 in
May-June 2012 suggests increased patient satisfaction with PHC treatment over the last two years
of project implementation. The data shows an increase in the extent to which patients perceive
that family doctors are sufficiently qualified and behave professionally. The survey demonstrated
that almost all households (98 percent) provided a positive answer to the question “Are you
happy with the health care services currently received by you and your family in the last two
years?? compared with 88.4 percent who expressed similar satisfaction in 2005 according to the
LSMS survey. However, an analysis of households’ responses indicates that the population still
has a high level of concern with the quality of care provided: 38.5 percent of households prefer to
go to a hospital directly, 28.5 percent answered that they don’t get the treatment they need and
25.4 percent think that health care centers do not have the necessary equipment. While 73.6
percent of respondents have noticed positive changes in quality of care, 24.5 percent replied that
it is still bad. Unfortunately, the LSMS survey was conducted in 2008 and it is not possible to
identify the exact percent of improved patient satisfaction, as the questionnaire used by the
Institute of Public Opinion Studies is not identical with the LSMS questionnaire.

70. There is no proper data to assess if outcomes for defined health conditions have improved as
a result of project activities. Albania, like other countries in epidemiological transition, is facing
an increase in non-communicable diseases. The major causes of death are similar to those in
developed countries: diseases of the circulatory system, neoplasms and accidents. The 2008-2009
Albania Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS) indicated that 79 percent of women and 90
percent of men who were identified as hypertensive were unaware of their condition. Only 3
percent of women and 1 percent of men who were aware of their hypertension, are treating it
along with their blood pressure being controlled. The preliminary results of a provider survey
conducted in five countries in the ECA region also reveal significant shortcomings in quality of
care (Figure 1).

 Albanian Institute of Public Opinion Studies conducted household surveys in May-June 2012 in order to
measure and track progress of main performance indicator achievement by the Project.

71. Nevertheless, the Project supported institutional reforms and investments aimed at improving
quality of care among health care providers and in health facilities. All health centers in the
country have been equipped with the basic set of medical equipment to provide better diagnostic
and treatment services to patients with specific focus on the management of chronic diseases.

72. The Project has contributed to the improvement of the PHC provider’s knowledge and skills
scaling up the Family Medicine training initiated by the USAID project. 631 PHC doctors from
three regions were successfully trained over a three-month long period using a “training of
trainers? approach. Family Medicine training was complemented by the Quality Improvement
Training component to contribute towards the growing need for introducing a quality culture and
principles as well as quality improvement methods in the health care settings particularly in PHC.
Additionally, General Practitioners (GPs) were trained in implementation of clinical guidelines
developed with project support.

73. The Project has been instrumental in reducing financial barriers to PHC. According to the
results of the household survey conducted by the Albanian Institute of Public Opinion Studies,
the percentage of households who are not seeking health care because of the financial burden, as
well as the share of household expenditures for primary care, has been reduced by 30 percent.
While the initial plan was to measure the achievement of the target based on INSTAT data, the
INSTAT data were not available at the time of this report.

74. Enrollment of the population with PHC provider – the PDO indicator was achieved – 70
percent of the population is enrolled with a primary health care provider. The program facilitated
registration of the population with the HII and enrollment with a primary care physician, together
with related public information campaigns. The identification of the number of residents
registered with GPs in all PHC centers was one of the most important steps achieved by the HII.
This process consisted of two phases:
     The first phase was completed with the support of GPs who actively registered all
         resident and non-resident population in their catchment area.
     During the second stage, the HII in collaboration with PHC centers, thoroughly checked
         data in the electronic register to clean duplications, made accurate identification of
         displaced or dead people and registered new residents in order to identify the exact
         number of residents registered with each family physician. The creation of an electronic



                                               30
        database capturing information on the population registered with a GP helps the HII to
        link its budget with the number of people served by GPs; hence improving the payment
        scheme for doctors.

75. Another important component was the development of the IT system for PHC centers to
support enrollment of the population with PHC doctors, and carry out monitoring and assessment
of health center performance and the calculation of bonuses based on results assessments. The
Project supported the purchase and distribution of computers and printers to 419 Health Centers
and a large number of servers for the regional health directories to consolidate information from
Health Centers.

76. Achievement of PDO 2: Increase effectiveness of the MOH and HII in formulating and
implementing reforms in provider payment and health system performance. The Results
Framework does not include PDO indicators directly linked with this PDO. However, it is clear
that the increased effectiveness of the MOH and HII in formulating and implementing health
sector reforms contributed to the achievement of the following key PDO indicators: (i) number of
visits per capita per year to PHC centers; (ii) increased patient satisfaction with PHC treatment;
(iii) reduced percentage of households who do not seek necessary health care because they cannot
afford it; and (iv) at least 70 percent of the population is enrolled within a PHC provider.

77. With the support of the Project, significant progress has been achieved in developing the
HII’s managerial capacity as the sole purchaser of health services, implementing performance
based payment system for PHC providers, addressing internal controls and governance of the HII
and strengthening HII capacity in providing performance analysis and contracting. It is difficult,
however, to specifically attribute to this Project the success of these achievements as often the
activities under the Project complemented those supported by other interventions from domestic
and international resources (for instance, the USAID project).

78. The HII role as the only purchaser of public health service packages reduced fragmentation in
financing arrangements and created an environment for the implementation of performance-based
incentives for PHC providers. After January 2007, HII/RDHI established contracts with almost
420 Health Centers (HC) countrywide. The contracts are based on the basic packages of services.
1,625 General/Family Practitioners and 6,636 nurses were contracted to provide general services
at health care facilities.

79. Strengthening the capacity of the HII to implement a more efficient performance-based
payment system for PHC providers led to the introduction of bonus payments for PHC doctors
and nurses linked with performance and quality of services offered to patients. In the first half of
2012, about 2,000 family physicians and specialists and 6,600 nurses benefited from increased
pay as a result of performance bonuses.

80. The development of information systems was partially completed, as only the hardware for
HII was purchased. As a result of serious delays in decision making from the HII side, the
software part had to be canceled under the Project and financed by the Austrian cooperation. The
initial objective of issuing the health insurance membership cards for the insured population was
also not achieved. Although the health financing law promises universal coverage, the HII does
not know the exact number of insured members. An insurance booklet is being used instead of
health insurance ID cards. Since the GOA has issued ID cards with general information, the HII
initiated a revision of its database to exclude duplications and link personal information in the HII
database with ID numbers.



                                                 31
81. The Project provided technical advice to the HII on reviewing and improving draft health
insurance legislation. Finally, Law 10383/2011 on “Compulsory Health Care Insurance? was
approved and will become effective in April 2013. This will improve governance, transparency
and the financial sustainability of the health care system.

82. Equally, the Project has been instrumental in strengthening the MOH’s capacity to formulate
health policies through the provision of technical assistance and training of staff. A number of
strategies and legislation were developed with support from the Project, which if implemented
effectively, will further contribute to improving the efficiency and quality of health care: (i)
health sector strategy; (ii) a legislative and regulation framework for the accreditation process of
health institutions; (iii) framework for monitoring health sector policies, programs and
institutions; and (iv) a national policy document and monitoring mechanisms to improve the
safety of hospitals and hospital infection control.

83. The Project significantly strengthened the performance monitoring function within the MOH.
An M&E working group established by the MOH developed with the Project support a detailed
vision, 137 health system performance outcome indicators and a participatory process for
strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation in the health sector. The implementation of this
vision is now the responsibility of the M&E Sector at the MOH that delivers semiannual M&E
reports for policy makers. The M&E working group became an effective mechanism for
coordinating across national health institutions. The MOH has obtained support from USAID to
further develop this system.

84. The Project played an important role in establishing the foundation for institutionalizing the
concept of quality improvement, which consists of a licensing and accreditation system, a health
technology assessment function and developing and implementing evidence-based clinical
guidelines. One of the important results of the Project was the establishment of a licensing and
accreditation function at the National Center of Quality, Safety and Accreditation of Health
Institution (NCQSA-HI) that is responsible for the periodic re-licensing of health care personnel,
in both public and private sectors, and the accreditation of public and private Albanian health
institutions. The Project provided significant TA in improving licensing and accreditation
regulations, thus creating a basis for expanding licensing and accreditation practices. At the time
of the ICR mission, accreditation of public and private health institutions was granted on a
voluntary basis by the NCQSA-HI.

85. The Project supported the development of a strategy for the institutionalization of a Health
Technology Assessment (HTA). A Knowledge Center was established in December 2010 to
support the institutionalization strategy (instead of the implementation of a software as originally
planned). Training in Evidence-based medicine (EBM) and HTA substantially improved the
understanding, knowledge and skills of health care managers.

86. Nevertheless, there is still very little familiarity with HTA and EBM among Albanian health
professionals, hospital managers or staff of the MOH and associated agencies. Even more so,
there is a lack of people who possess the full spectrum of skills and knowledge that would enable
them to produce HTA analysis, or apply the results of HTA analysis in health policy making.

87. Evidence-based clinical guidelines were developed and disseminated with project support,
although only 5 of the targeted 6 new clinical practice guidelines were developed for priority
diseases using the standardized approach.




                                                32
88. The Project improved the capacity of the Institute of Public Health to maintain the health
database by purchasing a joint data warehouse (including server, hardware and licenses) for the
health sector.

89. Achievement of PDO 3: Improve governance and management in the hospital sector. The
Results Framework does not include PDO indicators directly linked with this PDO. The
following are key achievements under this component: (i) hospital management training, with a
total of 230 trained staff in the main tertiary and regional hospitals; (ii) development of the
national rationalization plan for hospitals (including strengthening of a limited number of regional
hospitals and transferring the others to PHC facilities); (iii) piloting the rationalization plan and
reforms in hospital management in two regions; (iv) developing the plan for outsourcing of non-
medical services in the hospitals; and (v) developing the framework for provider payment
autonomy in the hospitals.

90. The Project strengthened the Tirana hospital’s capacity by purchasing medical equipment for
the cardiology and pediatric departments. This equipment improved the population’s access,
especially the poor, to new high quality medical interventions that before were available only in
private hospitals. The procurement of this equipment also directly impacted doctors who
participated in public post-graduate programs that were held only in the Tirana hospital.

91. Hospital managers and administrative staff in hospitals were trained in general and financial
management using a “trainer of trainers? approach. This Project has resulted in the successful
training of 190 hospital managers and other employees within the Albanian health care system.
As the first continuing education course accredited by the National Center of Continuing
Education, the Project serves as a model for the development of other continuing education
courses for managers in health care. Additional efforts and commitment of the MOH are needed
in order to maintain this training program under its own sponsorship or in collaboration with
other Albanian agencies that have an interest in ensuring improved management competence.

92. The Health facility rationalization strategy was developed to build a more effective and
rational secondary health care framework serving local needs and ensuring that both the
necessary skills and appropriate equipment are available and effectively used. The
implementation of this strategy comprises working simultaneously with a number of key issues,
including: (i) introducing the legal bases for the reform; (ii) redefining operational arrangements
to build regional referral networks; (iii) defining and strengthening the Regional Hospitals
(equipment, training, etc); (iv) reshaping the role of several district hospitals as ambulatory
centers; (v) defining, in partnership with the HII, the basic package of services based on Albanian
standards; and (vi) communication to the public.

93. Implementation of Hospital Governance. A framework for outsourcing non-medical services
that can be applied to support the MOH in the tendering process was developed. The MOH and
the Government are currently working on related political decisions on the implementation of the
framework. Three hospital management teams were trained in the implementation of hospital
corporatization - in Shkodra and Korca Regional Hospitals and the Tirana Health Center.

3.3 Efficiency

94. Based on the original estimations of efficiency in the original PAD (no changes were made
during two project restructurings), the expected direct and indirect benefits are related only to
project component B - strengthening of primary health care services. The task team found the
following efficiency gains: (i) decrease in unnecessary hospital bed days due to improved quality


                                                 33
of primary health care; (ii) reduction in unnecessary referrals to specialist care; (iii) reduction in
out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures for travel costs; (iv) averted productivity losses; and (v)
benefits of reduced mortality. Both the direct and indirect benefits from the component B of
project were estimated. The direct and indirect benefits from the component B and the methods
of estimation followed are presented in Annex 3.

95. The measures of economic efficiency under the base case scenario and three alternative
scenarios are presented in Table 5 (see Annex 3 for a description of the base case and the three
alternative scenarios). Under the base case scenario, the project yielded 18 percent Economic
Rate of Return and a Benefit : Cost ratio of 1.45. The sensitivity analysis showed that the even
under conservative assumptions the discounted project benefits covered costs resulting in modest
returns to investment. The rates of return from the project are modest and are justified.

96. The project is expected to yield reasonable returns over the next few years. The operation
and maintenance costs are not significantly high when compared with the public expenditures in
the health sector in the country. So the recurrent cost impacts of the health sector modernization
project are negligible.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97. The rating is based on both relevance of project objectives and a sound design that focused on
systemic issues. The rating is also based on the achievement of PDOs as discussed above in
section 3.2. The Project was implemented according to plan with few shortcomings. While an
evaluation of efficiency using traditional measures was not deemed practical, this evaluation
cannot verifiably rate the extent to which PDOs were efficiently achieved. However, the data
does show that the Project contributed to the shift of care from an inpatient care delivery model to
one that increasingly provides more accessible outpatient care.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

98. The system improvements achieved through the Project, such as those that improved the
affordability of primary health services, had a positive impact on the poor. PDO indicator 3 was
achieved and shows a 30 percent reduction in the number of households who avoid necessary
health care because they cannot afford it. The Project had no direct impact on gender inequalities
and social development.




                                                 34
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

99. The Project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact. During ICR
discussions with the MOH, HII, NCQSA-HI, regional health authorities and health facilities, and
managers and staff, it was recognized that project investments, including investments in capacity
building and technology, have resulted in substantial institutional development. Significant
progress was made through the Project to improve the capacity of the MOH, HII and health care
institutions’ staff to deal with modern management and policy analysis. The Project’s strong
focus on training and capacity building are more than likely to be sustained over time.

100.     The Project was also responsible for supporting reforms in primary health care delivery
and provider payment mechanisms, and these have also been institutionalized making it unlikely
that these outcomes could be reversed. This Project was instrumental in supporting the
development and adoption of new guidelines; the training of doctors and staff of the MOH, HII,
IPH and NCQSA-HI; and the dissemination and sharing of the tools that were developed as
discussed in the sections above.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

101.      The risk at the time of the ICR that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) will
not be maintained is rated Moderate. Although the MOH, HII and other institutions’ ownership
and commitment to sustaining gains are relatively strong at this writing, as shown at various
stages of implementation, this could change with new managers being appointed and evolving
priorities. Specifically:

       There is the risk of the IT application system not being implemented due to lack of
        resources. However, the government is trying to get adequate resources from donors to
        design and implement software applications, in which case IT equipment will be used to
        run these applications; and

       Without the Bank or other development agencies’ support, the MOH may not have
        adequate capacity to make fully operational the system of licensing and accreditation,
        HTA, development of clinical guidelines based on EBA and the system of continuous
        medical education, as well as the implementation of the hospital rationalization strategy.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory


                                               35
102.       The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation and appraisal of the Project
was satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of
project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and
institutional, including procurement and financial management. A number of alternatives were
considered for project design. In addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from other
earlier projects in the health sector in Albania were considered and incorporated into project
design.

103.      Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who
provided the technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a sound project design.
The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and budget to ensure quality
preparation and appraisal work. The Project was consistent with government priorities in the
health sector at the time. The Bank maintained a consistently good working relationship with the
Borrower during preparation and appraisal.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

104.     The Bank's performance during the implementation of the Project was satisfactory.
Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the Project was adequately and
intensively supervised and monitored. The task team regularly prepared Aide-Memoires and
alerted Government and the PIU to problems with project execution and facilitated remedies in a
timely manner, in conformity with Bank procedures. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs)
realistically rated the performance of the Project both in terms of achievement of development
objectives and project implementation. The task team also monitored safeguard and fiduciary
compliances.

105.     The Bank’s procurement and financial management staff worked with the PIU staff to
explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project implementation with regard to
procurement of goods and works, and selection of consultants, accounts and audits, based on the
Financing Agreement. Despite the fact that mis-procurement was declared in the amount of
US$1.1 million, the Bank put significant efforts into discussing the issue with the MOH than over
the course of a 10 month period; these discussions included the participation of the Bank’s RVP,
as well as the CD and CM. On an exceptional basis, more than two extensions were provided to
give the MOH the possibility to revise their decision. Nevertheless, the Minister of Health
insisted on maintaining their procurement decision as per the Albanian Public Procurement Law,
hence the Bank CD deemed it necessary per Bank guidelines to declare mis-procurement.

106.    The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in November-December 2008 and
conducted the workshop with stakeholders that highlighted key issues to ensure the sustainability
of the work started and helped to identify measures to overcome delays in Project implementation.

107.    The Bank team coordinated well with development partners active in the health sector in
Albania, such as the WHO, USAID and SDC to ensure optimization of resources. Project
supervision promoted strong coordination arrangements among all the government agencies
participating in the Project, as well as international partners. The Bank provided effective and
strong leadership to ensure consistent policy messages, not only in the areas supported by the
Project but also in overall health policy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

108.   Based on Bank performance during lending and supervision as discussed above, overall
Bank Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

109.    As mentioned in Section 2.1, the Government demonstrated its commitment to the
objectives of the Project at the time of project preparation and consistently maintained its
commitment throughout project implementation, although close follow-up by the Bank was
needed on many occasions. Government officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on
a continual basis, and cooperated fully with the task team.

110.    Appropriate levels of review and approval were usually in place; financial accountability
and follow-up was observed, expenditures were duly authorized before they were incurred and
documentation was maintained properly for periodic review. The Project did not suffer from any
counterpart funding problems, as the GOA took timely corrective measures and made appropriate
budget provisions.

111.    On the other hand, because of frequent changes in the Minister of Health and senior staff
in the MOH, there were delays in making decisions. The working groups to oversee the technical
implementation issues relating to: (i) health financing; (ii) health quality improvement; and (iii)
hospital governance and management were established only after MTR. The need for continuity
and commitment among project coordinators was often highlighted in Aide-Memoire’s (AMs)
and MTR.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

112.    The PIU had the skills necessary to implement the Project. It was effective in carrying out
all aspects of project management, such as financial management, procurement arrangements,
reporting activities and disbursements.

113.    Financial Management. The PIU’s financial management performance was satisfactory
throughout the implementation of the Project, with good internal controls in place, as well as
disbursement, staffing, reporting and auditing arrangements. Audits of the project’s financial
statements were completed on time and did not highlight any major irregularities. The quarterly
unaudited financial reports were submitted on a timely manner, with minor exceptions. Such
reports were generated automatically from the specialized project management software package,
developed and customized by an Albanian company.




                                                37
114.    The financial specialist responsible for the Project had the appropriate skills and abilities
to manage the Project’s financial management and disbursement issues. The Project management
unit had adequate internal controls for the Project, including regular reconciliation of bank
accounts, adequate segregation of duties, and performed monthly reconciliation of the Bank’s
disbursement summaries with project accounting records. The counterpart financing received
from the Government was satisfactory over the life of the Project.

115.     Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of all works, goods and technical services
under the Project followed the Procurement Guidelines “Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits?. However, the PIU did not have sufficient capacity to prepare technical
specifications for medical equipment, which caused delays in preparing bidding
documents. Despite the enormous amount of complaints received on the procurement of medical
equipment, the PIU was still able to complete procurement of all packages in the procurement
plan. The PIU performed well in the selection of consultants. The major shortcoming was related
to the mis-procurement on one lot of medical equipment in amount of US$1.1 Million. The
evaluation committee disqualified the lowest evaluated responsive bidder based on an evaluation
criterion not specified in the bidding documents and recommended award to a bidder other than
this lowest evaluated bidder, which violates the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines. The Bank
declared mis-procurement after extensive communication with the client.

116.    Reporting Arrangements. The PIU submitted all required quarterly and annual reports in
a timely manner. These reports were informative, and provided valuable feedback on how the
Project was progressing along all project activities. The status of performance indicators were
incorporated in all progress reports and served as valuable input to Bank implementation support
mission reports.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

117.   In light of the Government and PIU performance as discussed above, the overall
performance of the Borrower was moderately satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

118.     Complex reforms require holistic and well-sequenced approaches. The Program was
able to achieve success because reforms spanned key areas of the health care system starting with
the stewardship functions of the MOH in health policy development and the HII in health
financing and provider payment reforms.

119.    Institutionalization of important concepts such as Quality Improvement can be
achieved with strong commitment from national champions, as well as relevant staff and
management who understand the benefits of making data based decisions. For the sake of
sustaining the results, it is important to establish some form of education for health professionals
and other stakeholders in both evidence-based medicine and quality of care. Clinical guidelines
cannot be static, they need to be constantly updated in accordance with development of medical
technologies. Most European countries have a system in place to develop such standards; it is
hoped that the GOA will learn from those examples.




                                                 38
120.     The capacity of the Government to absorb technical assistance and implement
complex institutional changes should be carefully evaluated to ensure knowledge transfer and
a sustainable impact of the activities started under the Project.

121.    Close coordination with development partners is critical. Close coordination and
collaboration with USAID, WHO and SDC in supporting implementation aspects of the program
helped keep key activities on track and ensured complementarities of interventions.

122.    Since both the PIU and the Bank have no built-in capacity for the review of
technical specifications and bid evaluation reports of medical equipment, the launch of
procurement for medical equipment should allow more time in the procurement plan for the
review of bidding documents and bid evaluation reports. Moreover, the bid validity period
should also be for a longer period to avoid extension of bid validity period.

123.   The development and integration of health information systems in the health sector
is complex. If a sector needs intervention in the implementation of a new information system, it is
important that there is a specific team working on it right from the beginning of the Project, and
adequate time, resources, and attention should be given on a priority basis.

124.    It will be important for the Bank to find a way to keep supporting the follow-up
actions of the reforms introduced under the Project. Without a follow-on project, the Bank will
not have leverage with the government regarding the reforms introduced.

125.    Evaluations of institutional reform and capacity building projects in the health
sector is complex, but must be tackled if the attribution of Bank-funded project gains is to
be adequately assessed. This Project spent a significant proportion of project financing on
building the institutional capacity of the MOH as an effective steward of the sector and
transforming the sector into a more efficient one. While there is evidence that the reform process
was successful and the Project met objectives, the project monitoring and evaluation design did
not allow for a ‘with-project versus without-project’ evaluation, which would have provided more
evidence on the impact of the Project. Moreover, while the Project did focus on poor regions, as
well as on rural communities with less access to health care, this evaluation did not have data to
demonstrate how the poor have benefited in comparison to the non-poor.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1. Background

The health care sector in Albania is characterized by low public health expenditures compared to
those in most of Europe. However, the share of health expenditures paid for by private sources is
extremely high. One of the major inefficiencies in the health sector is inefficient treatment
protocols and management that resulted in neglect of primary healthcare in favor of specialist and
hospital care. This will result in higher inpatient and specialist care and thus inefficiencies and
inadequate provision of healthcare services across all levels. This project addressed such
inefficiencies by increasing coverage of primary healthcare thus reducing the need for inpatient
admissions and specialized healthcare.

The Project created efficiency gains in the health sector. The gains from higher efficiency were
passed on to the patients in the form of increased access to and higher quality of public health
care, lower treatment costs and lower out of pocket payments. Improved access to quality care,
better patient case management and use of preventive care resulted in the fewer hospital referrals,
less in-patient admissions, reduced mortality and fewer days lost through diseases and inactivity.
Thus the benefits from the project included: (i) decrease in unnecessary hospital bed days due to
improved quality of primary health care; (ii) reductions in referrals to specialists; (iii) reductions
in out-of-pocket expenditures, travel times and travel costs; (iv) losses in labor productivity
averted; and (v) benefits from reduced mortality.

2. Methodology, data and assumptions

Although all of the above three project components generated benefits, due to difficulties in
estimating monetary values of the benefits from components A and C, economic analysis has
been done for component B only. However it may be noted that investments under components
A and C complement the benefits from investments in component B.

The project generated both direct and indirect benefits. The methods used to estimate those
benefits are presented below.

(a) Direct benefits

The direct benefits included savings arising from reduction in unnecessary hospital admissions
and reductions in unnecessary specialist referrals. These direct benefits are further explained
below:

 (i)    Savings resulting from decrease in unnecessary hospital admissions and reduced bed days
        due to improved quality of primary healthcare and patient management in public health
        centers and improved adherence to standard protocols for referrals.

As a result of the project, the better trained GPs provided better care, case management and the
GPs were able to treat the patients without referring them to specialists and thus avoiding
hospitalization. The patients were treated by well-trained providers in PHC clinics that provided
quality care. This has resulted in drop in hospital admissions at an annual rate of about 3 percent.
Further, there were savings in total bed days from unnecessary hospital admissions. Such savings
in bed days were as high as 30 percent. We did not have data on actual cost of inpatient care to
estimate the above project benefits. Hence cost of inpatient care is estimated from the total


                                                 47
inpatient care expenditures and total number of hospital days in Albania and were adjusted for
inflation. The cost per inpatient day is estimated at US $ 46 and the recurrent costs of the
hospitals are assumed to be 20 percent of the total inpatient costs at US$ 9.2. The above costs are
then adjusted using the inflation rates in Albania.

 (ii)    Savings from unnecessary specialist referrals due to improved quality of care and case
         management of patients in public health centers and adherence of standard specialist
         referral protocols.

The evaluation and beneficiary analysis of the project showed a reduction in referrals to
specialists and inpatient hospital care by as much as 30 percent in Albania.

(b) Indirect benefits

In addition to the above direct benefits, the project generated the following indirect benefits:

 (i)     Improved access to preventive care resulted in less disease incidence and thus averted
         losses in productivity due to diseases and lost workdays.

Averted productivity losses arise from fewer visits to the specialist centers and reduction in
number of bed days from inpatient admissions. The reduced productivity looses are estimated to
be 0.5 days per referral. Similarly, fewer bed days due to fewer admissions results in significant
savings and thus savings in productivity. It has been estimated that there has been 30 percent
reduction in number of bed days as a result of the project. In order to estimate the value of
averted productivity losses in productivity is valued at an average wage rate of US $ 11.65 person
at a labor participation rate of 59.5 percent.

  (ii)   Savings in potential life years as a result of reduced mortality from diseases like
         respiratory and endocrine diseases.

Better quality of treatment and preventive measures averted chronic diseases and mortality and
the burden of diseases in Albania. Based on available evidence from surveys and evidence from
other published works, early detection through higher utilization of public health services and
better quality of care the mortality reduced by about 3 percent over ten years. In order to
compute the gains from reduced mortality it is assumed that each death averted results in nine life
years saved. The monetary value of life years saved were then estimated from the per capita
incomes over nine years discounted at 5 percent discount rate. The project supervision
documents and the beneficiary surveys showed that the benefits started to materialize from the
second year after the project was implemented.

  (iii) Reduction in travel costs to hospitals and specialist clinics

Out of pocket expenses and travel costs to specialist hospitals are greater than for out-patient
visits. Hence a reduction in specialist visits will result in savings in travel costs and out-of-pocket
expenses. Then the project benefits are the difference in out-pocket and travel costs for the
reduced number of visits to specialty centers.

3. Project costs

Since the benefits from the components A and C could not be estimated, the economic analysis
was done only for the component B. The project costs for the component B is presented below in

 2010              $1,935             $324                  $2,259
 2011              $3,271             $739                  $4,010

 Total             $9,539            $1,813                $11,351

The total project cost for the component B was $11.35 million of which IDA’s share was $9.54
million (84 percent) and the rest 16 percent was the share of the government. The project was
implemented over a period of six years.

4.   Project benefits and measures of economic efficiency

As explained in the previous sections the project benefits arise from the reduced referrals to
specialists, reduced inpatient admissions and benefits of reduced mortality due to better case
management at the PHC level. Under the base case scenario, the project benefits started accruing
in the second year, though at a limited scale, and will continue till for about 20 years. The
hospital admissions and referrals to specialists reduced on the average by 5 percent and the
reduction in mortality from the base year is 2.8 percent. The measures of economic efficiency
under this base case scenario are presented in Table A3.2. Under this base case scenario, the
project yielded an Economic Rate of Return of 18 percent and a Benefit: Cost ratio of 1.45.

Table A3.2: Base case scenario: Measures of efficiency (8 % discount rate)

                                          8 percent discount rate
Net present value (000 $)                                        6,177
Benefit/Cost ratio                                                1.45
Economic rate of return                                             18
Present Value of total project                                  13,891
costs (000 $)

It may be noted that most of the benefits are realized few years after the initial investment. Most
of the benefits are from reduced mortality and life years saved due to improved case management
and also due to reduced referrals to hospitals and specialist care. The project yielded modest
returns on the investment and these results are comparable with the expected returns under the
most likely scenario presented in the Project Appraisal Document.

The analysis considered only the costs for the component B. The costs for component A and
Component C are not included in the estimation of net benefits and rates of return though the
investments under components A and C also contributes to the total project benefits.

5. Sensitivity analysis

The above results are sensitive to the assumptions and parameters used in the analysis. In order
to assess the sensitivity of the results to changes in the different parameters the following three
alternative scenarios are considered.



                                                49
Scenario 1: This scenario considers a reduction in hospital admissions and referrals to specialists
at 3 percent from the base year level. The reduction in admissions and referrals are less than the
base case by 2 percent.

Scenario 2: Under this scenario the reduction in mortality is 2 percent while the reduction in
hospital admissions and referrals to specialists at 5 percent as in the base case.

Scenario 3: The third scenario considers the case when the reduction in hospital admissions and
referrals to specialists is 3 percent and the reduction in mortality is 2 percent.

Table A.3.3: Sensitivity analysis under alternative scenarios (8 % discount rate)
                             Scenario 1            Scenario 2           Scenario 3
Net present value (000 $)    3,467                 2,292                (502)
Benefit/Cost ratio           1.25                  1.2                  0.96
Economic rate of return      14                    12                   7

Scenario 3 is the most conservative case when there is less reduction in hospital admissions and
mortality rates than the base case scenario. The other two scenarios provide plausible cases
where the impacts of the intervention in terms of reductions in admissions and mortality are less
than the base case scenario. The results show that the project yielded modest returns to the
investment under alternative case scenarios considered. It may be noted that the net present value
becomes negative when the reduction in hospital admissions and referrals to specialists is 3
percent and the reduction in mortality is 2 percent. These results are comparable to the most
likely scenarios presented in the Project Appraisal Document with Economic rates of return
ranging from 7.9 to 12.8 percent.

6. Fiscal sustainability of the project

Albanian economy has been growing at around 5.1 percent in the last five years and public health
spending has been increasing reaching about 2.5 percent of GDP and 2.8 percent of the total
public expenditures in 2009, the highest in recent years. The recurrent costs for the health project
include replacement costs for medical equipment, operation and maintenance expenses. These
recurrent costs for this project account for only about 0.3 percent of the total public health
expenditures. Given the recent trends in economic growth and public health expenditures in
Albania the recurrent cost impact of the health modernization project is negligible and may not be
constraining sustainability of the project.

Project Objectives, Project Design and Implementation

The Albanian Health Care system has been on a long path of transition and development since the
mid 1990’s – albeit with a hiatus for several years caused by civil disturbances following the
pyramid schemes.

With a long history of political and economic isolation, the Health Care system suffered from a
lack of investment; health care was primarily delivered by local hospitals, in part due to poor road
and transport infrastructure. The system was based on the Soviet “specialist? service model ,
which did not truly provide Primary Health Care (PHC) services.

The Albanian economy was not as adversely affected by the 2008-2009 global financial and
economic crises as other economies in Europe or in South Eastern Europe. However, even though
the crisis was primarily external in nature, it did test the efficacy of the country’s macro-
economic equilibrium, structural reforms, financial and banking systems and the resiliency of the
private sector. Albania’s strong economic growth has been a major contributing factor to its
progress towards achieving targets in such areas as combating extreme poverty and improving
various aspects of health.

The government demonstrated its commitment to supporting social reforms by increasing the
budget for health programs, despite reducing spending elsewhere in mid-budget reviews. This
ongoing commitment was critical to the success of the undertaken reforms in health care services
and financing.

Upon electing a democratic, representative government in 1991, Albania embarked on an
ambitious program of health care. Like the health care reform efforts of other developing
countries, this process depends largely upon the management abilities of health care leaders.
These leaders must identify needs, devise appropriate corrective measures and incentives in
policy and procedures, and follow through by implementing organizational and operational
changes.

Albania’s healthcare leaders, like their counterparts throughout the world, face increasingly
critical challenges, such as the growing demand for access to quality health services and the ever
increasing costs of providing these services. For a country that is starting from a comparatively
low level of infrastructure, these challenges are particularly difficult to overcome. It is therefore
even more critically important for any organization that the key health care leaders, as well as all
levels of management personnel, take the time and effort to acquire the skills and knowledge to
successfully address these demands for reform and improvement.

Major changes, including the re-training of doctors in current PHC services, have allowed the
development of family medicine over the past couple decades. However, the development and
modernization of hospital services has been a continuing challenge.

Extensive analysis of the entire health care system to help identify priorities has been undertaken
with significant progress on a variety of fronts. The structure and organization of PHC services
has been significantly overhauled together with the payments system resulting in overall
improved services for citizens.

The Health Insurance Institute (HII) has gone from theory to practice and the new Health
Insurance Law will come into effect in 2013 with the goal of developing clinical contracting
between the HII and hospitals. Enactment is expected to result in delivery of better focused
financing of secondary care and a more cost-effective hospital service delivery system.

The Project Design fully met the government’s objectives to respond to the needs and priorities
of beneficiaries through investing in technology, reforming health institutions and increasing
capacity building.

The project design was also essential in providing a foundation and guiding project activities for
translating national policy into effective and sustainable programs, through strengthened
institutional structures, improved governance and an operationally strong implementation unit.

The objectives of the HSM Project were to:

    (a) improve the physical and financial access to, and use of, high quality primary health care
        services;

    (b) improve the recipient’s capacity to formulate and implement health policies and reforms
        in the health sector; and

    (c) improve hospital governance and management.


Components

The Project was comprised of three components aimed to address:

1. Strengthening Sector Stewardship, Financing and Purchasing:
Increased efficiency in the pooling and purchasing of health services on behalf of the population,
and increased financial protection to citizens, especially the poor and vulnerable.

2. Strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC) Services:
Improved quality of care and access to primary health care services, and increased use of primary
care services for the majority of health care needs.

3. Strengthening Hospital Governance and Management:
Improved management of health care facilities and increased involvement by stakeholders in the
governance of these facilities.

These components were expected to contribute to four health policy goals:

    (1) financial protection against the consequences of using medical care and thereby
        protecting the poor from falling deeper into poverty and the non-poor from becoming
        poor,
    (2) increased utilization of quality health care,
    (3) strengthened primary health care management, and
    (4) more efficient use of scarce resources.

Component A - Strengthening Sector Stewardship, Financing and Purchasing (base cost
US$6.9 million, total cost US$7.7 million) would help the HII develop its capacity as the sole
purchaser of health services, and would support capacity building to strengthen the stewardship
role of the MOH, the Institute of Public Health (IPH) and the HII.


                                               58
Component B - Improving PHC Service Delivery (base cost $8.9 million, total cost US$10.1
million) would support institutional reforms and limited investments aimed at improving quality
of care among health care providers and in health facilities.

The program would: (i) facilitate registration of the population with the HII and enrollment with a
primary care physician, together with related public information campaigns; (ii) build practice
management capacity at the primary care level; (iii) develop and introduce clinical guidelines
with an initial focus on primary care and the primary-secondary care interface and the most
pressing health issues (e.g. child health, antenatal care, respiratory infections, etc.); (iv) establish
a continuing medical education system (CME) and link this to the re-licensing scheme; (v) re-
train existing general practitioners and pediatricians in evidence based treatment of common
conditions and rational drugs use, based on the clinical guidelines; (vi) provide basic equipment
to physicians who complete the re-training program; and (vii) establish a grant facility to fund
proposals from primary care providers in support of quality of care and continuum of care
improvement initiatives.

Component C - Strengthening Hospital Governance and Management (base cost US$1.2
million, total cost US$1.3 million) would initiate improvements in hospital operations and
direction by focusing on: (i) the development and introduction of accounting and internal control
structures for hospital care providers and training in hospital management; (ii) developing the
regulatory framework, including by-laws and regulations to support the transformation of MOH
hospitals to autonomous public entities; and (iii) piloting reforms of hospital management and
governance structures in selected hospitals.


Actual Outputs

A. Capacity Building for the Ministry of Health, Health Insurance Institute and the Institute
   of Public Health

1. The development of payment and contracting methods and the dissemination of such
methods to providers and recipients of health services

Payment and contracting methods compatible with the needs of both a single payer and
autonomous institutions were developed, and were disseminated to providers and payers. This
included study tours to enhance the knowledge of provider payment methods in different
countries, and the influence of difference methods of payment of health services (positive and
negative impacts of each and experiences of other countries). Courses were developed for the
dissemination of this knowledge to trainers who conducted workshops for health service
providers throughout the chain of health services, to raise the awareness of health staff about the
concepts financial resources administration.

2. The development and monitoring of health policies and strategies for the Ministry of
Health and Policy Department within the MOH

The department of Monitoring and Evaluation was established.

3. The establishment of health information systems and infrastructure, through the
provision of goods and consultants’ services. A data warehouse was also established at the
Public Health Institute.


                                                  59
The establishment of the appropriate infrastructure for the management of health information and
the development of information systems was a key focus of this subcomponent.

This also included the provision of needed health information systems hardware and
infrastructure, including servers to enable the collection and storage of information and files for
all health institutions, hardware and software to enable the organization of the system of
information in hospitals and the HII, and the preparation of the specialized computer programs.

Specific activities included: (i) the development of systems for the HII in the area of prescription
drug processing, patient registration enrollment and service monitoring; (ii) improvement of
document management, internet access and standards development in the MOH; (iii)
establishment of the public health data warehouse in the IPH; and (iv) supporting the
implementation of new systems in PHC and hospitals.

4. The preparation of standards for licensing of health professionals and hospitals, through
the provision of goods, consultants’ services and training

This subcomponent included the preparation of licensing standards for health professionals
(provided through foreign assistance), technical assistance for the preparation of licensing
standards for hospitals (basic standards and for specific hospital services such as neonatal ICU,
CT Scanner and MRI), and determining and selecting the most appropriate model for Albania.
This subcomponent also included training for capacity building to further develop the supervisory
capacities of accrediting visits, training for capacity building to train Accreditation boards, and
training for capacity building for the Center of Accreditation and Quality.

More than 150 people were trained.

5. The development of capacity to conduct an assessment of medical equipment and
technology, and the preparation of standards for medical equipment and for supporting
hospital systems, through the provision of goods, consultants’ services and training

To support the development of a health technology assessment capability within Albania, this
subcomponent included an evaluation of current medical equipment, an evaluation and analysis
of the supportive systems in hospital facilities (power supply system, medical gases supply
system, vacuum and compressed air supply etc.), and the preparation of standards for medical
equipment and for supporting hospital systems.

The HTA & EBM Knowledge Center was established within the NCQSA-HI as and integral part
of the department handling the development of HTA& EBM clinical guidelines.


6. The building of capacity within the Ministry of Health for Project implementation and
administration, through the provision of consultants’ services and training


B. Improvement of Primary Health Care Services Delivery

Implementation of institutional reforms and investments to improve the access to, and quality of,
primary health care, including:



                                                60
1. The preparation and introduction of Clinical Guidelines, through the provision of goods
and consultants’ services.

This consulting assignment selected the most common diseases in the practice of the GP and
identification of the group of diseases lacking the protocols of treatment, and prepared protocols
for the diseases lacking the protocols with foreign consultant’s advice.

New Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed for 5 priority diseases and implemented in 12
regions

                 National Clinical Guidelines for management of Anemia for Chronic Renal
                  Insufficiency
                 National Clinical Guidelines for cerebral Vascular Accidents
                 National Clinical Guidelines for Treatment for Patients with Diabetes Type 2
                 National Clinical Guidelines for General Management of Patients in The PHC
                 National Clinical Guidelines for management of Hypertension

2. The development of training programs for health practitioners, through the provision of
consultants’ services and training;

This sub-component resulted in the development of training programs for General Practitioners
regarding: treatment of the acute morbidity; treatment of the chronic morbidity; existing protocols
of treatment and those where protocols are lacking (the newly developed/introduced ones); and
commitment to prevent and health education of the population. The process would use a
“training-of-trainers? (TOT) approach, with the organization o f a group of trainers for each, and
the number of courses of training/ number of trainers per each region based on the number o f
GP’s per each region. Training costs for GP’s are also covered. Quality training for primary
health care scaled up only to 3 regions: Tirana, Durres, Elbasan, 750 doctors trained.

3. The provision of equipment for primary health care to Primary Health Care Providers.

This sub-component included basic equipment for all health posts, health centers, and policlinics
in Albania, for a value of 2.1 million USD.

4. The provision of equipment for hospital care

This sub-component included:

        a)       Four mimeographs (US$1.9 million)
        b)       Seven autoclaves (US$1.5 million)
        c)       Medical Equipment for Cardiac Department at TUHC (US$2.3 million)
        d)       Medical Equipment for Pediatric Surgery at TUHC (US$0.54 million)
        e)       Medical Equipment for Regional Hospitals (US$1.5 million)

5. The organization of public information campaigns to promote the registration and
enrollment of Beneficiaries with Primary Health Care Providers through the provision of
consultants’ services and goods

A strategy was prepared.




                                                 61
This subcomponent included information campaigns for the public related to the registration and
enrollment process - including obligations to contribute, exemptions and outlining the benefits
from the scheme - as well as campaigns related to the improvements in quality of care resulting
from the GP training programs.


C. Improvement of Hospital Governance and Management

1. The strengthening of financial management, general management and procurement
capacity within hospitals, through the provision of training and consultants’ services
include the training of hospital managers and financial staff to improve management
abilities and awareness of modern management concepts

This project resulted in the successful training of 190 hospital managers and other employees
within the Albanian healthcare system. In addition, 11 highly qualified trainers were provided
with opportunities to develop their teaching and curriculum development skills. As the first
continuing education course accredited by the National Center of Continuing Education, the
project serves as a model for the development of other continuing education courses for managers
in health care and other sectors.

The project has validated the use of native Albanian trainers to deliver relevant continuing
education content to full-time employed trainees without adversely affecting their work
performance.

2. The development of a regulatory framework, including bylaws and regulations, to
facilitate the change of status of hospitals to autonomous public entities, and the
development of a hospital rationalization strategy, through the provision of consultants’
services.

This subcomponent provided technical assistance to select the adequate model of autonomy in the
areas of filling the legal gap and experience from other countries, covering both governance and
financial aspects. The MOH, in cooperation with the HII, selected the hospitals where the hospital
autonomy model will be applied and tested.

3. Rationalization Plan

A number of international projects examined the distribution and the structure of Albania’s
hospitals and presented plans for rationalization to the Ministry of Health (MOH). These plans
have largely focused on rebalancing services between the district and regional hospitals together
with decentralizing some services currently delivered only at Tirana’s Mother Theresa University
Hospital, thereby alleviating resource constraints/pressure at the central hospitals and minimizing
opportunity costs for the patient.

The overall aim of the rationalization process has been to examine the capacity of each district
hospital, taking into account its bed numbers, bed occupancy, workload and outputs, staffing and
the quality and range of service offered.

Many of the district hospitals recorded extremely low bed occupancy rates (as low as 15-20%) in
addition to a low number of surgical interventions which renders them neither clinically nor
economically viable as hospitals.



                                                62
Some district hospitals have bed occupancy rates as high as 50% and serve medium size
communities where a district hospital is appropriate. Overall, the district hospitals require
rationalization of bed numbers, staffing and service reconfiguration and other measures to make
them clinically and economically viable, as well as appropriate to the community they serve.

A master Rationalization Plan was prepared and approved by the MOH.

The rationalization plan model was tested in two hospitals.

4. Outsourcing of non-medical services

This assignment reviewed the existing model of outsourcing, as well as catering and hotel
services at TUHC, including an assessment of the current structure of the existing contract for
catering and hotel services. It also included the analysis and development of a cost model relating
to the implementation of outsourcing hospital ancillary services throughout the regional hospitals
in Albania, as well as produced a detailed analysis of the current structure of outsourcing food
services, and laundry and cleaning services at Tirana University Hospital Center (TUHC). A
privatization plan for non-medical activities in all regional hospitals was developed and presented
to the Government for approval.


Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank and other Donors

Regular Banks missions were conducted over the lifetime of the Project, reviewing ongoing and
future activities; we appreciate the support given by the TTL and the WB during the mission
towards achieving project goals.

An in-depth assessment on the HSMP activities was carried out during the Mid-term review
mission.

It is our pleasure to say that we appreciate the strong support and efforts the World Bank extends
to the health sector in Albania.

We are convinced the World Bank will continue to be a reliable partner in the long-term and will
support the forthcoming reforms through various projects and technical assistance.
