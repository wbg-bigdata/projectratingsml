                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY
The proposed restructuring is a level two restructuring to make the following changes to
the Health System Modernization Project (the “Project?) being carried out by the
Republic of Albania: (i) revision and cancellation of certain Project activities, and (ii)
reallocation of credit proceeds. This restructuring is expected to aid in the successful
completion of all Project activities before the Project Closing Date.



PROJECT STATUS
The Project was approved by the World Bank Board on March 14, 2006 and became
effective on July 9, 2006. The Project underwent a level two Restructuring in May 2010,
which included: (a) revision of a number of Project activities, (b) an 18-month extension
of the original Closing Date from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012, and (c)
revision of the results framework. Currently the Project has disbursed around 65% of the
Credit proceeds.

Following the Project restructuring in May 2010, Project implementation has shown good
progress overall. Most Project activities have been completed or are being implemented.
Under Part A, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Project, an information technology (IT) package
was to be procured for the Health Insurance Institute. This is the main remaining activity
under the Project.

While there has been good progress in proceeding with procuring the hardware that forms
part of the IT package, procurement of the software has suffered significant delays. The
main reason for the delay is that the Health Insurance Institute delayed making a decision
on the required software for developing the health insurance information system.

By way of the letter dated April 22, 2011, the Republic of Albania (through the Prime
Minister’s Office, Ministry of Health) has requested the Bank that the Project continue to
provide hardware support to the Health Insurance Institute (under Part A, Paragraph 2
and 3 of the Project) through the purchase of some additional equipment critical for the
implementation of the information system defined in the conceptual design of the Project,
which has its conceptual design completed under Part A, Paragraph 3 of the Project. The

                                             4
same letter also requests that the procurement and installation of software under Part A,
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Project be dropped from the Project’s activities and no longer
form part of the Project.
The Republic of Albania also states that it will secure financing through other donors to
procure and install the software according to the conceptual design. The implementation
of the Project’s activities under Part A does not depend on the procurement and
installation of the said software and therefore is independent of whether or not additional
donors’ financing is obtained. No change to the Financing Agreement is required in this
regard. The procurement plan has been updated to reflect this understanding.

As a result of the fact that the Project would no longer finance the procurement and
installation of software under Part A, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Project, the Credit
proceeds allocated for this purpose (under Category 1 and 2) are proposed to be
reallocated to Category 3 to further support the reform in hospital sector under Part B,
Paragraph 6 and Part C Paragraph 3 of the Project through procurement of necessary
medical equipment as well as testing of the hospital rationalization strategy in two
districts, as requested by the Republic of Albania.

In addition, the activity set out under Part B, Paragraph 1 of the Project, viz, “The
facilitation of the registration and enrollment of the population to receive primary health
care services, through provision of Unit Costs? has suffered significant delays, due to
delayed Government decision for the production of health cards. Currently, the Health
Insurance Institute is funding this activity. It is proposed that this activity be cancelled
and the credit proceeds allocated to this activity under Category 6 be reallocated to
Category 3 to further support the reform in hospital sector, under Part B, Paragraph 6 and
Part C Paragraph 3 of the Project through procurement of necessary medical equipment
as well as testing of the hospital rationalization strategy in two selected districts, as
requested by the Republic of Albania.

Also, the Bank has declared misprocurement for the activity set out under Part B
paragraph 6 of the Project, viz: “Procurement of Medical Equipment G-ICB-
05/2010/ALB/Lot2?, through letter dated August 9, 2011, as result of violation of Bank’s
Procurement Guidelines. In accordance with Section 6.03 of the applicable General
Conditions incorporated by reference in the Financing Agreement, the Bank, through
letter dated September 12, 2011, has cancelled SDR 697,669 (which is the amount of the
financing allocated to this specific activity, equivalent to US$ 1.1 Million) from Category
3 (Part B paragraph 6 of the Project).

The MoH proposes to start the implementation of the rationalization strategy for the
hospitals (which strategy has already been approved by the MoH) by piloting the
recommendations of the strategy in two districts. A new Project activity will be added to
this effect, as requested by the Republic of Albania.

The Project has no outstanding audit reports. Also, the financial management procedures
are in full compliance with Bank’s requirements. The revision and changes to the
Project’s activities will not impact the Project’s development objectives or the Project’s
performance indicators which will remain unchanged.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
   1. Changes to Project activities:

      (a) A new Project activity will be inserted in Part C, paragraph 3 of the Project’s
          description and the Financing Agreement will be amended accordingly. The
          new Project activity is as follows:

          “Testing of the hospital rationalization strategy on a pilot basis, in two
          selected districts, through the provision of consultancy services.?


      (b) Under Part A paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Project, both hardware and software
          were to be procured. However, as result of significant delays in procurement
          of software (main reason being the lack of decision from the Health Insurance
          Institute on key directions for developing the information system for the whole
          health insurance), the Project will no longer include procurement of software.
          Procurement of hardware will still continue to be financed under the Project as
          planned. Since the activity is broadly worded in the Financing Agreement, no
          amendment to the Financing Agreement will be required.


      (c) Part B, Paragraph 1 of the Project, i.e., “The facilitation of the registration and
          enrollment of the population to receive primary health care services, through
          the provision of Unit Costs,? will be cancelled.

The Procurement Plan has been updated to reflect these changes.



   2. Reallocation

   Project Costs: The proposed revisions in the Project costs by components and
   category of expenditures are presented in the tables below. The restructured Project
   will include an increase of expenditures (local and foreign) for goods to finance
   purchase of additional medical equipment for hospitals under Part B of the Project.
   In addition, it includes a reduction of expenditures (local and foreign) for goods under
   Part A of the Project (since the Bank will no longer be financing the IT software for
   the Health Insurance Institute under the Project), as well as a reduction of
   expenditures under goods as a consequence of the cancelation of the Unit Costs under
   Part B of the Project (for the primary health care enrollment).
