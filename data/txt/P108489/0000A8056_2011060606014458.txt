                         The objective of the proposed Statistical Strengthening Loan is to support the implementation of a GoI centrally sponsored scheme to strengthen state
                         statistical systems within a national framework. This loan is formally part of CAS outcome I, achieving rapid, inclusive growth, by improving the coverage and
                         quality of official statistics generally and by supporting the implementation of a reform program for the statistical system in the states it will also support the
                         other outcomes. In particular, by working directly to strengthen the results process in States and Union Territories it will also provide direct support to
                         monitoring and evaluation of all Bank operations.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The India: Statistical Strengthening Loan (SSL) was approved by the Board on June 1, 2010 and became effective on August 11, 2010. At the request of Government of India, the
                         money was fully disbursed on September 23, 2010. All loan conditions were fully met at the time of the Board approval and there was no condition attached to the withdrawal of
                         funds.

                         The November mission Aide Memoire noted that the overall pace of implementation has been slow and protracted in the first few months of implementation. Intensive efforts on the
                         part of MoSPI are required to achieve satisfactory progress by the loan closing date, July 31st 2011. As a result of recent discussions with the Bank team, some positive measures
                         by the Chief Statistician of India (CSI) on accelerating the pace of implementation and improving the coordination with states and other agencies has been possible. However,
                         considerable challenges remain ahead in achieving satisfactory progress. Some progress has taken place since the November mission and the MOSPI team is making efforts in
                         meeting the targets set out under the four policy areas in the program matrix of the loan. Some notable achievements are evident in terms of considerable ownership of reforms at the
                         state level with 32 states /UTs signing the Letters of Participation against a target of at least 7 states/UTs as in the program matrix. Another achievement is the establishment of the
                         institutional framework as set out in the Program Document both at the central level and the state level. At the center, both the High Level Steering Committee for ISSP and

                         Conference of Central and State Statistical Organizations (COCSSO) have been spearheading and closely monitoring the implementation of the ISSP by the states. The National
                         Strategic Statistical Plan (2008) is under implementation and a timetable has been put in place to update and publish a revised Plan keeping in line with the 3 year cycle of revisions

                         as per the Program Matrix. The National Statistical Commission (NSC) is currently reviewing the overall state statistical system and there is a committee that is looking after the
                         implementation of the recommendations of the Rangarajan Report (2001) on which the India SSL is based. The program matrix intermediate target on publication of manuals has
                         been met since CSO has published an additional two manuals during implementation. The National Academy of Statistical Administration (NASA) has piloted a training needs
                         assessment for four states which is scheduled to be completed by July 2011.
                         MOSPI is however lagging behind in the completion of the State Strategic Statistical Plans (SSSPs). The intermediate target was to complete 7 SSSPs and 3 MOUs by December
                         2010. So far, only 3 SSSPs (Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat) have received cabinet approval and only one MOU has been signed between the GOI and Govt. of Karnataka. The
                         slow progress in this particular area stems from several implementation impediments and lack of coordination between the center and the states. These implementation issues if not
                         addressed properly can risk timely achievement of results. Some of the key issues as noted in the mission Aide Memoire are:
                         ➢?¢      Coordination: The High Level Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of the Secretary, MOSPI has been meeting regularly to discuss the implementation of ISSP.
                         MOSPI agreed on the Bank team➢? s view that there is a need to strengthen the coordination between the CAP, Program Support Group and Technical Support Group (TSG). The
                         Bank team also stressed on the need to involve the Statistical Advisors in the central line ministries in the reform program and cast the net wide for ISSP. Even though MOSPI has
                         taken significant measures to integrate the state line ministries into the project but the involvement of the central line ministries still remains a concern. It is expected that MOSPI will
                         undertake a series of consultative workshops/meetings with these statistical advisors in order to engage them in the ISSP.

                         ➢?¢     Strengthening of the Technical Support Group: A technical support group (TSG) exists within MOSPI under DDG (CAP) to assist the states in the preparation of SSSPs. It
                         was discussed during the mission that TSG will be strengthened by including senior level officers (ADGs) from CAP and FOD as well as from different sectors for e.g. National
                         Accounts Division (NAD), Economic Statistics Division (ESD) etc. The TSG would assist in reviewing the different SSSPs and also provide necessary handholding to states/UTs as
                         needed during the implementation phase of the SSSPs.

                         ➢?¢      Regular Process of Engagement: During the mission MOSPI and the Bank emphasized on the need of a regular process of engagement with the state officials which will be
                         essential for successful implementation of ISSP. To speed-up the process of preparation of SSSPs in states, the Chief Statistician of India (CSI) had already met with the Chief
                         Secretaries of a few states. Furthermore, the Chief Statistician of India (CSI) will be holding meetings with the Field Operation Division DDGs posted in the states/UTs and discuss
                         and streamline their work plan for ISSP. It is expected that the meetings between the Secretary and the DDGs will be held on a quarterly basis.

                         ➢?¢      Need for frequent Implementation Support Missions: Given the performance towards the progress benchmarks and the gap between realized and planned targets, Bank
                         team is ready to support MOSPI and will be glad to conduct more frequent implementation support missions. As agreed, Bank will conduct these missions every two months till the
                         loan closing date of July 31, 2011 to jointly review the progress on agreed results.

                         ➢?¢       Monitoring Framework: A monitoring framework for the ISSP and draft reporting forms to assess the progress of preparation as well as implementation of SSSPs was
                         developed by the Bank and shared with MOSPI during the mission. It was decided that the proposed template will be circulated to all departments and divisions within MOSPI and
                         comments/feedback will be solicited to establish the monitoring framework and enhance it further. The same monitoring framework will be sent to all the state based DDGs by CAP

                         division. The DDGs will be meeting regularly with the Directors of DES and will report to the senior management of MOSPI according to a specified time interval to be decided by
                         MOSPI.

                         ➢?¢       Manpower and Weak Implementation Capacity: Manpower and weak implementation capacity is a major issue for the states/UTs. There is wide recognition of these
                         constraints and the permanent National Statistical Commission along with MOSPI is currently discussing ways to address the issue. The permanent NSC is looking at the
                         recommendations of the Vaidyanathan Committee on improving the agriculture statistics generated by the states and estimation of green GDP which include specific
                         recommendations for the development of the state statistical manpower. Based on the agriculture pilot, MOSPI will plan to develop strategies to assist the states/UTs in addressing
                         capacity constraints. MOSPI will soon issue guidelines on the use of TFC grant to the states/ UTs. Depending on the modality of the guidelines some of the vacant posts in the states
                         can be filled with the grant money.

                         ➢?¢      Technical Assistance from MOSPI to the Participating States/UTs: Discussions were carried out with MOSPI on the key areas where the participating states/UTs would need
                         technical assistance to perform the activities to be undertaken under ISSP. Presently technical assistance is needed to improve coordination mechanisms, manage data quality,
                         develop data banks, determine an appropriate ICT strategy, develop electronic dissemination of data and metadata or technical advice related to the design of particular statistical

                         review missions that enable to create a platform for the states/UTs to voice their concerns and needs.

                         ➢?¢      Non- Lending Technical Assistance (NLTA) from the Bank to MOSPI: Non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) to MOSPI through the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity
                         Building (TFSCB) which ended in June 2010 played a catalytic role during the period of preparation of the ISSP. The Bank provided TFSCB support for preparation of the NSSP,
                         SSSP guidelines, monitoring framework, draft MOU, holding of regional workshops and hiring of consultants for SSSPs. Consultations were carried out with MOSPI during the
                         mission for further NLTA which will be needed to achieve the results under the policy areas I-IV during the implementation phase of ISSP. The need for a complementary support and
                         technical advice is evident from the mission discussions. MOSPI has agreed to prepare a concept note for the follow-on TA support.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Bank to have more frequent implementation support missions. The Program Support Group of ISSP should intensify its efforts to address and support the preparation of SSSPs at the
                         state level . A monitoring framework for tracking progress state-wise based on the international consultant's framework should be adopted in order to address implementation
                         impediments at the state level. The Chief Statistician of India will be actively involved in the implementation of the ISSP through the High Level Steering Committee. Delays in
                         reporting matters pertaining to ISSP and weak coordination should be addressed by the High Level Steering Committee and appropriate timely actions are taken to speed up the
                         implementation process.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
