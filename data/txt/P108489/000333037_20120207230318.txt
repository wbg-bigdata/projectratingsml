1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.    India’s macroeconomic policy framework has been adequate to respond to the global
financial crisis and set the stage for a return to high growth rates. The fiscal policy stance was
loosened by 3.4 percent of GDP through tax reductions and expenditure increases in FY2008/09,
with further expansion witnessed in 2009/10. Strengthened government demand supported GDP
growth in the second half of FY2008/09, when private demand slumped. However, inflation rates
rose sharply, with both the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index moving
above 10 percent, and monetary policy tightening started in October 2009 with the return to
higher prudential norms. The central government budget for FY2010/11 also signaled a phased
return to fiscal prudence with a significant reduction in the fiscal deficit target.

2.     Over the medium term, a fiscal consolidation path has been adopted based on the
recommendations of the 13th Finance Commission (2010-2015). This envisaged bringing down
the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2013/14 and adopting an explicit ceiling for the debt-to-
GDP ratio of 68 percent by 2014-15, from the current 76 percent. Both World Bank and IMF
assessments of 2010 concluded that the macroeconomic framework was appropriate.

3.    Historically, India has been a pioneer in the collection and use of statistics for national
development. India has one of the largest and most extensive statistics systems in the world with
the capability of collecting data from a large diversified and decentralized economy. The first
decades after Independence brought significant development of the Indian Statistical System
(ISS) and related research institutions. The Indian Statistical Institute became a pre-eminent
research and training institution under the leadership of the late Professor P. C. Mahalanobis, an
internationally renowned statistician and scholar.

4.     Post liberalization of the economy in 1991, there was a shift from a centralized planning
model to a more liberal and decentralized model of development with greater private sector
involvement. Decentralization of governance was also initiated through amendments to the
Constitution. The 73rd Amendment to the Constitution seeks to endow the Panchayats with such
power and authority as may be required to enable them to function as genuine institutions of local
self?government. As Panchayati Raj is included in the State list of the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution, the States are responsible for devolving powers and authority to the Panchayats as
envisaged under Article 243G and the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. This has created a
three tiered decentralization with the following: – Center – State – Panchayat.

5.     These changes and reforms required enhanced statistical data to support effective policy
and decision making at all levels. Demand for statistical data in research, analysis, policy and
decision making has grown significantly. However, the two main sources of statistical data
required modernization to keep up with developments over last decades. First, the system of
statutory administrative returns and administrative records has been seriously weakened. Second,
resource and technical limitations in respect to census and survey-based data collection have
emerged, particularly limitations affecting timeliness, processing and disseminating the results of
surveys, and the disaggregation of survey data to sub-state levels. Consequently the ISS has not
been able to keep pace with demands for statistical data in terms of timeliness, reliability,
adequacy and credibility in public perception.

6.   The Government of India (GoI) recognized these challenges and initiated actions to
address them. In response to the above mentioned problems, in 2000 the GoI established a

                                                1
National Statistical Commission (NSC), chaired by Dr. C. Rangarajan, to examine the statistical
system in India comprehensively and to make recommendations on how it could be improved.
This was the first Commission to be established to examine the system in the 50 years since
Independence. Following the publication of the Commission‘s report in 2001, the GoI initiated a
statistical strengthening program to implement the Commission‘s recommendations and to
establish a well-coordinated statistical system that would meet the needs of the country in the
twenty-first century. After several years of delay the Government revived the statistical system
reform effort and started to act on the Commission‘s recommendations.

7.     There was increasing recognition in Government, at all levels, that a more responsive
and transparent statistical system is an important foundation for decision making and thus
further fiscal and governance reforms. As the 2001 Report had identified, the efficacy of the ISS
to a large extent depends upon the operational efficiency of the statistical systems in the State
Governments and Union Territories (States/UTs). The GOI and States/UTs subsequently agreed
to strengthen the ISS, starting at the base of the system, namely in the states.

8.     The GoI instigated a number of reforms to improve the operational efficiency of the
decentralized statistical system and to improve coordination between the Center and
States/UTs. Based on the 2001 NSC Report, the GoI formulated a nation-wide scheme, the India
Statistical Strengthening Project (ISSP), to support the reform and institutional strengthening of
state statistical systems. A high-level Steering Committee was instituted in September 2007 to
monitor implementation of the ISSP, with the nation-wide scheme approved by the Cabinet
Committee on Economic Affairs
(CCEA) in March 2010. The total
allocation by GoI to the nation-wide        Box 1. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)
scheme was Rs 650.43 crores                          Essentially CSS are special purpose

9.     Preparation of the Bank’s Statistical Strengthening Loan (SSL) began in 2005 with some
initial technical assessments. The Bank became re-engaged with the GOIs statistical
strengthening reforms through the funding of several studies1, conducted with MOSPI, including
an extensive study, initiated in 2005, to identify the statistical capacities and needs of all 35
States/UTs. These studies became the basis of the SSL. Although various options for Bank
support were considered, the loan was eventually designed as a standalone Development Policy
Loan (DPL) between the Bank and the Government of India. It was the first national DPL and
remains globally the only one supporting statistical capacity building. It is, de facto, aimed at
supporting the long term reform of the state level statistical system using the CSS vehicle.

10. The rationale for the SSL is based on three main arguments. First, it supported a
program of reform that the Government of India itself has identified as a priority. Second, the
loan supported the development results agenda generally and development efforts at all levels and
in all sectors through the promotion of more evidence and results based policy making (i.e. by
giving policy makers and oversight bodies better quality and more timely statistics). The
emphasis on development results and on the need to monitor indicators such as growth,
investment climate, and poverty reduction has placed a renewed emphasis on supporting
countries to increase their capacity to collect, compile, disseminate and use relevant and reliable
statistics. Third, the loan also supported other Bank and development partners operations in
India; an efficient and effective statistical system was seen as essential not only for the proper
operation of government at all levels, but also for the Bank‘s and others operations in the country,
both lending and non-lending.

11. The need for reliable, consistent and comparable statistics throughout India also
supports the approach of a national framework. While much of the data collection is done at the
local level and should aid local policy makers and oversight, there is also a need to ensure that
statistical information is comparable between states, for example for state and local level income
and poverty measures that may impact central transfers or investment, as well as to ensure that
certain information can be aggregated to assist policy making at the central level. The loan has
consequently also supported the promotion of central level statistical standards.

12. The India CAS, approved by the Board on November 14, 2008, emphasizes the
importance of measuring the Bank’s contribution to the achievement of country development
goals. The need is not only to extend the coverage of the statistical system, but also ensure that it
is working efficiently and that its products are trusted and widely used. Although this is the first
Bank-supported program in India in statistics, there is a long history of Bank interest and
involvement in this area. In the view of many data users, especially in the policy research
community, Bank involvement is seen as important and emphasizes the importance of good
statistics for the development process and poverty reduction generally.

1.2 Original Program Development Objective and Key Indicators (as approved)

13. The SSL Program Objective is to support a national policy of the GoI to reform the
institutional structure and to improve the operational efficiency of the state statistical systems.
The loan was designed to contribute to the implementation of CAS outcome I, i.e., achieving
rapid inclusive growth. It aimed at improving the quality and coverage of official statistics
originating at the state level to help improve monitoring and evaluation at the state level.

14. The SSL supported an institutional and policy based reform of the Government of India
to strengthen the statistical systems in States and UTs within a national policy framework. The
DPL supported a nation-wide scheme called the India Statistical Strengthening Project (ISSP),
with the following four main policy areas and key outcome indicators that covered the period of
the loan (i.e. 2010) and for 2015:

          Policy Area I, Strengthening the institutions of leadership and coordination of the
           National Statistical System: Baseline: Collection of Statistics Act 2008 passed by
           Parliament; End 2010: Rules framed under the Collection of Statistics Act 2008 prepared;
           By 2015: Rules in place and being implemented, Bill to provide a statutory basis for the
           permanent National Statistical Commission is presented to the Parliament.
          Policy Area II, Improving and increasing the support provided by the Central
           Government and the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation to the
           statistical systems of State/UTs: Baseline: Eight manuals for key statistical activities are
           published; End 2010: A further two manuals published, five in draft. By 2015: Manuals
           for other key statistical activities published and updated.
          Policy Area III, Strengthening the capacity and performance of the statistical
           systems in a majority of States/UTs in India: Baseline: Seven states have signed
           Letters of Participation to participate in ISSP; End 2010: Seven states have prepared
           strategic plans and at least three have signed MoUs with MOSPI and are implementing a
           program of reforms; By 2015: Majority of participating states have prepared SSSPs, and
           most of these have signed MOUs with MOSPI. Baseline: The staffing gap in sanctioned
           professional posts (unfilled posts as a proportion of the total) is estimated at 10 per cent;
           End 2010: Training needs in at least seven states quantified and appropriate policies
           identified; By 2015: Staffing gap expected to be reduced to less than 5 per cent.
          Policy Area IV, Improving the coverage, quality, timeliness and credibility of
           statistics generated by States and UTs: Baseline: Average quality score for national
           statistical activities in all States/UTs is 1.2; End 2010: Actions to improve quality of key
           statistics being implemented in three states and priorities and targets agreed in six more;
           By 2015: Average quality score for participating states is 2.5. Baseline: 40% of all
           States/UTs are disseminating statistics through a web-site. End 2010: 75% of
           participating States/UTs disseminate through web; By 2015: 95% of participating
           States/UTs disseminate statistics through web-sites.
15. The setting of medium-term targets explicitly acknowledged that the process of
strengthening state statistical capacity would not be completed within the period of the loan.
The Program Document was also explicit that, although the SSL would be fully disbursed on
effectiveness, ―the nature of such institutional reforms and capacity strengthening processes that
the loan is supporting requires that there should be a more sustained interaction between the
World Bank and MOSPI as the implementing agency‖2.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Project

17. The Project supported the Government reform program with focus on four key policy areas
derived from the recommendations of the 2001 NSC Report. The four policy areas are as
described below.

18. Policy Area I: Coordination and Leadership of the National Statistical System. The first
policy area addressed the deterioration in coordination and organizational functioning over the
past few decades that has reduced the effectiveness of the ISS. The GoI has taken action to
strengthen the leadership and strategic direction of the ISS including: (i) setting up the permanent
National Statistical Commission (NSC) and nominating its Chairman and members in June 2006;
(ii) filling the post of the Director General of the CSO, which had remained unfilled for almost 9
years; (iii) the appointment of the first Chief Statistician of India. Both the establishment of the
permanent NSC as well as the provision of technical and professional leadership in MOSPI has
provided a strong professional leadership mechanism for the ISS as well as important
interlocutors for the Bank; (iv) a National Strategic Statistical Plan (NSSP) was prepared in 2008
to underpin the reform program for the ISS; (v) The Collection of Statistics Act 2008 was passed
by Parliament in December 2008 and assented to by the President on January 9, 2009; and (vi) the
Conference of Central and State Statistical Organizations (COCSSO) has been revived and
strengthened- COCSSO‘s objective is to strengthen the institutional coordination of statistical
activities between MOSPI, other central ministries and state statistical organizations.

19. The program also aimed at supporting Government medium term plans such as (i) review
and update of NSSP, (ii) preparation of the Bill providing statutory basis for NSC, (iii)
implementation of the Collection of Statistics Act.

20. Policy Area II: Increasing Support from the Center to the States. The project has
supported improved and enhanced coordination and support of the central government to the
states in the area of statistics. It has supported establishing standards, norms and benchmarks for
key statistical activities that contribute to important national data series is ongoing; and
transferring technical and financial resources from the Center to states will be provided to support
the implementation of the reforms. MOSPI has defined a set of 20 key statistical activities for the
purposes of the 2007 assessment of State statistical systems. These activities are not exactly the
same as the Core Statistics discussed in the 2001 NSC Report, but they do generate the source
data for the most important economic and social indicators. They represent the set of activities
that any modern statistical system in a state will need to carry out on a regular basis. The 20
statistical activities can be grouped together under four main headings:

   Economic, financial and price statistics (7 activities)
   Production and labor market statistics (6 activities)
   Social, environmental and demographic statistics (5 activities)
   Other activities (2 activities – participation in the national sample survey and generation of
    statistics for local area planning)

In addition to financial support the project focused at establishing necessary institutional capacity
of MOSPI to support reforms at the state level.

21. Policy Area III: Strengthening the Capacity and Performance of State Statistical
Systems. One of the main areas of focus of the project was on improving statistical systems at the
state level. The 2001 NSC Report noted that the failure of the ISS stems from a deterioration in
the state statistical systems as a whole, and identified participation of the states in the reform

                                                 5
program as critical. The program has supported a detailed study, in consultation with states/UTs,
identifying specific requirements for strengthening State Statistical Bureaus. The Synthesis
Report summarizing the findings from these 35 studies was completed in 2008 following a
national workshop. As already indicated, the study defined an initial set of 20 key statistical
activities and each state was assessed on the extent it was able to undertake these activities and
comply with national requirements and the quality of the resulting data. All 35 comprehensive
States and UTs specific reports were prepared and discussed with the States/UTs and have been
widely distributed; they provide a baseline for monitoring progress under the ISSP. The project
also supported establishment of ISSP which is a centrally sponsored scheme that states volunteer
to participate by signing LOP and get resource transfer for preparing SSSPs and implementing
them. The actions envisaged in the program are completion of SSSPs by the states and beginning
of implementation, setting up High Level Steering Committees in the states for oversight of ISSP,
strengthening the role of the DES, or an alternative nodal agency, to ensure that it can play an
effective leadership role.

22. The capacity building component was also focus of the SSL. The project supported
establishment of the National Academy of Statistical Administration (NASA) as a national
statistical training institute providing on-the job training and research in official statistics. The
National Academy of Statistical Administration was inaugurated in February 2009. It was to play
the predominant role in addressing the main gaps in training provision for the ISS as a whole. In
particular, NASA is responsible for the development of curricula and training material, the
development of courses and the training of trainers.

23. Policy Area IV: Improving the Coverage, Quality, Timeliness and Credibility of Statistics
Generated by States. The NSC in 2001 and subsequent Bank work in consultation with MOSPI
and States in 2007 and 2008 demonstrated that there had been a decline in the quality and
reliability of statistics generated by state statistical systems and that there were other problems
such as data gaps, duplication leading to conflicting statistics and inordinate delays in
transmission and publication of data. The success of ISSP, therefore, was to be determined by the
extent to which it results in improvements in the timeliness, coverage, accuracy, consistency and
usefulness of the statistics produced by states. Another important outcome was supposed to be an
improvement in the awareness of users of statistical activities in states, improved access to
statistical data and increased interaction between data providers and users.

24. The results envisaged under the policy area IV are focused on improving statistics. The
ISSP is a results focused program and the main results are measurable improvements in the
quality and coverage of key statistics as determined by the extent to which states are able to
achieve the national standards. The states were expected to set their own targets for the
compilation and dissemination of indicators and data series, these targets are determined on the
basis of the needs of data users, including the needs of the state and national statistical system. As
part of the implementation of the SSSPs, states were encouraged and supported to establish a
regular consultation mechanism with data users, including those from outside the government.

26. The momentum of the reform process has been steadily building, reflected in substantive
progress, but with delays, to the original results. The matrix in Annex 2 provides a detailed
description of the performance results anticipated in the Program Document up to the end of
2010, while the summary below provides highlights of performance under each Policy Area.
Overall, there has been substantial progress towards the medium-term objectives, as set out for
2015 in the Program Document, in every Policy Area. However, the pace of the reforms has been
somewhat slower than originally anticipated, which means that many of the results expected by
the end of 2010 were not fully achieved (partly because, due to delays, the project was approved
only in June 2010).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

27. As highlighted above, the program has made substantive progress in each Policy Area,
albeit at a slower pace than originally envisaged. The major factors affecting implementation
have therefore largely been positive and conducive to the continued progress of the reforms.
These include the following:

      Sustained engagement and commitment to the reform process:
              The ISSP initiative grew out of the GOI’s strong commitment to implement
               the recommendations of the Rangarajan Commission. While it took time to
               develop the Commission‘s findings into the ISSP, with the support of further
               technical studies, the sustained commitment is evidenced by approval of the first
               CSS for statistics strengthening, along with the creation of the NSC, the
               appointment of the first Chief Statistician for India (CSI) in 2007 and the revival
               of COCSSO.
              The above process was mirrored by the substantial process of engagement
               by the Bank through a statistical capacity building trust fund. The Bank
               supported the design of the ISSP (and therefore SSL) through a number of
               technical studies between 2005-2010. This enabled the Bank to build a strong
               relationship with MOSPI and a number of States, as evidenced in particular by
               the Bank‘s participation in the national high-level Steering Committee and the
               collaboration with officials during frequent reviews (see section on monitoring
               and evaluation).
      Extensive consultations throughout a comprehensive design process:
              From around 2005, the design benefitted from a series of detailed technical
               studies. Following the Commission‘s 2001 Report, technical studies required the
               national government, the Bank and implementing agencies in all 35 States and
               UTs work together to develop the ISSP, particularly through the needs
               assessment. The Bank also shared global experiences gained in the design and
               implementation of other STATCAP projects. The resultant ISSP adopted many
               good practices for statistical capacity building as set out in the STATCAP
               framework, notably: setting the broad institutional framework; setting (20)
               national standards; setting local and national priorities through the NSSP and
               SSSPs; and increasing user awareness/demand.
              The CSS was also innovative in that, for the first time, States and UTs set
               their own priorities and timetable in State Strategic Statistical Plans (SSSPs).
               The ISSP seeks to provide greater flexibility in implementation with more local
               accountability for results, countering some of the criticisms of previous centrally
               driven CSSs (see Annex 3). While it appears to have taken time to disseminate
               the main features of the ISSP and to build support and capacity within the States
               and UTs, the almost universal commitment to participate suggests strengthened
               ownership.
      Knowledge transfer is already becoming a bottleneck in implementation at the State
       level
              The development of the SSSPs has turned out to be a more difficult task for
               most of the States. Only a few of the most advanced have managed to produce

                                               9
               good quality SSSPs. The implementation of the strategies is also much more
               challenging task and even the most advanced states will require support in how to
               manage the changes, particularly in terms of sharing good practices and lessons.
      The single disbursing SSL was acknowledged have some drawbacks
              There is timing mismatch between the single disbursing annual lifespan of
               the SSL and the long-term institutional reform. This was acknowledged in the
               Program Document, which included performance measures to 2015 and
               emphasized the need to consider ongoing technical support for the ISSP.
               However, it was not possible to design a programmatic loan as funding for the
               continuation of the ISSP under the 12th five year plan was not certain. An
               alternative Bank managed Investment Lending (IL) operation to cover such a
               broad, decentralized initiative as the ISSP was also considered to not be
               manageable. The Bank also provided limited technical assistance support for
               program design and the initial SSSPs through the Trust Fund for Statistical
               Capacity Building (TFSCB), until it closed in June 2010. Therefore, in the
               context of the engagement the instrument was considered the best option at the
               time, while recognizing the need for further funding and technical assistance
               would be needed to fully implement the ISSP.

              Implementation was helped by the enhanced use of project support.
               Institutional strengthening is a long term process and generally requires
               considerable technical assistance and capacity building. Although project
               supervision was constrained to a brief window, between the declaration of loan
               effectiveness in August 2010 and project closure in July 2011, the project team
               conducted three Support Missions within this timeframe and participated in
               numerous program-related meetings (despite the closure of the TFSCB). This
               was necessary given the complexity of supporting statistical capacity
               strengthening in 35 States/UTs, coordinated by MOSPI at the center.
      The Bank’s provision of a range of services, including technical support, knowledge
       transfer and help in facilitating the process of engagement between the center and
       the States / UTs:
              While the Bank supported technical assistance and knowledge transfer, including
               in the design stage, the SSL also helped to facilitate a complex and systematic
               program of engagement between the center and the States on the need for
               statistical strengthening. Through the SSL, the Bank is reportedly viewed as an
               independent / impartial intermediary in the ISSP and CSS process. The loan and
               CSS also helped to create a positive ‗buzz‘ as well as providing a flexible
               instrument to support what is typically seen as a backroom function at the State
               level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

28. In order to monitor the implementation process the following institutional framework
was established: At the central level a Steering Committee for the ISSP under the
Chairpersonship of the Secretary (MoSPI) was constituted to monitor implementation of the
project. The Project Support Group (PSG) was established and was responsible within the MoSPI
for monitoring progress and for providing support to the states. Although at the beginning the
PSG was not able to provide an adequate and timely support to the States, actions were taken to
strengthen its capacity based on the recommendations of the High-Level Steering Committee that

                                              10
was created to oversee the statistical reform and to monitor the progress of the ISSP. The Deputy
Director General from the Social Statistics Division (MoSPI) was Project Manager for the ISSP.
High-level Steering Committees in each State/UT were created under chairpersonship of the
concerned Chief Secretary/Administrator. A Technical Support Group (TSG) was constituted and
headed by the Deputy Director General of Coordination and Publication Division (CAP), which
was supervised by the Additional Director General of the Social Statistics Division. The PSG and
TSG work closely together and report jointly to the Additional Director General, Coordination
and Publication Department (CAP). Periodic monitoring was envisaged at the States/UTs level,
preferably every 3 months and at the central level every 6 months.

29. Project arrangements allowed not only monitoring of progress and project performance,
but also supported the implementation of the project at both technical and policy levels. The
Bank supported efforts of the GOI in assessing implementation through its Support Missions,
until the loan closing date of July 31, 2011. In particular, a monitoring framework for the ISSP
and draft reporting forms to assess the progress of preparation and implementation of SSSPs were
developed by the Bank and shared with MoSPI. This framework was sent to all the State based
Deputy Director Generals (DDGs), who had regular meetings with the Directors of the
Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) and reported back to the senior management of the
MoSPI. Besides, consultancy support was provided by the Bank to assist the states in
development of the SSSPs, and workshops were organized to facilitate this work following a
unified approach. However, variance in states‘ capacity and quality of statistics collected remains
a challenge and requires additional resources. Although the Program was aiming to improve
statistics at the level of State/UTs the unification of the nation-wide indicators was also a subject
of concern and focus. For this purpose the list of Key Statistical Activities was approved at the
central level to facilitate the coordination efforts of GoI regarding implementation of nation-wide
indicators at the states level.

30. The M&E system has been broadly effective and focused on key steps in the GOI's
program of engagement with the States on Statistical Strengthening. The M&E system focused
on the process steps during the time of the SSL and alerted the MOSPI and Bank team to the
somewhat slower than anticipated pace of reform early in the process, which enabled the Bank to
increase the number of Support Missions and the GOI to strengthen its oversight of program
implementation. Support Missions were increased to a quarterly frequency, with local Bank staff
also participating in regular ISSP meetings with MOSPI.

31. At the same time, the design of the ongoing program might be strengthened by
incorporating the intermediate steps between actions i.e. it would have been advisable to map
out, and regularly update, the trajectory of the reform process from those activities completed by
end-2010, through to the final outcomes in the policy matrix (due in 2015). Although this would
have been outside of the period covered by the loan, it could have helped to highlight the
potential impact of the slower than anticipated progress with the initial reforms for the ISSP and
helped in the design of corrective or mitigating actions where possible that could then be
monitored by MOSPI on an ongoing basis.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

32. While Bank engagement formally ends with the current SSL; the GOI is considering
further support. Going forward, the GOI needs to determine and then initiate the next steps in
order to continue the engagement with the Bank following the end of the SSL and TFSCB. To
maintain Bank support for the reform effort, clear direction from the GoI is required, ideally
within the context of the new five year plan and updated NSSP (due in early 2012).

                                                 11
33. At the time the Loan was approved it was anticipated that the Bank’s engagement would
need to continue in the medium term. The success of the Government‘s reform program rests on
a gradual improvement in the capacity and performance of the state statistical systems and their
increasing integration into the national statistical system. This requires the continued provision of
technical advice and support, to help states to prepare their strategic plans and, especially, to
support their implementation. The Bank may well be able to play an important role in supporting
the dialogue with states as well as helping to share experience and expertise, particularly through
South-South dialogue and knowledge sharing with Bank STATCAP projects. Such an
engagement would provide access to high level advice, technical support and examples of best
practice from other countries.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34. The objective of the Statistical Strengthening Loan (SSL) was to support the national
policy of the Government of India to reform the institutional structure and improve the
operational efficiency of the state statistical systems. The loan objective is relevant to both the
Bank's program of engagement in the country and the Government's reform program. It was
designed to contribute to the implementation of CAS outcome I, i.e., achieving rapid inclusive
growth. More importantly, the loan supports the long term initiative of the Government to
improve statistical system in India that is necessary to support economic policy making in the
GOI and States. It is also in line with the growing demand for statistical information by the
private sector and the public, particularly for informing investment decisions and for holding
governments accountable.

35. The program was based on a lengthy, comprehensive design process and sustained
engagement that helped to promote a well designed program that is consistent with the Bank’s
good practice STATCAP framework. The design of the program originated in the NSC Report of
2001, which identified key deficiencies and priorities for the statistical system in India. The Bank
re-engaged with the GOI to discuss support to statistical strengthening in 2005 and shared
experiences with STATCAP projects worldwide as well as funding several studies, conducted by
MOSPI, to identify the critical gaps in strengthening the coverage and quality of national
statistics. This became the basis of the ISSP, with its four policy elements that are fully in line
with the good practice in other institutional strengthening STATCAP programs, adjusted for the
particular federal characteristics of the system, namely: (I) Strengthening the institutions of
leadership and coordination of the National Statistical System; (II) Improving and increasing the
support provided by the Central Government and the Ministry of Statistics and Program
Implementation to the statistical systems of State/UTs; (III) Strengthening the capacity and
performance of the statistical systems in a majority of States/UTs in India; and (IV) Improving
the coverage, quality, timeliness and credibility of statistics generated by States and UTs. The
focus of the program on both statistics at the state level and improved coordination with the
center has played a useful role in bringing different states and central statistical agencies together
and focusing reform efforts on concrete next steps.

36. As discussed in section 2, the design of the Governments Centrally Sponsored Scheme
(CSS) was also innovative. The CSS that the SSL supported sought to overcome many of the
constraints previously identified for such schemes (see Annex 3), with a more flexible, State
driven approach to the design that focused on accountability for results rather than top down
command and control – such approach facilitated performance based focus of this CSS The
States, through the SSSPs, set their own priorities and timetables and have almost universally

                                                 12
committed to the scheme—which must be considered a major positive result for the ISSP in
setting up a mechanism to link financial transfers to performance.

37. While financing needs did not dominate in the dialogue with authorities in India, the
Bank’s involvement in the reform program through the SSL operation has been regarded by
the Government as an important catalyst for reform. The preparation and subsequent DPL
operation supported the Government reform program at both national and local levels. The Bank
helped to strengthen the relationship between the central government and the States and UTs,
particularly through the preparatory studies, which covered all States, and through the provision
of supportive technical assistance and other capacity building efforts. Moreover, the existence of
the DPL triggered as suggested by several Government officials additional resources channeled to
improved state statistics from the Thirteenth Finance Commission.

38. The choice of the single disbursing SSL as an instrument for supporting the reform,
although unusual, was justified at the stage of formulation of the project. As discussed in
section two, a single disbursement DPL, without considerable complementary technical support,
does not appear to be best suited to such a multi-year institutional reform program. However, the
only alternatives at the time could have been investment operation or programmatic DPL series.
Investment lending was not a good option due to the nature of the reform, which was attempting
to initiate the statistical reform in thirty five States and UTs. A programmatic DPL was also not
possible due to mismatch between Bank and Government planning cycles--the Government could
not commit to a reform program that was outside of the 11th five year plan, which is finishing in
early 2012. Thus, given the imperative to support the CSS backed ISSP the ICR team believes
that the DPL instrument was justified, and an innovative response to circumstances.

39. Nonetheless, the complexity of the program and choice of supporting Bank instrument
has led to certain limitations that could be taken into account in designing similar operations
to improve the sustainability of reforms. The ISSP is understandably ambitious in wanting to
cover all the States and UTs, given that weak links inhibit aggregation or intra-country
comparisons. While the SSL backed CSS ensured resource transfers and helped jump start the
reform process, the delays highlighted in the Results at a Glance chart show that capacity
constraints and knowledge transfer is already becoming a bottleneck in the implementation at the
State level. The development of the SSSPs has turned out to be a more difficult task than
anticipated for most of the States and only a few of the most advanced have managed to produce
good quality strategic documents. The issue of technical assistance as well as measuring the
quality of outputs and outcomes are common to many centrally sponsored schemes implemented
in India (See Annex 3). Furthermore, the implementation of the strategies is also proving more
challenging and even the most advanced States require support in how to manage the required
changes, particularly in terms of sharing good practices and lessons.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (PDO)
40. The assessment of the PDO achievement is a challenge because of the mismatch between
the SSL closing date (July 31, 2011) and the term of the Government’s program. This includes
the 11th five year plan (up to February 2012) and the 2015 targets elaborated in the ISSP. Since
the main goal of the loan was to support the efforts of the GoI to reform the institutional structure
and to improve the operational efficiency of the state statistical system, it would be more accurate
to assess the achievements associated with the planned period rather than with the closing date of
the loan. While successful implementation and achievement of the final objectives require the
strengthened institutional capacity and actions in the States and UTs as envisaged under the ISSP,
the determination of these is still very premature.


                                                 13
41. The final outcomes envisaged in the project are expected by 2015, but the mid-term
outcomes based on the tasks completed within the life of the loan are provided in the Result
Matrix (See Annex 1). The results presented in the matrix assess a progress achieved in the four
policy areas.

42. Overall, the loan has been successful in supporting the initial stages, albeit with delays,
of the national policy to reform the institutional structure and to improve the operational
efficiency of the state statistical systems. While progress across the board has been markedly
slower than originally envisaged, and therefore many of the process indicators for end-2010 have
only been partially met (even well into 2011), tangible progress is witnessed in all four policy
areas. The GOI has also demonstrated an appropriate policy framework to promote and sustain
the reforms under high level leadership—for example, as described in section 2, the GOI has
committed both resources and supported the institutions to maintain the reforms (such as
appointing the Chief Statistician to lead the process or reviving COCSSO). The development of
the National Strategic Statistical Plan (NSSP), and the agreed timetable for its revision in 2012,
also signals the Government‘s continued commitment to and leadership of the reform effort. In
addition, the commitment of almost all the States and UTs to develop their own SSSP
demonstrates the renewed interested and buy-in to the broader statistical system and ISSP
framework. The development of the statistical standards and data collection methodologies for
key statistical activities is also ongoing.

43. The slippages in PDO indicators and achievements appear to result largely from
bottlenecks in capacity and knowledge transfer to the States and UTs. Some delays to the SSL
were the consequence of obtaining the required approvals and clearances for what was the first
DPL in India. More importantly, while 33 states have indicated their willingness to participate
through the signing of a Letter of Participation (LoP), the fact that the SSSP preparation is not
more advanced could be explained to some extent by the limited capacity of the states in drafting
such comprehensive documents where the main direction of the reform and measures for its
implementation should be envisaged. In addition, at the central level the development of training
needs and a capacity building program are still going slowly.

44. Nonetheless, the project met the main objective of catalyzing the reform process and
creating conditions and incentives for the states to improve statistics. As long as the ISSP
framework can be sustained, with additional capacity building and knowledge transfer, it should
help to improve collection of key statistical indicators as well as improve the overall statistical
capacity at the state level.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

45. The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory based on the fact that despite the
delays the SSL has helped to trigger the long term institutional reform process being carried
out by the Government. While progress on implementation of the medium term actions was
slower than expected, as witnessed by the partially met nature of many of the indicators, the pace
of reform appears to have picked up during 2011. The majority of the intermediate indicators
have more recently been achieved or are on the way to being achieved before the end of 11th Five
Year Plan.

46. In addition, and despite the long and comprehensive design stage, the complexity and
ambitious scope/scale of reforms in a country the size of India, suggests that the rating of

                                                14
moderately satisfactory was a high probability at this stage of the reform process. On the
positive side, although the states are taking longer than expected to achieve results, partly due to
the lack of capacity and the lengthy initial learning period, the reform process has a sustainable
nature as evidenced by the number of participating States / UTs and progress in the preparation of
SSSPs in 2011.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

47. The loan did not have any direct impact on poverty reduction; however by improving
statistics and building institutional capacity at the state level, it initiated reforms that would
improve monitoring of poverty and social data. The standardization of state statistics supported
by the loan focuses on 20 key statistical activities that would be improved or established in all
participating states. These key activities include the education and literacy statistics, morbidity
and fertility statistics as well as price statistics. All of them are critical element of the policy
making and would contribute to more efficient and targeted social assistance thus alleviating
poverty in the country.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

48. The impact of the SSL on institutional strengthening originates from the design of the
operation supporting institutional reform in the area of statistics. This impact is actually larger
than of a regular development policy operation. An objective of the project was to help India set
up the institutional framework for better statistics. The main institutional impact of the reforms
supported by the loan is based on the following reform actions:

    (1) increased independence of the statistical system, which was effected through the
        promulgation of the Collection of Statistics Act, appointment of the Chief Statistician and
        permanent status of the National Statistical Commission (the draft law to legalize its
        status is now in Parliament);
    (2) enhanced coordination of the statistics collection and analysis between the center and the
        states as well as within the states. The project created a platform for discussion by
        establishing an annual Conference of Center and State Statistical Organizations where the
        states and center can discuss issues in the area of statistics and share experiences. The
        methodological guidance from the center is ensured by preparation of statistical manuals
        which is progressing well and over 10 manuals have been approved and posted by fall
        2011;
    (3) modernize institutional set-up at the state level to facilitate statistics collection and
        analysis. The high level steering committees have been established in 31 states, many
        states are preparing SSSPs and seven have already approved them.

49. Another important aspect of the long term capacity building is a focus on training. The
training needs of the states were assessed as part of the SSSP preparation exercise for about 15
states. The National Academy of Statistical Administration is developing the training program to
support implementation of the states‘ statistical strategies.

50. The institutional changes have been slower than expected. The states have started later
and been slower than expected in preparation of their SSSPs, partly due to the program being
approved later than planned, but the pace of this process has picked up only more recently. Also,
capacity was a constraint at both state and central level. The Bank operation could not ensure

                                                15
adequate knowledge transfer due to design of DPL operation although technical assistance
provided by the Bank covered some of the gap.

51. At the same time, there is no doubt that institutional changes supported by the loan are
likely to continue. The National Statistical Strategic Plan has been approved and is now being
revised based on implementation experience so far. The 13th Finance Commission has recognized
the importance of statistics and has given the grant to the districts for improving estimation of
state and district domestic product. The CSS supported by the project will be completed early
2012, and it is unclear whether the new centrally sponsored scheme ―Basic Statistics for Local
Level Development‖ would be launched as part of the 12th Five Year Plan.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

52.    There were no unintended outcomes.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

53. The risk to development outcome is considered to be moderate, based on the robust
commitment demonstrated by the GOI towards the strengthening of the decentralized statistical
system and improving coordination between the Center and States/UTs, although future
funding has not yet been firmed up. The project has supported a well articulated home grown
reform program of the Government of India. The milestones and outcomes were designed around
the ISSP program implemented by the Government and although progress was initially slower
than expected, in the course of 2011 it picked up significant momentum. The Government has
shown commitment to statistics reform by allocating funds under the CSS and through the 13th
Finance Commission. The latter targets a defined set of state level indicators used to produce
national statistics and thus complements the CSS. Nonetheless, without further financing it is
unlikely that the remainder of the States and UTs will receive the capacity building and
knowledge transfer required for such a reform. While MOSPI has indicated that statistics reform
will continue to be a priority in the 12th Five Year Plan (see Borrower ICR) this is not yet certain,
as the 12th Plan is under preparation and will be released only in March 2012. As noted in the
Borrowers ICR, in the interim the program has been restricted to the ―number of States/UTs that
can be covered during the 11th Plan period to about 15 States/UTs, with the possibility of
covering the remaining States/ UTs during the 12th Plan period subject to required approvals and
availability of funds.‖

54. The rating also reflects the critical need for continued support of the first few States that
are only just starting to implement their SSSPs. There has been little central disbursement for
the implementation of the SSSPs, although much of the money will eventually come from the
States themselves. It is important that the pioneering States can demonstrate successful
implementation, and share their experiences with other, sometimes less capable, States and UTs.
This ‗demonstration effect‘ could have a catalytic effect on encouraging other States, and also
showing what is possible (and perhaps the benefits from better statistics, such as encouraging
private investment). Going forward, significant capacity building and guidance will be required
from the center to support this process of dissemination and lesson learning. While most of the
states and union territories have signed up for the ISSP and many have prepared SSSPs already,

                                                 16
the uneven and often low capacity may hamper implementation. Arguably, India is approaching a
critical threshold in the initiation and implementation of statistics reform and continued resources
and focus on reform would be key to success.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

    Rating: Satisfactory

55. The Bank worked closely with the government to identify reforms and to follow-up on the
progress. As noted above, the Bank re-engaged in the design of the statistical reform process in
2005 and supported a number of technical studies and technical assistance at the center and across
the States and UTs. This helped to ensure the quality at entry and bolster the government‘s strong,
demonstrated commitment to the ISSP, as evidenced by the prior actions in Annex 2, and that for
the first time funds were earmarked under the thirteenth finance commission for the improvement
of statistical systems in state governments. This also demonstrated the strategic relevance and the
buy-in of government commitment. While the Bank was responsive to the client‘s reform
strategy, it did select key policy and process actions to help focus the program, consistent with the
STATCAP framework.

56. The design of the program also mitigated some of the risks with CSSs. Annex 3 highlights
some of the more common problems with CSSs, which was an issue also raised in the Bank‘s
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) of March 2008. However, in the CSS for the ISSPs, MOSPI
are not only the sponsors and monitors, but they also provide technical assistance and guidance to
the States/UTs. The States/UTs also lead the process through the production of their individual
SSSPs that ensure appropriate local flexibility and accountability. The Bank has played an active
role in promoting this process, for example in supporting the needs assessments in the States/UTs
that have built the trust of the States and help to design a more supportive/appropriate framework
for support under the CSS.

57. The Bank worked closely with the government to identify a workable method for
supporting the ISSP. The program of support had a lengthy development process in order to
consider various options and identify the most feasible mechanism for supporting the ISSP. As
noted in the Quality Enhancement Review (QER) of March 2008 the proposed operation
switched from a SIL (Specific Investment Loan) to be one of India‘s first central-level DPLs
(development policy loan). While the QER proposal had considered a programmatic series of
loans or tranches, which might have been better suited to the medium-term nature of the
institutional strengthening program as highlighted in the outcomes shown in Annex 2, this was
eventually not possible given the uncertainty over the future funding in the Twelfth Five-Year
Plan (2012-17), which is expected to be updated in March 20123, and the WB's rules on the



3
 As explained in the QER, a SIL covering such a large number of States would have been very complex to
manage. With regard to the DPL design, in addition to the GOI funding issues, a series is considered to

                                                  17
timing of programmatic DPLs. Consequently, a single tranche loan that bolstered the GOI‘s
demonstrated commitment to the ISSP, which included significant prior actions (see Annex 2),
and expected intermediate and medium-term results was an innovative solution.

58.     The above features combine to justify the rating of ‘Satisfactory’ for the Quality at Entry.


(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

      Rating: Satisfactory

59. At an early stage the Bank identified the need for frequent Implementation Support
Missions. The November 2010 Mission concluded that ―given the performance towards the
progress benchmarks and the gap between realized and planned targets, the Bank team is ready to
support MoSPI and will be glad to conduct more frequent implementation support missions. As
agreed, the Bank will conduct these missions every two months till the loan closing date of July
31, 2011 to jointly review the progress on agreed results.‖ The Bank also participated in meetings
of the high-level Steering Committee for the ISSP, which identifies states requiring additional
support, and regular technical meetings within MOSPI.

60. The implementation of the reforms accelerated during the period of intensive support
from the Bank. The momentum of the reform program is witnessed by the progress demonstrated
in the Bank Aide Memoires and ISRs, and summarized in the table in Annex 2. The Bank‘s
proactive and relatively intensive approach to supervision in the year following disbursement,
which identified challenges and proposed additional measures at an early stage, justifies a
‗Satisfactory‘ rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

      Rating: Satisfactory

61. The overall rating for the Bank’s Performance is Satisfactory. The Bank worked closely
with the government to develop a relevant reform agenda that strategically addressed several core
constraints in the country. The Bank also took an innovative approach to program design in the
face of numerous constraints to more conventional operations, such as a SIL, while taking a
proactive and intensive (particularly for a single tranche policy loan) approach to supervision that
helped to promote momentum after a slow start to the overall reform program.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




have lapsed if two successive operations are more than two years apart, while the two operations would
have had to support a five-year program.

                                                    18
62. The Borrower’s performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The success of the ISSP
program so far can be attributed to the GOI, as the borrower, and in particular MOSPI‘s high
level commitment to see it succeed. States/UTs have also enthusiastically signed up to the
program supported by the innovative CSS and 13th finance commission. However, the time
required for the GOI to provide the required approvals and clearances for the DPL resulted in a
delay of almost nine months from negotiations to Board presentation (this is one of the reasons
for the somewhat limited achievements at loan closure). In addition, the GOI should continue to
prioritize statistical reforms, by approving the updated NSSP in a timely fashion and providing
the statutory basis for the independent statistical authority, the NSC, which remains in progress.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63. The implementing Agency’s performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. While the
MOSPI has played a consistent and pivotal role in pushing through progress on the reforms, Bank
support missions identified at an early stage the need for more intensive efforts to achieve
satisfactory progress under the loan—in particular with regard to establishing an effective system
to monitor progress, the need for greater systematic guidance and more timely support to the
states/UTs and the need to enhance coordination and clarity on the division of work between the
Program Support Group, the Coordination and Publications Division and the Technical Advisory
Group. Once these issues were addressed, program performance began to accelerate in 2011.
MOSPI has also sought to strengthen its own capacity to provide guidance and quality assurance
to the States/UTs, with regard to preparing and implementing the SSSPs, as working relationships
have evolved. In the future, States and UTs, and particularly those with weak capacity, are likely
to need higher levels of support from the MOSPI to enact their reforms.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64. Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The ratings reflect a combination
of the performance of the GOI and MOSPI, which are supporting the performance of the States
and UTs. Beyond government ownership of the reforms, the Government of India has been
proactive during the process and in committing the resources and personnel to facilitate it. As a
result, the initial stages of the program were at least partially delivered, albeit with some delays.
With the continued strong support from the central government there are also good prospects for
achieving the medium-term goals, though perhaps with some further delays, which includes the
critical implementation phase for most States and UTs.

6. Lessons Learned

65. Using a single tranche SSL to support a complex multi-annual institution building
program was justified under circumstances, but has drawbacks. There is an obvious mismatch
between the lifespan of the DPL and such a multi-year capacity building and institutional reform
initiative. This was the only option at the time to support a priority area: a programmatic DPL
series was not possible due to the timing of the next plan and WB timing requirements while the
ICR team concurs that a standard Specific Investment Lending (SIL) operation would be
impossible to manage, covering such a broad, decentralized initiative. Nonetheless, India has a
well developed planning system that allowed the SSL to work in combination with the innovative


                                                 19
CSS. The Bank could also call on limited trust funds and mainly locally based staff to provide
intensive supervision and some technical assistance. Therefore, in the context of the engagement
the instrument was considered the best option at the time.

66. To make up for lack of knowledge transfer under the instrument, the Bank team has
provided intensive support over an extended period of time. Success lies in following up on the
implementation details of the reform process, which is critical to the sustainable effectiveness of
the reforms. In this case, the intensive supervision focused on numerous detailed implementation
issues that helped to promote momentum and trust between the center and the implementing
agencies in the States and UTs. This is demonstrated by the intensive and frequent ‗Support
Missions‘ conducted by the Bank team (unusual for a single disbursement DPL), as well as
participation of the Bank in many technical meetings. This was only possible due to the
commitment of staff based in Delhi, who could routinely follow up on issues as they emerged.
However, this is also only possible throughout the duration of the loan, and risks a ‗sudden stop‘
with regard to the technical support of the Bank at a critical stage in the implementation of the
reforms.

67. The major lesson for similar operations is that budget support for institutional reforms
should only be used with strong and mature country systems, and with greater emphasis on
knowledge transfer and strengthening analytical capacity. Although the operation ensured
resource transfers and helped jump start the reform process, knowledge transfer is becoming a
bottleneck in the implementation at the state level. Despite the lengthy and comprehensive design
period, the development of the SSSPs has turned out to be a more difficult task for most of the
states and only a few of the most advanced have managed to produce good quality strategic
documents. The implementation of the strategies is also much more challenging task and even the
most advanced states will require support in how to do the changes, particularly in terms of
sharing good practices and lessons.

68. Given the experience gained so far, the design of the program might also be strengthened
by incorporating intermediate steps between the actions and the final outcomes in the policy
matrix. Currently there is a big gap in the matrix between the initial process steps, covered in the
loan period (2010), and the expected outcomes in 2015. Setting out the trajectory of the delivery
chain from the start, including the intermediate milestones, could help MOSPI better manage the
pace and path of the reforms. By flexibly managing the trajectory on an ongoing basis MOSPI
might be better equipped to adjust to delays, exogenous shocks and other factors.

69. The States and UTs would benefit from additional technical assistance and capacity
building efforts to both develop SSSPs and implement them. Institutional strengthening
programs like the ISSP require significant technical and change management resources, and the
Bank has demonstrated itself well suited to provide specific technical support to the GOI and
selected States/UTs and to share experiences from its global network of STATCAP projects. A
further operation, which perhaps combines the advantages of a multi-year financing instrument
with more dedicated resources for capacity building and peer-to-peer lesson sharing might be
considered by the GOI to help support the implementation of the remainder of the ISSP.

Annex 3. Centrally Sponsored Schemes
The Centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) are the designed to meet development goals and main
fiscal mechanism through which the central government can influence state development
expenditure decisions. The design and policy management of CSS are derived at the center, as
they are at their core, efforts by the center to influence outcomes in every state. In this scenario,
they also offer an opportunity for the center to systematically address implementation problems
across the system and in so doing generate the momentum for further reforms.
Many elements of the accountability system are weak in India‘s current mechanisms for
delivering public expenditure. Providers are typically held accountable for money spent and
processes followed but not for the quality of services rendered - excessive focus on inputs, limited
evidence based planning, limited local discretion on resource allocation; no systematic
monitoring process, no link between spending capability, outcomes and access to finances, weak
oversight, limited citizen participation in oversight.
Time bound targets for many of these programs need to take an evidence?based approach and be
sensitive to areas that need extra assistance. For example, data should be available on which
districts or states are unable to appropriately plan or implement CSS, whether due to weak
administration, a lack of existing infrastructure, or an inability to complete projects. And thereby
weaker states could receive technical assistance or greater human or financial resources. Goals
should also be responsive to the fluctuations of both inputs and outputs. Risk and institutional
performance indicators can be used to track key contextual changes that may affect outcome
achievement.
CSS guidelines have very strict norms about timing and processes through which funds are
released from the center to the states and onwards. Broadly, the process follows the following
logic. Once plans are in place and budgets have been approved, the central government releases
its first installment of finances for the state. The state then adds its share and releases requisite
funds – as determined by the plans – to the district which in turn releases funds to the service
delivery units. The release of funds is contingent upon various procedures being fulfilled at the
state and district level.
Clear, credible goals would create benchmarks that Ministries, states, and local organizations can
be held to. The process approach to design and implementation could help subgroups and
individuals have a clearer sense of purpose in implementing the scheme.

   1. Indian Statistical System and India Statistical Strengthening Project (ISSP):

        The Indian Official Statistical System has the responsibility to provide adequate,
relevant, reliable and timely official statistics/data sets for use in informed decision
making and for the formulation of plans and programmes. This task/ function is
performed at the national level by the statistical system consisting of the Central Statistics
Office (CSO), National Sample Survey Office, the Office of the Registrar General of
India, the various line Ministries/ Departments and Organizations of the Government of
India. The Statistical System in the States, which is almost similar to that at the centre, is
generally decentralized over the departments of State/Union Territories (UT)
Governments. At the apex level in the States/UTs, there usually exists a Directorate (or
Bureau) of Economics and Statistics, which is responsible for the coordination of the
statistical activities in the States/UTs. Much of the administrative data flows from the
State system to the National Statistical System and as such, the latter is dependent on the
former, on many of the socio-economic data and indicators. The State Statistical System
is an integral part of the Indian Statistical System and improvements in State Statistical
Systems are critical to the improvement in the National Statistical System.

       A National Statistical Commission (NSC) under the Chairmanship of Dr. C.
Rangarajan was appointed by the Government of India in January 2000 to examine
critically the deficiencies in the statistical system and to recommend measures for its
systematic revamping. The Commission in its report submitted to the Government in
September 2001 listed several data gaps and deficiencies in the statistical system. On the
basis of national consultations with all concerned stakeholders, a medium term Vision,
Policy and Strategic Framework Document entitled ‘National Strategic Statistical Plan’
(NSSP) has been formulated for the purpose of guiding the course of development,

                                             36
improvement and growth of the national statistical system. In the context of effectively
addressing the various problems faced by the state statistical systems, and with a view to
improving the State Statistical Systems, a centrally sponsored scheme viz. ‘India
Statistical Strengthening Project (ISSP)’ has been formulated for implementation from
2010-11 during the 11th five year plan.



   2. Objectives of ISSP:

       The objective of the ISSP is to strengthen the capacity and operations of the
Indian Statistical System in line with the NSC (2001) recommendations, by strengthening
the capacity of the State Statistical Systems. The project is designed to help build the
required capacities at the States/UTs level to collect, compile and disseminate relevant
and reliable official statistics, to serve the twin objectives of planning and policy making
at the state and local levels and to provide the data that would be required at the national
level. The project is essentially based on the outcomes of 35 detailed State/UT reports
with regard to ―Identifying the Specific Requirements for Strengthening of State
Statistical Bureaus‖. It also proposes help to develop structures to assist the line
departments and other data agencies to improve the quality and coverage of the data they
collect and to promote their usage at the State/District and Block levels. The project has
been designed to cover the following key areas of support to the States/UTs

   a) Improving the coordination and management of Statistical Activities in the
   States/UTs;

   b) Developing statistical skills and capacity (Human Resource Development);

   c) Developing statistical infrastructure;

   d) Investing in physical infrastructure, including Information Technology, and

   e) Improving Statistical Operations(data collection, processing, management and
   dissemination), especially those supporting the cause of Improvement in the quality
   and dissemination of statistical data, particularly for 20 key statistical activities.




                                               37
       Twenty Key Statistical Activities have been identified for taking up in the
Project. These are:

   1) Estimation of State Domestic Product

   2) Estimation of Capital formation and Savings

   3) Estimation of District Domestic Product

   4) Estimation of the contribution of local bodies

   5) Compilation of data on major Fiscal variables

   6) Participation in the conduct of Annual Survey of Industries

   7) Compilation of Index of Industrial Production

   8) Estimation of Crop area and Production

   9) Compilation of Wholesale Price Index numbers

   10) Compilation of Consumer Price Index numbers

   11) Collection and compilation of Health, Morbidity and Mortality and Family
       Welfare Statistics

   12) Collection and compilation of Education and Literacy statistics

   13) Collection and compilation of Labour and Employment statistics

   14) Collection and compilation of Housing statistics

   15) Birth and Death registration and Population

   16) Compilation of Electricity production and distribution statistics

   17) Compilation of Environment and Forest statistics

   3. Scope and Strengths of ISSP:
       India Statistical Strengthening Project (ISSP) is a comprehensive project designed
to strengthen State statistical systems by way of providing adequate technical and
financial support to improve both their statistical capacity and infrastructure for
collecting, compiling and disseminating reliable official statistics for policy planning
purposes particularly at the State and Sub-State levels. With the above primary objective,
ISSP could also be perceived to act as a catalyst in facilitating implementation of
National Strategic Statistical Plan (NSSP) for meeting growing data requirements both at
national and international levels. It aims to strengthen the State Statistical Systems and
their Statistical operations according to national standards in terms of quality, timeliness,
adequacy, relevance, utility, user-friendliness and user-satisfaction. This, in turn, would
help in strengthening the National Statistical System to meet the ever-growing and ever-
diversifying data requirements, both at the National/Sub-National and International levels
in a cost-effective and operationally feasible and efficient manner.

       ISSP is being implemented as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of the Government
of India (GOI) formulated during the Eleventh five-year Plan, with an approved outlay of
Rs.650.43 crores of which 80% has been funded through a World Bank Loan and 20%
borne by the Government of India. ISSP provides for States/UTs to sign up to a process
of reform and capacity strengthening in line with the recommendations of the NSC and to
adopt and follow national guidelines and standards. In return for preparing and then
implementing the State Strategic Statistical Plan, the participating states receive technical
and financial support through ISSP. It gives the participating State/UT a unique
opportunity to make a comprehensive assessment of the existing State Statistical System
in its entirety, identify the major deficiencies and potentiality and prepare a suitable
realistic plan accordingly, to be implemented in phases towards accomplishing the goal.

       Recognizing that there are substantial differences and significant levels of
disparities in the levels and status of development of the sub-national level statistical
systems in India spread across various States and UTs, the ISSP has             accordingly
provided for, in its design, ample and adequate flexibility to the States/UTs in terms of
various relevant parameters, taking necessary and due cognizance of State-specific


                                             39
situations, requirements, variations, perceptions and priorities with regard to ‗Official
Statistics‘ and the systems and organizations pertaining thereto.



   4. Processes for implementation of ISSP:

       All the States and Union Territories (UTs) of the country are eligible to participate
in and benefit from this Project. However, eventually, the project would get implemented
only in all those States and UTs which decide to participate in the same and
communicate/articulate their decision to do so in this regard through sending a Letter of
Participation (LOP). The participating States/UTs are then required to prepare State
Strategic Statistical Plan (SSSP) outlining the vision, development plan and
implementation strategies for the respective State/UT. A seed money of Rs. 10 lakhs each
is provided to each participating State/UT (with the exception of Haryana and Chattisgarh,
which had been provided earlier with the corresponding support through an alternative
instrument earlier) towards preparation of the respective State Strategic Statistical Plan
(SSSP), inter-alia based on extensive interaction with all the stakeholders concerned.
After getting the SSSP finalized and duly approved by the High Level Steering
Committee on ISSP at State Government and subsequently at GOI Level, the MoU
(Memorandum of Understanding) is signed between the Ministry of Statistics and
Programme Implementation (MOS&PI), Government of India and the concerned State
Government/ UT Administration on a case to case basis. On signing of MoU, the first
instalment will be released in accordance with the guidelines incorporated in the SSSPs
and relevant provisions of the concerned MoU to commence implementation of the
Project, for which the funds are subsequently released in installments as per MoU.


   5. Support provided by MOSPI to the States/UTs & institutional arrangements

          At the Central level, a Steering Committee on India Statistical Strengthening
Project (ISSP) under the Chairpersonship of Secretary (Statistics & and Programme
Implementation), Government of India, has been constituted to monitor the
implementation of the Project. The Project Implementation Unit of Central Statistics
Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, created earlier for the

                                            40
purpose has since been suitably upgraded and rechristened as Project Support Group
(PSG), which is functioning under the overall supervision and guidance of the Director
General, CSO.

          The Project Support Group on ISSP in MoSPI has been continuously and
periodically reviewing, directing and providing all the required guidelines and technical
expertise with regard to all the facets of activities connected with the preparation and
implementation of the State/UT specific SSSPs and the MoUs based thereon. This apart,
Senior Indian Statistical Service Officers working in the Field Operations Division of
National Sample Survey Office, designated as State Statistical Co-ordinators (SSCs) are
also entrusted with the coordination with States/UTs as local contact points with regard to
implementation of ISSP.

          In addition, in each of the implementing States/UTs, there are high level
Steering Committees functioning under the chairpersonship of the concerned Chief
Secretary/ Administrator to provide the required leadership, directions, impetus and
supervision for the project implementation in the respective States/UTs, besides
undertaking periodic reviews on the status and progress of the Project. Senior officials
from MoSPI invariably participate in and provide their inputs, especially from a national
perspective.

          To move, further, faster and more efficiently on the implementation of the
India Statistical Strengthening Project (ISSP), a need has been recognized and endorsed
by the Steering Committee on ISSP of the Government of India to organize ISSP
implementation issue-oriented/ focussed workshops for the States which have already
signed MOU with the Government of India and commenced implementation of the
Project as also for those other States which are, in a relative and comparative sense, at a
somewhat slow stage of pick-up and progress with respect to the finalisation and
approval of their respective State Strategic Statistical Plans (SSSPs). All this is over and
above the comprehensive and detailed reviews on all dimensions of the Project
undertaken annually at the Conference of Central and State Statistical Organisations
(COCSSO). Another noteworthy feature is that, during the annual events of COCSSO,
review of progress on ISSP is a permanent agenda item and the only one of its kind.

   6. Progress so far

       The CCEA approved ISSP on 19th March, 2010. All the States/UTs are
participating in the project except Goa and Chandigarh which may also join subsequently.

             Seed money of Rs. 324 lakhs has been provided to the participating 33
              States/UTs to initiate the process of preparation of the respective State
              Strategic Statistical Plans (SSSPs).
             In December 2010, Karnataka became the first state to sign MoU with
              Government of India and initiate implementation of their SSSP. Till
              March 2011, two more states viz. Gujarat and Rajasthan also signed MoU
              on ISSP. However, first installment of funds was released only to the
              State of Karnataka as per the financial plans approved. During the current
              year i.e. 2011-12 the Project gathered a significant momentum with the
              active enthusiasm on the part of the States/UTs. Till the end of 2011,
              three more States (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu) have signed
              MoU with Government of India to start implementation of the Project.
              Kerala is likely to sign MoU with GOI and start implementation shortly
              from now.
             In addition, for four more States/UT viz. Jharkhand, Mizoram, Sikkim and
              Lakshadweep, the finalised State Strategic Statistical Plans (SSSPs) have
              been approved by the GOI High level Steering Committee paving the way
              for signing of MoU for implementation of their SSSPs.
             The States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha have also got their
              SSSP approved by the respective State High level Steering Committees
              under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretaries concerned.
             This apart, five other States viz. Haryana, West Bengal, Arunachal
              Pradesh, Delhi, and Assam have achieved significant progress in regard to
              finalisation of respective SSSPs (State Strategic Statistical Plans) in
              anticipation of getting appropriate support through ISSP, while the



                                           42
    remaining participating states are currently at various stages of progress in
    this regard.
   Keeping in view the existing cap in terms of the approved outlay of Rs.
    650.43 crores for the Project, it has been rendered necessary to restrict the
    number of States/UTs that can be covered during the 11th Plan period to
    about 15 States/UTs, with the possibility of covering the remaining States/
    UTs during the 12th Plan period subject to required approvals and
    availability of funds.
   During the current year (2011-12) the first installment of funds have been
    released to five States (Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and
    Tamil Nadu) by the Govt. of India as per the respective MoUs. In the case
    of Karnataka, the State High Level Steering Committee has already
    undertaken a review of the progress of implementation and the case
    relating to the release of the second installment of funds is being processed
    by the Government of India.

       ISSP, being the first project of its kind and given the complex structure of
statistical system in India, posed numerous challenges in formulation of the project,
getting through various processes, approvals etc. before it was finally approved by the
CCEA on 19th March, 2010. The main thrust initially was to conduct a series of
interaction with the states in order to create greater awareness, understanding and
appreciation about ISSP. It, not only helped in more mature review and planning in
preparation of respective State Strategic Statistical Plans (SSSPs) progressively, but also
stimulated momentum as evident from a substantial progress being achieved recently. It
is hoped that the process will get further impetus following greater interaction and
sharing of experience among the Central project support team members and the State
Government officials on a regular basis.
       It is almost clear that ISSP, by virtue of its potential to strengthen the statistical
system through provision of adequate financial and technical support, has managed to
create a lot of confidence and generate significant motivation among the state statistical
agencies and inspired them to gear up their efforts to accelerate the process of completion
of SSSPs, sign MoUs and start implementation as early as possible. Their enthusiasm has
been fuelled further and propelled with the additional support now available through 13th
Finance Commission Grant, meant inter-alia, to develop statistical infrastructure, focused
largely on the sub-state level. With this kind of comprehensive support (both technical
and financial) now available for the State statistical systems for the first time, the
prospects for witnessing significant and substantive development of state statistical
systems look quite promising. What is crucial now is not only to sustain the process and
the momentum built up already, but also, if possible, to accelerate and broad base it
further with a view to helping the State statistical systems to realize their full potential
and thereby contribute in a major way to the overall objective of strengthening the
National Statistical System in India, in all its dimensions.
       MoSPI has recently initiated some preparatory steps and thinking towards
undertaking the required comprehensive review and revision of the National Strategic
Statistical Plan (NSSP). While undertaking this exercise, it is proposed to extensively
utilize the experiences so far (limited it may be though) of both the Central and the

                                             45
participating State/ UT Governments. It is also proposed to go through a process of
extensive stakeholder consultations with a view, inter-alia, to determining what has
worked and worked well as also what really hasn‘t. The exercise will also take a look at
missing links and shortcomings, if any, in the existing NSSP, and identify new areas that
may need to be featured in the revised version of NSSP, so as to ensure its relevance,
comprehensiveness and efficacy are adequately addressed, in the current context.
       It will also be necessary to address some important issues like improving clarity
in the task of preparation of SSSPs, streamlining certain procedures or modules to
minimize delays in approvals or release of funds, increasing visibility of statistics both in
public and administrative departments including ensuring better status and recognition of
role and importance statistical personnel in the system of governance etc., in order to
stimulate the process further.

       To sum up, ISSP is considered to be a crucial project/scheme not only for
strengthening the state statistical systems, which assumes greater significance in the wake
of increasing thrust on devolution of planning responsibilities and financial powers to the
State and sub-state level, but it is also extremely relevant from the point of view of
developing a sustainably robust and integrated statistical system in the country to
compare well with its counterparts elsewhere in the World and implant, with necessary
adaptations, the relevant success stories and best practices of the International Statistical
System.



   8. Way ahead:

       ISSP has been envisaged to be implemented in stages to meet the objectives and
targets to be achieved in order to progress from one stage to the next, with the
implementation of already approved SSSPs extending through the 12th Plan period. With
the pre-implementation activities acquiring adequate pace, the implementation process is
expected to gain greater momentum.

       It, therefore, seems absolutely necessary at this stage to not only continue but
sustain this project/scheme to achieve all its designated objectives in full measure. This
will be critical not only for protecting commitments made already by way of approval of

                                             46
MoUs and investment made through disbursement of ISSP funds, but will be crucial to
secure active involvement and commitment of the remaining States which are working
hard in anticipation of getting similar support to pursue implementation of ISSP as early
as possible.

       It is critical now to sustain not only the aspirations and expectations of the
States/UTs which have been brought on board on the Project after a great deal of effort
and persuasion, but also accelerate the progress further to drive forward the much needed
statistical development process for realizing the objectives of ISSP. Such a systematic
statistical development process on an extensive scale, taken up for the first time ever in
India, is expected to provide a major push in collection, compilation and dissemination of
more reliable statistics for planning and policy making, particularly at State and sub-State
levels, besides generation of quality data to meet various and expanding data
requirements at the national and international levels. ISSP is also an extremely relevant
and absolutely important scheme for periodically and objectively reviewing progress on
various development schemes (both central and State-Centric) being undertaken in
different social sectors, including different National Flagship schemes of the Government.

        Comments on Draft ICR Report (Report No.ICR 00002107)
       Dated December 08, 2011 on ISSP prepared by the World Bank
                 (received by ICR team 23 January 2012)

     IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT
                      (IBRD-77960)

1. In Para 8, line 5, 2008 to be corrected as 2007
2. Para 26: line 1: the word ―gradually‖ may be replaced by ―steadily and surely‖;
   Para 26: the last sentence: it appears to be an under statement to mention that
   ―the pace of reforms has been some what slower......‖; also, one needs to
   appreciate that, in a situation wherein, given the complex nature of the project, the
   fact that such a CSS concerning ―Statistics Sector‖ has been taken up for the first
   time ever in India, the large number of procedural requirements to be gone
   through and several prescribed approvals that needed to be obtained, eventually
   the required CCEA approval for the project came through only in the second
   fortnight of March, 2010 and it was some more time before the World Bank loan
   related procedures could be completed as per requirements, it was only but natural
   and inevitable, in some sense, that the results expected by the end of 2010 were
   not fully achieved. In the light of this, the relevant portions of Para 26 may
   require suitable amendments/adjustments as suggested ―...the pace of reforms was
   restricted due to a very complex nature of the project involving a large number of
   complicated procedures and processes to be finalized especially in the case of
   such a comprehensive Project like ISSP taken up for the first time in India..‖
3. Page 8: table titled ―RESULTS AT A GLANCE‖
   Under policy area 1, the last bullet - currently all required efforts are being made
   to achieve this transit by end March, 2012 at any cost and therefore, instead of
   saying ―delayed‖, it may be stated as ―though a little behind schedule is expected
   to be achieved‖
   Policy area 2, second bullet: second line: the word ―delayed‖ may be amended as
   ―delayed but recently has acquired considerable momentum‖; present delay may
   be covered up in the light of considerable momentum since acquired.
   Policy area 3, third bullet, second line ―partially met‖ seems to be a significant
   under statement since, by now, in more than 15 States/UTs, the HLSCs have
   already met and in some amongst them, even met more than once to take crucial
   decisions on the project at the State/UT level; ―significant progress.‖
4. Section 3.3 ―Justification of overall outcome rating‖ : the rating given hereunder
   as ―Moderately Satisfactory‖ appears as an under assessment, in the light of the
   progress witnessed by now and the expected future progress and prospects
   thereon; the rating may be upgraded as ―Satisfactory‖
5. Para 51 line 1: the string ―slower than expected‖ to be amended as ―slower than
   expected for certain well known reasons‖ ;it viz. the string ―slower than expected‖,
   seems to require, in a realistic sense, some up gradation since, although the
   progress till the end of fiscal 2010-11 was certainly slow, there has been a
   quantum jump and pick-up in the progress of work on the project during the
   current fiscal year 2011-12, with 11 States/UTs having already got their SSSPs

                                        48
   and MoUs based thereon approved by both the concerned SHLSCs and
   subsequently by the High Level Steering Committee on ISSP in the Government
   of India and in all likelihood, this number is presently and realistically expected to
   swell /grow to a number of around 15 States/UTs by end March, 2012.
6. Section 5.2 ―Borrower Performance‖; (a) Government Performance ; (b)
   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance ; (c) Justification of Rating for
   Overall Borrower Performance – At present, for each of the three items listed
   above, the Rating has been given as ― Moderately Satisfactory‖ : the Government
   of India does not find this assessment realistic and compatible with the significant
   levels of progress which have been accomplished in several States/UTs on a large
   number of associated Process Indicators and structural improvements effected. A
   lot of details in this regard were shared with the ICR Mission by Ministry of
   Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India during their visit
   to India earlier viz. during October, 2011. A number of positive and highly
   encouraging factual details concerning the substantial progress of the project so
   far on several fronts had also come up during the course of the discussions had by
   the ICR Mission, initially during their State visit to Karnataka and subsequently,
   during the course of their detailed discussions on a large number of project related
   issues with the Government of Delhi. While, it may be no body‘s case to argue
   that the Rating given for these items now in the Draft ICR as ―Highly Satisfactory
   or Fully Satisfactory‖, there certainly seems to be a valid and justified case to
   amend                                     this                                 present
   Rating to ―Satisfactory‖, in the case of (a) Government Performance; (b)
   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance; and (c) Justification of Rating
   for Overall Borrower Performance.
7. Annex 2. Development Outcome Indicators: Policy Area 1; item 1; the last
   column thereof: In the concluding portions the following amendment is required:
   Instead of the string ―.....with a revised target timeline for approving the NSSP in
   early 2012‖, the string ―.....with a revised target timeline for referring the revised
   NSSP for favour of perusal, comments, if any and approval to the National
   Statistical Commission in early 2012‖, may be inserted.
