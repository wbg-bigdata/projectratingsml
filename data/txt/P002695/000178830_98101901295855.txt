TANZANIA
APPRAISAL OF MWANZA TEXTILE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project of Mwanza Textiles Limited (MTL) in
Mwanza, Tanzania to expand the Company's production from about 23 to 43 mil-
lion meters of printed cotton fabrics per year to substitute for imports and
meet growing local demand. The project would benefit from existing manage-
ment, skilled labor, and infrastructure and would use locally-grown cotton
as principal raw material, most of which is presently exported; it would
also provide employment for about 1,200 persons. The Company is owned (40%)
by the National Textile Corporation (Texco) which is responsible for all
production, and marketing of textiles in Tanzania as well as the country's
textile imports and exports; a local agricultural cooperative (40%); and the
French Sodefra group (20%) which assisted in the implementation of the Com-
pany's original plant in the mid-1960's and its subsequent operations.
ii.       Texco was created in early 1974 as a special parastatal organiza-
tion. It is organized as a holding company and basically functions as a
liaison body between the Government and individual textile companies. Texco
owns 100% of the shares in three of its eight associated and subsidiary com-
panies, of which three still have some foreign minority shareholdings. Ex-
cept for some small garment industries, all textile activities in Tanzania
are within the Texco group and controlled by it.
iii.      Total financing required for the project would amount to US$44.3
million (Shillings 314 million), of which US$30.0 million is expected to be
required in foreign exchange to be met in equal parts by two loans of US$15
million each from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (Kuwait
Fund) and the Bank. Both loans would finance separate lists of goods and
services in accordance with the procurement guidelines of the two lending
institutions. The Bank loan would be made to the Government for 22 years,
at an interest rate of 8.5% per annum and would be onlent to the Company
for 13 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace, at 10% per year. The Kuwait
Fund loan would also be made to the Government for 22 years and at an in-
terest rate 'of 4% per annum and be onlent on terms and conditions similar
to the Bank loan. Local costs would be financed by the Company's internal
cash generation and by the Government in the form of equity to Texco which
in turn would subscribe to new share capital in the Company, thereby in-
creasing Texco's shareholding in MTL to 90%. The Government would also
cover any cost overrun.
iv.       In addition to the proposed project and other small ongoing ex-
pansions, the Government is considering another major textile project, to
substitute for present imports of cotton/man-made fiber blend fabrics.
Tanzania's cotton is ideally suited for the production of blend fabrics
and the possibility of'exporting to other countries merits also consi-
deration.   To investigate the feasibility of this project including
a review of the export marketing possibilities of Tanzanian made
textiles, the Government intends to undertake a study of which the
estimated foreign exchange cost has been included in the proposed Bank
loan.



- ii -
v.        The existing mill of MTL started operations in 1968.  Its perfor-
mance has steadily been improving and it is now operating close to capacity;
its present employment is about 2,400. Operations of the existing mill have
been supported by expatriate management assistance from Textilconsult S.p.A.
(Italy). Textilconsult's contract is now, however, being phased out so that
since December 1974, Saigol Brothers Ltd (Pakistan), who also prepared the
feasibility study for the project, has been providing some technical manage-
ment staff. Saigol is to act as the Engineering Company for the project with
full responsibility for project management, engineering, procurement, con-
struction, erection, start-up, initial operations, personnel training and
other such services as necessary to successfully implement and operate the
project.
vi.       Saigol Brothers is one of the largest manufacturers and exporters
of textiles in Pakistan, but has had no actual experience in building or
managing textile plants outside of Pakistan. The Bank's review assisted
by an independent textile consultant has indicated, however, that Saigol
is fully qualified for the assignment, provided some limited assistance in
such areas as preparation of detailed equipment specifications and produc-
tion planning systems will be added. This will be done through a Technical
Advisor, the Gherzi Textil Organisation of Switzerland, which will also
assist the Company in the supervision and control of all project activities,
from implementation through initial operations. While these arrangements
are satisfactory, the successful execution of the project will still largely
depend on the effective cooperation between the Company and Texco on the one
hand and Saigol and Gherzi on the other.
vii.      MTL was initially financed with a high loan portion and despite
satisfactory profits since 1972, the Company's debt service coverage and
liquidity have remained low; furthermore, heavy loan repayments are still
due through 1977. However, the project will be soundly financed so that
the Company will have a satisfactory capital structure upon project com-
pletion and should be able to service its debt comfortably. Furthermore,
to maintain the Company's sound financial position, the Government will
ensure that MTL --on the basis of efficient operations--obtains sufficient
revenues to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.
viii.     The project would yield an attractive incremental financial return
of about 19% after taxes, and an economic return of 16% using international
prices for tradable inputs and outputs. The project would provide substan-
tial additional employment and training. While technical and commercial
risks are minor because of the standard plant design and a product that
would largely replace present imports, a potential management and general
administrative risk exists and can only be avoided if, as mentioned previ-
ously, the local and expatriate expertise provided for in the project can
be effectively meshed.
ix.       Based on the agreements reached with the Government, Texco and MTL
as summarized at the end of this report, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$15 million.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tanzania has requested Bank financing of US$15.0
million to cover part of the foreign exchange expenditures for a project that
is to cost about Shillings 314 million (US$44 million) and expand the annual
production of Mwanza Textiles Ltd. (MTL) at Mwanza (Map IBRD 11282) by 20
million meters (m.) of fabrics to 43 million m. per year 1/ based on locally
produced cotton. The remaining portion of the foreign exchange required
(US$15 million) would be provided by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic De-
velopment. Local financing would be made available in the form of equity by
the National Textile Corporation (Texco) which is the parastatal organization
responsible for the textile sector and which is fully owned by the Government.
The Bank loan and Kuwait Fund financing would be extended to the Government
and onlent to MTL. The project is scheduled to start production in 1978 in
substitution for textile imports and create additional direct employment for
about 1,200 people.
1.02      MTL is one of the best operated textile mills in Tanzania with
satisfactory operating performance and relatively high product quality.
As part of Tanzania's program to expand textile production in the country,
to reduce imports and to increase the local processing share of its cotton,
the MTL project is of high priority. The project would increase Tanzania's
textile production capacity to about 120 million m. per year and would
mainly produce printed woven cotton fabrics in high demand in Tanzania.
The project's output is expected to satisfy domestic market needs for woven
cotton fabrics until the early 1980's, when additional local production ca-
pacity will be needed.
1.03      The project was identified in April/May 1974 out of three textile
projects for which feasibility studies had been submitted to the Bank and
pre-appraised in August/September 1974. An appraisal mission, consisting of
Messrs M. Ferber (Chief) and A. Sandig of the Industrial Projects Department
and Mr. B. Ahmad of the East Africa Region was carried out in November 1974.
Subsequently, discussions with the Government and Texco took place in January
1975.

II. TEXTILE INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANY (MTL)
A.   Structure of the Textile Industry
2.01      In accordance with general Government policy, all textile companies
have over the past few years been gradually transferred into partial or full
state ownership. Most of them were first incorporated into the National De-
velopment Corporation (NDC) as either subsidiary or associate companies and
subsequently, in January 1974, all textile activities were entrusted to Texco.
NDC is a wholly-owned Government corporation and is Tanzania's principal in-
strument for economic expansion and productive investments. Texco was created
as a special parastatal organization in view of the importance given by the
Government to the textile industry. Part of the shares of two major textile
companies, previously majority-owned by private foreign groups, were purchased
by NDC and Texco against cash and long-term loans following agreements reach-
ed with these groups in 1972 and 1974. Texco which now controls management
and operations of these companies does not intend to increase its sharehold-
ings in them further.
B.   Organization, Operations and Financial Analysis of Texco
1.   Organization
2.02      Texco, which started its activities in January 1974, is responsi-
ble for all production and marketing in Tanzania and the country's textile
imports and exports. Its authorized share capital is Shillings 500 million
(US$70 million) of which Shillings 70 million is paid in, fully owned by
the Government. Texco's Board of Directors is chaired by the Minister of
Commerce and Industry and consists of nine members including the Managing
Director of Texco (Annex 2-1).
2.03      Texco is organized as a holding company with a staff of 30 and an
operating budget of about Shillings 4 million in 1974. At present, it func-
tions as a liaison body between the Government and the mill managements and
is mainly focusing on operations and pricing policy, expansion programs, as
well as the coordination of local and foreign financing. Texco holds shares
in eight companies, ranging from a 33% to 100% ownership. The holdings are
shown in detail in Annex 2-2 and are summarized below:

/1   Unless otherwise stated.
2.04      As the above table indicates, Texco's holdings comprise four textile
manufacturing companies (with'five plants), two agricultural bag making com-
panies and one blanket manufacturer as well as the National Textile Indus-
tries Corporation Ltd. (Natex) which is responsible for marketing textiles
in Tanzania as well as their import and exports. Except for small garment
industries, all the country's textile activities are therefore handled by
the Texco group.
2.   Operations
2.05      The operational performance of the textile mills has improved
steadily over recent years and further production increases from existing
capacity are expected (para. 3.04). Several mills have recently experienced
some water (Dar-es-Salaam) and power (Mwanza) problems, but corrective steps
have been taken to overcome these (para. 4.06). Except for the Friendship
mill, all plants employ expatriates; in some instances they have full manage-
ment responsibility and in others they are limited to filling some management
and supervisory positions in operations and accounting. The manpower situa-
tion on the workers level is reasonably satisfactory, although all mills are
heavily overstaffed. While gradual replacement of expatriates is envisaged,
the scarcity of available local personnel can only be alleviated over time
(para. 4.12). As mentioned previously, cotton, the major raw material of
Tanzania's textile mills, is produced locally. Of an annual production of
about 400,000 bales, about 15% is consumed locally by the textile mills and
the rest is exported and constitutes Tanzania's most valuable single crop



- 4 -
and largest export earner. The Tanzanian Cotton Authority, in coordination
with farmers' cooperatives, is responsible for production, ginning and mar-
keting of cotton. In January 1974, IDA approved a credit of US$17.5 million
to help finance a cotton development project of the Tanzania Cotton Authority
in the Geita District of the Mwanza Region.
2.06      All textile mills base their production on requests from Natex and
deliver their products to Natex against cash payments. In view of the peren-
nial textile shortage in Tanzania, this marketing system appears to have been
working satisfactorily, although some reorientation will be needed as textile
demand and supply in the country become more balanced (para. 3.11).
3.   Financial Analysis
2.07      Although Texco directs and influences all major decisions of its
eight holdings, it does not prepare consolidated financial statements (two of
the companies are only minority owned). Summarized financial statements on
past operations and projected debt service payments of each of the holdings
are shown in Annex 2-3. Their combined sales in 1973 amounted to Shillings
358 million (US$50 million), not counting Shillings 218 million (US$31 mil-
lion) of sales resulting from imported textiles and garments. During the
same year total net income before taxes was Shillings 55.5 million (compared
to 25.4 million in 1972) and net income after taxes was Shillings 28.1 mil-
lion (17.4 million in 1972), corresponding to a 17% and 14% return on equity
in 1973 and 1972 respectively. Earnings in 1974 have reportedly been main-
tained at the 1973 level and are expected to rise in the future as produc-
tivity increases and benefits from ongoing modernizations are realized (para.
3.05). Considering Texco as a whole, the financial performance can be con-
sidered as satisfactory except for the East-African Kenaf Industries, Ltd.
which has lost half of its equity (Shillings 23 million) in less than two
years of operations because of problems in kenaf plantations. However, the
responsibility for kenaf plantations is to be transferred to the Ministry
of Agriculture.
2.08      Texco's long-term liabilities are about Shillings 30 million,
most of them owed to the Government in the form of loans. They were in-
curred to allow Texco the purchase of shares in Kiltex (1972) and Tangan-
yika Dyeing and Weaving Mills, Ltd. (1974). Since ongoing small expansions
in the Texco group would be financed by the respective Texco project entity
itself through internal cash generation and Texco's equity contribution to
the proposed project would be obtained from the Government, operational
expenditures, principally for staff and debt service payments, thus consti-
tute the only projected financing needs of Texco. It is realistic to assume
that these modest requirements can be financed by dividend contributions
from Texco's subsidiary and associate companies. Finally, Texco has con-
tingent liabilities for guaranteeing its companies' short term bank borrow-
ings from the National Bank of Commerce. These guarantees amount to about
Shillings 330 million of which Shillings 287 million are for Natex and are
expected to terminate by June 30, 1975. Natex experienced cash constraints



in early 1974 after it imported a substantial amount of Chinese garments
which have been slow moving; therefore, Texco had to provide guarantees for
temporary increased bank borrowings until the stocks of Natex will have been
reduced.
C.   MTL and its Operations
2.09      MTL was established as a limited company in 1966.  Its share
capital of Shillings 20 million (US$2.8 million) is owned by Texco (40%),
the Nyanza Co-operative Union, Ltd. (40%) and the Amenital Holding Regis-
tered Trust (20%). The Nyanza Co-operative Union, Ltd. is the local agri-
cultural cooperative union and the Amenital Holding Registered Trust belongs
to the French group Sodefra which through Textilconsult S.p.A (Italy) also
has assisted in the implementation and operation of MTL (para. 2.10). The
Board members of MTL, listed in Annex 2-4, are all delegates of the share-
holders. The organization chart of the Company is shown in Annex 2-5.
2.10      The MTL mill is located about 8 km from Mwanza (Lake Victoria), the
second most important city of Tanzania and has a capacity of about 25 million
m. per year of cotton fabrics. It was constructed with the help of Textil-
consult and started operations in 1968. The output of the mill has increased
steadily from 12.3 million m. in 1970 to 22.6 million m. in 1974 and is ex-
pected to at least maintain this level in future years. Early in 1974, a
fourth shift was introduced and total employment at MTL is now about 2,400
of which 26 are expatriates.  While MTL's General Manager, Mr. I.H. Mtingwa,
is a Tanzanian national, most of the other key operational and accounting
positions are filled by expatriates, Under a management agreement with Tex-
tilconsult which will expire in 1976, Textilconsult has provided technical
assistance, management and procurement services for dyes, chemicals and spare
parts against an annual management fee based on a fixum plus profits. In
accordance with the contract and in view of the envisaged phase out of Textil-
consult, Texco, in December 1974, asked Saigol Brothers Ltd. (Pakistan) to
provide technical, management and training assistance for MTL and at present
five management positions at MTL have been filled with experienced Saigol
people (para. 4.09).
2.11      As for the other textile mills in Tanzania, the marketing of MTL's
output is now being handled by Natex, which is MTL's only customer. At pres-
ent, MTL is mostly producing khanga and kitenge dress prints (55%), sheeting
(15%), with twills, linen and poplin accounting for the rest. MTL's products
are valued for their quality in Tanzania and in Kenya which has been importing
limited amounts of MTL's khanga prints.

purchased gray fabrics.
2/ Mostly currency exchange rate fluctuations.
3/ Including repayments due in 1971/1972 that were rescheduled to 1973-1978.
2.13      As mentioned previously MTL's operating performance has steadily
improved. Capacity utilization in 1974 including finishing of 1.5 million m.
of purchased gray fabrics was about 90% and some marginal increase in output
is expected in 1975. The production of 22.7 million m. forecast from 1975
onwards is about 7% above the 1974 level in terms of spinning and weaving
output. MTL's profit situation was unsatisfactory until 1972 mainly due to
poor operating performance and heavy financial charges. With an initial high



- 7 -
debt financing and a short repayment period, MTL's debt service in some years
has amounted to more than half of its equity. As a result, repayments due
in 1971/72 on its foreign loans from French banks had to be rescheduled to
1973-1978.
2.14      The profit situation of MTL in 1974 was satisfactory and further
improvements are expected in future years because of the anticipated minor
rise in output (para. 2.13) and the favorable effect of the 1974 price
changes. Although heavy loan repayments are due through 1976, MTL's debt
service situation is therefore forecasted to become less critical from 1975
onwards. Conversely, the debt/equity ratio is projected to improve rapidly
from 79/21 at the end of 1973 to zero in 1977 with the current ratio strength-
ening moderately from 0.9 in 1973 to 1.1 in 1977. Although, based on the ex-
pected earnings, MTL appears to be in a position to attain a sound financial
structure through internal resources within the forthcoming three years,
MTL's present financial situation does not provide a satisfactory basis for
incurring additional debt. Therefore, the Government and Texco have agreed
to provide, as part of the Bank's involvement in the project, adequate new
equity funds (para. 5.06).

- 8 -
In the past eight years the consumption of woven fabrics has been increasing
at an annual rate of 4.1%, or 1.4% per capita annually. However, the pat-
tern of this growth has been erratic reflecting year to year variations in
the level of import licenses granted due to foreign exchange constraints.
Major local textile production commenced only in the mid-1960's and between
1966 and 1974 the share of domestic fabrics in total consumption increased
from 10% to 67%. Nevertheless in 1974, Tanzania imported Shillings 312 (US$43)
million worth of textiles, in the form of 12.5 million m. of cotton fabrics
and 28.2 million m. of blended fabrics.
3.02      Textile consumption in Tanzania, even by the standards prevailing
in other less developed countries in Africa, has remained low. In 1973, per
capita consumption of woven fabrics was 7.6 meters (1.3) kg and including
imported textile articles (apparel anid home furnishing) about 1.7 kg per
capita as compared with 1.9 kg average for all,of Africa (excluding South
Africa), 12.7 kg for Western Europe and 20.5 kg for North America (Annex 3-2).
The popular African printed fabrics (khanga and kitenge) have frequently been
restricted to a few sales outlets in the cities and at times they have not
been available even at prices higher than those fixed by the Government.
Potential demand in 1974 is estimated to be up to about 19 million m. higher
than the apparent 1974 consumption of 114 million m. of textile fabrics in
the above table.
3.03      Tanzania has essentially a tropical climate and cotton textile
products meet most, though not all, of the consumer requirements. Wool
suiting fabrics still have to be imported and so have easy care polyester-
cotton suiting and shirting materials. Due to foreign exchange constraints
the Government in the past has restricted imports of blended man-made fab-
rics. These restrictions are expected to be tightened and thus to result
in a relative increase in the consumption of locally made cotton goods.

B.   Woven Textile Fabrics Forecast for Tanzania

/1   Including Mwanza expansion at 50, 75 and 90% capacity in 1978, 1979, and
1980 respectively.
/2   1974 are actual figures.  Thereafter an upward adjustment for total latent
demand of 10 million was made on which basis an annual growth rate of 4.3%
has been applied. The projected consumption figures are averages of mini-
mum and maximum expected consumption figures shown in Annexes 3-3 to 3-5.
/3   Part of the deficit of other fabrics consists of fabrics which are not
likely to be made in Tanzania for economic and technical reasons (Annexes
3-3 to 3-5).
3.05      The production forecast for textile woven fabrics is based on the
capacity of the existing mills at reasonably attainable capacity utilization
plus minor expansions already in progress, and the proposed project. In
1973, operating 825 shifts per annum, the industry produced 71.7 million m.
(74 million m. including imported gray fabric) at a capacity utilization
estimated at 82%. As from January 1974 all mills have been put on 1050
shifts per annum and by 1975, the production of the existing facilities
should increase to 84 million m. New looms to be installed in the Kiltex,
Friendship and Sunguratex plants account for another 18 million m. bringing
total production up to 102 million m. by 1977, i.e. before the MTL project
starts operations. With the MTL expansion assumed to operate at 50, 75 and
90% of capacity utilization in 1978, 1979, 1980 and thereafter respectively,
the local production of woven fabrics is expected to reach 122 million m.
per year by 1980.



- 10 -
3.06      Given the erratic textile consumption pattern in the past and the
latent demand, historical consumption does not provide sufficient guidance for
estimating future fabric consumption. Therefore, minimum and maximum demand
projections were prepared. These are shown in detail in Annexes 3-3, 3-4 and
3-5 and the above table only gives demand averages. As the starting point for
projecting minimum demand, the actual 1974 textile consumption was used while
for projecting the maximum demand, the 19 million m. of unsatisfied demand
(para. 3.02) was added to the actual 1974 consumption. Using this minimum
and maximum consumption base, demand projections for the period 1975-1982
assume a 4.3% annual growth rate of which 2.8% is expected to derive from
population growth and the remaining 1.5% from increases in the per capita
consumption. The income elasticity of demand for textiles implied in these
projections is 1.0 which is higher than the 0.7 average for all developing
countries combined 1/ but lower, and considered by the Bank more realistic,
than the 1.5 used by the local planners. 2/
3.07      There are no specific Government projections of textile demand in
Tanzania. In 1973, there was a reported Government policy to limit consumption
to 8 meters per capita and to export any remaining surplus. Were such policy
applied the consumption of woven textiles in Tanzania in 1982 would be 144
million m. and thus considerably below the 171 million m. projected by the
Bank in para. 3.04 above. However, some unofficial forecasts prepared by
consultants within the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development Plan-
ning (Devplan) 2/ estimated the 1982 demand as high as 190 million m.,
thereby assuming that the average income per capita between 1974 and 1982
will grow at 2.8% per year.and per capita textile consumption by 4.2% per
year over the same period. Finally, Natex more recently 31 projected 1982
domestic demand for cotton woven fabrics alone as high as 183 million m.
3.08      The average consumption figures forecasted by the Bank therefore
are between the various projections and take into account (1) a latent
demand of about 10 million m. at present and (2) a growth rate in future
consumption that is based on the assumption of reasonable economic growth
in Tanzania and the objective of the Government to improve the availability
of textiles. Actual future consumption will largely depend on the overall
economic development and the priority given to domestic consumption growth
which is greatly influenced by the Government which controls wages, prices
as well as exports and imports of the textile and other consumer industries.

- 11 -
3.09      A comparison of likely supply and demand projections indicates that
Tanzania will practically achieve self-sufficiency in cotton textiles by 1978.
Whether there will actually be a small deficit or a small exportable surplus
in cotton fabrics will entirely depend on (1) the Government policy on texti-
les and consumption in general, (2) the country's overall economic develop-
ment and (3) the consumer's willingness to follow the Government policy of
substituting blended fabrics through cotton fabrics. After 1980 there
appears to be justification for additional cotton fabric production capac-
ity.
3.10      Considering the blended fabric situation it appears that in the
longer run the import level of 28 million meters in 1974 may still further
increase despite the Government's policy of substituting it with cotton
fabrics. Even after substracting about 15 million m. fabrics which for
economic and technical reasons cannot yet be manufactured in Tanzania,
there is expected to remain an annual import requirement of 10-15 million
m. of polyester-cotton blended suiting and shirting fabrics; it is expected
that this type of material could be economically made in Tanzania by blend-
ing local medium-long staple cotton with imported polyester staple. Therefore,
the Government is considering as the next major textile project in Tanzania
a blended fabric production facility. Such a project would not only reduce
foreign exchange requirements for imports but might even create export pos-
sibilities to other countries, since Tanzania's cotton is ideally suited
for this type of fabric.
3.11      In order to further investigate the feasibility and eventually
to advance the preparation of such a project, Texco will undertake a feasi-
bility study for a blended fabric project in Tanzania. The study will be
carried out by experienced textile consultants and will in particular
investigate the requirements for successful project implementation, oper-
ation and marketing. The estimated foreign exchange costs for the study
(US$200,000) have been included in the proposed project and in the sug-
gested Bank loan. As part of the study, the marketing investigation as
basis for any future textile project in Tanzania will also cover export
marketing possibilities for blended as well as cotton fabrics made in
Tanzania to other countries. The Government has agreed to carry out
such a study, and as part of the continuing dialogue on the development
of the textile sector, exchange views with the Bank on the conclusions
of the study and apply these conclusions to any major expansion of the
textile industry. The consultants are to be appointed by no later than
December 1, 1975 and their appointment and terms of references to be
acceptable to the Bank.

C.   Marketing of Textiles in Tanzania
1.   Distribution
3.12      As mentioned previously, all yarns, fabrics, garments and other
textile articles whether domestically produced or imported are currently
being marketed and distributed by Natex the fully owned subsidiary of
Texco. Between 1971 and 1973, Natex's sales increased from Shillings 176
to 573 million; mostly reflecting the growth in the number of manufacturing
units it represented but also increases in the prices of domestic and im-
ported goods. In 1973 sales of domestic goods (Shillings 360 million)
accounted for 64% of Natex's turnover. Details of Natex's trading activi-
ties are shown in Annex 3-6.
3.13      Natex operates 34 distribution centers 4 of which are located in
Dar-es-Salaam and 30 in the other 19 regions of the country. Natex operates
its own trucks to deliver the goods from the factories, ports, or warehouses
to the distribution centers. Internal freight costs are pooled, so that
prices to the retailers are the same throughout the country. There were
20,000 accounts in 1973 but 1,350 accounts (or 7%) in the Dar-es-Salaam area
absorbed 54% of the sales. Terms of sale to retailers are either cash or
banker's draft. Because of the shortage of textiles a sale to an individual
retailer can be made only once a week and there is a strict allocation of
the total volume as well as of the proportion between domestic and imported
goods. The marketing and distribution of textiles in Tanzania, while not
overly efficient, is inexpensive. The opportunity for individual profits is
drastically reduced, and the cost of advertising, merchandising and market
research practically non-existent. Most of the retail sales are transacted
in open air bazaars. The price to the consumer is therefore usually no more
than 100-130% higher than the price of the goods landed or ex-factory, as
compared with a 200-300% mark-up in more developed countries.
2.   Prices
3.14      Ex-factory prices of domestic fabrics are determined by the Price
Commission of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and are generally based
on the ex-factory costs of the plant with the highest operating costs, in-
cluding depreciation and interest charges plus a profit which on average is
intended to amount to about 10% of the sales price. In practice, the actual
profit may vary from year to year and from item to item. Prices are deter-
mined periodically (usually once a year) and as costs change continuously,
the mills have occasionally operated at a loss, at least on specific items.
Although the system provides some incentives for the individual plant to
lower costs and improve productivity, adequate incentives are limited
because prices are not based on standard costs but on actual costs and in
some instances the same fabric is only made by one or two mills. The cur-
rent textile prices were established in April 1974 on the basis of 1973
costs; however, in view of rapidly increasing costs, MTL for example cannot
cover production costs on about 40% of its items and needs to subsidize them



- 13 -
with the profits on the sales of khanga. More frequent product by product
price reviews would be desirable to provide for a reasonable and up to date
price structure (para. 6.06).
3.15      The price of cotton, the major raw material, is determined by the
Tanzania Cotton Authority (TCA). Until recently cotton prices for domestic
mills were the same as for exports. In 1973 and early 1974, when interna-
tional cotton prices were unusually high and local fabric prices could not
be increased accordingly most of the textile plants in Tanzania were tem-
porarily losing money. Therefore, in April 1974 the internal cotton price
was fixed at about Shillings 3.30 (US$0.45) per pound below the export price
rith this difference absorbed by TCA. Although the internal prices at that
time represented only about 50% of the export prices it approximately cor-
responds to the present world-market prices.
3.16      The ex-factory fabric prices are subject !o a Shillings 0.3/m2
Excise Duty and 25% Sales Tax (20% for khanga). lhe structure of Natexvs
selling prices is such as to allow Natex to make a i,% gross profit on all
domestic and imported goods.  The wholesale prices charged to wnolesalers,
manufacturers and parastatal organizations include a 5 to 6% gross profit
and so-called sub-wholesale prices charged to retailers one of 10 to 11%
gross profit. The Price Commission determines also the maximum retail
prices so as to limit the gross profit of the retailer to 10% of the
price paid to Natex. The maximum retail price for each type of fabric
at the retail level is the same irrespective of which mill produces it
best or the geographical location of the point of sale. Retail prices
for typical fabrics as well as a comparison of ex-factory selling prices
of similar woven fabrics in Tanzania and USA are shown in detail in
Annexes 3-7, 3-8 and 3-9; in general, ex-mill prices of fabrics in
Tanzania, converted at the official exchange rate, are higher than in
the USA, on average about 30%. However, if a shadow foreign exchange rate
is used, this margin would be reduced accordingly.
3.   Tariffs
3.17      Imported goods are subject to custom duties ranging from 30 to 45%
of the CIF price, and a sales tax of up to 50% on the duty paid costs. In
1973 the duty on the Shillings 162 million CIF value of textile articles
imported by Natex amounted to Shillings 73 million or 45%. The sales tax
paid (Shillings 78 million) averages 33% of the duty paid costs. Since
as mentioned previously Natex resells the goods at 10% gross profit to the
retailers who in turn are entitled to a maximum 10% gross profit, an average
item landed at CIF cost of Shillings 10.00 would be sold to a consumer at
Shillings 23.33. Most of the textile fabrics and articles are at present
imported from the People's Republic of China which in 1973 supplied 52% of
total imports and from Japan. A breakdown of imports is shown in Annex 3-10.
As all importation is carried out on the basis of strict licensing by the
Government, the high import duties are primarily designed to discourage the
use of foreign goods and thus conserve scarce foreign exchange rather than
to protect the local textile and apparel industry from outside competition.

4.   Export Situation
3.18      In the last five years Tanzanian exports of cotton fabrics have been
limited by lack of local production. Exports varied between 2 and 4 million
m. per year and went mainly to neighboring Uganda and Kenya. Exports of yarn
have been negligible. However, Tanzania is considering further textile proj-
ects to satisfy domestic market needs as well as export markets and the fea-
sibility study mentioned in para. 3.11 will include an in-depth review of the
marketing possibilities, principally to other East African countries which are
logical export countries for Tanzania. General observations on export pros-
pects of the textile industry of Tanzania are discussed in Annex 3-11.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Location and Scope
4.01      The project consists of the expansion of an integrated textile
plant from about 23 to 43 million meters per year of finished fabrics, i.e.
an additional annual production of 20 million meters. It would be built
adjacent to the existing MTL plant with the land needed for the expansion
already owned by the Company. The plant is located eight km from Mwanza,
a town with a population of 50,000, situated on Lake Victoria and some
1,100 km (by air) northwest of Dar-es-Salaam. Mwanza is the second most
important city in Tanzania and thus offers availability of skilled and
semi-skilled labor; it is connected by rail and road to all parts of the
country and to Uganda and Kenya through Lake Victoria. The climate in
Mwanza at an altitude of some 1,100 m. is mild and the mill does not re-
quire air conditioning which in contrast is essential in the coastal areas
because of the deleterious effect of the high humidity and temperature on
the human element as well as on the efficiency of spinning and weaving oper-
ations.
4.02      An alternative location in Musoma (about 200 km north of Mwanza
on Lake Victoria) was considered but found less attractive because of the
high additional costs for infrastructure, and the lack of skilled labor,
civil amenities, housing as well as adequate road and rail connections. The
expansion of the existing mills in Dar-es-Salaam was also eliminated as an
alternative because of the Government's policy to decentralize the industry
and on account of the acute shortage of water in the area.
4.03      The project would add to the existing facilities 27,648 spindles
and 578 looms as well as related bleaching, mercerising, dyeing and printing
equipment. Assuming 1,050 eight hour shifts per annum and 83% overall plant
efficiency, annual spinning capacity will be raised from 3,360 to 6,540 tons,
screen printing capacity from 7.4 to 18.5 million meters, and roller printing
capacity from 11.6 to 25.0 million meters per year. The overall design of
the project which was carried out by Saigol Brothers Ltd. takes into account
that the existing mill is not entirely balanced with certain departments
having excess capacity; this will result in some savings for the project.
The expanded mill will provide employment for 3,600 workers and therefore
create about 1,200 new jobs.



- 15 -
B.   Machinery and Buildings
4.04      The mill will be equipped with new but conventional machinery.
The type and amount of equipment has been specified in Saigol's feasibility
study on the basis of detailed production calculations assuming efficiencies
and utilization factors which are considered attainable and which have been
checked by the Bank and where felt necessary, revised. All spinning, weaving,
converting as well as 90% of the service machinery will have to be imported.
A detailed list of the machinery required for the different plant sections
is shown in Annex 4-1.
4.05      About 23,000 m2 of covered floor space will be constructed includ-
ing 19,700 m2 of service buildings for warehousing, a boiler plant and power
house.  The area of the floor space is in line with norms accepted in the
textile industry, i.e. 0.33 m2 per spindle and 20 m2 per loom.  The main
factory buildings are to be of structural steel with asbestos cement corru-
gated sheet roofing, cement brick walls, reinforced cement brick floors and
false fiberglass ceilings. There will be humidity control in the spinning
and weaving areas but no air conditioning.  The spinning section will have
an overhead air exhaust system and the carding room, an additional floor
waste filter exhaust to improve working conditions and increase yarn qual-
ity.  The proposed machinery layout as related to the planned floor space
has been checked and found satisfactory.
C.   Raw Materials and Utilities
4.05      The basic raw material required by MTL is cotton of which at full
production, the mill will utflize annually 7,050 tons or 38,000 bales. AR
cotton type from the Mwanza growing area will be used. There is an ample
supply of cotton in Tanzania. In 1973, the local textile industry processed
only about 15% of the crop and, in 1980 is expected to use about 22% (or
110,000 bales) of a crop estimated at 500,000 bales. The AR cotton grade
is clean, white and of a superior quality suitable for spinning medium and
medium-fine counts up to 50 cc.
4.06      The project's additional water requirements of 2.0 million liters
per day will be made available from the municipal water supply system. MTL
presently receives all its power from TANESCO which is the government entity
responsible for all power supply and distribution in Tanzania. At present,
four transformers of 1.25 MVA each are installed at the factory and for the
project 2 transformers will be added at the factory, one of 1.25 MVA for the
spinning and one of 1.5 MVA for the weaving department.  Recently MTL has
frequently been experiencing power failures because of break-downs of
TANESCO's generators. To improve power supply and satisfy increasing demand,
TANESCO has obtained Government approval for an expansion program for addi-
tional power generation in the Mwanza area. The first phase is already
under construction and is expected to be ready by 1976 and adequate to meet
MTL's increased needs together with those of other consumers in the area.
In addition the Government has agreed to cause TANESCO to supply sufficient
power to ensure the efficient operation of MTL's integrated textile plant.
At present the Company operates two boilers each with a capacity of 6,000 kg
of steam/hour. For the expanded plant two more similar boilers will be
required to allow a 25% safety margin for repair and maintenance.



- 16 -
D.  Ecological Considerations and Occupational Health
4.07      The air quality in Mwanza is relatively good because there are few
industrial units in the town and the MTL mill's distance from its center. The
only fuel burnt at MTL is and will continue to be diesel oil for steam genera-
tion. The discharge is therefore limited to the boiler flue and it is planned
that the new boilers will have an automatic regulating device to ensure maxi-
mum combustion. The spinning and weaving sheds will be equipped with air
filters to control fibers and dust from being exhausted into the atmosphere
and the appropriate humidity in them will be maintained by a central air
treatment system comprising air filters, washers and dampers. The cards will
be equipped with floor waste exhaust filters. In the converting department
the dyeing, printing and finishing equipment generating heat and/or steam will
have special hoods with forced exhaust systems to lower the temperature in the
working area. The effluent from the converting operations will be discharged
to the two existing open air settling ponds located 3 km from the mill.  The
drainage system, which is a combination of sinking, settling and evaporation
and extends about 40 km from the ponds to Lake Victoria is considered fully
satisfactory and will be modified to handle the additional effluent to ensure
an acceptable level of biological oxygen demand. There are no agricultural
land or human settlements in the immediate vicinity of the ponds or along the
length of the drainage system which is passing through what is essentially
waste land.
E.   Implementation, Staffing and Training
4.08      Efficient implementation of the project is closely related to the
availability of expatriates. Three out of four companies manufacturing woven
fabrics in Tanzania have had management assistance from European companies,--
Sunguratex from Tootal (UK), Kiltex from Texunion (France) and MTL from
Textilconsult (Italy). Within the provision of the contracts, Texco hired
Saigol in December 1974 to replace expatriate management positions in Kiltex
and MTL (para. 2.10). Saigol replaced five key technical people at MTL
through experienced personnel from its own mills. The remaining 21 expatriates
at MTL have been contracted by MTL directly; although they have been hired in
part with the assistance of Textilconsult, their staying is not linked with
the management contract with Textilconsult which will expire in 1976. Although
it is the Government's policy to reduce the number of expatriates, Texco has
at present no technical and management personnel to fill their positions
should they become vacant.
4.09      The Saigol group who undertook the feasibility study for the project,
is one of the largest textile producers and exporters in Pakistan. Addi-
tionally, Saigol has broad experience in the construction and chemical industry
although part of these activities have now been taken over by the Government
of Pakistan. Texco, on behalf of MTL, and Saigol have already entered into
a tentative contractual arrangement according to which Saigol is to act as the
Engineering Company for the project with full responsibility for project
management, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, start-up and
initial operations, personnel training and other such services as necessary



- 17 -
to successfully implement and operate the project. Saigol has never executed
or operated a project outside of Pakistan; however, our investigation of the
Saigol organization with the help of an independent textile consultant company
has shown that Saigol should be capable of undertaking the above functions
provided that it obtains support in some of these responsibilities.
4.10      More specifically Saigol will require assistance in detailed equip-
ment specifications and procurement and in the area of establishing mill
control, labor cost and production planning systems. Such assistance will be
provided by the Technical Advisor (para. 4.11). Saigol will be fully res-
ponsible for completion of the project according to an agreed timetable
(Annex 4-2) and for arranging all necessary operational training of the
operators and management (para. 4.12). Qualified preparatory, spinning,
weaving, dyeing and printing personnel will be made available from a cadre
of the existing MTL plant as well as the personnel trained by Saigol. Texco,
MTL and Saigol are at present discussing a detailed draft of a contract for
project implementation. Such a draft was reviewed by the Bank during nego-
tiations and principally found acceptable, and MTL will enter by not later
than August 1, 1975 into a final agreement with Saigol Brothers for project
implementation, satisfactory to the Bank. Among others the agreement cannot
be terminated prematurely without the consent of the Bank. Additionally, MTL
will not later than six months before the expected date of commissioning
make arrangements, acceptable to the Bank, for technical management to
operate the project for a period of three years after completion of the
project.
4.11      Since Texco and MTL do not have sufficient experience in project
management and implementation control they will employ a Technical Advisor.
The main responsibility of such Advisor will be to assist Texco and MTL
in supervising the work of the Engineering Company. The Technical Advisor
will also provide management and technical assistance to Texco and MTL in
coordination with the Engineering Company to start up the project and inte-
grate it with MTL's existing operations. The detailed terms of reference
for the Technical Advisor are described in Annex 4-3. Texco and MTL have
had preliminary discussions with Gherzi Textil Organisation (Switzerland),
an experienced textile engineering and consulting company. During negotia-
tions the Bank has reviewed the draft contract with Gherzi and found it
principally acceptable. Texco and MTL will enter into a final technical
assistance agreement with Gherzi, satisfactory to the Bank by not later than
August 1, 1975 and such agreement cannot be terminated prematurely without
the consent of the Bank.
4.12      Saigol and Texco have developped a proposal for a detailed job-
related training program which is acceptable to the Bank. Training of workers
for the project will be undertaken in the existing facilities of MTL. In
addition and according to the expected availability and needs of supervisory
and management personnel at least 20 Tanzanian nationals with appropriate
education and several years experience in the textile industry will be selected
for the special training program. The suitable candidates will be sent to



- 18 -
the Pakistan College of Textile Technology in Lyalpur for a specially
designed crash course in textile technology, to be followed by training in
Saigol's mills in Pakistan or plants elsewhere to the extent any equipment
involved in the project is not in use by Saigol. The foreign exchange
expenditures of such a training program (US8100,000) have been included in the
project costs and are part of the suggested Bank loan. Texco and MTL will
enter into final agreements for adequate training with Saigol and Gherzi,
satisfactory to the Bank by not later than August 1, 1975 as part of the
general contracts with Saigol and Gherzi.
V. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
5.01      Total project costs are estimated at Shillings 289.2 million
(US$40.8 million) and total financing required including interest during
construction at Shillings 314.4 million (US$44.3 million). Capital costs
are shown in detail in Annex 5-1 and are summarized below:

5.02      Capital costs are based on estimates prepared by Saigol from
indicative quotations provided by various suppliers and Tanzanian construction
firms in November 1974 for orders to be placed early in 1975.  To provide for
inflation from early 1975 until the expected date of expenditures a price
escalation of 12% in 1975, 10% in 1976 and 8% in 1977 for foreign and 30% per
annum for local expenditures has been provided for in the project cost estimate.
The unusually high rate for local price escalation is based on past and expec-
ted near term trends of local costs, particularly in the construction industry.
The cost estimate also includes a 5% physical contingency. Since the equip-
ment to be used is fairly standard, the project scope well known, and civil
works clearly defined and relatively modest because of already existing
infrastructure, the risk of cost increases is limited and the capital cost
estimates are considered realistic. Additional infrastructure required for
successful operations of the project and not included in the capital cost will
be mainly for improvement and increase in power supply (para. 4.06); this is
being financed by the Tanzania Investment Bank and bilaterial sources.
5.03      Permanent incremental working capital requirements for the project
are estimated at Shillings 32.4 million (US$4.6 million). They provide for
6 months requirements for raw materials, 18 months for stores, 1-1/2 months
for finished goods and 20 days for receivables. Since the Company is paid
upon delivery of the goods, the estimates for inventories and receivables
are considered realistic. Details of the working capital requirements before
and after expansion are shown in Annex 5-2.
B.   Financing Plan
5.04      The financing plan of the project would be as follows:
Financing Plan
(in million US$)
Local   Foreign   Total    Local   Foreign    Total
Debt
IBRD                       -       106.4    106.4       -        15.0       15.0
Kuwait Fund                -       106.4    106.4       -        15.0       15.0
Equity (Texco)            101.6        -       101.6     14.3        -        14.3
101.6     212.8    314.4       14.3     30.0       44.3
5.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million equivalent would cover half
of the estimated foreign exchange financing required for the project, the
other half would be provided by the Kuwait Fund. The proposed Bank loan
would be made to the Government for 22 years, including 5 years of grace, at
an interest rate of 8.5% per annum. The Government would relend the proceeds
of the loan to MTL for 13 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace, and would
charge an effective interest rate of 10% per annum. MTL would bear the



- 20 -
foreign exchange risk on the loan. The proposed Kuwait Fund loan of US$15
million equivalent (Kuwait Dinar 4.5 million) would be made to the Government
for 22 years, including 5 years of grace at an interest rate of 4%. The
onlending terms to MTL would be similar to those of the Bank loan. While
confirmation of the terms and conditions of Kuwait Fund financing has been
received, the finalization of the financing arrangements between the Kuwait
Fund, the Government and MTL would be a condition of effectiveness for the
Bank loan.
5.06      The local funds of Shillings 101.6 million (US$14.3 million)
required for the project would be provided through an increase in equity by
Shillings 100 million (US$14.1 million) and through internal cash generation
of Shillings 1.6 million (US$0.2 million). The equity would be provided by
the Government through Texco which being the only shareholder to participate
in the equity increase, will increase its shareholdings in MTL from 40% to
90%. MTL's internal cash generation during project implementation is expected
to be about Shillings 67 million. However, due to low working capital and
the Company's high debt service payments until 1977 most of the total internal
cash generation (Shillings 65.4 million) would be needed for loan repayments
and for establishing a reasonable working capital level. The Government and
Texco have agreed to make equity funds available to MTL as required by the
project and in any case in such a way that MTL's debt to equity ratio does not
exceed 60:40. The Government has also agreed to provide any overrun financing
(local and foreign) that might be required to complete the project in a form
satisfactory to the Bank. Specifically this would mean that at the date of
project completion 1/ MTL's debt/equity ratio will not exceed 60:40 and its
current ratio will be at least 1.5:1.
C.   Allocation of Bank Loan, Procurement and Disbursements
5.07      Bank and Kuwait Fund financing would be on a parallel basis with
separate specific goods and services to be covered by each of the two lenders.
The Bank and Kuwait Fund loans would be used for meeting the foreign exchange
expenditures of the project. However, foreign exchange expenditures for US$1.5
million of the Kuwait Fund loan representing foreign interest during construc-
tion would be disbursed against local expenditures for civil works because of
the Kuwait Fund's policy not to finance interest during construction.
1/   Defined at the date at which the project will have produced 2.9 million
m. of finished textiles over two months (about 80% capacity).

5.08      The Bank loan would be used for financing all foreign exchange
expenditures for consultancy services, study and training, equipment for
weaving, finishing and service facilities and for interest during construc-
tion on the Bank loan. Procurement of goods and services financed by the
Bank will be according to Bank procurement guidelines. Equipment and mate-
rial will be procured through international competitive bidding, except for
(1) small items costing less than US$50,000 equivalent which may be purchasedt
through international shopping on the basis of suitability, availability and
price considerations following approval by the Bank of the list of items
involved, and (2) proprietary equipment necessary for efficient plant opera-
tion and items in limited supply which are critical to the timely completion
of the project and which are estimated to cost not more than US$2 million
and which may be procured following bidding from restricted lists of qualified
suppliers, with prior approval of the Bank. A forecast of the estimated
disbursement schedule is given in Annex 5-3. Any funds remaining in the loan
account upon completion of the project would be cancelled. All disbursements
would be fully documented. In order to proceed with the project as soon as
possible, it is expected that up to US$150,000 retroactive financing will
become necessary; principally for the downpayments on the contracts with the
Engineering Company and the Technical Advisor, both critical for timely
implementation of the project.
5.09      Equipment financed by the Kuwait Fund loan would be procured inter-
nationally according to its own procurement guidelines. Subject to pre-
qualification, local contractors after local bidding would carry out civil
works, in part financed by the Kuwait Fund.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenues and Operating Costs
6.01      The financial analysis of the project has been done on an incremental
basis for which the assumptions are listed in detail in Annex 6-1 and are
summarized below.  It has been assumed that the project will start operations
in January 1978, that capacity utilization will increase from 50% in the first
year (1978) to 75% in 1979 and 90% thereafter and that it will have an opera-
ting life of 15 years.  At 90% capacity, the project will add 20 million m.
per year of fabrics production and at the same time, allow to shift production
to more sophisticated fabrics, thereby, for example, eliminating production of
sheeting and linen; most of the project's output will be in the form of khanga
and kitenge. Thus, the project is projected to add annual sales of Shillings
125.5 million (US$17.7 million) i.e. slightly exceed the sales of Shillings
106.7 million of the existing mill, and to generate operating profits before
depreciation and financial charges (at 90% capacity) of Shillings 74.6 million
(US$10.1 million) per year as compared to Shillings 22.5 million (US$3.2
million) for the existing mill.
6.02      Revenues and operating costs before and after expansion have been
expressed in constant 1975 ptices. Since prices of textiles, as a basic
consumer good, are set by the Government in consultation with Texco (para.
3.12), it has been assumed that any cost increases after 1975 be compensated
for by increases in product prices.
B.   Financial Projections
6.03      The financial projections are based on sales revenues and operating
costs assumptions explained in para 6.01 and 6.02. Detailed projections of
income statements, cash flow and balance sheets on an incremental basis for
the project as well as for MTL after expansion are given in Annexes 6-2 to
6-7 and are summarized below:

6.04      Under the assumptions, MTL's profitability would improve substan-
tially on account of the project. Net income after taxes is expected to
increase from Shillings 7.8 million in 1977 to 18.0 million in 1979 and 28.1
million in the years thereafter; only in 1978 when no more than half of the
project's capacity has been assumed to be utilized, net income declines to
Shillings 4.1 million. The more than proportional increase in sales value
and earnings-is due to switching to more sophisticated products as well as
to economies of scale from the expansion. Net income before taxes as a
percentage of sales which was only 5% in 1974 is expected to increase to
more than 10% in 1975, mainly as a result of higher textile prices and lower
cotton prices which only in part affected 1974 earnings. After completion
of the project, net income after taxes as a percentage of sales would be at
about twice the level of the existing operations.
6.05      As a result of the good earning potential of the project, the
financial ratios of MTL show quite satisfactory levels despite substantial
additional debt financing. The debt service coverage remains above two times
after the heavy repayments on the existing operations in 1975 and 1976. The
current ratio would improve from 0.8 in 1974 to a satisfactory level of 1.5
in 1975 as a result of internal cash generation and the increase in share
capital. The debt to equity ratio would be about 60:40 from 1976 until 1979
when as a result of beginning debt repayments on the project, it would start
to gradually improve. Texco and MTL have agreed to maintain a debt to equity
ratio of at least 60 to 40 and a current ratio of 1.5 (paras. 5.03 and 5.06).
6.06      Since MTL's profitability and sound financial situation will
largely depend on the Government's policy of pricing inputs and outputs, the
Government has agreed to take all measures necessary or appropriate to ensure
that after completion of the project, MTL--operating efficiently--obtains
revenues sufficient to cover all of its costs, to service all of its debt and
to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. MTL has agreed not to
declare or pay any dividends until the project has been completed and thereafter
only if by so doing the current ratio would not fall below 1.5.
C.   Incremental Financial Return and Major Risks
6.07      The incremental financial return of the project amounts to 24.2%
before and 19.4% after taxes. Its detailed calculation and its sensitivity
are shown in Annex 6-8. It is relatively high partly because the project is
an expansion using existing infrastructure and partly because existing machin-
ery can be used more effectively in combination with the project. As usual,
the return is most sensitive to changes in revenues. The return after taxes
would decrease to 17.3% if a 10% reduction of textile prices is assumed. If
investment costs went up 15% combined with a one year delay in project com-
pletion the return would drop to 13.9%. If the ultimate capacity utilization
of the project were to be only 80%, the return would decrease to 17.7%.



- 25 -
6.08      The project faces technical, managerial and commercial risks.
However, the technical and managerial risks should be limited in view of: (i)
employment of an engineering company for project implementation, (ii) employ-
ment of experienced technical advisors, (iii) MTL's experience with similar
existing operations, (iv) outside assistance for operations and job-oriented
training program, and (v) allowance for a relatively long implementation
period and a well defined capital cost estimate. These risks would only be-
come major if for whatever reasons the cooperation between the Company and
Texco on the one hand and Saigol and the Technical Advisor on the other should
not be as effective as now expected. Therefore, Texco and MTL agreed that
the arrangements with Saigol and the Technical Advisor cannot be terminated
prematurely without the prior consent of the Bank (paras. 4.10 and 4.11). In
view of the limited supply of textiles and since MTL is not responsible for
marketing its output, the major commercial risk of the project would be in the
Government's price setting for inputs and outputs. This risk should be
limited considering MTL's relatively good production performance and in view
of the agreements obtained from the Government in this regard (paras. 5.03,
5.06 and 6.06).
D.   Auditing
6.09      Coopers and Lybrand is MTL's auditor and its auditing reports are
prepared on time and are acceptable. MTL will continue to be audited by an
independent auditing firm acceptable to the Bank.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      For the economic analysis, costs and benefits have been evaluated
at estimated long-term world prices prevailing in 1978 (expressed in 1975
Shillings), when the project is expected to start operations. As the
conversion rate a shadow exchange rate of Shillings to US$ of 10 to 1 has
been used. Tradable items, which are the more significant costs and benefits
of the project, are valued at border prices, and non-tradable local items at
their nominal values except for unskilled labor, the only non-tradable item
with some significance. Based on detailed studies of the textile sector
within the Tanzanian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development Planning,
it is estimated that the shadow price for unskilled labor is 50 to 75% of the
nominal value; therefore a shadow price of 75% has been assumed for calculating
the base return of the project. This is considered conservative in view of
the relatively high minimum wages in Tanzania.
A.   Raw Material and Textile Prices
7.02      Prices for cotton, which is the basis for the textile production
of this project, have to be seen in close relation to prices for man-made
fibers. In line with other increased commodity prices, cotton prices reached
unprecedented high levels in 1973/74. In the past, cotton has experienced



- 26 -
increasing competition from man-made fibers which prior to 1973 kept cotton
prices practically unchanged for many years; in real terms, cotton prices
had even declined. Improved technology and enlarged capacities for man-made
fibers, particularly polyester staple, resulted in substantial reductions of
production costs and combined with excess production over many years led
to constant pressure on cotton and fiber prices. Consequently, and in addi-
tion to increasing consumers' preference for man-made fibers, cotton demand
stagnated. This situation changed in 1972/73 when demand for cotton increased
partly because of a leveling in the supply of man-made fibers since in
preceeding years, product prices for them were low, and the industry had
been unable to attract sufficient investment for new capacity. Additional
uncertainties were introduced through the changed oil situation. The com-
bination of these factors resulted in early 1974 in a dramatic increase in
cotton prices which reached a level three times higher than the traditional
US$0.25 to 0.35 per pound before 1973. Subsequently, cotton prices have
again decreased to about US$0.40 per pound and lower. Although cotton prices
may decrease further in the near future, it is not expected that, on a long-
term basis, they will return to levels prevailing before 1973. For purposes
of calculating the economic rate of return, Mwanza cotton has been priced
at its export value with an estimated international price of US$0.52 per
pound FOB. This is in line with the price forecast of the Bank's Economic
Analysis and Projections Department. For other major raw materials which
are practically all imported, CIF import prices have been used.
7.03      Since production generated by the project would replace imports of
fabrics, the estimated import prices based on the above cotton price have been
used for determining the economic benefits of the project. Because of dif-
ference in design, fabric structure, product quality and market fluctuations,
it is difficult to establish long-term international prices for the variety
of textiles to be produced by the project. The prices used were developed
through a comparison of production costs in typical textile manufacturing
countries and compared with actual import prices in Tanzania. In order to
arrive at production costs, added values for spinning, weaving and finishing
in typical fabric exporting countries plus freight and insurance to Tanzania
have been added to the estimated long term cotton price. The prices arrived
at through this added value concept have been found well in line with the
actual import prices in Tanzania at a time when cotton prices were about at
the same level as assumed in the economic return calculations. The different
fabric prices and costs used for the financial and economic analysis are
shown in detail in Annex 7-1.
B.   Economic Return
7.04      Based on the assumptions given above, the project yields a satis-
factory rate of return of 16% (base case). Annexes 7-2 and 7-3 give a
detailed description of the calculation of the return and its sensitivities
which fundamentally follow those for the financial return. Under the most
adverse circumstance of a one-year delay in project completion with a 15%
increase in investment costs, the project's return would be about 12%. If



- 27 -
unskilled labor is shadow-priced at 50% of its nominal value, the project's
return would increase to 17%. If unskilled labor would be assumed at the
nominal value the return would be 15%. Using the official exchange rate,
the base return would decrease to 14.0%. Substantial indirect benefits from
the project will be derived from the additional employment and training of
about 1,200 workers.

the Bank loan.
8.03      Based on the above agreements and assurances, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$15 million equivalent to the Government for 22 years,
including a 5-year grace period, and for relending to the Company for 13 years,
including 4-1/2 years grace.

twill:         A weave characterized by diagonal lines or ribs produced
by staggered floats. Warp face twill has prevalently
warp floats on the face, filling face twill has filling
floats. One of the basic weaves; permits heavier,
denser cloth than plain weave.
twist:         The turns about their axes of fibers, yarns, or cords.
Expressed in turns per unit of length or, less
commonly, by the helix angle in reference to the
diameter of the yarn.
warper:         A machine for preparing the yarns intended for the warp
of a woven or warp knit fabric.
warping:        The preparation of the warp for looms or knitting
machines by arranging the yarns on a bean. Principal
methods: beam warping, chain warping, and sectional
warping.
weaving:        The process of manufacturing a fabric by interlacing a
series of filling (crosswise) yarns with a series of
warp (lengthwise) yarns at right angles.
width:          The distance between the two selvages of woven cloth.
winding:        Transfer of a yarn or thread from one type of package
to another, for example, from cakes to cones.
yarn:          A generic term for continuous strands of textile fibers
or filaments in a form suitable for knitting, weaving,
or otherwise intertwining to form a textile product.
It may comprise: (a) A number of fibers twisted
together, (b) A number of filaments laid together

without twist (a zero-twist yarn), (c) A number of
filaments laid together with more or less twist, or
(d) A single filament with or without twist, a mono-
filament.
yarn, carded:  Yarns made from fibers that have been carded but not
combed in the manufacturing process. Note: Most
spun yarns are of this type.
Yarn number-   A measure of linear density.  For cotton, the cotton
ing system:  count (c.c.) is defined as the number of basic hanks
(840 yd. lengths) per pound. Hence, the finer the
yarn the higher the count.

EXPORT PROSPECTS OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY OF TANZANIA
1.        In assessing future export opportunities for cotton fabrics,
special consideration has to be given to Uganda and Kenya which are members
of the East African Community (EAC). Tanzanian goods are not subject to
import duties which for the cotton fabrics originating from outside the
EAC amount to 45% (page 5). Uganda traditionally has been an exporter of
cotton fabrics (mostly to Kenya) and in the years 1970-72, its exports of
cotton fabrics exceeded imports by 20 million meters. Recently, however, due
to economic problems the textile industry has been reported to operate at a
fraction of its capacity. Kenya is currently importing textile fabrics at a
rate of 40 million meters per annum, including 8 million meters of cotton
prints. At this moment, there are in Kenya two textile projects under con-
sideration with a total capacity to produce 22 million meters per annum by
1977 and 47 million meters by 1980. It is estimated that in terms of cotton
prints, Kenya will be self-sufficient by 1977 and by then, only a small pro-
portion of other imported fabrics will be of the type which can be produced in
Tanzania (page 6).
2.        Erection of new and/or expansion of the existing manufacturing
plants have also been reported in Zaire, Zambia, Sudan, Malawi and Ethiopia
and it appears that most African countries have plans to become self-sufficient
by the end of the decade as far as cotton textile fabrics are concerned. Also,
in some African countries (Zambia, Somali), a portion of the textile require-
ments are being supplied on concessionary terms by the Peoples Republic of
China eliminating almost completely the requirements for regular commercial
imports. Consequently, future exports of Tanzanian cotton fabrics to the
African countries are most likely to be limited to occasional sales anc it
appears that opportunities to build a sizeable and permanent market in these
countries do not any longer exist.
3.        In the period 1967-1971 the world imports of cotton textiles from
developing countries increased from US$217 up to US$284 million, i.e. 31%,
while the total world imports of cotton fabrics grew from US$827 up to
US$1,192 million, i.e. by 44%. 1/ Consequently, while the number of develop-
ing countries exporting cotton fabrics has increased, their share of the world
market has declined.  There are two reasons to explain this trend.  Firstly,
the quality of fabrics supplied by the developing countries is relatively
1/   Source:  UNCTAD Secretariat, International Trade in Cotton Textiles and
the Developing Countries: Problems and Prospects, August 1973.



ANNEX 3-11
Page 2
low so the imports are mainly limited to gray goods. In 1972 the European
Economic Community (EEC) imported $170 million worth of cotton fabrics from
the developing countries out of which only $11 million or 6.5% were finished
fabrics. In total, EEC imported during 1972 $559 million worth of cotton
fabrics so the finished fabrics from all developing countries accounted for
less than 2% of the imports. Secondly, the developing countries export
mostly cotton fabrics, the importance of which in world trade has been
steadily declining. In the period 1967-1971 world imports of man-made
fabrics increased from US$682 to 1,263 million, i.e., by 85% or twice the
rate of growth of cotton fabrics. In 1960, cotton accounted for 68% of all
textile fibers used. By 1970 this figure had decreased to 55% and it is
estimated that by 1980 the cotton share will be as low as 38%. On the other
hand, the share of polyester increased from 1% in 1960 to 11% in 1970 and is
expected to reach 24% in 1980.
4.        With the exception of a few thousand samples of Khanga and Kitenge
prints distributed through the Tanzanian embassies in USA and Europe, no
serious attempt has ever been made to explore the export opportunities for
Tanzanian textiles outside Uganda and Kenya. The current productivity
(page 7) of the Tanzanian textile industry is low and also the cost of
machinery, spare parts, dyestuffs and chemicals is approximately 25% above
the level prevailing in Europe and USA. Consequently, the costs and sell-
ing prices of Tanzanian textiles usually would not be competitive (pages 8,
9 and 10) in the world markets. Tanzanian fabrics entering EEC would be
subject of a 13.5% duty as compared with no duty for EEC member and asso-
ciate member countries (Tunisia, Greece, Morocco, Spain and Portugal).
Also, the freight from Dar-es-Salaam to European ports would be more costly
than from the Mediterranean countries. In Asian countries, the wage rates
are usually lower (page 11) and labor productivity higher than in Tanzania,
and Tanzanian cotton fabrics are not competitive in export markets with
textiles from such exporting countries as Taiwan, Hongkong, South Korea and
Pakistan, which dominate the world export markets. Actually, cotton fabrics
from Taiwan, Pakistan and Hongkong can be landed in Dar-es-Salaam 35-45% below
the prices of the similar local goods (page 8). It appears, therefore, that
the prospects to develop export markets for Tanzanian cotton fabrics in Europe
are not too good and extreme caution has to be exercised in planning any ex-
port oriented investments in the immediate future.
5.        At the same time, as part of its economic development program,
Tanzania wants to decrease the share of raw cotton exports in favor of an
increased export of cotton yarn and fabrics (page 12). The Government
hopes eventually to increase the share of cotton to be processed in Tanzania
up to 60%. The cost of such a program is estimated to cost US$400 million
with US$300 million foreign component. Such a program would create an
exportable surplus of 200 million meters. However, there is no evidence
that export markets can be easily developed to absorb even a small portion
of this output. It appears that before sizeable exports can be developed
the productivity of the industry has to be improved and the costs have to
be drastically reduced. Also, a considerable amount of market and merchandis-
ing research and development has to be done regarding quality, styling, pricing
and distribution before any definite plans for export oriented facilities are
formulated.



ANNEX 3-11
Page 3
6.        It appears that Tanzania probably has a greater comparative advan-
tage in the production of cotton-polyester blended fabrics (based on local
cotton and imported polyester fibre) than in pure cotton fabrics. The main
reason for this is that Tanzanian AR grade cotton is of a type that is tech-
nically ideally suited for the manufacturing of fine blended combed fabrics.
This type of cotton is available in limited quantities only in some parts
of the world (Egypt, Sudan, Peru, Southwest USA).
7.        The potential foreign exchange savings associated with a polyester-
cotton blended fabric project appears also attractive. On average the landed
cost in Dar-es-Salaam (excluding duties and taxes) of standard 65/35 polyester-
cotton fabric in 1974 was US$1.00 per meter. In other words, a 10 million
meter project would substitute US$10 million worth of imports per annum. The
annual foreign exchange costs of operating such a factory would be about US$6
million (page 13). The foreign exchange savings associated with the project
would be therefore of the order of $ 4 million per annum. Furthermore, it
is quite possible that - because of the type of cotton grown in the country
- Tanzania could manufacture fine blended combed fabrics at an internationally
competitive cost level and develop permanent export business in this rapidly
growing market.

MWANZA TEXTILE PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ADVISOR FOR TEXCO AND MTL
A.   The Project
1.        The National Textile Corporation (Texco), on behalf of the Govern-
ment of Tanzania, proposes to expand textile production at Mwanza Textiles
Ltd. (MTL), Mwanza (Lake Victoria) by 20 million meters per year. Texco is
a parastatal organization for all major textile activities in Tanzania. It
is a major shareholder of MTL and is the sponsor for the project together
with MTL. The project consists of an integrated textile plant which would
increase production at Mwanza from 23 million meters to 43 million meters
per year. Total project costs are estimated at about US$43 million of
which about US$30 million would be in foreign exchange. It is expected
that these foreign exchange requirements will be financed by IBRD and the
Kuwait Fund.
2.        Project implementation should start about mid-1975 and commercial
production of the project is expected to commence in 1978. The feasibility
study for the project has been prepared by Saigol Brothers Ltd., Lahore
(Pakistan), the largest textile producer in Pakistan. Saigol Brothers
would also be retained as Engineering Company to implement the project
(details in para. B). The existing mill at Mwanza started operations in
1968 and has achieved a production of 22.6 million meters in 1974. Total
employment is now about 2,400. Operations are supported by management
assistance from Textilconsult SpA (Italy) which also assisted in the con-
struction of the mill. The management agreement with Textilconsult will
terminate in 1975 and adequate replacement of expatriates has been arranged
with Saigol Brothers.
3.        The project would add about 28,000 spindles, about 600 looms as
well as bleaching, mercerizing, dyeing and printing equipment to the exist-
ing facilities. The spinning capacity will be increased from 3,360 tons
to 6,540 tons. With addition of three new automatic screen printing machines
the capacity for screen printing will be increased to 18.5 million meters.
The capacity for roller printing will be increased to 25.0 million meters.
The expanded mill will provide employment for an additional 1,,200 workers.
It is proposed to construct about 23,000 sq. m. of covered floor space
including 19,700 sq. m. of service buildings for warehousing, boiler plant
and power house.

1/ Benefits and costs have been based at 1978 prices expressed in 1975 Shillings.
Economic price assumptions for tradable items are based on international prices
and non-tradables, except unskilled labor, at their nominal values. Values in this
table are based on the official exchange rate whereas the economic rate of return
calculations are based on a shadow exchange rate of Shilling to US$ of 10 to 1.
Unskilled labor has been shadow priced at 75% of its nominal value. Economic
benefits are based on an expected long-term cotton price of US$-.52/pound CIF
equivalent with added values for spinning, weaving and finishing in typical
fabric exporting countries plus freight and insurance to Dar-es-Salaam. CIF
values have been assumed because the project's output represents import
substitution.
2/ Includes 30% import duty.
3/ The cotton produced in Tanzania and used for the project is of higher quality
than actually would be required for producing this type of textiles. The
FOB Mwanza value of Tanzanian cotton has been estimated at US$-.52 cents/pound
equivalent corresponding to a CIF value of US$-.57/pound in the major textile
exporting countries. However, when determining the benefits of the project, lower
grade cotbon, typically used in other countries, has been taken into account with
a CIF value of US$-.52/pound (see above).
