IRRIGATION XI! PROJECT (LOAN 1645-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        The project was prepared by the semi-autonomous Jatilubur Authority, and
by Project Irigasi IDA (PROSIDA), an executive unit of the Directorate General
of Water Resource Development (DGWRD) in the Ministry of Public Works, with
consultant assistance from Sir William Halcrow and Partners (UK) and P. T.
Virama Kerya (Indonesia). The project was appraised by the Bank in June
1978. The Loan Agreement was signed on December 29, 1978 and became effective
May 10, 1979. The Loan closed on March 31, 1986. The final disbursement was
US$65eOlM and an amount totalling US$11.9M was cancelled.
Objectives
2.        The project's objectives were to:  (a) assist the Government's
program of further upgrading its existing irrigation systems at relatively low
cost in order to increase food production; and (b) facilitate the movement of
agricultural products, inputs and services. The project consists of: (i) two
construction components--Jatiluhur Tertiary Development (186,000 ha), and
Cisedane Drainage (5,000 ha) and Inspection and Access Roads (230 km); and
(xi) Studies and Investigating component for the preparation of future
drainage and tidal land development projects.
Implementation Experience
3.        The project has been in general successfully completed and has
achieved its main objective of increasing paddy production. Implementation by
the Jatiluhur Authority for the tertiary subproject and DGWRD for the drainage
subproject was satisfactory although the project suffered about two years'
delay in completion for both these two subprojects. This is mainly because of
difficulties encountered in land acquisition, and the limited capacity of a
major local contractor for the drainage subproject, and the extension of the
project and difficulties in staff housing contract for the tertiary
subproject. All studies under the project have been satisfactorily completed.
4.        A 15% project cost underrun was mainly because of devaluation of
Rupiah and liberal allowance of physical and price contingencies ($22.4
million) provided at appraisal. The recalculated economic rates of return
(ERR) are 422 for the tertiary subproject (52% at appraisal) and 18% for the
drainage subproject (16% at appraisal) which are highly satisfactory.
However, Operation and Maintenance (OEM) of these projects were less than
satisfactory and raised concern.  O&M of tertiary works, which is the



- v -
responsibility of the Water Users Association (WUA) were generally inadequate,
and only about 15% of chese WUAs was operating effectively. DGWRD, which is
responsible for O&M of the drainage subprcject during construction and one
year after completion, has insufficient budget for an adequate maintenance.
Although the system is new and no significant damages have occurred so far,
this situation can not last long--particularly when the O&M responsibility
will soon be shifting to the West Java Province.
Sustainability
5.        Overall prospects for sustainability of the project will be fairly
good, provided the Government continues to focus upon the importance of O&M,
particularly in terms of adequate funding and the strengthening of
institu ions and procedures. The basis for project sustainability is being
laid by the following factors:
(a) the perception of GOI decision makers has changed favorably towards
irrigation O&M;
(b)  Bank assistance for the ongoing Central and West Java project (Loan
2649-IND) and the Irrigation Subsector Project (Ln. 2880) will lay
the basis for strengthening the O&M organizations at the provincial
and local levels;
(c) Indonesian farmers are generally industrious and disciplined, their
participation on tertiary O&M  s expected to be improved when their
main systems are better maintained, duplication of tertiary water
management control in the village is eliminated, and an effective
farmers' training program initiated under the ongoing Irrigation XVI
project (Loar. 2118) is contirued under the Irrigation Subsector
Project;
(d) the Government's crop intensification programs such as BIMAS, INMAS
.mnd INSUS are important complementary factors for increasing farm
production and for the project'. sustainability; and
(e) both Jatiluhar and Cisedane subprojects have a secured source of
water supply for irrigation; improvement of the Jatiluhar main
carrier West Tarum Canal's ope.ation and maintenance is being
carried out under Loan 2560-IND.
Findings and LessonE
6.        The major lessons learned and points of interest under the project
are as follows:
(a) Performance of local water users associations must be upgraded
during and after the project implementation to sustain potential
benefits of tertiary systems;
(b) Provincial O&M resources must be strengthened in general, and smooth
transferring of O&M responsibilities from DGWRD to the provincial



- vi -
government for each completed project should be ensured in
particular;
(c)  Jatiluhur Authority's current O&M funding arrangement is encouraging
as it has obtained considerable OM funds (about Rp. 20,0001ha) from
local government land tax revenu' ' (IPEDA), and its own revenues
from electricity and municipal water supply.

IRRIGATION X.I PROJECT (LOAN 1645-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANK OVERVIEW
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The attached project completion report (PCR) was prepared by the
Directorate of Planning and Programming (DPP) of the Directorate General of
Water Resources Development (DGWRD), the Ministry of Public Works. It is
noted that this report is the first PCR prepared by staff of DPP/DGWRD without
any external assistance. This may be considered as a part of DCWRD's achieve-
ment in institution strengthening under the Bank assistance. This overview,
prepared by staff of Asia Regions highlights the PCR's major findings and
comments on some issues raised in the PCR.
II.  HIGULIGHTS
2.1       The PCR has provided an appropriate section on summary, conclusion
and lessons learned (p. 25, PCR). This $100 million project was mainly
designed to increase rice production and farm income tbeough tertiary irriga-
tion development of about 186,000 ha (later adjusted to 168,000 by excluding
18,000 na of upper Jatiluhur area) and the improvement of drainage related
works of about 42,000 ha in the province of West Java. A package of studies
for future projects was also included. In general, the project has been
satisfactorily completed and its main objective of increase in rice production
has been achieved. A two-year delay in completion was mainly because of dif-
ficulties in land acquisition, limited capacity of local contractors, and
change of scope in tertiary development, while a 15% project cost underrun was
chiefly due to devaluation of the Indonesian currency and more than necessary
provision of physical and price contingencies. The proiect's economic rates
of return (ERR) have been recalculated at 42% for the tertiary subproject
against 52% estimated at appraisal, and 18X for the drainage subproject
against 16% estimated at appraisal, which are satisfactory.
2.2       Major concerns of the PCR are with respect to the project's proper
operation and maintenance (OEM), and sustainability. Specifically, the
performance of local water users' associations (WUAs) has been generally less
than satisfactory and needs to be upgraded, and the provincial government's
capacity to take over O&M responsibility of the newly completed project is
inadequate and needs to be improved to ensure the project's sustainability.
However, the PCR points to an encouraging development on O&M funds
mobilization in the Jatiluhur area where the tertiary subproject is located.

III. BANK COMMENTS ON THE PCR
3.1       Concerns of the PCR on O&M and sustainability of the project are
consistent with those expressed in previous PCRs for irrigation projects in
Indonesia. The following Bank comments and discussions are thus also focused
on these important subjects.
Water Users' Association and Tertiary O&M (Jatiluhur Subproject)
3.2       Since the WUA is responsible for O&M o' its tertiary system, the
tertiary's standard of maintenance is a clear index of the WUA's performance.
A summary of performance of WUAs in the two subproject areas is shown below.

According to the observations of a Bank supervision mission for the project,
several structures had been damaged and other structures had their gates
missing. They also observed in one instance that an earthen embankment, which
divided the field channel and the tertiary channel downstream of the division
box, was missing for several feet. They also noticed several instances of
damaged concrete or stone pitching in the tertiaries downstream of division
boxes. There was little evidence of any repairs undertaken to restore damages
or of any repairs being planned. This indicated that the responsible WUAs
were not much concerned.
3.3       The major reasons for poor performance of the WUAs were identified
during the Bank overv-kew of PCR for Irrigation VII, and were as follows: (i)
inadequate attention paid by local government officials, including village
heads, to the training and functioning of the WUAs; (ii) inadequate consulta-
tion with and participation of farmers during planning and construction
stages; (iii) poor leadership and management of WUAs; and (iv) too many share-
croppers involved who have insecure land tenure and hence little interest to
participate. Additional factors that may be mentioned include: (v) lack of
effective legal discipline for those who violate the rules and willfully
damage the canal distribution system; (vi) lack of proper training of water
users; and (vii) duplicate functions performed by existing village water man-
agement functionaries such as ulu-ulu, particularly in areas where the terti-
ary boundary does not coincide with the village administrative boundary.



- ix-
3.4       Presidential Instruction No. 2, issued in 1984, inter alia, requires
that: (i) the Minister of Home Affairs should direct the Provincial Governors
to promote and stimulate the WUA; (ii) the Minister of Public Works should
provide guidance for use of irrigation water and maintenance of irrigation
network at the tertiary level; and (iii) the Ministry of Agriculture should
provide guidance in the utilization of water in a fair and effective way at
the level of quaternary plots. Accordingly, the Jatiluhur Authority, the
executing agency of the tertiary development subproject, prepared an action
program in early 1986 for improving performance of WUAs in its jurisdiction.
However, no progress reports are yet available, and close monitoring and con-
tinuous support from DGWRD to this important program will be required.
3.5       Recently the Bank has carried out an appraisal of an Irrigation
Suosector Project under which special attention will be paid to streamlining
performance of the existing WUAs nationwide. Prior to this project, large-
scale training for WUAs was initiated under the Bank-financed Irrigation XVI
Project (Loan 2118-IND), where training is provided at selected centers in
Java. Traditional village water management systems will be merged with WUAs
where applicable. Guidance and stimulation will be provided to them as stipu-
lated under the above Presidential Instruction. Further, pilot schemes will
be formulated to enlarge or make federation of these tertiary WUAs to serve
irrigation systems of up to 150 ha each. These system-wide WUAs are expected
to share with the local government increasing responsibility for irrigation
O&M and collection of irrigation service fees.
Transfer and O&M of Main Systems (Cisedane Subproject)
3.6       The Cisedane subproject, which is newly completed and temporarily
maintained by DGWRD, will be transferred to the West Java province for perma-
nent O&M. As rightly stated in the PCR (para. 3.07, PCR), if maintenance
efforts on the drains are relaxed they will deteriorate very fast due to sil-
tation problems. The provincial government will have to devote considerable
efforts and resources to ensure regular inspection of the completed works and
to develop cost effective methods and work cycles for keeping the drains clear
of silt and in proper shape. However, it would be difficult for the West Java
Provincial Irrigation Service (PRIS) to perform an adequate O&M after transfer
of the system under the current budgetary allocation for O&k. The West Java
PRIS is a typical case in the country facing two major O&M problems: the lack
of O&H budget and the inefficient utilization of the limited budget. This may
be explained by the current national average O&M expenditure of about
Rp 13,000 ($8.01) per ha, which is less than 50% of the amount required for
adequate O&M. Two thirds of this allocation has been traditionally used for
salary and overhead items, leaving only a small portion for physical improve-
ment of works.
3.7       The reasons for short allocation of irrigation maintenance budget
have been the following:  (i) GOI had, until recently, assigned a high prior-
ity to irrigation investment projects aiming at rice self-sufficiency, and a
lo% priority for O&M activities; (ii) O&M requirement has been increasing
rapidly because of the large volume of investments in the past, financed by
oil revenues; (iii) GOI has in recent years been experiencing severe financial
constraints as a result of considerable reduction of oil revenues; (iv) the



- x 
planning and budgeting process does not provide adequate O&M funding as part
of the investment plan; and (v) the al'location of O&M funds does not corres-
pond to the actual needs of each irrigation system in the provinces. Other
than a basic shortage of funds for O&M, the following factors have also been
contributing to inefficient O&M: (i) the disproportionate allocation of per-
sonnel inputs against nunpersonnel ones; (ii) inappropriate selection of pri-
ority O&M works; (iii) inadequate quality of O&M staff; and (iv) almost no
participation and feedback from water users on the water system O&M.
3.8       The Government is now aware of these problems and has formulated a
Policy Statement and Action Program for irrigation O&M and cost recovery. The
main objectives of the Policy Statement are: (i) to gradually raise the O&M
funding to efficient levels, which can sustain the effectiveness ant meet the
performance standards of irrigation systems, as designed, through increased
budgetary support and eventually through direct (irrigation service fee) and
indirect (land tax improvement) cost recovery measures; (ii) to strengthen O&M
institutions including PRISs and WUAs; and (iii) to improve budgeting and pro-
gramming of O&M and to establish sound criteria and procedures for allocation
and monitoring of funds to meet the actual O&M needs of each irrigation sys-
tem. This Policy Statement and Action Program will be implemented as a part
of the Irrigation Subsector Project. Training of staff of the West Java PRIS,
at all levels, is also being pursued under the Bank-financed Central and West
Java Provincial Irrigation Development Project (Loan 2649-IND).
Funding in the Jatiluhur Area
3.9       Until 1986/87 O&M expenditure and financing in the Jatiluhur area
had been the same as elsewhere in the country. However, this has been consid-
erably changed recently (see Table 1). In i987, the Authority mobilized O&M
funds of about Rp 5,100 million or Rp 17,000/ha, mostly from users' charges on
hydropower, municipal and industrial (M&I) *ases of water, and land tax. Reve-
nues of hydropower and M&I water supply were directly collected by the Author-
ity, while land tax was collected by the local government who shared about 2%
of its net collected tax revenue with the Authority to support its irrigation
O&M expenditures.  At present, this 2% sharing rate is considered too low, and
the Government has scheduled a review and in-rease in this rate as required in
1988.
3.10      Although the Jatiluhur area is managed by a semi-autonomous author-
ity and the model of O&M funds mobilization may not be fully applicable to
other irrigated areas, yet the approach of improving land tax and sharing a
part of its proceeds for mobilizing irrigation O&M funds may be workable
throughout the country. At present, the average land tax in the area is about
Rp 18,000/ha/yr. It is expected that the average rate would be increased at
about 30% per year in the next three years, or about Rp 40,000/ha by 1990 as a
result of a comprehensive land reclassification and revaluation program assis-
ted by the Bank (Loan 2560-IND). The increase in land tax revenues, together
with the introduction of a direct cost recovery through an irrigation service
fee system, will contribute towards strengthening the local government's
financial autonomy in handling irrigation O&M.

Sustainability of the Project
3.11      While sharing the concern expressed by the PCR on inadequate O&M,
overall prospects for sustainability of the project will be fairly good,
provided the Government continues to focus upon the importance of OM,
particularly in terms of adequate funding and the strengthening of institu-
tions and procedures. The basis for project sustainability is being laid by
the following factors:
(a) the perception of GOI decision makers has changed favorably towards
irrigation OM;
(b) Bank assistance for the ongoing Central and West Java project (Loan
2649-IND) and the proposed Irrigation Subsector Project will lay the
basis for strengthening the O&M organizations at the provincial and
local levels;
(c) Indonesian farmers are generally industrious and disciplined, their
participation on tertiary O&M is expected to be improved when their
main systems are better maintained, duplication of tertiary water
management control in the village i3 eliminated, and an effective
farmers' training program initiated under Loan 2118-IND is continued
under the Irrigation Subsector Project;
(d) the Government's crop intensification programs such as BIMAS, INMAS
and INSUS are important complementary factors for increasing farm
production and for the project's sustainability; and
(e)  both Jatiluhur -id Cisedane subprojects have a secured source of
water supply for irrigation; improvement of the Jatiluhur main
carrier West Tarum Canal's operation and maintenance is being
carried out under Loan 2560-IND.
Loan Disbursement
3.12      The loan disbursement amount as shown in PCR Annex 3, Tables 3 and 4
needs updating. The total loan amount was US$77.0 million, of which about $65
million (or 84X) was disbursed and the remaining about $12 million was can-
celled. Two cancellations were made, one on August 7, 1985 (for $8,778,000)
and the other on October 21, 1986 (for $3,185,197.33).

r. INTRODUCTSOu
1.01- Rice is the daxinant irdigated crop in Indonesia. Of about 8.4
million ha of rice harvested in 1976, 7.2 million ha were irrigated 4c
grown under wet land conditions. lrrigation systems cover about 4 million
ha, of which Java accounts for 60t. Average paddy yielded on Java about
3.3 ton/ha ccmpared with 2.8 ton/ha in the other islands. Although
irrigation has long been a major feature of Indonesia agriculture, by the
late 1960s, the systems built during the colonial period were in a state
of  complete  disrepair.  lrrigation  development  during  the  first  two
development plan periods concentrated heavily on the rehabilitation of
these systems. Construction of new systems, mainly to serve as the basis
for transmigration projects outside Java, lagged behind.
1.02 hl-h the rehabilitation of most existing irrigation systems either
completed or under way, future irrigation development in Indonesia will
shift to the construction of new gravity systems and swamp and tidal land
development outside Java. This shift does not mean, however, that
irrrigation development on Java should stop. Nany of the existing systems
still need to be fully rehabilitated or upgraded at relatively low cost,
and  the  limited potential for large  storage  and groundwater should  be
developed to expand dry season cropping as far as economically feasible.
This in turn would require strengthening of the Directorate General of
Water Resources Development (DUWRD), training and staff development, and
an expansion of aggicultural supporting services. The Irrigation XII
project fits in well w4th these conditions and policies.
II. hROJECT FORMULATION
Proiect PrcDaration
2.01   The Government of Indonesia (GO0) had requested Dank assistance for
tertiary development on 186,000 ha and construction of oPeration and
maintenance (O S N) Staff housing in the Jatiluhur area in West Javas
rehabilitation and improvement of drainage works and lnspection and access
roads in the Cisedane area in Wlst Java; and studies and investigation for
future flood control and drainage ptojects in Central Java and South
Sulawesi and for tidal land development projects in South Sumatera and
Central Kalimantan.

2.02   World Bank lppraisal mission, appraised the project in June 1978
and in their report, detailed ftatures of the Projent were given as
follows I
2.03 - The tertiary development area is one of the most important rice
producing areas in Java. It in located along the north coast of West Java
and extends in an east-west direction ftor about 140 km immediately to the
east of Jakarta. The 186,000 ha to be provided with tertiary systems would
be apread over the northern and southern portions of the area served by
the Jatiluhur irtigation system. This area is bounded on the nocth by the
Java Sea, on the east by the Cilalanang River, on the south by the East
and Wst  Tatum main canals, and on  the west by Jakarta. The 5,000 ha
Cisedane drainage area is located within the service atea of the 42,000 ha
Cisedane irrigation system, which lies immediately to the west of Jakarta.
it is bounded on the east by the Angke River, on the north by the Java
Sea, on the west by Cidurian Riv%r, and on the south by the Tanah Tinggi
and west primary irrigation canai  from the  Pagat Baru barrage on  the
Cisedane River. Tangerang, the main town, lice some 28 km to the west of
Jakarta.
2.04   Some 346,000 farm families and 61,000 landless familles inhabit the
186,000 ha tectlary development area. The total Cisedane acea covers
42,000 ha with a population of about 85,000  farm families and 25,000
landless familiest average yearly inundated ageas would be about 5,000 ha
with some 10,000 farm families and 3,000 landless families affected.
2.05   Farm size and land tenure data are sketchy. Information from local
officials suggest an average farm size of 0.S ha in both project areas.

in both pr,jsct areas, about 60% of the farmers are owner-operators, and
40% ace sharecroppers. in most shatoccopping arcangements the tenant and
landlocd equally share total production, inputs and harvesting costs the
tenant and his family provide their labor and the land owner pays the land
tax. The  landless population is about 15%  of the  rural population in
Jatiluhur and 20% In Cisedane.
2.06   The tertiary devolopment area ts served by the West Tarum, East
Thrum, North Tarum and CipunegCaa irrigation system, /1 which were
rehabilitated under Credit 19S-IND. Run-of-river supplies for these
systems are augmented by water released from the Jatiluhur reservoir. This
water is impounded by the Jatiluhur dam, a 105 m high zoned-fill
embankment on the Citarum River with a crest length of 1,200 m and a
usable  storage  of  2,000 MCM.   2   The  water  is  celeased  through  the
Jatiluhur power plant and is rediverted about 10 km downstream by the
Curug barrage and pumping stations. The West Tarum pumping station, which
supplies the West Tarum system through the West Tarum main canal, has 17
hydraulically-driven pumps with a total capacity of 93 cu m/sec at a
maximum lift of 2 m. water conveyed through the best Thcum main canal is
augmented by run-of-tiver diversions from the Cibeet, Cikarang and Bekasi
rivers by barrages bealAng the same names. The East Tarum pumping
station,which supplies the East Thrum and Cipunegara systems through the
East Tarum main canal, has 6 electrically-driven pumps with a combined
discharge of 91 cu m/sec at a maximum lift of 4 m. Water supply for the
North Tarum system is released to the Citarum downstream of the Curug
barrage through 17 turbines with a S m head. These tutbines drive the 2 m
lift pumps supplying the West Tatum system. Water released through these
turbines is rediverted farther downstream by the Walahar barrage, and is
conveyed to the North Tarum system through the Walahar main canal. Water
supply for the Cipunegata system is diverted from the Cipunegara by the
Salamdarma barrage. This unregulated supply is augmented by water released
from the Jatiluhur reservoir and conveyed through the East Tarum main

canal. All the main and secondarY canals ot the above syStems have been
rehabilitated and upgraded, and tertiary systems were about to be
completed on 25,000 ha of their 200,000 ha service area.
2.07   the Clsedann  drainage area is serVed by the Cisbdana  irrigation
systmo which was completed in 1936 and rehabilitated under Credit 127-IND,
Water supply for this system is diverted by Pasar Baru weir some 2 km
downstream of Tangerang. Apart from the Clodane, other large rivers in
the ptoject area are the Cidurian, Cimanceuri, Cltarab and Mngke. Riveos
whos catchonts lio outside the project area but which traverse the area
before discharging into the Java Sea are the mati/Cipasilian, Cileuleus,
cirarangan and Cilongkok. All these rivers contribute.to the flooding of a
large number of pockets of low-lying land which are distributed over the
42,000 ha service area of the Cisedane irrigation system. These pockets
were  flooded  annualy  because  theic  internal  drainage  systems  here
inadequate  capacitys  existing  control  structure  (flap  gates)  were
inoperatives  drainage  channels  had  been  blocked  or  their  capacities
substantially reduced by brush  dams erected by farmers using drainage
water for irrigations capacities of natural channels/rivers had been
reduced due to silting, weod growth and erection of fish traps, and sea
outfolls of rivers wetr blocked or their dlscharge reduced by sand bars
formed by the littoral drlft.
2.08   The  Jakarta-Tangerang-Secang  h!ghway  provides  access  to  the
Cisdane area. A number of Kabupaten (district) roads connect with this
highway to provide access inside the area. These roaca are in poor
condition and would need rehabilLtation and improvement. Inspection roade
would also be roquLied to facilitate tho maintenance of irrigation and
drainage works and to Lmprove the movement of agcicultural product, inputs
and sorives.

2.12. Consulting Services, were provided by the project to assist the
implementing agencies, with the services of expatriate and local consul-
tants during project implementation. Local consultants were engaged to
prepare detailed designs and construction drawings for 159',000 ha of
tectiary systems in the Jatiluhur area. Expatriate and '.-cal consultants
were employed to prepare conatruction drawings and to supervise construc-



tion of the Cisedane drainage coaponent. The consultants also underlook
socioeconomic surveys of flood-affected areas in Femali-Camal and Sadang;
complets  the  feasibility  styudies  on  internal  drainage  and  river
improvement works in these areas; and prepare detailed designs and
construction drawings for internal drainage works in Sadang and in the
Canal and Padakaton blocks in the Pemali-Comal area, and river improvement
works for the Cisanggarung River. An expatriate was retained to assist the
DGWRD in evaluating its long-term trainingneeds (para. 4.04). Local and
expatriate consultants were engaged to assist in carrying out the tidal
land development stud,es. Local consultants would underlook the socio-
econcuic and soil surveys, prepared soil maps and preliminary engineering
designs for the Lalang, fesuji and Sebangau areas, and produced detailed
designs and construction drawings for the Karaug Agung area. Foreign
consultants reviewed the work of the local consultants and, based on the
data supplied by them, prepared the feasibility studies for the Lalang,
Mesuji and Sebangau areas and updated the feasibility study for the Karang
Agung area. The number of man-moonths required to carry out these services
as well as their estimated costs are presented in table below.

Cost and Pinancing
2.13. The total project coat was estimated at us$ 118.5 million, with a
foreign exchange component of USS 56.3 million (48%). The Bank loan of US3
77.0 million was to finance the full foreign exchange cost plus US$ 20.7
million of local costs. The remaining expenditures were to be met by
annual GO! budgetary allocations.



Procurement
2.14 Vehicles and equipment for constructlon and operation (estimated
cost USS 1.0 million) and major civ_l works for the Tertiary and Drainage
subproject (estimated cost U8S 105 oilion) were to be pcocured after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. All
contracts for vehicles and equipment in excess of USS 100,000 in value
were suboitted to the Bank for review before bidding and avard.
Consultants services w er procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
rmplementation Oraanization
2.15.  Three   separate   organizations   were   responsible   for   project
management.  Since   the  entire  tertiary  subproject  fell  within  the
Jatiluhur Region, it was implemented by the Jatiluhur Authority. The
Cisadane tirainage ccmponent was executed by PROSIDA, a DGWRD executing
body, which is now became Directorate of Irrigation II. This executing
body, also carried out the Plood Control and Drainage Studies.
Tidal Lands Development Studies was executed by P4S (Proyek Pembukaan
Fersawahan Pasang Surut), a special project executive body of DGNRD te
carry out tidal land development.
Benefits
2.16. By providing improved water control, distribution and drainage, the
project would increase crop yields and production on 186,000 ha in
Jatiluhur. The project would directly benefit same 346,000 fanm families
or 1.9 million people; and through the provision of additional employment
opportunities, indirectly benefit same 61,000 landless laborers' families,
or 336,000 people. By Lncreasing dry season irrigation fran 149,000 ha at
present to 167,000 ha (rice only) at full project development, it would
create a demand for an additional 10.7 milUion man-day. of farm labor per
yeatr equivalent to same 45,000 full-time additional jc.hs annually.
Improved drainage in the Cisedane area would eliminate flooding over an
average   5,000  ha  enabling  same  10,000  farmers  to  follow  regular
agricultural practices during the wet season and produce some dry season
crope Paarm labor demand would correspondingly increase by 430,000
man-days per year equivalent to 1,800 full-time johe annully. In addition
improved tranAportation infrastructure needed for construction and 0 & K
of drainage works would substantially benefit the whole Cisedane area



_9_
4n  paCticular agiCUltuCal production  would  X  stimulated  because  of
better supply of inputs and marketing of produce and because extension
staff would be able to work moce effectively. Overall incremental tfam
labor demand in the Cisedane area is estimated at 1.8 million man-days per
year, equivalent to 7,50C full time annual jobe, which would partly
benotit landless population of about 25,000 familes.

Irl. PROJtCT IMPLEMENTATION
Tertiary Development of Jatiluhur Area
3.01. All design work required for developing tertiaries in the project
had been campleted by the end of 1983. At the closing date, 1986, the
construction of tertiaries for about 16S,940 ha had also been ccapleted.
This meant more than two years delay in project complet.on as compared
with appraisal estimate (see Annex table 6).
The delay was mainly due to the extension of project scope, after
transfering 37,600 ha of tertiary works from Irrigation V to the project
and also due to the land acquisation problem. In the tertiary development
no land acquisition funds is provided by the Government the land which was
required for the tertiary canals in the Jatiluhur area was made available
after a series of consultations and agreement with in the members of WUA.
Although same difficulties in the staff housing contract, accoured 252
houses equivalent to 10,882 sq.m, have been succesfully constructed. The
construction standard of houses was generally acceptable, except for same
settlement cracks noted in a few houses. A camparison of Civil Works
Quantities between Appraisal estimate and actual achievement are shown in
table 3.1.
Cisadane Drainage and Road Sub-prolect.
3.02. The entire work of this sub-project was distributed amongst three
single year contacts and three multiyear contracts, one each for Eastern
Block, Central Block and Wbstern Block. Slow pace of land acquisition work
for the Central Block and in adequate management of the contractor have
been the cause of delay on the control block. The land acquisition was
completed in the. end of 1985. A all civil works for the Eastern and
hestern Blocks of the project have already been caupleted. Same drains of
Central Block, i.e. Ciasin and Cikapub drains (about 16 Im) have been
excluded fran the implementation program. This was due to the management s
capacity of the contractor. The project management planned to cauplete it
during the fiscal year 1986/1987, but no budget was provided. The road
sub-project was implemented without any difficulties. A canparison of
Civ3,l Works Quantities between Appraisal estimate and actual achievement
are shown in table 3.1.

Studies and Investigation
3.03. Studies and investigations Included in the project have been
completed. Scope of consultant's work under the project was extended to
include the design for enlargement of West Tarun Canal and designs for
about 85,000 ha of Swmp Reclamation areas of Mesuji, Lalang and Sebangau.
Although audies, investigation and detailed design for flood control in
Sadang Irrigation areas have been completed no further construction
project has been taken up in this area. However the detai led designs at
the Karang Agung, Lalang, Mesuji and sebangau area haveen used in
subsequent construction projects like Swamp Reclamation I & UI projects.
Tarum Canal are being used for the WfC project.
operation and Maintenance
3.04. rn Jatiluhur sea. the maintenance standard of irrigation system in
general and tertiaries in Particular is poor. Hardly 15 of the water user
organization are effective in maintaining the field irrigation system. In
the remaining areas the maintenance is badly neglect'd. Inidence of scour
and erosion downstream of distribution boxes is camon. Their walls have
been broken and gates removed by same of the water users. Maintenance of
cnals other than tertiaries is also subnomal. The general consensus was
that the maintenance budget of the canal structures and the canal
inspection roads was inadequate. rn fact considering the volume of traffic
on the canal inspection roads quite s few of them need to be raised to
Kabupaten or Provincial level road.
3.05. Starting from the fiscal year 1985/1986 onward Operation and
Maintenance funding for Jatiluhur Authority area will be receiving
contributions on an increasing scale from land revenues was used for
(IPEDA), power and vater supply sale to Jakarta.
3.06. Rp. 6,171 million is provided by the Jatiluhur Authority, for the
Operation  and Maintenance  budget in  this  1986/1987  fiscal years.  The
budget is collected by the Authority from
*le¢tricity       -      Rp. 4,676,227,059
vater supply      -      Rp. 1,304,718,880
1 P 3 D A        -       R.   130,000.000
T o t a 1  RV. 6,170,945,939



- 13 -
This is due to the mobiLzation 0 a N funds of about Rp. 25,000,-/ha
mostly fron  users charges  (hydro -power, N B I water supply, and  land
tax). Revenues 'of hydro-power and N & I water supply were directly
collected by the Authority while lInd tax was collected as tax revenue and
a small percentage allocated to the Authority to support its irrigation o
& M expenditures. At present, this 2% sharing rate is considered too low,
and the government has scheduled to review and increase this rate as
required in 1988.
3.07.  Cisadane Drainae. Upon completion of the drainage and roads works
0 & N remains the responsibility of PROSIDA for one year, before the West
Java PRIS takes ovsr the 0 & N of the main and internal drains and their
embankments and the Kabupaten (Districs) takes over the district and
village roads in the project area. So far these transfers have not taken
place. As the major portion of the drainage works have only recently been
completed, most of the systess are still operating satisfactory. However
this is not expected to last for long, because of siltation problems. The
responsible agencies need to plan and devote considerable efforts to
develop cost effective methods and work cycles for desilting and reshaping
of the drains as well as for routine inspection.
This needs to be followed by providing suitable equipment, making proper
organizational arrangements and by allocating sufficient staff and funds
to ensure proper 0 & N of the drainage facliUties built under the project
in the year to ccme.
Pro1ect Cost and Disbursement
3.08. Estimate and actual project costs and disbursement schedule are
shown in, Annex tables 1 and 2. The total project cost estimated at
appraisal was 8 118.5 milUion equivalent as compared with S 100.S million
at completion. The project's 15% cost underrun was mainly due to
devaluation of rupiah and liberal allowance of Physical contingencies and
Expected price increased which was provided in the appraisal cost estimate.
Actual disburaements are 24 months behind schedule because of the delay
during project implementation as stated in the previous chapter.
Consulting Service 8
3.09.  The   total  amount  of  Consulting   Services   for   Studies   and
Investigation at project campletion is about US$ 12,400,000 compared with
UsS 16,700,000 at appraisal (see Annex table 3).

IV AGRICULTURAL I PACT
4.Oi. soth project were subtantially completed by the extended closing
date, march 1966. but its impact on agricultural performance started in
1981/1982 when the works were partially campleted.
Projected yields and cropped areas vith and without the project are based
on crop production records kept for the crop intensitification program
(BDIAS) and by the Jatiluhur Authority and Cisadane Project offices. The
net irrigation  XIX  area in  Ja:iluhur wa  reduced  fran  186,000  ha  as
estimated at appraisal to o6S,940 ha at completion due to unsuitable
topographic and soil coneition in upper Jatiluhur area, while Cisadane
atea reducoed fr£m 42,000 ha to 36,165 due to the conversion of land for
housing, industry and for the new airport in Cengkareng.
Service area, cropping pattern and intensity
4.02.  The service area under Jatiluhur Authority is  about 297,500 ha.
Jatiluhur service  area  is  divided  into  3  Irrigation  Region  (ktlayah
FengaiL.an * WP), namely the West WP of about 58,200 ha, Central WP of
about 106,S00 ha and the East WP of about 132,800 ha. This area covers 5
Kabupatens in  west Java and DRI Jakarta. (see Table 4.1). This area is
subject to changes dOe to the land development fra uniLtrigated (rainfed)
to irrlgated and frcu sawah to construction land for industrial and
housing purpose. For example the changes in 1982 were a
(a) in West WP      - minus 1,146 ha
(b) in Central WP  -  plus  6,299 ha
(c) in East VP      - minus   218 ha
total      -  plus  4,935 ha
4.03.  The construction of the tertiary system in Jatiluhur area has been
funded through several projects namely Cr. 514-IND, Loan 1268-IND Loan
1645 IND, and GO! fund. Construction of about 1935 tertiary blocks had
been cmpleted as of September 1986, as follow.t

formed, and standard training and visit system ( T a V system) wcre
satisfactoCity implemented. Seed and other inputs are easily available in
the kiosi a The main problem in Jatiluhur acea was to accange the same
planting time for a whole block, l.e. because some of the land owners were
not pcesent in the meeting and also due to the shoctage of labours.
4,09. in Cisadane area, there are 6 Rucal extension Centers (RECs) with
60 PRLs  in Thngerang District, one ReC with 2 PRL in DKI Jakarta and
Serang District has one REC and 2 PV..
During off - s*ason, i.e. after heavy work of land prepatations and
planting has been completed in the field, many farmecs proceed on off -
facm jobs and the field visit by PLs is usually not effective. In this
case, planning for the coming season wete caroied out, during evening
visit by the PRP to the farmers in their domicile.



V. 8CONONC RE-EVALUATION AND BENPFITS
5.01. At appralsal the Jatiluhur Thrtiary pcoject was justified by an
expected annual Incremental productLon of 328,600 tons of paddy and 32,000
tons of secondary crops from annual productlon of 1,127,400 ton of paddy
and 15,000 tons of secondary crops. While the Cisadane draLnage and road
subproject was justifLed by an expected annual Incremental production of
30,200 ton of paddy from annual production of 10,000 tons of paddy.
These Lncremental lead to Lnctrased small farmer lncomes; foreign exchange
savings, and a satLifactory economic cate of return. Table 5.1 and Table
5.2 summarize the *oclo - economic benefits estimated at appraisal
compared to the projected results at completion.
Basic Asumptions
5.02. Both costs and benefits are expressed ln constant 1985 prices.
Domestic and internatLonal price indlces (Annex table 8) were used to
adjust prices over time. Projections of future tradable commodity prices
have been based on the Bank's projectLons adjusted for transportation,
processLng, and handling cost::. A conversion factor of 0.9 has been
adopted to convert financial project costs to economic costs.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
5.03.  The estLmatse ERR for Jatiluhur is about 42t compared with 52%  at
appraisal. This accresse is due malnly to the cost overrun and a lower
total land coverage. Por CLsedane drainage the estimated ERR is about 18%
compared with 16% at appraisal. ThLi  increased li  du  mainly to the higher
incremental of paddy production.

Pro ict Executing Auonates
6.01.  Jatiluhur  Authority.  As  an  experienced  executing  agency  tor
Sank-*ssisted project, the Ahthority's performance in constructlon of the
tertiary subproject was satitfactory, although a 30 months delay occurced.
A good progress- has been made by the Authority In providing budget for
maintenance of tho irrigation system under its jucisdlction (about 300,000
ha). The budget was taken from inctresing the power tariff and incteasing
shate of the land tax in West Java Province.
6.02. Directorate of Irrication It. This now Directorate, within the
DGWRD, is accomodating several pojoects and used to work for B..nk-
assisted project, such as eOSIDAh The Clsadane drainage sub-project was
formely executed by Prosida. The Directorate perfotmance was satisfactory,
although a 27 months delay occurred.
6.03.  P4S. Ab an experienced executing agency for Bank-assisted project,
also performing satisfactory in carrying out the studies, for future Tidal
Lands Development.
Natee Users Asociations
6.04. The perf3rmance of water user's associations (WUA) in Indonesia was
discussed in some detail ln the PCR for the lrrigation VIS  Project (Ln.
1268-IND) and the Bank's Overview to that PCR. As summarized in the PCR
for  the  ICrigation  VII  Ptoject,  the  main  reasons  for  wUA's  poor
performance are : (a) in adequate attention paid by the local government
officials# (b) inadequate consultation with famerts during planning and
construction stages; (c) poor leaderchip and management of WUAa and (d)
sharecroppers with little interest in participating. These re&aons are by
and large also applicable to the plain area of Irrcigation Xlt project. In
the hilly ar*e of (Subang D'.strict) Irrigation Xlt pcoject, the WUA8
performing better, and one of the reason is the importance of countour
tertiary channel which should always in a better shape, if tho farmers
don't want to loose the water.



-22-
6.0S. Since the estabiusuaont of the WUAs t a pre-requisite for the
construction/developmunt  of  the  tertlary  systems  the  numberof  WuAs
established should be as sore as tertiary blocks, but as the case with
other areas, only about 201 were active in Jatiluhur areas and about iO0
in Cisadane areas.
Cost Recov*rv
6.06. The KR' for the terigation Vrr Project dealt In some detail with
the Issue of icrigation coat recovory. The conclusions ceached in that
discussion apply to most of the Bank-assisted irrigation projects in
Indonesia, including this project. However, coat recovery in the Jatiluhur
area ace improving under tho Sank-assisted West Thrum Canal improvement
peolect  (Ln.  2S60-IND)  through  the  reformulation  of  I RDA  rates  and
improved !PEDA collectlin. (See SAQe, WTC, iedung Ombo, Central and West

VIT NRVOR4ANCE o01 BORROWER AND aANK
Pertormanc  of the Dotrovwr
7.01.  The Borrower (WoI) was suppoCtive of the project and has generally
complied with the loan covenants. However, difficulties were encountered
in the following areas s
(a)    submission of audited financial statements  was  generally
late by about 12 month tLoan Agreement, Section 4.02). In
view of existing accounting procedures and efticiency, it
would be difficult for PW to comply with this covenant.
Technical assistance to improve the Authocity's accountinq
system and a longer submission period should be considered
by the Bank for futucr  projectut
(b)    adequate 0 a M funds adjusted to keep pace with inflation
and  annual  needs  were  not  provided  to  Bank-assisted
cirigation  systems  (Loan  Agreement),  due mainly  to  02's
financial constraintst
(c)    collection of adjusted INDA trom beneficiaries to ensure
sound 0 & N practices and to recover a reasonable portion of
the capital costs was not cartied out. However, the cost
recovery issue is being addressed under three recent Bank-
assisted irrigation projects (paca. 6.0S),
(d)    submission of the PO was delayed by about 2 months. This is
due mainly to the limited capacity in DPP/DGWRD to prepace
such reports, however this in better than last PCR report.
Performance of the Bank
7.02.  Project  pocaLsAj. Bank appraisal of the project was comprehensive
and addrossed important issues relating to project management, 0 s H, cost
recovory, agricultural supporting services, WUAs, civil works under'
consultants contsact, and benefit monitoring
7.03. Prolect Su ervision. The Bank's supervision missions were fielded
regularly and maintained a harmonius relationship with the implementing
agencies. During the project period, seven Bank supervision missions
visited the project area.

VIII SUMMARY. CONCLUSrON MND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01. The project, which was approved by the Board in December 1978,
consisted of (a) tertiary development on the remaining 186,000 ha of the
Jatiluhur Irrigation System in West Java, which was newly rehabilitated
under  the  Bank  - assisted  Irrigation  rr  project  (Cr.  195-2ND)s  (b)
improvement of flood control, drainage and road networks in the 42,000 ha
Cisadane irrigation system also in Wst Java, which was rehabilitated
under Irrigation I (Credit 127-IND); and (t) studies for future projects
of flood control, drainage and tidal swamp development. Total proJect
costs were S 118.5 million with a Bank loan of S 77 million. The major
objective of the project was to improve food production, mainly rAce,
through these project works which could be considered as a follow-up phase
of previous Bank- assisted irrigation projects. At appraisal, it was
envisaged that sane 360,000 tons of incremental paddy would be produced
annually and about 2.2 million rural people, mostly small farmers, would
benefit from the project.
8.02. The project has been generally successfully completed and has
achieved its main objective of increasing paddy production. Implementation
by the Jatiluhur Authority for the tertiary subproject and DGWRD for the
drainage subproject was satifactory although the project suffered about
two yearss delay in completion for both these two subprojects. This is
mainly because of dlfficulties encountered ln land acquisition, and the
limited capacity of a major local contractor for the drainage subproject,
and the extension of the project and difficulties in staff housing
contract for the tertiary subproject. All studies unter the project have
been satisfactorily completed.
A 15S project cost underrun was mainly because of devaluation of Rupiah
and liberal allowance of pbysical and price contingencies (J 22.4 million)
provided at appraisal. The recalculated economic rates of return (ERR) are
42% for the tertiary subproject (52% at appraisal) and 18% for the
drainage subproject (16% at appraisal) which are highly satisfactory.
However, Operation and Maintenance (01  M) of these project were less than



.i  2.5  '
satisfactory and raised concern. 0 6 N of tertiary works, which to the
cesponsibLUty of the Whter Users Association (WUA) were gneorally
inadequate, and only about 15t of those WUAr was operating effectively.
DCWRD which is responsible for O 6 K of the arainage sub project during
construction and one yeac after caupletion, has insufficient budget for an
adequate maintenance. Although the system is new and no significant
damages have occured so far, this situatimn can not last long particularly
when the 0 & K responsibility will be soon shifting to the I%st Java
province.
8.03. The major lessons learned and points of interest under the project,
are as follows t
(a) Perfomance of local water users associations must be upgraded
durLng and after the project implementatlon to sustain potential
benefits of tertiary systems
(b) Provincial 0 & M resources must be strengthen in general, and
smooth transferring of 0 * K responsibiUties frcm DGWRO to the
provincial government for each completed project should be ensured
ln particulars
(c)  Jatiluhur  Authority's  current  0  6  K  funding  artrangement  is
encouraging as it has obtained considerable 0 6 M funds (about
Rp 20,000 /ha) frtm local governnent land tax revenues (IPEDA), and
lts own revenues frac electrieity and munLclpal water supply. (See
also para 3.06).

Mr. GRAHAM DONALDSON,
Chief Agriculture, Infrastructure
and Human Resources Division Ope-
rations  Evaluation   Department
IBRO 1818 H. Street N.W. Washing-
ton D.C. 20433 U.S.A.
Refer to your letter dated February 18, 1988 about Project Comp-
letion Report on the Indonesia Irrigation XII Project, I would like
to inform you as follows :
1. We have no comment on the Project Completion Report prepared by
Directorate General of Water Resources Development because of the
report only consisting of comparation between Project Appraisal
Report and project achievement.
2. But I am forwading small comment on Bank Overview of the Project
Completion Report Specifically about item 3.3 as follows :
a. Bank Comment on the PCR point 3.3 mention that there are seven
reasons for poor performance of the WUAs, and also mention that
major reasons were identified during the Bank overview of PCR
for Irrigation VII.
My comment is that the major reasons which were identified for
Irrigation VII is not valid for Irrigation XII before
scrutinizing Irrigation XII itself.
b. Several  WUAs in Indonesia had been established traditionally
long time ago for instance Subak in Bali, which could be said
running properly.
But the other just established WUAs ftill has several problems
such  as  lack  of  i.aterest,  lack  of  participation,  lack  of
appropriate regulation, poor experience, poor leadership e.t.c.
Due to such situation we need quite same time to improve the
performance of WUAs.
c. Inadequate.......

c. Inadequate attention paid by local government officials and
village head to the training and functioning of the WUAs as
identified during the Bank overview of PCR for Irrigation VII,
it might be because of other reason such as poor performance
of training, lack of involvement of any functional agency of
local government, lack of approach to local government, e.t.c.
That are my comment and thank you very much for your at-
tention.
With kind regard.

Sibero.

Administration and Regional
