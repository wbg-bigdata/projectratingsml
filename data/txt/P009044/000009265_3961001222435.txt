MMORANDUh AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNTIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED WAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOA l AGRLTURA  RESEAM  PR-OJECT
1.       I submit for your approval following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey for US$ 55 million equivalent.  The
proposed loan would have a term of 17 years, including a five-year grace period,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance an
Agricultural Research Project.
2.       Backgrgund. Turkish agriculture's share of total CDP has declined from
34X in 1965 to about 16X in 1990, due mainly to rapid industrialization. Never-
theless, agriculture still generates directly over 202 of export earnings while
providing about 501 of civilian employment. Industries based upon agricultural
raw-materials provide an additional 50X of Turkey's exports. Turkey is one of
the few countries in the Middle East which is virtually self-sufficient in food
production. Nevertheless, while official statistics show agricultural GDP growth
keeping pace with population growth, opportunities to increase income and exports
of the sector have not been fully exploited. In addition, crop yield growth
rates are declining.  Such continued declines could clearly affect Turkey's
competitiveness in various agricultural products. In addition, recent large
scale irrigation investments need to be complemented by development of
appropriate cropping patterns and technologies for these regions, in order to get
full benefit from the physical investments.   Finally, a serious cause of
declining growth in productivity has been inappropriate practices which are
degrading Turkey's agricultural resource base.   Agricultural research is
essential in formulating sustainable solutions for reversing the decline in crop
yield growth rates and land degradation through new technologies for increasing
quantity and quality of produce to improve.farmers income. It becomes particu-
larly urgent if Turkey 'La to maintain competitiveness with other countries in its
exports to Middle Eastern countries and to the EC as well as providing for its
growing population. Yet, at present, only about 0.2X of agricultural GDP is
invested in agricultural research, far below countries of similar levels of
development.
3.       While the agricultural research system showed good results in the 1960s
and 1970s, the system deteriorated badly thereafter. Research staff morale and
performance were also severely weakened by organizational changes in the research
system, inadequate funding of operational expenditures, frequent staff transfers,
and non-adherence to research staff career regulations.  The Government has
recognized the problem and has taken initial steps to improve the situation.
This has included the decision in August 1991 to consolidate agricultural
research into a new General Directorate of Agricultural Research (GDAR) with
responsibility for providing effective planning, programming, budgeting,
coordination and monitoring of research.   The Government request for Bank
assistance in the preparation and financing of an agricultural research project
represents part of an overall Government effort to restore and strengthen the
agricultural research system as an important part of its overall strategy for
improving agricultural productivity and raising farm income levels.



4.       Although the Bank has played an active role in supporting agricultural
extension activities in Turkey for many years, the Bank's6 involvement in
agricultural research has been limited to small components for adaptive research
in support of extension activities, primarily under the 1984 Agricultural
Extension and Applied Research Project (AEARP), and the 1990 AEARP-II. These
projects introduce improved extension methods and extension/research linkages in
s  a^rate pruject areas, each covering about 25% of Turkey's provinces. AEARP was
delayed by a major reorganization in the former Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Rural Affairs which severely disrupted proje:t start-up. Thereafter, good
progress was shown during the 1986-89 period, and In many parts of the project
area the effect of improved extension activities on farmers practices is evident.
Progress slowed, however, due to constrained budgetary resources in 1990 and
1991. The reduced budgetary resources has also affected AEARP-II, but a start
has now been made with the hiring of consultants and the procurement of vehicles.
5.       Ratlonale for Bank Involvement.  The project forms an integral part of
the Bank's sector development strategy which includes, inter ali, supporting
institutional reform and particularly technical support services of research and
extension. This strategy has been initiated by the two extension projects since
1984 with assistance to research limited to backstopping support to provide
training to extensionists in the project provinces, and significant progress has
been made in improving farmer-extension-research links. However, little has been
done to date to resolve other problems affecting the research service.  At
present, the service is inadequate to the task ahead with many of the existing
professional research staff having little training in research methodology. The
Bank is currently the only agency giving significant assistance in improving
agricultural technical services. This proposed project would be supportive of
other Bank activities for poverty alYeviation and environmental improvement.
6.       Protect Ob iecives.  The proposed project would assist the Government
in strengthening its agricultural research programs to upgrade the system's
ability to develop improved technology, and to provide recommendations to be
transferred through the extension service to farmers so as to achieve increased
agricultural production and farmer incomes. It would concentrate on strengthening
agricultural research programs of relevance to the less developed regions of
eastern and southeastern Turkey, which would contribute to poverty reduction, and
also include a few research programs of high priority on a nationwide basis.
Furthermore, the project would focus on natural resources development
(agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries), and contribute to food
production and to more sustainable agricultural methods. The project would also
strengthen institutional capacity for research coordination, monitoring and
evaluation, and for agricultural economic and policy analysis, and therefore, it
would contribute to improved efficiency and effectiveness of the Government's
agricultural research activities.
7.       Project Description.  The largest component of the proposed project
would consist of investments to strengthen selected research programs of
importance to eastern and southeastern Turkey in crops, livestock, irrigation and
drainage, forestry and, where feasible, contract research at cooperating Turkish
universities. This would include research institutes in these regions and lead
institutes in other parts of Turkey. The project would also strengthen priority



national resbArch programs on erosion control and soil conservation,  soil
fertility, integrated pest management, pesticide residue control, and farming
systems research.   A major emphasis of the project would be strengthening
institutional capacity for research programming, planning, budgeting, monitoring
and evaluation.   This would include institutionalizing a system within the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) for preparation of long-term
research master plans, which would be updated annually, and the establishment of
a research management information system.   The project would also support
establishment of an Agricultural Economic Research Institute (AERI) to provide
answers to government decision makers on agricultural policies affecting land,
marketing and export matters impinging on farmers' incomes and as guidance to
*        researchers on crop, livestock and forestry research programs.  In addition, the
project would include a small component for strengthening MARA's capacity for
testing food products for compliance with pesticide and hormone residue
regulations.  The project is expected to be executed over a period of seven
years.  The project would incltude: civil works consisting of laboratories,
offices, workshops, and staff housing (281 of project costs); laboratory and
field equipment (15X); vehicles (71); training locally and abroad (26X);
technical assistance (101); office equipment and library sad information services
(61), and incremental operating costs (8X).  The latter small component is
included as it covers expenses (spare parts and fuel), which are critical for
carrying out the research programs.
8.       The project has an estimated total cost of US$ 77.6 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 55.0 million (701). The proposed Bank
loan of US$ 55 million would finance about 701 of project costs. Schedule A
shows a breakdown of costs and the financing plan, while Schedule B shows amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations ln
Turkey are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 9890-TU) dated April 9, 1992, is being distributed separately.
9.       Project Inlementation.  The implementation of the project would be
coordinated by GDAR, except for forestry components which would be coordinated
by the Ministry of Forestry (MOF) Research, Planning, and Coordination Bureau
(APK). Specific research programs under the project would be carried out at 18
research institutes and substations within GDAR, and two forestry research
institutes and substations within MOF.
o        10.      Project Sustainability. Recent Government action to create GDAR within
MARA is an indication of the Government's increased emphasis on the importance
of agricultural research. The long-term research master plan and other research
institutional development under the project would be expected to strengthen
project sust4inability. The Government has agreed at negotiations to maintain
adequate operational financing after project completion.
11.      Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement.  While limited Bank
funds have been made available for agricultural research, primarily in connection
with programs for strengthening extension services, this project would be the
first to aim specifically at improving agricultural research. Bank experience
under extension operations in Turkey supports the need to have a flow of improved



-4-
technology packages developed by research to enable extension to impact
effectively on farmers' productivity and incomes. Experience with these projects
also indicates that having research staff regularly involved in training
extension officials, and subjected to their questions, is an effective device for
making research more relevant to farmers problems and for accelerating the
dissemination of research findings. Finally, it is clear that a stable research
environment and ministerial management committed to the importance of research
are essential prerequisites for effective research efforts.
12.      Agreed Actions.   At negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government on the following: (a) an indicative plan and schedule for
strengthening GDAR headquarters to enable it to uniertake responsibility for
coordination of all MARA research, including planning, programming, budgeting,
monitoring and evaluation and for strengthening staffing of APK of MOF to enable
it to undertake similar responsibilities fo- forestry research; (b) the
preparation of an annually updated 13-year Master Research Plan (under an agreed
sch-dule and TOR) with the initial master plan completed by October 31, 1994; (c)
establishment of an Agricultural Economics Research Institute no later than
October 31, 1993; (d) arrangements would be made no later than April 30, 1993 for
provision of 1,000 ha of land for pasture research in Erzurum; (e) the terms of
reference for, and the establishment by no later than April 30, 1993 of, four new
farming systems research teams in the regional research institutes in Diyarbakir,
Erzurum, and Eskisehir, and the GDRS research institute in Sanliurfa; (f)
engagement of internationally recruited consultants with qualifications
acceptable to the Bank to assist in administering the training program abroad,
strengthening of GDAR's research capabilities in the areas outlined in (a) above;
initiating farming systems research; the establishment of the AERI; and assisting
the various research programs as required by April 30, 1993; (g) preparation by
MARA and MOF assisted by consultants of research effectiveness assessments not
later than April 30, 1995 and October 31, 1997, in accordance with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, and discussion with the Bank of the findings
and implications of the report and of implementation experience in terms of
Jesirable adjustments in the project; (h) reactivation of the national commodity
research program approach and commencement of biannual reviews of each MARA
research institution and measures for strengthening research/farmer links; and
(i) renewed implementation of research staff career structure regulations.
13.      Environmental AsRects. Environmental benefits can be expected from the
forestry, soil conservation, soil fertility research programs and two plant
protection programs of integrated pest management and residue control.  The
forestry and soil conservation program will help to maintain and/or improve the
natural resource base. The soil fertility and the integrated pest management
programs will develop technology to reduce inputs of fertilizer and pesticides.
The residue research and control programs would contribute to redu:ing such
incidence.
14.      Program Objective Categories. By focussing on the impoverished East and
Southeast of the country, where incomes are one-third of the national average,
the project would contribute to improve incomes through strengthening research
programs of relevance to agriculture in Turkey's least developed regions.



5 -
15.      hen2glUa.   To remain competitive and to develop new markets and
products, Turkish agriculture must become more efficient, both in the modern and
traditional smallholder subsectors. The proposed research project is needed to
prov_de a means for developing and testing a continuing stream of improved
agricultural practices, without which the continuing investment and recurrent
costs of extension would not be justified. The project would assist to develop
more sustainable agricultural practices. Concentrating on research benefitting
the less developed regions is justified for social/ec, '.,y reasons and because of
large irrigation investments currently underway in these areas. However, much
of the research undertaken would be expected to provide benefits throughout
Turk-ey. Programs to improve research planning, budgeting, and monitoring would
increase the efficiency of the system and its responsiveness to farmer require-
ments. The new AERI would provide policymakers with information on the costs and
benefits of various policy options, as well as improved information on agricul-
tural investment priorities, trade opportunities, and human resource issues in
rural areas.
16.      Risks.   The main project risks are:  (i) insufficient funding by
Government in the face of budget constraints; and (ii) inadequate control of
research coordination and management of priorities leading to inefficient
research or new technologies inadequately adapted for farmer requirements. The
first risk was addressed by reducing the project size in line with Government
estimates of financing capacity. The second risk is being addressed by project
supported efforts to improve research planning and budgeting systems, and
research/extension/farmer links.   The recent decision to create GDAR is an
indic.tion of the Government's increased commitment to the importance of
strengthening agricultural  research.    Finally,  two research  and project
effectiveness assessments provide opportunities. for making any required
adjustments based upon implementation experience.
17.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
