WEST TARUM CANAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Indonesia
Amount:           $43.4 million
Terms:            Repayable in 20 years, including 5 years grace, at the stan-
dard variable rate.
Project
Description:   The main objectives of the proposed project, which will serve
the agriculture and urban sectors, is to increase rural
incomes and food production through larger irrigation
supplies, and to improve Jakarta's urban living conditions
through increased and improved raw water supply. Towards
these objectives, the proposed project includes (a) improve-
ment of the West Tarum Canal (WTC), its major structures; (b)
the construction of a pipeline from the canal to the
Pulogadung treatment plant; (c) strengthening the operational
and maintenance capacity and financial condition of the
Jatiluhur Authority; (d) technical assistance for
construction supervision design, land mapping for
reclassification and reassessment of taxation, protection of
raw water and improvement of safety measures at the Jatiluhur
Dam. Agricultural beneficiaries will include mostly small
holders, with incomes below absolute poverty, in about 67,000
ha at West Tarum, in West Java, while urban beneficiaries
will be Jakarta's residents whose highly inadequate water
supply will benefit from more and better raw water. To
improve traditionally inadequate O&M funding, the project
provides, on a pilot basis and for the first time in
Indonesia, for increased cost sharing by beneficiaries in
both sectors. Urban beneficiaries through direct water
charges will pay the entire cost of supplying raw water while
irrigation beneficiaries will pay part of recurrent costs
through properly channeled, appropriate, land taxes. While
these arrangements should ensure adequate O&M funding, and
hence satisfactory operation and maintenance of the improved
canal, there is some risk in terms of delays in putting them
into place, and consequently of inadequate funding or below-
standard O&M. However, Government has already indicated
readiness, to increase land taxes, to assign priority in the
use of a portion of these taxes for O&M, and to supplement
such funds, as required, for adequate O&M. Also Jakarta's
Municipal Water Utility has agreed to pay its share of O&M
and capital costs.

r. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank assistance for
the multipurpose West Tarum Canal rmprovement Project which will enhance irri-
gation and urban raw water supply and consists of (a) improvement of the West
Tarum Canal (WTC) to provide more water for irrigation of about 67,000 ha in
the West Tarum area, and for more raw water to the City of Jakarta; (b)
construction of a 7.5 kmn water supply pipeline to connect the WTC and
Jakarta's Pulogadung water treatment plant; (c) strengthening the operacional
and maintenance capacity and financial condition of the Jatiluhur Authority
(POJ), the agency responsible for operation and maintenance of project works;
and (d) technical assistance for management and supervision of construccion,
studies of future developmencs, land mapping for reclassification for tazation
purposes and strengthening of tax inspection offices, protection of raw water
resources, and improvement of safety measures at the Jatiluhur Dam.
1.02      The West Tarum Canal, one of Jatiluhur's main conveyance canals, was
built in the 1960s to convey irrigation supplies to the West Tarum area and to
augment Jakarta's raw water suppLy. As demands for its water were only gradu-
ally built up, it did not carry the full discharge it was designed for. With
water demands nearly fully developed, the full discharge will be needed and
structural and maintenance improvements are required to enable the WTC to
convey it (para 2.05). Improvements, to be implemented under the proposed
project will facilitate meeting peak irrigation requirements of the entire
service area and Jakarta's raw water demands till the late 1990s when
additional conveyance facilities will import water from neighboring river
basins. The project was identified by Bank and FAO/CP missions in 1980,
prepared by the Directorate Gereral of Water Resources Development (DCWRD),
and POJ and their consultants between 1981 and 1984 with Bank assistance under
Irrigation Project XV (Cr. 995-IND) and appraised by the Bank in September
1984. The project has a high priority in COI's water supply and irrigation
development plans. It should be supported by the Bank as it addresses highly
important sectoral issues and fits into long-term development strategies in
the agricultural and water supply sectors. The project will increase food
production and rural incomes, improve the use of land and water resources,
provide additional, and better raw water to Jakarta, strengthen institutions,
expand the dialogue with COI on cost recovery, and improve public health and
operation and maintenance (O&M).
Sector Background
1.03      Agricultural and Rural Sector.  Covernment's major objectives for
the agricultural and rural sectors are to: (a) create productive employment
to raise incomes of the rural poor; (b) increase domestic food supply to keep
pace with rising demand; (c) expand agricultural exports, particularly of
smallholder tree crops; and (d) ensure productive, sustainable use of
Indonesia's land, water and other resources. Irrigation improvements and a
shift to high yielding rice varieties, supported by fertilizers, almost
doubled rice production during the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1983, paddy pro-
duction increased from 13 million tons to 23 million tons, 90X of it from
irrigated areas, which made Indonesia nearly self-sufficient in its major food



commodity. However. to maintain this position and offset growing demand
throughout the remainder of this decade, GOI pLans to invest an average of
about S800 million a year. or about 8% of the development budget, upgrading
and expanding irrigation systems and swamp developments.
1.04      Bank Role and Support Strategy for Irrigation.  Since 1968, the Bank
has provided $1,018 miilion for irrigation projects in Indonesia. The
earliest Bank-supported projects were designed to repair major systems to
quickly increase rice outDut. Later projects provided additional rehabilita-
tion of existing syscems, drainage, flood protection, and tertiary networks.
The most recent projeccs include measures to strengthen planning, programming,
and budgeting capacity and managemenc information systems (Irrigation XV -
Cr. 995 and XVI - Ln. 2113). and co build up the capacity of provincial irri-
gation services in East Java Province (Irrigstion XVII - Ln. 2119), and in
eight other provinces (Second Provincial irrigation Development - Ln. 2375).
During GOI's Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita IV, 1984-89), the
Bank's involvement in the sector will emphasize institution building and
address persistent sectorwide problems, such as operation and maintenance
standards and cost recovery. Lending will focus on:
(a)  strengthening of national and provincial irrigation servi..es, and
improving their operation and maintenance performance; and
(b)  a number of technically complex projects or projects which present
difficult economic choices or in which Bank participation can mobi-
lize significant cofinancing. Such projects include the West Tarum
Canal, the Jatigede Multipurpose Dam Project, and the Kedung Ombo
Multipurpose Dam Project.
1.05      The first five Bank-assisted irrigation projects have been1yomple-
ted. Project Performance Audits have been issued for four projects,- and a
follow-up ImpasF Evaluation Report is available for the first project
(Cr. 127-IND).=   ImpLementation delays and cost overruns, comnon to the five
projects, were caused by protracted bureaucratic procurement procedures,
shortages of local funds, higher than expected inflation, design deficiencies
and slow contractor performance. However, since cost increases were more than
offset by higher rice prices, economic rates of return are expected to exceed
40Z. The performance audit highlighted the need to improve operation, mainte-
nance and replacement services (OM&R); provide technical and administrative
support to water user associations; and promote efficient water use. These
problems are recognized in the strategy adopted for Bank assistance.
1.06      Water Supply Sector.  Public urban and rural water supply systems
are relatively undeveloped in Indonesia, and serve only a small part of the
population. About 40Z of the urban and 18% of the rural population had direct

access to piped warer supply in 1981. The remainder obtains drinking water
from vendors, from shallow wells or rivers, at considerable health risk. The
Government's major objectives for the water supply sector are:
(a)  Physical.  The provision of basic water supply, sewerage and sarita-
tion facilities, in accordance with technology appropriate to the
Local situation, cost-effectively, and with emphasis on the needs of
low-income groups;
(b)  Institucional.  The development of new, and the xcrengthening of
existing. central and local institutions - including water supply
and sewerage public utilities - to improve their ability in
planning, implementing and delivering basic services; and
(c) FinanciaL. The creation of financially viable public utilities,
which can provide services at affordable tariff levels and with a
tariff structure which allows recovery of operation, maintenance,
and an appropriate portion of capital costs.
1.07      In 1981/82 the Government invested about Rp 65 billion (about $104
million) in water supply and sanitation projects, amounting to about 1% of the
development budget. During the last ten years, multilateral finance agencies
and bilateral aid donors have provided Indonesia with about $300 million
equivalent in capital and technicaL assistance reLated to this sector. During
this period, through a systematic approach based on limited levels of service
and simple, standardized technology together with bulk procurement and decen-
tralized implementation arrangements, COI has evoLved a substantial, low-cost
investment program, which focussed on lower income groups and served a wide
range of communities. Government has also paid attention to strengthening
water supply authorities in order to improve operational efficiency and
achieve adequate cost recovery and better implementation performance. Now,
%.nder the impetus of the International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade
(1980-90), cOI aims to scep up its earlier efforts and to significantly
improve the level of access to safe water. Under Repelita IV, service targets
for 1990 have been set ac 701 of the urban population and 55% of the rural
population, at an average basic needs level (60 liters/capita/day (llc/d)
minimum).
1.08      Bank Role and Support Strategy for Water Supply.  The Bank's overall
objectives and strategies for the sector are consistrt with those of Govern-
ment. As of end 1984, the Bank had made four loans - for the sector. In
addition, substantial complementary investments in water supply and sanitation
have been supported by five Bank loans for the urban sector. Through the
Second Urban Development Project (Ln. 1336-IND) the Bank has had a significant
involvement in the formulation of a comprehensive development strategy for the
3/   First Water Supply Project (Ln. 1049-IND, 1975), Second Water Supply
Project (Ln. 1709-IND, 1979), the Jakarta Sewerage and Sanitation Project
(Ln. 2236-IND, 1983), and the First East Java Water Supply Project
(Ln. 2275-IND, 1983).

Jakarta Metropolitan Area through the Jakarta Metropolitan Development Plan
(JMDP). completed in 1981. Detailed studies of municipal and industrial water
demands and improvement and expansion of Jakarta's wacer supply systems are
currently in progress as part of the Jakarta Sewerage and Sanitation Project
(JSSP). wich parallel Japanese Government assistance. A follow-up project is
also being prepared to rehabilitace Jakarta's existing water supply and
upgrade its institutional framework.
II. THE PROJECT AREA AND PROJECT FORMULATION
A. The Project Area
2.01      The project area consists of two parts:  the agricultural service
area of the West Tarum Canal (the West Tarum area) And the metropolitan area
of Jakarta.  The first part will benefit from increased irrigation supplies
while the second part will benefit from increased raw water supplies.
The West Tarum Area
2.02      West Tarum. one of Java's most fertile, rice producing areas, forms
the western section of the 240,002 ha Jatiluhur irrigation project area.  It
covers a gross area of 87,000 ha,- or a net area of 67,000 ha, most of it in
the Bekasi District.  It is bounded on the wez.t by Jakarta, on the north by
the coast, on the east by the Citarum River and on the south by the West Tarum
Canal. About 2 million people currentLy live in the West Tarum area, mostly
engaged in agriculture.  There are two large towns, Bekasi and Cikarang, and a
number of smaller towns. Good internal road and rail connections facilitate
year-round mobility within the area as well as access to main population and
commercial centers.  Due to its proximity to Jakarta's markets, the area has a
comparative advantage in growing a variety of crops in addition to rice.
2.03      The climate of West Java, in which both West Tarum and Jakarta are
located, is tropical. with an average temperature of 260C, relative humidity
of about 80% and daily evaporation rates between 3-6 an. The average annual
rainfall is 1,800 mm with about 75% falling during the November-April rainy
season, when monthly averages range between 130 and 400 mm. The remainder is
scattered throughout the May-October dry season, averaZing between 40-125 m
per month (Annex 1, Table 1). West Tarum's soils, like those of other parts
of Java's north coa.t, have been formed by alluvial and colluvial deposits
from a chain of volcanic mountains in the center of the island and are highly
suitable for rice production. The northern part of the irrigable area, close
to sea level, is flat and partly swampy, while towards the south, the ground
rises several hundred meters. The general drainage is from south to north,
varying in slope from about 0.02% at the coast, to 0.1% in the south. Four
major rivers, the Citarum, Cibeet. Cikarang and Bekasi, traverse the West
4/   About 1,000 ha have been rezoned as urban area to allow for Jakarta's
expansion.

Tarum area, and in :he past their peak uischarges ilooded the northern, low-
lying, lands. They were contained in the mid-1970s by extensive flood control
works provided with Bank assistance (Irrigation Project V. Cr. 514-IND).
2.04      Most of the area has been under wet-season rice and secondary crops
for generations, and about 45,000 ha are currently under dry-season irrigated
rice and about 3.000 ha, uncer secondary crops (Table 6.1). Based on 1983
Agricultural Extension Service daca (Annex 1, Table 2). more than nalf the
farmers in the area hold less than 0.5 ha, nearly 80% hold less than I ha
while about 3% hold more than 3 ha. About 70X of the land is owner-operated,
and about 20% is farmed by sharecroppers.
2.05      The West Tarum Canal  The WTC traversing the area from east to west
was designed to convey from up to 85 cubic meters per second (cms) at its
pumplift headworks at Curug, on the Citarum River to about 11 cms at its
terminal end, for irrigation and for municipal, industrial (M&l) supplies and
flushing of rivers in Jakarta. Shortly after construction, earth slides
severely damaged the canal and in mid-1970 it was repaired with Bank-Croup
assistance under Irrigation Project II (Cr. 195-IND).         1982 a hydrometric
survey or the canal and its structures uas carried out -  which determined
that the actual capacity et headwork pumps, the conveyance capacity of the
canal itself and of some of its major structures (a river crossing siphon and
a tunneL and a siphon at the terminal) was significantly less than as
originally designed (Annex 1, Table 8). This was partly because of design
deficiencies and partly because of inadequate maintenance. Despite this
deficienc,. WTC's capacity was till now, adequate to supply West Tarum's,
partially developed, irrigation demands. However, the relatively smalL
capacity of the terminal reach (6 cms instead of 11 cms) precluded releases
for flushing of Jakarta's badly polluted Ciliwung river, which also serves as
a main, open sewer. WTC's current capacity is not adequate to meet peak irri-
gation demands of the entire West Tarum service area (as system rehabilitation
under Irrigation Projects V and XII, Lns. 514 and 1645-IND respectively is
nearing completion), and raw water demands of Jakarta's expanding water supply
systems (Annex 1, Figure 1). An increase in the capacity of the WTC and its
ancillary structures, proposed by this project, is the least cost, viable,
solution to meet these demands (par&. 2.15).
Jakarta's Metropolitan Area
2.06      Jakarta, the notion's capital and its largest city, with an area of
about 640 sq km, is located in northwestern Java. The city had an unprece-
dented growth rate of 6% p.a. in the 1950s, and though its growth slowed to
about 4% p.a. in the 1970s. its population of about 7 miLlion in 1983 is
expected to increase to over 12 million people by the turn of the century.±'

supply and other services. By 1970, municipal water suppLy systems covered
only about 16Z of the city, and as a resuLt of a crash prcgram and the first
phase of a long range development, completed in 1975 and 1982 respectively,
the service area nearly tripled in size (to about 44% of Jakarra's area) but
only about haLf the population in tne service area (about 2.1 miLlion)
actualLy received piped water supplies. Even though the city has been engaged
in an effort co increase piped wacer sup,lies most of Jakarta's population
continues to obtain water from other sources (para. 1.06).  The Master Plan
for Jakarta's water supply (JWSDP, _ICA. December 1984), envisages a gradual
expansion of the service area co about 70% of the city by 2005, supplying, at
that time, piped water to about 9 million people of the city's estimated
population of 12 million.
2.07      About 90% of Jakarta's piped water is currently supplied from two
treatment plants, receiving raw water from rivers traversing the city. The
remainder comes from ground water (4X), from springs (4%), about 40 km south
of Jakarta, and from a number of small 'mini' treatment plants located on
local, small, rivers. The largest and oldest of Jakarta's treatment plants,
Pejompongan (5.6 cms), is Located in the heart of the city, on the Banjir
(Flood Control) Canal, whicb receives water from the Ciliwung River (Map
18504). The second, never plant, Pulogadung (whose capacity of I cms is
currently being expanded to 4 cms), is located in the city's eastern part, on
two small creeks, the Sunter and the Cipinang. During low flows, limited,
supplementary quantities of water are released into the Ciliwung and into the
Sunter from the West Tarum Canal, some 19 km upstream of Pejompongan and 7 km
upstream of Pulogadung. A major deficiency of Jakarta's water supply is an
antiquated distribution system which, in 1980, delivered only 47% of the water
produced by treatment plants. Most of the remainder was lost through
leakage. The poor condition of the distribution system also induces an inflow
of contaminated ground water.
Water Resources and Requirements
2.08      Surface Water.  The main water resource for all of West Java,
including Jakarta, is the Citarum River. At the Jatiluhur Dam, near the town
of Karawang, the Citarum drains a catchment area of 4,550 sq km with an
average annual rainfall of about 2,400 mm, and an average annual runoff of
about 6 billion cubic meters (BCM). In addition to a 2 BCM (active storage)
reservoir at the Jatiluhur Dam, two additional dams, Cirata and Saguling, are
under construction upstream. Saguling, with a reservoir of about 610 MCM
(active storage), is scheduled for completion in l9SQ  2nd Cirata, with a
reservoir of about 800 MCM, is scheduled for completion in 1988. The
Jatiluhur reservoir is operated as a multi-purpose reservoir, serving irriga-
tion, water supply and power. Saguling and Cirata will be operated primarily
for hydropower generation, but will contribute to increasing Citarum's water
supply potential. In addition, smaller flows are contributed to the West
Tarum area and to Jakarta by the Cibeet, Cikarang and Bekasi Rivers (Map IBRD
18504), and exclusively to Jakarta, by the Ciliwung River and a number of
creeks including the Sunter (Map IBRD 18505, and Annex 1, Table 3).
2.09      Groundwater.  Groundwater is found in Java's coastal plain in
quaternary, deltaic alluvial sediments that reach a thickness of over 300 m



-7-
and comprise clays, sands, silts and graveLs. There are three main aquifers
in the coastal plain, though not always distinctly separated: a 50 m deep
phreatic aquifer with its water table close to ground surface, underlain by
clay layers separating two semi-confined aquifers, each about 40 m deep. The
phreatic aquifer is recharged by rainfall on the coastal plain and by rivers
traversing it; the semi-confined aquifers are recharged mainLy at outcrops,
some 15 km from the coast. and by infiLtration from the ohreatic aquifer. It
is estimated that in 1980 izarly 50% of greater jakarta's water supply, about
200 HCH per year, was deriverd from groundwater through tens of thousands of
small wells. Of these, L.3C0 have been inventoried by the Directorate of
Environmental Geology. Present extraction exceeds the aquifer's safe yield,
and piezometric levels have dropped to 20 m below sea level in the cencer of
pumped zones (North Jakarta). As well water becomes too saline for drinking,
alternative water will be required. The proposed project, which will increase
raw water supplies to Jakarta, and an expansion of distribution systems (para
1.08) address this issue.
2.10      Sediment.  As a result of progressively denuded catchments, all
rivers in the area carry ever increasing amounts of sediment, particularly
during high stages. Most of the Citarum's sediments settle in the Jatiluhur
reservoir, yet large amounts carried by the relatively small Cikao River, a
tributary of the Citarum downstream of the Jatiluhur Dam, enter the WTC at its
headworks, while sediment carried by the three other intercepted rivers, the
Cibeet, Cikarang and Bekasi, enter at interception points. An analysis of
sediment data (Annex 1, Table 4) shows that, with properly designed and
properly operated and maintained sediment traps, most of the sediment that
would have settled in canals could be trapped and disposed of before entering
the canals where its removal is both difficult and costly. The data indicate
the impact of efficient sediment traps to be provided under this project, on
reducing siltation in the canal system.
2.11      Bacteriological Water Quality.  Bacteriological quality of drinking
water in Indonesia, and in particular in Jakarta, is an issue of major
concern. As a result of the city's high population density and lack of
control on the use of resources, the quality of its surface and ground water
has deteriorated progressively and the city's entire population is exposed at
one time or another, to bacteriologically unsafe water. Water in shallow
wells is contaminated from surface wastes, while rivers running through the
city, from which both individuals and treatment plants derive raw water, are
increasingly poLluted by human and industrial wastes. Highly fluctuating
levels of pollution make it practically impossible to effectively treat such
raw watef,and as a result contaminated water has passed into piped water
systems.!/ Preliminary results of water quality monitoring, initiated in
7/   Treatment plants were originally designed to treat relatively good
quality raw water in the rivers (or creeks) on which they are located,
through simple, conventional treatment processes, but uncontrolled
development and poor sanitation have led to a progressive deterioration
of water quality.



-8-
November 1983 (under Irrigation Project XII, Ln 1645-IND), indicate that raw
water in the Bekasi-Jakarta reach of the WTC is of much better and treatable
quaLity chan river (or creek) water reaching treatment plans (Annex 1. Table
5). This finding has been incorporated in project formulation and design
(para. 2.17).
2.12      Irrigation Requirements.  The required capacity of the WTC has been
based on peak irrigation requirements of the entire West Tarum area of some
67,000 ha and on Jakarta's raw water requirements.  Irrigation recuirements
have been calculated on the basis of recorded. representative. evapotranspira-
tion rates, average percolation rates of 1 mm/day, and a simulated rainfall of
a 1:5 dry year, with an effectiveness of 45% during the growing season and
70% during land preparation. An overall efficiency of 65% has been assumed,
which, though higher chan the current efficiency of about 45%, is expected to
be achieved in the fucure through the structural and operational improvement
of the WTC. Annex 1, Table 6 shows seasonal and peak irrigacion requirements
at turnouts from the WTC into secondary systems based on a common practice of
dividing the service area into 5 (occasionally 6) about equal size, rotational
blocks (golongans).
2.13      Jakarta's Water Requirements.  Metropolitan Jakarta's municipal and
industrial (M&I) water requirements, given in Annex 1, Table 13, have been
based on a projected population growth to 12 million by 2005, of whom about 9
million would be served; on supplies ranging from 30 l/c/d for low income
groups to 250 lIc/d for high income groups; and on an increase in distribution
efficiency from about 54% at present to 75% in 2005, through rehabilitation of
distribution systems. With little likelihood of increasing groundwater
supplies (para. 2.09), most of this water will have to come from surface water
resources. In addition to M&I water needs, an estimated minimum flow of about
9 cms in Central Jakarta's rivers is required for flushing purposes, about
10 cms in East Jakarta's, and about 4   s are required to meet riparian
demands downstream of diversion weirs._ To meet all these requirements,
additional water will be imported from eastern, and to a limited extent
western, basins, and treatment and distribution facilities will be expanded
(Annex 1, Figure 1 and Map IBRD, 18505). High priority activities in
Jakarta's water supply development program are improving water quality and
reducing losses (para. 2.19).
Water Management
2.14      The Jatiluhur reservoir is the largest and most important multi-
purpose storage reservoir in West Java for irrigation, water supply and power.
Operated since inception on forecast two-weekly demands, releases for the
8/   During the dry season, low river flows have to be supplemented.  The WTC
will be able, after improvement, to supply up to 5 cms into the Ciliwung
River running through Central Jakarta, supplementing a low river flow of
4 cms, while flushing releases for East Jakarta can take place only after
additional water resources become available.



- 9 -
three main systems (West, East and North Tarum) have supplemented intercepted
run-of-the-river flows for irrigation in the Jatiluhur service area, including
West Tarum, providing up co 6 cms to Jakarta, small quantities to a number of
small towns and industries, and generating about 55 SWh of power per month.
Water management and reservoir operation studies, summarized in Annex L,
Table 7, show that after 1988 (the completion of the Cirata Dam), the
Jatiluhur reservoir will be able to supply annually up to 4.8 BCM (supple-
menting about 1.9 BCM from local rivers), to meet Jatiluhur's irrigation and
Jakarta's projected M&I demand, and provide about 300 MCM for flushing. In
releasing this water, about 1,000 GWh of power (660 CWh firm) woyxd be
generated annually, with minor shortages in irrigacion supplies.-   Additional
reservoir operation studies (under Irrigation Project X, Ln. 1578-IND) will
optimize the operation of reservoirs on the Citarum River to meet demands
beyond the year 2000.
B. Project Formulation
2.15      The project has been formuLated to meet peak irrigation requirements
of the entire West Tarum area, Jakarta's raw water requirements till the mid-
1990s, and improve water quality by works that are: (a) technically feasible;
(b) least-cost solutions; Cc) ready as needed without requiring prolonged
service interruptions; (d) designed to deliver a reliable wacer supply of
acceptable quality; and (e) an integral part of long-range developments. The
improvement of the West Tarum Canal meets all these objectives. An additional
conveyance canal (Canal #1, or the Tarum Jaya Canal) will be necessary in the
mid-1990s to supplement the WTC's capacity in supplying needed raw water.-
which will utilize the remaining potential of the Citarum's water resources
and augment Jakarta's raw water supply by an additional 35 cms. Works of the
proposed project make maximum use of existing facilities, modifying and
improving them with minimal shut-down periods. Canal capacities will be
optimally increased mainly through surcharged water levels requiring
relatively minor modifications of canal cross-sections, and through structural
improvements, including mechanically operated trashracks, additional siphon
barrels and larger desilting basins at river crossings.
2.16      Considerable attention was given in project formulation to upgrade
POJ's institutional capacity for improved operation and maintenance (O&W) of
its systems and to ensuring adequate O&M funds through-cost recovery from
irrigation and water supply beneficiaries (paras. 5.05, 5.06). Technical
assistance has been designed to assist and train O&M staff in upgrading O&M
standards and procedures. This activity will be aided by equipment, to be
furnished under the project.

2.17      In view of a progressive deterioration of Jakarta's raw water
suppLy, a search for better quality water was initiated in November 1983 by
monitoring water quality along the entire raw water suppLy route. Interim
findings indicate that water in the WTC is of much better quality than chat in
the rivers feeding Jakarta's treatment plants. A study of alternative pLans
(e.g., intensified treatment, poilurion control) showed that procected convey-
ance (through pipelines) from points of suitable water quaLity in the WTC to
treatment plants was the most feasible and cost-effective method for raw water
improvement. This solution has therefore been adopted in planning the connec-
tion between the WTC and the relatively new Pulogadung treatment plant, where
savings in treatment costs alone justify such an investment (para. 7.04). A
pipeline to Jakarta's older treatment plant at Pejompongan, whose distribution
systems are in poor condition, may be justified if phased in parallel with
distribution system improvements. and these are being prepared with Bank
assistance under JSSP. In order to facilitate the appropriate timing of these
activities studies of this pipeline have been initiated (under Irrigation
Project XII, Ln. 1645-IND) and its design will be provided under this project.
2.18      Parallel Activities.  In parallel with physical development, the
project has been formulated to strengthen executing institutions in implemen-
tation management, and water quality protection (Annex IV). The project has
also been formulated to provide for aerial photography and remapping of
Jatiluhur's irrigated lands for reclassification and reassessment of land
taxes. Additionally, to verify farmers' payment capacity, a study of current
aggregate tax burdens on the farmer and land tax colLection methods has been
initiated under Irrigation Project X (Ln. 1578-IND).
2.19      Following the findings of the study carried out under JSSP
(para. 1.08), a project is being prepared with Bank assistance to rehabilitate
Jakarta's existing water supply systems, construct a pipeline to the
Pejompongan treatment plant, and improve the management and financial
capability of Jakartats public water supply utility.

3.04      Under the civil works component. cross-sections of the WTC will be
increased by about 30% bevond original design dimensions to compensate for
recorded. larger-than-foreseen fr-ction losses (Mannin    n-.026, instead of
nn.020 in original design).  Excepc ac che nead reach         this will be
achieved by increasing the depth of flow by 25-30 cm and by increasing the
width of the canal by about 5-i0% by restructuring the Left berm.  Original
design capacities, recently (1982) surveyed and revised capacities are given
in Annex L, Table 8.
3.05      FoLlowing structural improvements will be carried out under the
project:
(a)  Inlet Bay and Headworks.  A new inlet bay co the Curug pumping
plant will be constructed by dredging an old river channel,
immediacely upstream of the existing inlec. tt will be
connected to the forebay of che pumping plant through a new
trashrack structure, and equipped wich mechanicaL rakes and
trash removal facilities. Turbine discharge penstocks and
outlet gates will be rehabilitated and subsurface drainage of
the forebay of the plant will be improved;
(b) Sediment traps at the Cibeet, Cikarang and Bekasi diversions
will be considerably widened and deepened;
(c) Two additional siphon barrels and a new, mechanically raked
trashrack will be constructed at the Cibeet River crossing;
(d) A new streamlined inlet, equipped with mechanically raked
trashracks will be built at the Cawang siphon (near WTC's
terminal) and the 1 km long outlet tunnel into the Ciliwung
River will be lined; and
(e)  Minor structures.  turnout gates from WTC will be heightened
and defective gates replaced; about 20 cuLverts will be
extended; drain inlets into the WTC between Bekasi and Jakarta
will be closed and a parallel drain and culverts will be
provided.
3.06      The proposed connection between the WTC and the Pulogadung treatment
plant will be a gravity pipeline, 2.0 m in diameter, starting near km 63 + 630
(bridge #49), at a metered inlet, and inflow will be controlled from the
treatment plant. The inlet structure will allow a future connection of the
pipeline to Canal #1 (Tarum Jaya). The pipeline will foLlow the Buaran Creek,
crossing an Industrial Estate at Pulogadung, and will terminate at the
existing inlet to the treatment plant. Prestressed concrete appears to be the

cheapest material of construction of the pipline but a final selection of the
pipe's material will be made after bidding (schedule for Kay 1986).
3.07      Definite engineering plans and cost estimates of all civil works
were prepared under Irrigation Project XII (Ln. 1645-IND) on the basis of
final design of the WTC. Additional work on detail, design and contract
documents is well in hand and scheduLed for completion by July 1985. Weekly
water quality measurements in the WTC, which have been carried out since
November 1983, are being continued. Detail design of the pipeline to
Pulogadung has started and is scheduled to be completed in October 1985 for
bid invitation in December 1985. Land acquisition for limited rights-of-way
requirement along the canal is in progress and negotiations with land owners
are in progress. Due to limited requirements, no major delays in construction
are expected.  Similar activities for the pipeline right-of-way will commence
upon completion of alignment surveys. This activity has been prograumd in
construction schedules.
Consulting Services
3.08      Local and foreign consulting services will be provided to assist the
Jatiluhur Authority in construction management and supervision, in upgrading
O&M, and in designing additional conveyance facilities. Consulting services
will also be provided to continue and expand the Authority's training program
in O& of tertiary systems to include more water users, and in preparing plans
for the protection of the quality of WTC's water conveyed to Jakarta. Con-
sulting services will also be provided to assist in the preparation of
suitable maps for reclassifying irrigated rice lands in the Jatiluhur project
area. Estimated man-months of various assignments are suimarized in Table 3.2
below and detailed in Annez 1, Table 9. The cost of the assistance package is
estimated as $5.83 million for 247 man-months of expatriates, 620 man-months
of local professionals and 1,044 man-months of local technicians. Assurances
have been obtained at negotiations that consultants, whose qualifications,
experience, terms and conditions of employment are acceptable to the Bank,
will be engaged not later than the dates indicated in Table 4.1. The contract
for consulting services for construction supervision is being currently
negotiated with invited consultants, scheduled for coooencement of work in
September 1985 (one month ahead of commencement of construction).
Implementation Methods and Schedule
3.09      The project will be implemented by parallel activities in various
canal reaches over a 6-year period starting in the fall of 1985, with priority
given to enlargement of the Bekasi-Jakarta reach, to facilitate an early
increase in municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply (Table 4.1).
Implementation plans specify dredging of the canal for the removal of
accumulated material below the water surface, or, where widening of the canal
is called for, mechanical excavation for the removal of material above the
water surface. All this will be done with minimal service interruptions.
Structural work at the canal terminal, which requires service interruption for
dewatering of the canal at that point, will be implemented during sufficiently
large flows in the Ciliwung so as not to affect operation of the Pejompongan
water treatment plant.

D. Project Cost and Financing
3.10      The total project cost is estimated at $72.8 million (including
taxes on civil works of $4.8 million), of which $43.4 million (60%) will be in
foreign exchange. Project costs are expressed in March 1985 prices and an
exchange rate of Rp 1,100 - $1.00 is used in this report. Quantities of civil
works are based on final design and unit costs are based on recent contracts
for similar works. Costs of consultant services are based on early 1985
rates. A 15Z allowance has been included for physical contingencies for all
items, and price contingencies have been estimated, based on the following
inflation rates: for foreign costs: 5X in 1985, 7.5% in 1986, and 8% in 1987-
1990; and for local costs: 8% for 1985-90. Expected price increases total
about 24Z of base costs. Detailed project costs are given in Annex 1, Tables
20, 21, 22 and are summarized in Table 3.3.
3.11      The proposed Bank loan of $43.4 million, will finance the foreign
exchange cost of the project. This represents about 64Z of total project
costs, exclusive of taxes. COI will finance the remaining $29.4 million from
its development budget (Table 3.4).
E. Procurement
3.12      Construction of civil works (earthworks and major structural works)
on the West tarum Canal ($27.04 million including contingencies) and the con-
struction of the Pulogadung pipeline ($11.7 million) will be procured through

3.15      Disbursement will be made against contracts.  The proposed alloca-
tion of loan proceeds is given in Annex 1. Table 11, and disbursements are
projected over seven years, from September 1985 through December 1991 as shown
in Annex 1, Table 11. Estimated disbursements are expected to be similar to
those given in the disbursement profiles for Indonesia and regional irrigation
projects, for works of similar nature. Project Completion is expected in
December 1990 and Loan Closing would be by December 31, 1991.
G. Accounts, Audits and Reporting
3.16      During negotiations, Assurances have been obtainedfrom GOI that all
agencies participating in this project will maintain separate records and
accounts related to project expenditures. Acounts will be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. All contracts, orders and
receipts will be kept at least two years after loan closing; and audited
reports will be forwarded to the Bank within nine months following the end of
each fiscal year.
H. Environmental Impact
3.17      The project will make an important contribution in improving
Jakarta's water quality and in reducing endemic water-borne diseases by
increasing and improvinig raw water supplies to the city. The project will
also contribute to preserving and protecting the West Tarum Canal and the
proposed Tarum Jaya Canal from pollution by initiating studies and preparing
for protective measures. It will likewise contribute to improved sanitary
conditions by providing water for the flushing of the city's rivers.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Executing Agencies
4.01      Construction and Design.  Construction of physical works under the
project and the design of future developments will be implemented by "PROYEK
SERBANGUNA JATILUHUR," a project unit for Jatiluhur's multipurpose develop-



- 21 -
ment, in DGWRD's Department of Irrigation I (DWI I). This unit, previously
known as PROSIJAT, and reporting to Jatiluhur's Directorate, has been
responsible for the rehab.Litation of Jatiluhur's irrigation system (under
Irrigation Projecr II, Cr. 195-IND), for construction of flood control works
(under Irrigation Project V, Cr. 514-fND) and is nearing compLetion of its
current assignment for tertiary construction (under Irrigation Project XII,
Loan 1645-IND). The unit has an amply staffed technical department but
requires technical assistance in construction supervision arid management, and
in designing new developments. Water quality protection plans will be pre-
pared under the supervision of DGWRD's Directorate of Planning and Programming
(DPP).
4.02      Operation and Maintenance.  The Jatiluhur Authority (POJ) is
responsible for the operation and maintenance of all infrastructure (including
the Pulogadung pipeline) upon completion of construction. The Authority was
established in 1970 to operate and maintain the muitipurpose Jaciluhur
project, including the dam, power Dlanc, irrigation and raw wacer supply
systems. The Authority employs more than 2,000 peoDle, (exclusive of daily
workers) in O&M. Maintenance activities, handicapped by chronically short
budgets, and carried out usually during slack periods of agricultural seasons,
have to be significantly upgraded to orovide continuous and reliable water as
required by Jakarta's water supply, and operation procedures require similarly
upgrading to reach optimal utilization of available water resources.
4.03      Land Taxation.  The Directorate of Land Taxes (IPEDA) within the
Directorate General of Taxation in the Ministty of Finance, will be
responsible for mapping, demarcation of landholdi.ags, reclassification of
lands for taxation purposes and reassessment of land taxes. Assurances have
been obtained at negotiations that GOI will cause the implementacion of said
mapping, reclassification and reassessment in accordance with the
Implementation Schedule (Table 4.1).
B. Current and Planned Procedures
4.04      The West Tarum Canal is currently operated on the basis of calcula-
ted irrigation demands, and agreed raw water supplies to Jakarta, within the
constraints of WTC's carrying capacity and available supplies. DeLiveries are
reviewed and agreed every two weeks by POJ and PDAM, the Jakarta's water
supply utility (paras. 4.08-4.09), and maintained throughout the operation
interval, even if changes in hydrologic conditions occur in the interim. This
applies to all of Jatiluhur's irrigation systems (north, east and west) which
are operated through operational subcenters, and an operational center at
Curug. West Tarum's subcenter, located at Bekasi, is supported by three
sections, each operating a reach of che WTC between two local rivers. Most of
the flow in these rivers is diverted into the WTC to meet irrigation and raw
water demands, and when these flows are inadequate, supplemental water is
released from the Jatiluhur reservoir. This procedure, which till now
supplied up to about 67X of WTC's service area, appears to have worked well,
but wit.. the forthcoming completion of all irrigation systems in the command
area and increasing supplies to Jak&rta, the operation of the system has to be
more responsive to hydrological changes to achieve an optimal use of water
releases from storage. Appropriate operation would have to be supported by

frequently updated and processed rainfaiL data from catchments of local
rivers, flow forecasts to facilitate adjustments in diversions at Curue and
optimized releases from Jatilunur (above firm power reieases). This would
require improved communicacions between gauging stations and subcenters,
between subcencers, and improving and upgrading of data collection and
processing. The project addresses this need by providing operational hardware
(microcomputers and communicacion equipment), software, technical assistance
and training of operation staff.
4.05      Maintenance.  As a result of POJ's recurrent shortage of funds
(para. 5.01) and cumbersome, manual maintenance procedures (which require
dewatering of the system which interrupts water supply), the WTC has not been
maintained in optimal operating condition. Between annual clean-out
operations. silt, originating in intercepted rivers nas been accumulating in
conveyance systems, reducing capacity (para. 2.10). Xanual maintenance
efforts could not be intensified without interrupting Jakarta's raw water
supply, and inadequate funds precluded the acquisition of appropriate
mechanical equipment. The project addresses this issue by providing for
infrastructural improvements and larger and more effective sediment traps
which will reduce the inflow of sediment into the canal (Annex 1, Table 4),
and for suitable, small dredgers and ancillary equipment to facilitate
maintenance without interrupting supplies.
4.06      The project also provides technical assistance in training POJ's
staff in effective O&M of the WTC and of headworks pumps. Staff at the
Jatiluhur Dam will be trained in adequate monitoring, processing and inter-
preting of dam safety data (including piezometric levels, embankment settle-
ment data, deflection and settlement data of the intake tower and power plant)
and in adequately maintaining safety equipment. Assurances have been obtained
at negotiations that GOI shall cause the inspection of the Jatiluhur Dam,
reservoir banks and associated structures at 3 year intervals with sound
engineering practice and to remedy without delay any deficiencies which may
endanger the safety of the dam and its structures. GOI will propose appro-
priate arrangements for the Bank's review not later than December 31, 1985.
4.07      O&H Funding.  POJ derives operating and maintenance funds from
generated revenues, from budgetary allocations from Central Government and
from Local Government contributions.  In 1982 about 50% of POJ's revenues came
from the sale of power to the State Power Authority, Perusahaan Listrick
Negara, (PLN); 32% came directly from Central Government; 11% came from
Central Government funds chAnnelled through Local Government; 3% came from the
sale of raw water and 4Z from miscellaneous sources (e.g. tourism and various
services). Though these revenues are higher than they were in previous years,
they still fall short of current O&M requirements (para 5.01). POJ has, in the
past, also benefited from additional funds made available for capital
investments particularly in rehabilitation of irrigation systems, which were
not always clearly distinguishable from routine maintenance. In the future,
these resources may no longer be available. As raw water supply increases,
O&M requirements become more stringent and more costly and POJ's future
financial posture will be precarious,unless additional revenues can be
generated (para. 5.01)

C. Raw water Utilization
4.08      PDAM-DKI Jaya.  PDAM. established in 1968. i1s a semi-auconomous
utility of DKI Jakarta responsibLe for cveration, mainEenance and expansion of
Jakarta's water supply. Raw water Drovided by the WTC is treated by PDAM's
plants and is distributed through its sVstem.  ?DAM is headed by a President
Director who is assisced bv three airectors responsibie ior engineering.
business, and administration (Fig. 2, Annex 3). The utility has about 2.000
employees. Despite a low water discribution efficiencv. PDAM has been
financially proficable in the pasc years with an average annual net surplus of
about Rp 2 billion during 1981-83 (Annex 2. Table 3).
4.09      PDAM has a long-cerm expansion plan for its service area and in view
of a shortage in local water resources, is importing increasing quantities of
water from severai river basins (paras. 2.06, 2.13). New treatment plants
(Pulogadung II, Buaran. and Cakung), are expected to come on line (Annex 1,
Fig. 1) and discribution systems are in a process of expansion. The Bank is
assisting PDAM (under JSSP. Ln. 2236-IND) to prepare a project wich will
strengthen its implementation and management capacity. During negotiations,
assurances have been obtained that GOI will cause Cipta iCarya (the Directorate
General of Housing, Building, Planning and Urban Development) and PDAM (a) to
complete the expansion of the Pulogadung Treatment Plant by September 1988 and
its distribution system prior to September 1989. Also, COI confirmed, at
negotiations that by September 1985 GOt would employ consultants to assist
with planning the improvement and rehabilitation of Jakarta's water supply
distribution system which is scheduled to commence in September 1986.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
4.10      Monitoring and evaluation of projects during and after implementa-
tion are important tools in managing existing projects ard in planning for
future development. These activities may be generally classified into five
interrelated levels to be implemented by various agencies Es shown in Annex 2,
Table 14.
4.11      In the Jatiluhur project area, monitoring of physical and financial
progress has been routinely carried out by PROSIJAT; however, monitoring and
evaluation of water management and crop production requires considerable
improvement. Farm incomes in irrigated areas and the socioeconomic impact of
irrigation has been evaluated in the past by university groups on an ad hoc
basis, and a systematic design for and effective implementation of M&E including
all five levels still needs to be established. Assurances have been obtained
at negotiations that GOI will cause DGWRD's DOI I to submit a comprehensive
M&E scheme for project works construction and will cause POJ under the
guidance of DPP to submit to the Bank for comment by July 1986, a comprehen-
sive M&E scheme of O&M, crop production, farm income, changes in land tenure,
distribution of project benefits, and commence its implementation by July
1987.

V. ALLOCATION AND RECOVERY OF PROJECT COSTS
A. Background
5.01      POJ's weak financial position is a major cause for inadequate
maintenance of irrigation systems under its jurisdiction (para. 4.05). As of
June 30, 1982, POJ had accumulated a net loss of about Rp 32 billion (Annex 2,
Table 1). This loss occurred in POJ's irrigacion and water supply operations,
primarily due to an absence of revenues from irrigation, and inadequately Low
revenues from the sale of raw water to jakarta. Increasing revenues from raw
water charges (para. 5.04). and channeling increased land taxes to O&M (para.
5.06), will improve POJ's finances. As, however, incremental revenues will be
generated gradually, additional funds will have to be made available by GOI
for O&M (paras. 5.08 and 5.09).
B. Project Cost Allocation
5.02      Annex 1, Table 13 illustrates cost sharing between beneficiaries.
It shows the allocation of investment and recurrent (OH&R) costs to the two
benefitting user groups: irrigation and M&I water supply. Improvement costs
of joint facilities of WTC have been allocated in direct proportion to the
capacity each component requires. This resulted in an allocation of 70Z of
improvement costs to irrigation, and 30% to water supply. The cost of WTC's
single-use components, e.g., the Bekasi-Jakarta reach and the Pulogadung
Pipeline, serving only raw water supply, has been allocated entirely to water
supply. Seventy percent of the investment and replacement cost in O&M
equipment, which will primarily benefit raw water supply, has been charged to
this beneficiary. On this basis, of the total estimated investment of about
$67 million (including contingencies and engineering but excluding technical
assistance), $39 million (58%) has been allocated to M&I raw water supply, and
about $28 million (42%) to irrigation. Annual O&M costs are prorated on the
same basis, but adjusted at given intervals to actual expenditures.
C. Cost Recovery
Raw Water SuppLy
5.03      POJ's raw water supplies to Jakarta, Bekasi and a number of indus-
trial consumers are paid for currently in accordance with negotiated rates.
Payments by PDAM for raw water delivered to Jakarta were fixed in 1976 by the
Governor of Jakarta at Rp 19.8 million p.a., with an annual increase of 15% to
compensate for inflation. In 1981, the payment was about Rp 40 million
($53,000) or about Rp 0.4 per cu m (Annex 2, Table 2). This rate was too low
to meet O&M costs for raw water supply, let alone recover investment costs. A
new rate of Rp 10/cu m of raw water has recently been established, but has not
yet been implemented.
5.04      Estimated raw water charges and payment capacity.  With an aim of
recovering allocated OM&R costs and capital investment, raw water charges
should be determined on the basis of actual costs as illustrated in Annex 1,



- 26 -
Table 13. PDAM should repay actual construction costs and pay recurrent O&M
costs (Annex 1, Table 14). Data given in Annex 1, Table 17 show that PDAM
will be in a position to pay these costs, amounting to less than 10% of its
estimated operational costs, through larger revenues from increased water
supply, and through, conservatively estimated, higher water tariffs. The cost
of the Pulogadung pipeline will not burden PDAM as it will be offset by
potential savings in the cost of water treatment (Table 7.2).
5.05      POJ/PDAM Agreement.  Prior to loan negotiations POJ, as supplier of
raw water, and PDAM as user of raw water, entered into the following
agreement, accepted by the Bank, which wiLl become effective by, July 1988, or
three months after POJ commences supplying 11.6 cms to PDAM's treatment
plants, whichever earlier. The agreement specifies that:
(a) PDAM will pay POJ annually 100X of the allocated raw water supply
costs (including operation, maintenance and replacement) and repay
capital investments allocated to the DKI Jakarta raw water supply,
according to principles given in para. 5.02;
(b) Allocated capital costs shall be paid yearly throughout a 30-year
period at a 12% per annum interest rate; annual OM&R costs shall be
reviewed every three years by both parties and adjusted on the basis
of actual costs;
(c) POJ will ensure the delivery to PDAM of an uninterrupted supply of
water of an agreed quantity, peak discharge and quality;
(d) POJ shall keep separate accounts for (i} recovery of capital costs,
(ii) replacement of O&M equipment, and (iii) O&M of WTC and of the
Pulogadung pipeline. These accounts will be annually audited and
audited reports shall be sent to PDAM and the Bank for coments.
5.06      During negotiations, GOI agreed that any proposed amendment to the
agreement be furnished to the Bank for comments.
Irrigation
5.07      Government revenues in Indonesia's agricultural and rural sector are
mainly generated through, by current standards relatively low, land taxes
(IPEDA) (para. 5.08). There are no direct irrigation water charges in
Indonesia, except contributions by farmers of irrigated lands to village water
masters and water user associations, for the upkeep of tertiary irrigation
systems (para. 5.07). The lack of adequate revenues in the irrigation sub-
sector, unjustified in view of significant benefits attributable to irriga-
tion, imposes an unduly heavy burden on GOI in financing new developments and
in operating and maintaining irrigation systems. To ease this burden,
revenues in the irrigation subsector should be increased, commensurate with
benefits, and for expediency should be channelled to maintenance of irrigation
systems. In view of a long tradition of farmers' perceived inalienable right
to free surface water, and various political and social constraints,
Government is not ready, at this time, to impose water charges, and the most
practicabLe way of increasing revenues appears to be an increase of land taxes



- 27 -
by applying existing laws and regulations 121 linking IPEDA with, inter alia,
rice production and rice prices. Towards channeling locally generated funds
for O&M of main and secondary irrigation systems, a dialogue has been
initiated with the West Java's local government, and an agreement has been
reached in principLe (para. 5.09). IPEDA's funding of other rural develop-
ments would not, and indeed should not, be curtailed, and farmers payment
capacities would be considered in assessing higher tax rates (para. 5.10).
This is the first time that this approach is being explored in Indonesia, and
its application is expected to be gradual. The dialogue initiated under this
project will be pursued in coming irrigation projects, and broadened to other
provinces.
5.08      Farmers' Contribution.  Farmers are expected to operate and maintain
tertiary irrigation and drainage systems, and in the project area, are
expected to contribute 25 kg of paddy per ha per crop, and about five days of
labor per year to their local water user association (WUA). In most irrigated
areas, including the project area, these associations have not been active and
have not been able to improve the operation and maintenance of tertiary
systems. Consequently farmers have been reluctant to contribute their
share. With a view to improving chis situation, the Jatiluhur Authority has
been training irrigation officials in ensuring reliable irrigation supplies to
farmers and in proper O&M of tertiary systems (para. 6.04).
5.09      Land Taxes (IPEDA).  IPEDA (luran Pembangunan Daerah), literally a
contribution for rural development, is commonly collected from farmers by
provincial governments through village heads and allocated at the Kabupaten
(District) level. The tax is used for a variety of rural developments but is
usually not used for the upkeep of main and secondary irrigation systems,
which have traditionally been financed by Central Government. In West Java,
the provincial government, which in the past retained 10% of IPEDA collec-
tions, has recently rechannelled 8% to district governments and about 2%, or
about Rp 200/ha (1% of the current requirement) for O&M of Jatiluhur's main
and secondary irrigation systems. Under current regulations, IPEDA is
assessed in accordance with the size of landholdings, the productivity 13ass
of the land, value of production, and may be reassessed periodically.
However in practice, most lands are under assessed. Current IPEDA rates,
shown in Annex 2, Table 4, were established in 1979 and have not been
materially increased since. Under the impact of previous and current
investments in irrigation, rice production will increase to about 10 t/ha
(Table 6.1) and this will raise IPEDA for an average 0.8 ha holding from a
current assessment of Rp 13,300/ha (Table 5.1) to about Rp 29,000/ha
(according to Annex 2, Table 4, using the 1979 price of Rp 95/kg) or Rp
50,000/ha (using the 1985 paddy price of Rp 165/kg, Annex 1, Table 18).
Clearly such an increase in IPEDA can only be implemented gradually, and in
the interim GOI will have to provide required funds for adequate O&M through
budgetary allocation (para. 5.09).

5.10      During project appraisal, GOI has agreed in principle to update land
classification and IPEDA assessment in Jatiluhur's irrigated area and to
earmark a portion of IPEDA revenues for fRincing O&M of main and secondary
irrigation systems in the Jatiluhur area.        Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that:
(a) GOI will cause POJ to update maps of the Jatiluhur service area for
reclassification of IPEDA by December 31, 1988;
(b) GOI will cause the Directorate of IPEDA to reclassify irrigated
lands and reassess IPEDA rates in the Jatiluhur service area (about
300,000 ha) in accordance with agreed terms, and specifications by
March 1990;
14/ See project file.



- 29 -
(c)  cOt will cause the Wesc Java Provincial Government to allocate
incremental IPEDA collected in the Jatiluhur service area, to the
financing of O&M of main and secondary irrigation systems in such
area in accordance with a schedule, acceptable to the Bank, to be
furnished to the Bank by December 1988.
(d) cOr will, at all times. make available adequate funds for O&M of
Jatiluhur's irrigacion systems, and those required co supply to
Jakarta reliable raw water of acceptable quality, as agreed between
POJ and PDAM, supplementing funds which may become available from
other sources.
5.11      The above-mentioned activicies will be facilitated by two technical
assistance schemes: (a) Land remapping for reclassification and IPEDA re-as-
sessment (assisted under this project) and (b) studies on farmers' tax burden
and improving IPEDA collection efficiency (assisted under Irrigation X,
Loan 1578-IND).
Cost Recovery Indexes
5.12      On the basis of projected raw water charges shown in Annex 1,
Table 14, the cost recovery index for the water supply component is about 106%
at a 10% interest rate (the local opportunity cost of capital). The cost
recovery index of the project's irrigation component is about 11.5Z at a
similar interest rate which is in line with other irrigation projects in
Indonesia. Detailed calculations of these indexes are shown in Annex 2,
Table 5. The relatively low cost recovery index for irrigation is due to the
relatively small amount of incremental taxes expected from irrigation
beneficiaries as a result of this project.
VI. ACRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND FARM rNCOMES
A. Agricultural Production
6.01      The improved West Tarum Canal will provide additional water to the
rehabilitated irrigation systems in the project area, which will facilitate an
expansion of irrigated areas in the dry season, and a concomitant increase in
production of rice, soybeans and maize. Changes in cropping patterns, yields,
and production with the project are summarized in Table 6.1, with details
given in Annex 2, Tr'.le 8.
6.02      Cropping Patterns, Yields and Production.  In the project area,
paddy is, and will remain, the dominant crop during the wet (November - April)
and dry (May - October) seasons. Secondary crops, such as food crops and
vegetables, will continue to be grown as second or third crops after the main
paddy crop. In farm analyses, major crops of maize and soybeans represent all
secondary crops. The main contribution of the project will be an expansion of
the cropped area during the dry season. This area, currently comprising about

/a   Based on the impact of Irrigation Projects V and XII.
7b  About 3,000 ha of swamp land is currently under development.
{c   Maize and soybean are major non-rice crops grown in the dry season and
are representative of a large variety of secondary crops and vegetables.
/d   Including about 10,000 ha of rainfed rice.
48,000 ha can expand to about 55,000 ha as distribution systems are completed.
Further expansion to 67,000 ha (Table 6.1) will take place as the capacity of
the WTC is increased. Paddy yields in the project area have been steadily
increasing and with the full impact of Irrigation Projects V and XII are
expected to increase to about 5 t/ha during the wet season and to about
4.8 t/ha in the dry season. The project is not expected to achieve a further
increase in paddy yield, but yields of major crops of maize and soybeans are
expected to increase by 0.2 t/ha. The project's (1990) incremental production
of about 82,000 tons of paddy, and 22,000 tons of maize and soybeans is
primarily the result of increased cropping intensity. Most of this production
will be absorbed by the Jakarta market and will substitute for imports, as
long-run Indonesia's demands will exceed national production.
6.03      Supporting Services and Post-harvest Facilities.  Farmers in the
project area are experienced food crop growers. Most of the project area has



- 31 -
been covered under BIMASVINKAS a national guided credit and production inten-
sification program for wet and dry season rice crops, and agricultural
supporting services provided to farmers are generally adequate. There are 16
rural cooperatives (BUUD/KUD) and 114 branches (kiosk) which supply farm
inputs, and about 660 mills/hullers, which are adequate for present and
expected future production.
6.04      Water Users Associations.  Water users associations (WUA) have
recently been established for aLl tertiary systems in the project area. How-
ever, most of them are inactive and need to be developed (para. 5.07). During
negotiations, DCWRD clarified :hat training of water users would be provided
through a national program and C0I wouLd provide specific details by October
1985. In addition, the burden on farmers of paying various formal and
informal taxes in the area will be studied (para. 5.10).
B. Farm Incomes and Payment Capacity
6.05      In the farm income analysis, budgets have been developed for farm
sizes of 0.3 ha, 0.8 ha, and 1.5 ha representing smaLl, average, and large
farms in the project area. The farm budgets of sharecroppers are based on
traditional sharecropping arrangement, whereby landowners pay for taxes and
about half of the prcduction costs, receiving in return half the production.
It has been assumed that farm fmilies consist of 5 persons, providing about
50 man-days per month, supplemented by hired labor in peak seasons, and are
employed off the farm during slack seasons. Financial prices of all farm
inputs and outputs have been used in farm budgets, which include all incurred
production costs except farm family labor.  Estimated farm incomes for these
typicaL farms are summarized in Table 6.2 and detailed in Annex 2, Table 11.
6.06      As shown in Table 6.2, incomes of all farms will rise as a result of
the project. A significant income increase (50-852) for all farm groups will
result from massive improvements under Irrigation Projects V and XII, and a
smaLler increase (12-18X) as a result of the proposed project. After sub-
tracting an equal minimum living allowance from net incomes, average and Large
farm holders will have a considerable surplus for payment of incremental
taxes. Smellholders' surplus will remain negative, albeit considerably less
so than before and their payment capacity for additional taxes is limited.
The size of Landholding is reflected in IPIDAs. current rates, and small-
holders are assessed a lower rate than holders of larger farms, however, the
difference is too small to adequately reflect respective payment capacities.
The subject of an equitable distribution of all farmers' tazes based on
farmer's payment capacity would be pursued in our continuous dialogue with
COI.

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits and Beneficiaries
7.01      The proposed project will increase food crop production, improve
water supply to Jakarta, reduce foreign exchange expenditures for rice and
other food grain imports, and enhance employment and income opportunities in
the agricultural sector. Major benefits and beneficiaries of the project are
sumnarized in Table 7.1. At full development, an incremental quantity of
about 82,000 tons of paddy and about 22,000 tons of soybean and maize will be
produced annually which will save CO1 about $22 million each year in foreign
exchange by reducing imports. An equivalent of 15,000 full-time farm jobs will
be created through crop intensification every year. Civil works of the
project will generate some 4 million man-days of construction labor during the
5-year implementation period. Jakarta will receive a progressively increasing



- 33 -
amount of raw water with improved quality which will generate benefits as
shown in Table 7.2. About 140,000 rural families and 700.000 urban families
will benefit trom the project directly and indirectly.  Against this,
investment costs per family are about $120 per farm family and about $29 per
urban household.
7.02      The proposed project is the least-cost solution to achieve these
benefits and the continuation of water resource developments in which the
Jatiluhur Authority progressively supplies an increasing portion uf Jakarta's
raw water. The project will upgrade POJ's O&M capabilitv and address cost
sharing of investments and recurrent costs by beneficiaries.  The project will
provide for farmers training in O&M of tertiaries and in increasing irrigation
efficiencies. It will also provide for che protection ot water quality.
These considerations. though not quantifiable, are important benefits of, and
justifications for the project.
B. Economic Justification
Major Assumptions Used in Economic Analysis
7.03      Irrigation Benefits.  Only the direct and quantifiable benefits of
irrigation attributable to this project are considered in the economic
analysis. These are derived from incremental farm production (rice, maize and
soybeans) valued at economic prices (March 1985 constant dollars) net of
incremental production costs. A detailed analysis of farm production benefits
ii shown in Annex 2, Table 11. About 80% of irrigation benefits are
attributable to paddy production from an incrementally irrigated area of about
17,000 ha in the dry season and the remainder are attributable to secondary
crops including soybeans and maize. These production increases are directly
reLated to WTC'J improvement, and are distinct from product on increases as a
result of other irrigation developments (Irrigation Projects V and XII).
7.04      Benefits of Municipal Water Suppl.  Benefits of the municipal water
supply component can be classified as: a) increased raw water quantity made
possible through the enlargement of the WTC; and (b) improv.  raw water
quality by a protected conv! H nce through a pipeline connecting WTC to the
PuLogadung treatment plant.-   The project is part of a lei t cost system
expansion plan to meet projected water requirements in Jakarta. Without the
project, the most Likely alternative to improving water quality is to continu-
ously increase chemicals in the treatment process to cope with increasingly
polluted row water. This will increase treatment costs and decrease plant
efficiency. The economic benefits of the proposed pipeline to Pulogadung from
savings in chemicals and plant efficiency, is about Rp 2.4 billion in 1990 and
increases progressively (Table 7.2). These savings aLone would generate an
economic rate of return (ERR) of about 19X for the proposed pipeline, and
about 8Z for the water supply component as a whole.
15/ Until another pipeline is built for the Pejompongan treatment plant,
water from WTC will be delivered to this plant through the Ciliwung River
with only a marginal impact upon raw water quality at that plant.

7.05      Benefits also arise from increased water quantity.  Alternative
local surface and ground water resources are limited, increasingly contam-
inated, treatment is costly and often ineffective, and large quantities of
water transfer from neighboring river basins cannot be readily developed to
meet near-future requirements. The allocated development cost (excluding
pipeline costs) of Rp 11.0/cu m (Table 7.2) is the price paid by PDAM for raw
water and is passed on to consumers. Current retail tariff averages Rp 250/cu m.
Therefore Rp 11/cu m, 4% of the currea1t retail tarrif, may be considered as a
minimum estimate of benefits. There is substantial consumer surplus at this
tariff and there are also considerable public health benefits which have not
been quantified.
7.06      Labor Pricing.  The project is located in the vicinity of Jakarta,
and there is considerable population pressure in the project area. This is
reflected in the large proportion of landless laborers (about 30Z) who are
highly underemployed. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor is low at an
estimated Rp 700lday.-&  The shadow wage rate nas therefore been assessed at
about 70Z of average farm wages of about Rp 1,000/day, and at about 50% of the
common construction labor wage which is estimated at about Rp 1,400/day
excluding costs of transportation, housing, and other facilities.
7.07      Agricultural Prices.  All farm inputs and outputs in the economic
analyses as well as in farm budgets are valued in conscant March 1985
prices. Economic prices for rice, maize, soybean, and fertilizers are based
on January 1985 world market price forecasts for 1986, 1990 and 1995 by the
Bank's Commodities and Export Projections Division, adjusted for transporta-
tion, processing, and handling costs to farm gates, as shown in Annex 2,
Tables 6 and 7. For reference, financial prices for all commodities from
actual farm gate prices are also listed in these tables. In the project
analysis, projected prices for 1986, 1990 and 1995 represent prices during
1984-1989, 1990-1994, and 1995 and onwards, respectively.
7.08      Foreign Exchange.  The official exchange rate of US$1.00 = Rp 1,100
is considered to reflect the value to the economy of the foreign exchange used
in the project, and hence a standard conversion factor of 1.0 has been
adopted.
7.09      Economic Life.  The project's economic life is assumed to be
30 years under adequate O&M, based on the expected life of major project
works.
7.10      Economic Costs.  Total project costs have been adjusted to economic
costs by eliminating discrepancies between financial prices and real oppor-
tunity costs. The following are the major adjustments (see Table 7.3):
(a) exclusion of expected price escalation and taxes;
16/ Average daily income from various marginal activities, based on an

Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
7.11      With these assumptions, the economic rate of return of the entire
project is estimated at about 26Z. Specific ERRs for various components are
as follows:
Components                    ERR (Z)
(a)       Irrigation-WTC                  38
(b)       Water supply-WTC                 13
(c)       Water supply-pipeline            19
(a+b)     WTC subtotal                    28
(b+c)     Water supply subtotal            15
(a*b+c)   Total Project                   26
The-relatively high ERR of the irrigation component is *ainly due to the
relatively low cost of improvements under the project, reflecting the effects
of various sunk costs of previous investments. These include the Jatiluhur

reservoir, main, secondary and tertiary irrigation systems, drainage and
roads. Detailed annual economic costs and benefits are summarized in Annex 2,
Table 13.
Sensitivity AnaLysis
7.12      Crossover (or switching) values2l7  for a 10  discount rate were
calculated for a number of variables crucial to the success of the project.
Table 7.4 summarizes differences between the crossover and appraisal values
for a number of criticaL variables. Since the project has two technically
separable components, the WTC and the pipeline, the sensitivity analysis
focuses on these components.

7.13      The project as a whole is economically robust, relatively
insensitive to cost overruns, reduced benefits, or implementation delays.
This may be seen in the high switching value relating to the improvement of
17/ The crossover value is the value of the variable tested for which the
project's net present value calculated at 10% discount rate is zero, or
equivalently the value beyond which the ERR would be belov 10.

the WTC, indicating that the improvement is economically viable even if
investment should increase by 19OZ or incremencal paddy production should
decline to nil. Similarly, the viability of WTC's improvement is relatively
unaffected by a reduction of benefits from secondary crops or water supply.
It will remain marginally viable even if the economic life of the WTC is only
eight years. The ERR of the pipeline wouLd be reduced to IOZ by a 61%
reduction of savings in chemicals. A 194Z reduction in savings of treated
water would be required to reduce ics ERR to lO. The pipeLine will be
marginally viable even if its economic costs increases by 87% or its economic
life decreases to 12 years (including three years construction).
C. Risks
7.14      As discussed above, there are no major risks inherent in the pro-
posed project except that OLK may be below standard if funds are inadequate
and/or management is inefficient. However, OI has indicated readiness to
increase land tazes and assign priority in their use to OLM; PDAM has agreed
to reimburse POJ for all incurred expenditures related to raw water supply and
GOI has agreed to supplement these funds, as required, for adequate 06M. In
addition the following steps have been taken to further reduce risks:
(a) the project will initiate a progrm aimed at protecting the quality
of WTC's water resources;
(b) PDAM's share of OUI expenditures will be paid at quarterly intervals
to POJ, in accordance with the agreement between PJ and PDAM;
(c) Incremental IPEDA collections will be applied to Oh and the balance
of funds needed for adequate 01K will be provided by OI through
budgetary allocations
(d) PDAM's allocated 0&K contributions will be adjusted every three
years in accordance with actual, incurred expenditures;
(e) POJ will procure under the project appropriate O01 equipment to
ensure reliable, continuous raw water supply. Funds will be set
aside to enable equipmeat replacement and procurement of spares; and
(f) the project will provide technical assistance which will upgrade
POW's technical and managerial capability in carrying out 01K works.

(h)  COI will reclassify lands and reassess IPEDA in the Jatiluhur
irrigated area by Karch 1990 (para. 5.09);
(i) 001 will cause the West Java Provincial Government to allocate
incremental IPEDA collected in the Jatiluhur service area to the
financing of O&M of main and secondary irrigation in such area. In
accordance with a schedule, acceptable to the Bank, to be furnished
to the Bank by December 1988;
(j) COX will, at alL times, make availabLe adequate funds Ear O&M of
Jatiluhur's irrigation system, and those required for the reliable
supply of raw water to Jakarta in quantities and quality agreed upon
between POJ and PDAM, in addition to such funds which may become
available from other sources (para. 5.09); and
(k) GOI shall cause POJ to inspect the Jatiluhur dam, reservoir banks
and associated structures at 3 year intervals with sound engineering
practice and to remedy without delay any deficiencies which may
endanger the safety of the dam and its structures. GOI will cause
POJ to propose appropriate arrangements for the Bank's review not
later than December 31, 1985 (para. 4.06).
8.03      Signing of civil works contract No. 1 will be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para. 3.12).
8.04      With the above agreements, assurances and conditions, the project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of $43.4 million with a 20 year maturity at
the standard variable rate, including a grace period of 5 years. The Borrower
would be the Republic of Indonesia.

assist POJ in preparing detail design of Canal #1, (Tarum Jaya), based on a
least cost solution. The canal will be designed for 40 cms, comnence at WTC's
headworks, at Curug, follow an alignment parallel to the WTC for an approxi-
mate distance of 52 km, and terminare about 2 km east of the Bekasi River
where a new treatment pLant will be built. (Design of this plant is not
included under these TOR). Consultants will: (i) finalize, survey, and stake
out the canal's final alignment; (ii) scudy the feasibility of lining (either
rigid or flexible Lining); (iii) determine and specify the operational require-
ments of the svstem and their implications on structural and operationaL
controls (e.g. interconnections with the WTC, hardware, software, for dis-
charge control. quantity and quality monitors, etc.); (iv) determine and
specify viable maintenance procedures, their implicacions on che design of the
system, and quantify aLl requisite maintenance equipment (and software),
manpower and budgets; (v) finalize hydraulic and structural design of the
canal, including its headworks, terminal, crossing scructures, operational
controls, operational software, monitoring system, and prepare detail design,
drawings, technical specifications and an O&M manual.
4.   Water Quality Protection
4.1       The objective of consulting services under these TOR is to establish
viable plans to protect the quality of raw water supplied to Jakarta by the
West Tarum canal, and that to be supplied by future Canal #1 (the Tarum Jaya
canal). Towards this objective, consultants shall (i) identify potential
sources of pollution along the alignment of the WTC, Canal #1, and the tribu-
tary rivers (particularly the Bekasi, Cikarang and Cibeet) and classify them
in accordance with the type of pollution (human, agricultural, industrial) and
its expected impact on the effectiveness and cost of water treatment in
Jakarta's plants; (ii) study alternative protection plans, analyzing and
assessing advantages, disadvantages, expected socio-economic and legislative
impact; and (iii) develop technically, economically and socially viable short
term and long term plans duly considering cost effectiveness, and the need to
provide alternative water supply and sanitation to the population along the
watercourses.
4.2       Analyses of all alternative plans, prepared in accordance with para.
4.1 above, on suitable (1:50,000 scale) maps, and an accompanying narrative,
shall be submitted for review and comments within 8 months after commencing
work under these TOR. Consultants will accomodate any comments given in the
review in preparing recommended plans.
4.3       Consultants shall prepare plans and cost estimates for a water
quality monitoring program, specifying data recording and interpretation
mechanism, and a detail plan of preventive and emergency actions to safeguard
water quality.
