MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Indonesia
West Tarum Canal ImDrovement Project (Loan 2560-IND)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Indonesia - West Tarum Canal
Improvement Project (Loan 2560-IND). Parts I and Ill were prepared by FAO/CP for the East
Asia and Pacific Regional Office and Part 11 by the Borrower.
Water from Jatiluhur Dam feeds West Tarum Canal, which irrigates 67,000 ha.
outside Jakarta and provides water to the city. That the canal could not carry its design
discharge became critical as demand grew. The project was to enlarge and improve the canal,
and to add a pipeline to the principal water treatment plant. Aerial mapping was to improve
land titling and tax collections. These and direct water charges to urban water users were
to increase cost sharing. Safety of the dam was to be monitored. Future improvements to
the urban water system were to be planned.
The project realized its major objectives after some delays due to problems with
agency coordination and contractors, and extensions to permit dam safety work. Despite
apparently good preparation, substantial redesign occurred. Borrower commitment and
supervision were strong; the latter had complete continuity. Consultants' performance was
generally good. Borrower and Bank differ on agricultural results and the economic value of
urban water, but the project shows good returns by either estimate. The Borrower did not
comply with cost recovery covenants, which are said to have been superseded by
arrangements under subsequent projects. Institutional development may be considered partial.
The dam safety study revealed earthquake vulnerability; the loan was amended and closing
extended to permit additional studies and dam-safety works. Even without this benefit, the
project has been satisfactory. Benefits are likely to be sustained.
The otherwise excellent PCR leaves unresolved differences between the
Borrower's and the Bankfs assertions about agricultural results.
No audit is planned.

WEST TARUM CANAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2560-IND)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the West Tarum Canal Improvement
Project, for which a World Bank Loan of US$43.4 million to the Government of the Republic of
Indonesia (GOI) was approved in May 1985. US$2 million of the loan amount was cancelled in March
1992 at the request of GOI. The original Loan Closing Date of December 31, 1991 was extended until
April 30, 1993. Approximately 100% of the loan has been disbursed.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary, Part I and Part III of this PCR were prepared by a
mission" from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme in accordance with the guidelines for
preparing PCRs, issued in June 1989. The report is based on data provided by the GOI, a review of
World Bank records and the mission's visit to Indonesia in November and December 1992.

WEST TARUM CANAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2560-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The main objectives of the Project were to increase rural incomes and food production
through larger irrigation supplies, and to improve Jakarta's urban living conditions through increased and
improved raw-water supply. To achieve these objectives, the Project included: (a) civil works to enlarge
and improve the West Tarum Canal (WTC), to restore its capacity to convey up to about 80 rn3/s of water
from Jatiluhur reservoir to Jakarta and to an irrigated area of about 67,000 ha; (b) construction of a
pipeline of 2 m diameter and about 7.5 km long to convey raw water from WTC to an existing water
treatment plant at Pulogadung; (c) equipment for improved operation and maintenance (O&M) of the
WTC and Jatiluhur dam (including safety monitoring equipment) and for the land-tax inspection offices;
(d) aerial photography and mapping of 300,000 ha for land reclassification for taxation; and (e) studies
and designs. At appraisal, the estimated project cost was US$72.8 million to be financed by a World
Bank Loan of US$43.4 million (all the foreign exchange cost) and a contribution equivalent to US$29.4
million by Government of Indonesia (GOI) from its development budget.
Implementation Experience
The Loan became effective some two months later than planned, in November 1985. The
Project was successfully implemented, generally in accordance with the proposals outlined in the SAR.
There was a delays of about two years in completion of most of the main works due to delay in award
of contracts, additional work and changes in design. However, important improvements to the reach of
the WTC from Bekasi to Jakarta, which enabled increased quantities of raw water to be supplied to
treatment plants, were completed about six months earlier than the SAR program, despite the late start.
Inspection of the Jatiluhur dam, which was required by a loan covenant, raised concern
about the dam's stability. The Loan was amended to finance further investigations and reviews by a dam-
safety panel. The Loan Closing Date was postponed first by four months to complete additional safety-
related work at Jatiluhur dam, and then by a further year to April 30, 1993 to enable a review of critical
dam-safety issues and design of remedial works. About 95% of the Loan was disbursed. The project
completion cost was Rp 113,800 million (42% more than SAR estimate), but only US$66.5 million in
dollar terms or about 90% of SAR estimate mainly due to devaluation of Indonesian Rupiah against the
US Dollar since the appraisal.
The aerial photography and mapping for purposes of land tax and also the designs and
studies were completed satisfactorily but slightly later than planned.
Results
As a result of the Project, an estimated additional 460 million m3 of raw water will be
available for Jakarta each year and there will be appreciable savings in the amounts of chemicals used
for water treatment. The incremental annual agricultural production due to the Project is estimated to
be about 80,000 tons of paddy, 12,000 tons of maize and 17,000 tons of soybeans. The Jatiluhur dam



- iv -
has been inspected and found to need remedial works, which were designed under the Project. The
Directorate of Land and Building Tax (PBB) estimates that there has been about 25% increase in PBB
collected due to remapping, as well as further increases due to new methods of assessment and collection.
The economic rate of return of the Project is now estimated to be 33%. This is higher than
the 26% estimated in the SAR due to slightly higher incremental agricultural production and a higher
value given to raw water for Jakarta.
The Project has contributed to improving the availability of clean drinking water to Jakarta
and has improved incomes of poor farmers in the area irrigated from WTC. The Project has so far had
little other environmental impact. However, if the remedial works, recommended by the project-
supported investigations, are carried out to ensure safety of the Jatiluhur Dam, then the environmental
benefit would be enormous.
Sustainability
Sustaining the project benefits will depend on implementation of remedial works at Jatiluhur
dam, the replacement of the pumping station which supplies WTC at Curug and the sustained O&M of
the system. GOI has included in its development plans the construction cf Jatiluhur Dam's remedial
works and replacement of the Curug pump station equipment at appropriate time. It has requested the
Bank to finance the former as part of a proposed Dam Safety Project (FY94L). With the assumption that
the need-based annual budgets for efficient O&M will continue to be provided, as under Irrigation
Subsector I and II (Loans 2880 and 3392-IND) Projects, there is a basis of optimism that the West Tarum
Canal would continue to operate at the same level of efficiency as designed. It is reasonable to assume
that the project benefits would be sustained.
Findings and Lessons
This has been a successful project due in part to the design and supervision of construction
by consultants, closely supervised by Bank, FAO/CP and DOI" staff. By employing the same
consultants for design and construction supervision, a responsible attitude was taken to improvements in
design needed to suit actual conditions during constructions.
The Project has drawn attention to the need for insisting on regular dam- safety inspections
and a national dam-safety project has now been proposed.

2. Background
2.1   The main water source for West Java and Jakarta is the Citarum River. At the Jatiluhur dam,
the Citarum drains a catchment area of 4,550 km2 with an average annual runoff of about 6,000 million
nl. In addition to a 2,000 million m3 (active storage) reservoir at the Jatiluhur dam, at the time of
appraisal two additional dams (Cirata and Saguling) were under construction upstream. Saguling, with
a reservoir of about 610 million m3 (active storage), was completed in 1985 and Cirata, with a reservoir
of about 800 million m3, in 1989. The Jatiluhur reservoir is operated as a multi-purpose reservoir,
providing irrigation, water supply and power. Saguling and Cirata are operated primarily for hydropower
generation, but contribute to increasing Citarum's water supply potential. In addition, smaller flows are
contributed to the West Tarum area and to Jakarta by the Cibeet, Cikarang and Bekasi Rivers, and
exclusively to Jakarta by the Ciliwung River and a number of smaller rivers including the Sunter and
Cipinang.
2.2   The West Tarum Canal (WTC) is about 70 km long and is one of Jatiluhur's main conveyance
canals. It was built in the 1960s to convey irrigation supplies to the West Tarum area of West Java and
to augment Jakarta's raw-water supply. As demands for its water were only gradually built up, it did
not carry the full discharge for which it was designed. By 1985, water demands were nearly fully
developed, the full discharge was needed and structural and maintenance improvements were required
to enable the WTC to convey it. Improvements, to be implemented under the Project, were to facilitate
meeting peak irrigation requirements of the entire service area and Jakarta's raw-water demands until the
late 1990s, when additional conveyance facilities would be needed.
2.3    About 90% of the treated water used in Jakarta was supplied from two plants: Pulogadung, in
the eastern part of the city, received water, often of very poor quality, from the Cipinang and Sunter,
which was augmented at times of low river flow by water from WTC; Pejompongan, in the heart of the
city, received water, also often of very poor quality, diverted from the Ciliwung which traversed the city
and which could be augmented by water from WTC.

3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1   The main objectives of the Project were to increase rural incomes and food production through
larger irrigation supplies, and to improve Jakarta's urban living conditions through increased and
improved raw-water supply. To achieve these objectives, the Project included:
(a) civil works to enlarge and improve the WTC and its major structures, and to construct a
pipeline of 2 m diameter and about 7.5 km long between the canal and the Pulogadung water
treatment plant;
(b) equipment for improved operation and maintenance (O&M) of the WTC and Jatiluhur dam
(including safety-monitoring equipment) and for the land-tax inspection offices;
(c) aerial photography and mapping of Jatiluhur's irrigated area (300,000 ha) for land
reclassification for taxation;
(d) technical assistance for: construction management and supervision; O&M; studies a n d
detailed designs for a future pipeline from WTC to Pejompongan and for a new canal from
Curug to Jakarta to augment WTC - the proposed Tarum Jaya Canal (TJC); land-tax data
management; water-quality protection; training; and
(e) a covenant in the Loan Agreement requiring the Jatiluhur Authority (POJ) to regularly
inspect Jatiluhur dam (but no finance for this was provided under the Project).
3.2   Agricultural beneficiaries were to include mostly smallholders, with incomes below poverty level,
in about 67,000 ha in the West Tarum area, while urban beneficiaries were to be Jakarta's residents
whose highly-inadequate water supply would benefit from more and better raw water. To improve
traditionally inadequate O&M funding, the Project was to provide, on a pilot basis and for the first time
in Indonesia, for increased cost sharing by beneficiaries in both sectors. Urban beneficiaries through
direct water charges were to pay the entire cost of supplying raw water while irrigation beneficiaries were
to pay part of the recurrent costs through properly-channelled, appropriate land taxes.
3.3   At appraisal, the estimated project cost was US$72.8 million including an estimated US$43.4
million in foreign exchange, to be financed by a World Bank (Bank) Loan of US$43.4 million. The
Government of Indonesia (GOI) was to finance all local costs equivalent to US$29.4 million from its
development budget.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1   The Project was identified by Bank and FAO/CP missions in 1980, prepared by the Directorate-
General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD), POJ and their consultants between 1981 and 1984
under Irrigation Project XV (Cr. 995-IND) with assistance from FAO/CP and the Agriculture and
Infrastructure Divisions of the Bank and appraised by the Bank in September 1984.
4.2   The concept of the main component of the Project was straightforward construction work, which
was well prepared and appropriate in the light of its objectives. The roles and responsibilities of the
agencies responsible for the Project were clearly defined and understood. DGWRD was responsible for



- 3 -
civil construction and design, the Directorate of IPEDA (later PBB)" for mapping, reclassification and
improvement of data collection and processing and POJ for training of their staff.
5. Project Implementation
5.1   The Loan became effective in November 1985, some two months later than planned due to a delay
in awarding the contract for the Bekasi to Jakarta reach of the canal, which award was a condition of
effectiveness. The Project was successfully implemented, generally in accordance with the proposals
outlined in the staff appraisal report (SAR) but with some changes. There was a delay of about two years
in completion of most of the main works due to delays in contract award, additional work and design
changes. However, the important improvements to the reach of the WTC from Bekasi to Jakarta, which
enabled increased quantities of raw water to be supplied to treatment plants, were completed about six
months earlier than the SAR program, despite the late start. Loan Closing was postponed first by four
months to complete additional safety-related work at Jatiluhur dam and then by a further year to April 30,
1993 to enable a review of critical dam safety issues and design of remedial works. About 95% of the
Loan was disbursed. The project cost was Rp 115,000 million (42% more than the SAR estimate), but
only US$66.5 million or about 90% of SAR estimate due to alterations in the rate of exchange between
the rupiah and US dollar.
5.2   There was a substantial increase in the quantity of work, particularly earthworks, required to
improve the canal, due to underestimation in the original design and due to the unforeseen presence, due
to seepage, of very soft, wet clays at the base of the existing canal embankments. Additional internal
drainage systems were provided for high canal embankments and additional cross-drainage structures were
built. Measurements of canal flows made in 1991 indicated that in all but one short reach the SAR design
capacity has been achieved. However, in order to reliably achieve the design flow in the upstream reach,
the capacity of the Curug pumping station will need to be augmented.
5.3    During implementation it was realized that: (a) the inlet bay for WTC at the Curug headworks
would need redesign to accommodate the headworks for the proposed TJC; and (b) the old hydraulic
pumping station had developed major weaknesses and would eventually have to be replaced. It was
therefore proposed that a new intake be constructed on the left bank of WTC where the canal crosses the
old course of the Citarum River, approximately 500 m downstream (along the canal) of the existing intake
and hydraulic pumping station. This intake, to be constructed under a future project, would accommodate
an electric pumping station for WTC and the TJC intake, which would pass under WTC at this point.
Under the Project, a gravity inlet to WTC was built just upstream of the proposed future intake. This
gravity intake can supply only about 30 to 40 m3/s to the canal for essential irrigation and supply to
Jakarta while the pumps and forebay were being repaired. The hydraulic pumps were overhauled and
spare parts provided under the Project. Additional remedial works were also carried out to the weir
wing-wall and on the right bank of the river, downstream of Curug weir.
5.4   Substantial equipment was provided under the Project, particularly the dredges to remove the silt
accumulating in the newly constructed desilting basins and the canal. Training was provided to POJ staff
(both operational and maintenance staff) so that O&M activities are improved.

5.5   The design of the inlet from WTC to the Pulogadung pipeline was revised to allow inlet gates for
upstream control of the water flow and for chlorination. Pipe length was reduced from 5 m to 2.5 m
thereby reducing the weight of each pipe from 22 tons to 11 tons, which greatly facilitated transport and
construction. Thrust blocks were added at bends in the pipeline.
5.6    GOI was required by a loan covenant to have Jatiluhur dam periodically inspected. Following
the dam's safety inspection under the Loan, the Loan Agreement was amended to finance additional
studies for its stability and safety-related works. Because of the dam's importance (being the largest
reservoir in Indonesia), a panel of two dam experts was also financed by the Loan to review these
additional studies. The dam panel concluded that in the event of a large earthquake, the upstream
embankment of the dam could be severely damaged and damage could also occur to the downstream
embankment; further investigation of the structural integrity of the intake structure was also needed.
Following more work by the inspecting engineers and a further review by the dam panel in January 1993,
rehabilitation work was recommended, the design of which has been completed under the Project.
Construction is proposed to be done under a possible future dam-safety project.
5.7    The aerial photography and mapping for purposes of land tax were completed satisfactorily but
about three months later than planned. Designs of Pejompongan pipeline and TJC were successfully
completed as were studies for O&M and for water quality protection and the assistance for land-tax data
management.
6. Project Results
6.1    As a result of the Project, an additional quantity of about 460 million m3 of raw water will be
available for Jakarta each year and there will be appreciable savings in the amounts of chemicals used
for water treatment due to improved raw water quality. Additional water supplied in the dry season has
enabled the cropping intensity to increase from  182%  to 234%, resulting in incremental annual
agricultural production estimated to be about 80,000 tons of paddy, 12,000 tons of maize and 17,000 tons
of soybeans. Jatiluhur dam has been inspected and found to need remedial works, which are being
designed under the Project. PBB estimates that there has been about 25% increase in PBB collected due
to remapping, as well as further increases resulting from new methods of assessment and collection.
6.2   The economic rate of return (ERR) of the Project is now estimated to be 33%. Despite lower
prices for agricultural commodities, the ERR now estimated is higher than the 26% estimated in the SAR
due to slightly higher incremental agricultural production and a higher value given to raw water for
Jakarta.
6.3   The Project has contributed to improving the availability of clean drinking water in Jakarta and
has improved incomes of poor farmers in the area irrigated from WTC. The Project has so far had little
other environmental impact but if, due to investigations and designs carried out under the Project, a
disastrous failure of Jatiluhur dam has been avoided, the environmental benefit would be enormous.
6.4    As a result of the designs carried out under the Project, a contract has been awarded for the
construction of the 11 km long, twin 1.6 m diameter Pejompongan pipeline, which started in 1992,
financed by Jabotabek Urban Development II Project (Loan 3219-IND). The designs for TJC have not
yet been used for construction. The management consultancy for POJ resulted in a computerized
operating model (JISMOD) for operation of the system. However, although working, the model is not
being used; data are required to be updated daily which has been difficult to do, and the model needs to
be located in one central unit with operational authority.

7. Project Sustainability
7.1   The sustainment of project benefits would depend on maintaining a reliable water supply. This
requires implementation of remedial works at Jatiluhur dam and the replacement of the pumping station
at Curug with the proposed new electric pumping station. Both these operations will require GOI finance.
7.2    Maintaining a reliable water supply depends also on the O&M of the system. The responsibility
for this is shared between POJ (dam and headworks and one third share of Curug to Bekasi and all
Bekasi-Jakarta) and West Java Provincial Water Resources Service (PRIS) (2/3 of Curug to Bekasi,
secondary canals). The rate POJ receives from the Jakarta Drinking Water Supply Utility (PAM) for sale
of raw water is fixed from time-to-time by DGWRD. This rate has been Rp 22/m3 since 1991 even
though POJ calculated in 1989 that they would require Rp 38/m3 when the Pulogadung pipeline was
commissioned (1991) rising to Rp 42/i3 in 1994. POJ is able to augment any shortfall in its income
from sales of water by income from sales of hydroelectric power, although this requires annual ministerial
approval.
7.3    Although there was a covenant in the Loan requiring GOI to allocate a portion of land tax
collected to the O&M of main and secondary canals, this was not enforced because it was considered to
be superseded by irrigation service fees and PBB implemented under the Irrigation Subsector I and H
Projects (ISSP I and II, Loans 2880 and 3392-IND respectively). Part of the revenues derived from PBB
are made available to West Java PRIS. If the improved O&M and budget allocations achieved under
ISSP in other areas are applied to WTC, are sustained and adequate O&M are provided, it would be
reasonable to assume that project benefits would be sustained. However, there is a risk that this will not
happen.
8. Bank Performance
8.1   The Bank performed well at all stages of the Project. FAO/CP was used by the Bank to guide
GOI and their consultants with the feasibility study (financed under Credit 995-IND) and, when it became
apparent that the Project would have both agricultural and urban water supply components, encouraged
collaboration between Agriculture and Infrastructure Divisions in the Bank. The Bank thus ensured that
the urgendy needed work on the downstream reaches of WTC was quickly achieved. By insisting on
dam-safety inspections, the dangerous state of Jatiluhur dam was identified and remedial works put in
hand.
8.2   Continuity in the supervision of civil works was ensured as the same engineer led all ten Bank
missions which supervised the works. Clear and concise supervision reports were prepared. The Bank
adopted a flexible attitude to reallocating the Loan, introducing a special account and extending the
closing date of the Loan to permit urgent safety investigations and designs to be undertaken at Jatiluhur
dam. Bank staff provided constructive ideas on the redesign of the pumping station at WTC headworks
at Curug. The Project drew attention to the need for safety inspections for dams.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1   The Borrower generally performed well. By employing experienced consultants who had designed
the main works, to supervise construction, good continuity was achieved enabling designs to be improved
to suit actual conditions during construction. There were delays in awarding contracts, partly



caused by shortage of funds in 1986 and 1987 and for the Pulogadung pipeline, by the difficulty of
obtaining the approval of Jakarta City Government to the alignment of the pipeline.
10. Project Relationships
10.1   Good relations were maintained between the Borrower and the Bank with excellent continuity of
Bank staff involved with project supervision. There were no appreciable problems in coordination
between Government agencies because very little coordination was needed. There are regular discussions
between POJ and PAM concerning the rate to be charged for raw water.
11. Consulting Services
11.1   Consultants were used for supervision of construction, design for future projects, review of dam
safety, mapping, training and studies. The performance of foreign consultants was reported to range from
acceptable to excellent.  For local consultants, collaborating with foreign consultants or working
independently, performance was reported to vary from less than acceptable to acceptable. The role of
consultants for construction supervision was to assist project staff (assistance concept) and not to be
responsible for an output (task concept), whereas for designs and studies the consultants worked under
the task concept and were responsible for the output. The quality of output for consultancies under
assistance concept was reported to be diluted by the part played by project staff, whereas under the task
concept it was reported as being generally higher.
11.2  The recruitment of consultants was delayed initially, but consultants generally delivered their tasks
on schedule. There were increases in consultants inputs due to additional work. The major increase
occurred for the Dam Safety-related assignments, as a result of unusually dangerous conditions revealed
after initial inspections. Staff of foreign consultants remained nearly the same as in the consultants offer,
but some changes were made in the staff of local consultants. Relationships between the foreign and local
firms were reported to be always excellent.
11.3  Consultancies generally achieved the intended effects and met objectives. When objectives were
not met fully, it was reported to be due to inappropriateness of the local consultant staff, who in spite of
the training afforded by the foreign consultants did not reach the proficiency level expected of them. This
sometimes resulted in the extension to the terms of some foreign experts and consequent additional cost.
The supervision consultancy was reported to have resulted in better quality construction and more
accurate construction quantities and hence payments to the contractor, than would have been expected
without such a consultancy.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1  The Loan Agreement was unusual in that it included a detailed implementation schedule (see
Schedule 5, Part III, Section 7A). The SAR provided a useful framework for use during project
implementation but was not always easy to understand and contained minor inconsistencies.
12.2   Good records of construction were maintained but monitoring of agricultural benefits was
insufficient to make a,precise reestimate of agricultural benefits from the Project.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Comments on Part I
1. Preparation
1.1    The improvement of West Tarum Canal (Canal) which started in 1985 was originally focussed
in the right direction to meet the shortage of irrigation and raw water for industry and municipal water
supplies in Jakarta. Since Indonesia's achievement in 1984 of self-sufficiency in rice production emphasis
was redirected towards Operation & Maintenance of irrigation schemes.
1.2    The Canal was originally designed to convey discharge of 85 cu m/sec in Curug and 11 cu m/sec
at its end in Jakarta. Due to the capacity of the canal being considerably less that this, as a result of
sedimentation and sliding of the inner side slope, it was necessary to enlarge and improve the canal.
1.3    To obtain better quality of raw water, a pipeline would be constructed which would connect the
canal at Buaran and Pulogadung water treatment plant. The preparation of the West Tarum Canal Project
was done satisfactorily between 1981-1984 under the Irrigation Project XV (Cr. 990-IND) and with
assistance from the FAO, and the Indonesia Agriculture and Infrastructure Divisions of the Bank. The
demand for 60,797 ha of irrigation water, particularly during the dry season, has been met and eventually
increased crop intensity from 182% to 200%. However, the demand for raw water for drinking by the
peoples of Jakarta usage by it's industry has not been met. Sixty percent of Jakarta's people and some
industries are still consuming ground water (with a varied and non-standard quality). The raw water
resources from Jakarta and its surrounding area is sufficient. The problem is a lack of funds for the
water treatment plant as well as its distribution system. Ideally, water supply for Jakarta would also
include city flushing or at least and ability to keep a minimum flow during the dry season. The dense
population of Jakarta from time to time would produce polluted waste water from households and
industries.
2. Implementation
2.1    It is clearly stated in Part I that the Project was implemented successfully, but with some change
in works and a two-year delay in completion of most works. The success of project implementation was
mainly due to the supervision role both by Bank staff as well as by Project staff with emphasis on quality
control, quantity survey, construction inspection and technical administration.
2.2    Some works were delayed for the following reasons:
(a) During the construction activities, the canal flow for irrigation as well as raw water supply to
Jakarta could not be interrupted, therefore the widening of the canal and the removal of sediment
had to be carried out partly by dredging or other suitable means;
(b) Delays in awarding of contracts and construction works. The overall completion of works was
scheduled for April 1989 but due to the rescheduling of Project activities, the awarding of
contract and construction works were delayed. To assist the contractor in carrying out the works



- 8 -
according to the contract, particularly with respect to the quality, quantity and proper execution
of these works, the Project established a Project Supervision Organization;
(c) Including additional works in the Project, consisting of earthworks, drainage and additional
syphoning;
(d) Unforseen circumstances; e.g. seepage and very soft clay at the base of the existing canal
embankment;
(e) Rescheduling of project implementation as a result of the country's national economic situation;
(f) The redesign of some works; and
(g) Delays in completion of aerial photo maps due to the difficulty in collecting data from many of
the land-owners who were away from the irrigated areas at the time.
3. Project Results
3.1    Physical. The Canal at Curug has a capacity of 82 cu m/sec, while at the Curug Hydraulic
Pumping Station, its capacity has been improved from 56 cu m/sec to 78.2 cu m/sec. The syphon
capacity at Cibeet has been increased from 64 cu m/sec to 78 cu m/ec. The Canal at Bekasi could supply
raw water to Jakarta with a discharge of 21 cu m/sec. The Pulogadung pipeline is supplying raw water
(of a better quality) with a discharge of - cu rn/sec and the Canal at its end in Jakarta has a capacity
of 11 cu m/sec.
3.2    Following is the agriculture production during the wet and dry seasons from 1989 to 1992:
a. Wet Season 1991/1992
- irrigated area    60,797 ha
- production        5.88 tons/ha
- benefits          53.9% of gross income
46.1% for seed, land prep. etc.
b. Dry season 1992
- irrigated area    60,797 ha
- production        5.26 tons/ha
- benefits          53.9% of gross income
46.1 % for seed, land prep. etc.
- no palawija of maize and soyabeans
3.3    The Project could contribute irrigation water for about 60,797 ha paddy field during the dry and
wet seasons, and an additional quantity of about 460 million cu m of raw water with better quality to
Jakarta. The income of poor farmers in the area irrigated by the Canal has increased. It seems,
however, that the increase of farmer's income could not be enjoyed by them because rice prices decreased
while the price of fertilizer, for example increased. A farmer with 0.3 ha paddy field has an income
somewhere between Rp 30,000 and 50,000/month, or less than US$1.00/day. According to the Bank,
-------



- 9 -
this would put these farmers in poverty levels; therefore the success of an irrigation project with an ERR
of 59% can't improve the farmer's welfare.
3.4    The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of water supply which is based on the price of raw water
at Rp 22/cu m is 17%. It is considered that the price of raw water of Rp 22/cu m is a financial price.
If the economic price of raw water of Rp 29/cu m is used, the ERR of water supply would be higher than
17%. The ERR of irrigation should be recalculated.
3.5    Due to the land reclassification and new methods of assessment and collection, the PBB has
increased by 25%. The land tax is 1% of the price of land while the building tax is 1% of the building
price less Rp 2 million.
B. Comments on Part III
The Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III
4.1    After going through Part III, GOI has the impression that the data contained in Part m
adequately reflects the implementation of the Project.
Table 6 - Project Results - (A) Direct Benefits. Please recalculate the estimated incremental
crop' production for paddy. Please omit data on maize and soya beans; (B) Economic Impact.
The incremental yield of maize and soya beans should be omitted. Incremental cropping
intensity: 44% (SAR) and 18% (PCR).
The Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Annex 1
4.2    A few questions arise:
Para. 4 - Cropped Area. The total land area of the Project is 68,460 ha, but decreases as a
result of rats, pigs, etc., broken canal, change in function etc., the harvested areas is only
60,797 ha. Cropping intensity has increased from 182% at SAR estimates, to 200% for the
PCR. The table for cropped area should be revised.
Para. 5 - Yields. Table of yields (kg/ha) should be revised.
Para. 18 - Economic Rate of Return. The ERR should be recalculated.
Table 7 - Economic Price of Maize - the economic price of maize would normally be the Bank's
commodity price.
The data and information used in Part III were obtained from the Jatiluhur Authority (POJ).
Changing assumptions will not materially alter the PCR's findings.  (Comment by
EA3AG).

C. Bank Performance
5.1    From  the viewpoint of Bank missions from  project preparation stage, construction
implementation through the completion of all project works, all project objectives have achieved their
targets and operated well. The Bank performance was satisfactory.
5.2    The completion of works, however, was delayed for two years as a result of additional works
being included in the project, rescheduling of project activities, and unforeseen circumstances. While
some delays in the completion of works were acceptable, the SAR targets might have been too optimistic.
5.3    The integrated development among the agencies concerned had the purpose of enhancing the
acceleration of regional development. The PBB component is one component of this Project, belonging
to the DG tax. As a result of land reclassification from the aerial photography, the PBB has increased
by 25%.
5.4    Because of weak coordination among agencies concerned, the O&M cost-recovery for irrigation
schemes is still unclear.
D. GOI Performance
6.1    The Government of Indonesia has the great responsibility of completing all project works.
During construction implementation, problems were revealed and steps were undertaken to get accurate
and regular measurements of the works in progress. Even so, completion of project works were delayed
for two years; however the quality and the function of the canal are satisfactory.
6.2    The performance of local consultants reportedly varied from less than acceptable to acceptable.
For this reason, the selection of consultants should be more closely monitored.
6.3    The transferring of knowledge is an important responsibility. The transferring of this knowledge
from expatriates to project staff and contractor's staff is considered satisfactory. Close cooperation
among Engineering contractors and consultants in the field and in the office was a direct way of
transferring knowledge. A training seminar was conducted in 1987 and the expatriate specialists provided
lectures and organized discussions on their specific fields of experiences.
6.4    According to the law no. 11/1974 on water use priorities, the first priority for water use is
drinking water, household, flushing etc.; second is agriculture, irrigation etc. In fact, these priorities got
reversed. Jakarta is in dire need of drinking and flushing water and the exploration of ground water by
its population affected the intrusion of sea water up to Monas. As a lesson, the Canal should considered
a source of additional raw water for Jakarta.
E. Bank and Borrower Relationship
7.1    Coordination between the Bank and the Borrower during the preparation and implementation of
this Project was satisfactory. All the problems which were revealed during project implementation have
been overcome by both the Bank and the Borrower by their exchanging of views.

implementing reassessment of IPEDA in POJ area. Loan effectiveness was delayed until the
condition that the contract for improvement of WTC between Bekasi and Jakarta had been
awarded was met. The loan closing date was extended first by four months in 1991 to complete
the additional safety-related work at Jatiluhur Dam and then, in 1992, by a further year to enable
a review of the critical dam safety issues and the design of remedial work.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
1.         The mission re-estimated the ERR closely following the assumptions of the SAR, but using
actual data where possible.
B. Project Costs
Economic Costs
2.         Using price deflators for domestic inflation (Table 1), actual project expenditure in current
terms (Table 2) was adjusted to obtain an estimate of expenditure in 1992/93 values and then converted
to economic costs (Table 3) in the same way as in the SAR: costs of studies relating to future projects
which have no direct impact on project benefits were excluded; taxes and subsidies were excluded; a
shadow wage rate of 50% of the wage for unskilled construction labor was used (see para 8). Conversion
factors are shown in Table 4.
C. Project Benefits
Irrigation Water
3.         The Project area was already highly developed and relatively well irrigated and therefore
the project objective was only to increase dry season irrigation, thus permitting an irrigated second crop
(rice) and enabling a third crop in some areas. The distribution system was already in place and farmers
were well aware of high yielding technologies; it was therefore assumed that the main benefit was from
an increase in cropping intensity and from a switch from lower value to higher value crops. These
increases were assumed to take place as soon as water was made available.
4.         Cropped area. The total land area of the Project is 68,460 ha with 67,000 ha being
cultivated with rice in both the wet and dry seasons (as expected in the SAR). Based on data provided
by Jatiluhur Authority (POJ), the area under maize increased from 2,000 ha to 7,200 ha (compared to
SAR estimate of 7,000 ha) and the area under legumes (represented by soya) is 16,000 ha (compared to
SAR estimate of 11,000 ha). This has had the effect of increasing cropping intensity from 182% before
the Project to 234% at completion and full development.

5.         Yields are relatively high in the project area and, although expected to rise, the SAR
did not envisage any increase in rice yields due to the Project. Both maize and soya yields were
expected to increase by about 10% due to better irrigation.

No data were available for actual yields, except one monitoring and evaluation report for
1990/91 which gave a weighted average rice yield for the area of 4,820 kg/ha in the wet season
and 4,340 kg/ha in the dry season. Data collected for other seasons were not analyzed due to
lack of funds. As these are well within a range centered on the SAR estimates, the mission has
accepted the SAR estimates.
6.         Crop budgets. Since the benefits in the SAR were based largely on area increases
and shifts in crop mix, the mission has used the same crop budgets (Table 5) to estimate total
production and input requirements. Incremental production is estimated to be 79,680 tons of
paddy, 11,840 tons of maize and 17,240 tons of soybeans.

7.         Economic price projections. The mission re-estimated parity prices for the main
economic crops and inputs, using the latest World Bank Commodity price projections (November
1992) (Tables 6 to 10).
8.         Economic wage rates. The current wage rate for unskilled labor is about Rp 2,000
per day plus meals estimated at Rp 500 per day, giving a total daily wage of Rp 2,500. The
shadow wage rate, used for the SAR and commonly used for projects in Indonesia, is 50% of
the financial rate and this conversion factor was used to estimate the economic cost of unskilled
farm labor.
9.         Economic benefits from irrigation water were estimated as shown in Table 11.
10.        Benericiaries. The mission had insufficient information to update the SAR analysis
of beneficiaries in terms of land ownership and farm size class.
Raw Water Supply for Domestic and Industrial Use
11.       Increased quantity of water available is shown below. The SAR valued the
increased quantity of water supplied at the fee paid by the Jakarta Drinking Water Supply Utility
(PAM) for raw water, which was considered to be a minimum estimate of economic value.

12.        Water fee. The water fee agreed between PAM and POJ is currently (1992/93) Rp
22 per m3 of raw water. It is projected to increase to Rp 27/m3 in 1994, but Rp 22 has been
used for analysis. The retail price for treated water varies for different users and quantities, but
is on average about Rp 250 per m3. Undoubtedly, Rp 22 per m3 represents a lower bound on
the economic value of raw water and can therefore be assumed to be a conservative estimate.

13.       Improved quality of water. The SAR valued the improvement in water quality as
a result of the construction of the pipeline on the basis of chemicals saved in the treatment
process and by the improved productivity of the Pulogadung treatment plant, due to the decrease
in water used for washing filters and bleeding settling tanks.
14.       The SAR estimated that, as a result of better quality water, the annual productivity
of the Pulogadung treatment plant would increase by 18%. This assumption has been retained
by the PCR mission. The estimated savings in chemicals used are shown in Tables 12 and 13.
15.       Total benefits from water supply. There are also indirect health benefits, resulting
from both the increased supply and better quality of water supplied, which have not been
quantified.
D. Economic Analysis
16.       The overall rates of return to the Project, and to the individual components, were
re-estimated using the assumptions described above. The cost and benefit streams are shown
in Table 14. Project costs were lower than expected due to a devaluation of the rupiah in 1986,
followed by a more gradual depreciation in its value against the US dollar.
17.       The rate of return to raw water supply has increased slightly from that at appraisal
due to the increased economic value given to raw water. Moreover, it should be remembered
that, as in the SAR, the economic price of water is a lower bound on its real value. However,
the increased cost of the pipeline and the lower chemical savings than assumed in the SAR result
in lower ERR, based on water quality.
18.       The projected economic prices of agricultural commodities and inputs are generally
lower than estimated in 1984, but lower construction costs have resulted in an increased
economic return to irrigation.

E. Financial Aspects
19.        A major issue during project design was the allocation and recovery of project costs,
both of irrigation water and domestic drinking water.
Cost Allocation
20.        The SAR estimated the breakdown of costs between irrigation and water supply as
follows:
Irrigation  Raw water supply
Investment costs
- Curug to Bekasi                  70%                30%

Cost Recovery
21.        Raw water supply. Considerable progress has been achieved in determining the
fee rate paid by PAM to POJ for raw water, in that there is now a mechanism in place for
annual review. Disagreement remains about the formula for establishing the rate, although the
debate is fairly transparent with the different approaches representing the negotiating positions
of the two agencies involved in the supply and purchase of raw water.
22.        The debate between PAM and POJ focusses on 2 aspects: (a) whether PAM should
pay for water which is not treated but used for flushing rivers (this arises because of the
metering arrangements); and (b) whether full capital recovery should be included in the fee.
Allowing for depreciation and O&M costs, POJ estimates the fee rate should be Rp 22 per m3
and this is the rate currently paid by PAM. However, POJ argues that this does not allow for
a return on capital which would increase the fee rate to Rp 29/r3.

23.       Irrigation water. The link between ultimate beneficiaries and those responsible for
the supply of water is less clear and less direct. Farmers do not pay directly for O&M of the
main and secondary system, but contribute towards the cost through Land and Building Tax.
The allocation for irrigation passes through several levels of Government and final allocation
should be made by the West Java Government to the PRIS and POJ. This and the recovery of
O&M costs through Irrigation Service Fees are a major component of ISSPs and have not been
dealt with in detail here.
