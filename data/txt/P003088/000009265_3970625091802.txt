CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Zaire
Beneficiaries:        Banque du Zaire (BZ), participating financial inter-
mediaries, CEPETEDE, ANEZA, Zairian SSE promotion
institutions and small enterprises.
Amount:               SDR 19.8 million, equivalent to US$25.0 million.
Terms:                Standard IDA terms.
Relending Terms:      The Borrower, through the Bank of Zaire (BZ) as its
agent, would onlend US$22.5 million equivalent to
qualified participating financial intermediaries at
the rediscount rate (currently 30% pea.), or the
KINIBOR rate (Kinshasa Inter Bank Offering Rate) when
the recently established interbank market operates to
the Borrower and IDA's satisfaction, with a flexible
amortization  schedule  reflecting  the  aggregate
subloans made by the intermediaries.   The onlending
rate would be reviewed annually.   Acting under a
Management Agreement satisfactory to IDA, BZ would
(i) collect for the Borrower the interests due by
participating   intermediaries,    except   for   an
administrative fee of one percentage point that would
accrue to the Project Unit; (ii) recycle the Credit
proceeds back to participating intermediaries for SSE
financing; and (iii) repay the Borrower the funds
lent to intermediaries over a period of 17 years
starting three years after the date of the Management
Agreement.   Interest rates charged by participating
intermediaries to beneficiary SSEs would be variable
and market-determined. They are expected to be about
37 percent p.a., excluding the CCA tax on interest,
which would however be eliminated over a two-year
period. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by
the Government. The Borrower would use the remaining
US$2.5 million to (i) provide training and technical
assistance   to  participating  intermediaries  and
beneficiary SSEs (US$1.7 million); and (ii) cover
part of the operating costs cf a Project Management
Unit located in the Central Bank (US$0.8 million).

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Zaire for SDR 19.8 million (US$25.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terns
and would help support the development of small-scale enterprises in
Zaire.   The Government, through the Bank of Zaire (BZ), would onlend
US$22.5 million equivalent in zaires to qualified participating financial
intermediaries at the rediscount rate (currently 30% p.a.), or the KINIBOR
rate when the recently established interbank market operates to the
Government and IDA's satisfaction.   These intermediaries would lend to
beneficiary SSEs at variable and market interest rates (currently about
37X) and terms of two to ten years.   The Government would assume the
foreign exchange risk.   The Government would use the remaining US$2.5
million to (i) provide training and technical assistance to participating
intermediaries and beneficiary SSEs (US$1.7 million); and (ii) cover part
of the operating costs of a Project Management Unit located in the Central
bank (US$0.8 million).
2.        Background.     Since  1983,  Zaire  has  been  implementing  a
comprehensive program of economic restructuration in collaboration with
the Bank Group and the IMF.   As part of this program,  the Government
devalued the Zaire currency by about 500 percent in local currency terms,
established a floating exchange rate regime and liberalized all interest
rates, with the exception of agricultural credit which remained fixed at
about  30 percent p.a.    In  1986,  the Government  also  eliminated  the
remaining import controls, abolished all export duties and taxes on
manufactured exports and adopted a new tariff regime.   These reforms,
together with the promulgation of a new investment code with a special
regime f or SSEs and the reactivation of the guarantee fund, have removed
the bias against SSEs in the policy framework and substantially improved
their development prospects.
3.        Small-scale enterprises (SSEs) in Zaire are a non-homogeneous
group, varying significantly in complexity and sophistication as well as by
size and activity. Formal SSEs are mainly active in trade, transport and
other services where they provide about 50 percent of employment in these
sectors.   Ihey are less well represented in productive activities where,
according to the 19b0 census of productive enterprises, SSEs only accounted
for 8.5 percent of total production and 12 percent of total employment.
Informal establishments, which account for a large part of the SSE sector,
are generally unregistered and many of them do not even keep records of
their activities.   Despite these shortcomings, the informal sector is an
important generator of employment, providing as much as twice the number
of jobs as the formal sector in large cities.  It is also in the informal
sector that women entrepreneurs can generally be found, particularly in
activities that also allow time to care for a family, such as small trade,
dressmaking, hairdressing, bakeries, hotels and restaurants.  Unlike large
and medium enterprises, most SSEs in Zaire are owned, managed, and operated
by Zairian nationals.   They are productive,  labor intensive and less
dependent on imported inputs than large enterprises. There is ample scope



-2-
f or development of SSEs in Zaire which are less constrained by transport
difficulties and produce goods and services accessible to low income
groups.   however, the sector faces severe constraints.  More than large
enterprises, SSEs suffer from limited training and difficult access to bank
credit.    Building  on  the  lessons  learned  from past  effortE  at  SSE
development by the Bank Group and other donors, this project will address
these issues constraining the growth of SSEs by channeling the financial
resources not only through development banks but also through commercial
banks  and  savings  cooperatives  and  by  using  Zairian  experts  and
institutions to deliver technical assistance to beneficiary SSEs.
4.        Project  Objectives.    The  main  objectives  of  the  proposed
operation would be to (i) generate new employment opportunities; (ii)
nurture the development of Zairian entrepreneurs; (iii) increase the
participation of financial intermediaries with large branch networks in
the development of SSEs, thereby contributing to the decentralization of
economic activity; and (iv) develop in Zaire a good capacity to prepare,
appraise and supervise SSE projects.   The proposed operation would also
help address the training needs of women entrepreneurs and facilitate their
access to institutional credit.
5.        Project Description.    The project would offer a package of
credit, technical assistance and training, tailored to the needs of SSEs
defined as enterprises with total net assets of less than US$350,000.
The credit component would finance the foreign exchange and a portion of
local costs of (i) fixed assets and associated permanent working capital
of extensions and new investments promoted by small private entrepreneurs
in all sectors of the economy; and (ii) free-standing working capital for
viable existing SSEs in the productive sectors. Any accredited financial
intermediary with clean audits would be eligible to participate provided
it has entered into a Participating Agreement with BZ that would specify,
inter alia, the lending and repayment conditions, procurement and disburse-
ment procedures, and the intermediary's acceptance of responsibility for
appraisal  and  supervision  of  subprojects.    The  technical  assistance
component would be provided through local institutions with proven capacity
in training and SSE promotion for:   (i) SSEs and women entrepreneurs on
techuical matters and project management; and (ii) staff of participating
banks at headquarters and in the regional offices on appraisal and
supervision of investment projects. A Project Management Unit (PMU) would
be established at BZ to coordinate and monitor the activities of financial
institutions and Zaire's training and SSE assistance institutions involved
in the project.
6.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$37.3 million
equivalent,  of which US$21.4 million would be in foreign exchange.   A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods o' procurement and disbursement, as well as a disbursement
schedule, appear in Schedule B.   A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Zaire are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the different regions of
the country is also attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6632-ZR,
dated April 3, 1987, is being distributed separately.



-3-
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA involvement would supplement
its policy-based lending for adjustment by supporting the Government's
efforts to stimulate economic growth and increase employment. The package
of financial resources and technical assistance provided by the project
would help the development of SSEs, a sector which has high employment
generation potential and is the breeding ground for developing a Zairian
entrepreneurial class.   Despite the involvement of many donors in SSE
development, there is still a shortage of term resources to finance
SSE projects because of the lkrge needs of the sector and the constraints
established by bilateral assistance regarding procurement, nationality of
the beneficiary, geographical location or type of projects.
8.         lgreed Actions.   The Government has agreed on the following
actions: (i) onlending rates and conditions and their annual review with
IDA; (ii) condition for the use of the KINIBOR as the onlending rate for
the project; (iii) content of the draft Management Agreement between the
Government and BZ.  The signing of the Agreement would be a condition of
effectiveness;  (iv)  content  of  the  Participating  Agreement  between
financial intermediaries and BZ; the signing of the agreement would be a
condition of disbursement for each intermediary; (v) appraisal and
supervision procedures to be followed by participating intermediaries;
(vi) obligations and compensation of Zairian training and SSE assistance
institutions under the project; (vii) terms of reference for the promotion
missions in the regions to inform potential investors of the existence of
the IDA line of credit and explain to them the bank's procedures and
requirements for obtaining term loans; (viii) content of a first series
of courses and seminars to be given to staff of financial intermediaries
and SSE promotion institutions; (ix) use of one percentage point of the
interest rate received by Government as seed money for encouraging the
constitution of guarantee funds for loans made to micro-enterprises and
women entrepreneurs;  and lx) action program aimed at strengthening the
saving   cooperatives'   financial   structure   and  preparing   them   for
accreditation by BZ.
9.           Justification.   It is expected that the investment component
would help create 5,000 new jobs at an average cost of US$7,000 per job.
The impact of the project is also expected to be widely dispersed both
geographically and among various income groups with benefits reaching
subborrowers  in  the  regions  and  micro-enterprises.    In  addition  to
providing term finance to SSEs, the project will also play an important
role in building up in Zaire an effective capacity for financing and
assisting small enterprises.   Finally,  the project would enable women
entrepreneurs  to  upgrade  their  skills  and  ease  their  access  to
institutional credit.
i4          10.        Risks.   As  the first  apex  operation  in Zaire,  the  project
involves institutional arrangements that are new to intermediaries and the
Central Bank. Some delays in subloar processing may occur as the Central
Bank needs to familiarize itself with the system and as participating
intermediaries strengthen their capacity to appraise SSE projects.   This
risk would be considerably reduced by the rapid implementation of the
technical assistance component and the close supervision by IDA during
the initial phase of project  execution.   Another risk relates to the
possible deterioration of Zaire's economic situation, which would affect



-4-
the investment plans of small enterprises and slow down the demand for
term  credit.   Such a risk is, however, limited  by Zaire's  continued
determination to implement stabilization measures and the actions envisaged
by -IDA and other donors to increase the resource transfer and foster
economic recovery in Zaire.
11.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
