INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A
LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Union of Burma for the equivalent of US$7.5 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a projeci- for livestock develop-
ment. Part of the proceeds (US$2.5 million) would be relent to the Live-
stock Development and Marketing Corporation (LDMC) Eor 15 years including
five years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report entitled "The Current Situation and
Prospects of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" (565a-BA) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on January 15, 1975. Country data
are provided in Annex 1.
3.        Burma is the largest country in the south-east Asian mainland
and is rich in natural resources. However, much of this wealth is yet to
be developed and the per capita income of Burma is still well below $100.
Burma came out of the Second World War and the struggle for independence
in 1948 economically devastated and politically divrided. The fifties were
a period of turbulence, both political and economic. When the present
Goverrnent came to power in 1962, its major objectives were to unify the
country and complete the social transformation of t:he economy which had
begun in the forties.
4.        After 11 years of government by the Revo:Lutionary Council, a
Constitution was adopted in a nationwide referendun in December 1973.
Parliament is vested with supreme executive, legisLative and judicial
authority. The People's Councils, which extend down to village tracts,
are the primary means of governing the nation. During the recess of
Parliament, the Council of State exercises power on its behalf. On the
whole, there has been little change in Government personnel. The Burma
Socialist Program Party is the only authorized political party.
5.        By and large, the Government has made notable progress in the
attainment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still a
problem, particularly in the hill and border areas, but there is probably
greater stability now than at any time since independence. Nationalization
of all major sectors with the exception of agriculture, has been accomplished.
Agrarian reform has given the peasants ownership cf the land and eliminated
major inequalities in the pattern of landholdings. Successful efforts were



-2-
also made to raise the standard of living of a population of about 30 mil-
lion by reducing inequalities in the distribution of income, keeping the
prices of basic commodities stable and widening the scope of education
and health services.
6.        However, these achievements in social fields are endangered by
slow economic growth. From 1963-65 to 1972-74, average annual growth of
GDP was only 2.4% in real terms, i.e. hardly above population growth which
was 2.2%. Output of productive sectors was still more disappointing. The
stagnation of agricultural production (which accounts for 90% of total ex-
port earnings), combined with the growth of population, has led to a steady
dwindling of the export surplus. This is vividly illustrated in the case of
rice which still accounts for nearly half of total exports. Before the Sec-
ond World War, Burma exported 3 million tons of rice a year; in the early
sixties this had dropped to 1.5-2 million tons. In 1974, the volume of
rice exports was only 225,000 tons.
7.        The volume of total exports had fallen by over 60% since the
beginning of the sixties and, due to unfavorable movements in the terms
of trade, the purchasing power of exports had fallen by over 70%. In
1974, there was an improvement in the terms of trade which to some
extent cushioned the effect of the decline in the export volume. The
resulting foreign exchange constraint has deprived the industrial sector
of essential imports of raw materials, spare parts and components. From
1963-65 to 1972-74, the volume of industrial production increased by an
average of less than 1% a year.
8.        The root of Burma's current economic difficulties lies in the
stagnation of agriculture brought about by Government's pricing policy
and investment decisions. As a means to ensure a given pattern of income
distribution, prices for compulsory delivery to the Government of many
agricultural commodities were set at a low level. Farmers, especially
paddy farmers, were left with little savings for maintenance and invest-
ment and intensive methods of cultivation were discouraged. Inadequate
private investment in agriculture was not offset by investments in the
public sector. Only 8% of public investment (equivalent to about 1.6%
of net agricultural output) was allocated to agriculture in 1973. In
the Burmese context, industrialization at the pace adopted was probably
premature because it could only be based upon a prosperous agricultural
sector.
9.        Growing scarcities of domestically produced and imported goods
created a flourishing black market which led to increased unwillingness
of farmers to sell to the Government, resulting in a widespread diversion
of goods - including those produced by public sector undertakings - away
from the public sector distribution channels. Since official distribu-
tion agencies are supposed to be the main Government revenue earners
through the collection of indirect taxes and their operating surpluses,
this development eroded Government's tax base. The current revenue/GNP
ratio declined from 18% in 1966/67, to 15.5% in 1969/70, and to 10.5% in



- 3 -
1974/75. The aggravation of the budgetary situation is best illustrated
by the fact that in 1970/71 total Government revenue financed 75% of total
Government spending (current and capital expenditure), in 1972/73 60%, and
1974/75 only 50%, according to budget estimates. Gross domestic savings
came down from an average 10% of GNP recorded in the early 70's to about
7.5% in 1974.
10.       Pricing, resource mobilization and resource allocation are the
three basic economic policy issues facing the Government. The Government
is well aware of the problems and has recently taken measures to solve
them. On pricing, the Government has been raising procurement prices of
agricultural commodities so as to narrow the gap between official and black
market prices; this has helped the Government to procure about 2.8 million
tons of paddy in 1974/75 as compared with 1.5 million tons in 1973/74 and
1.2 million tons in 1972/73. In January 1975, the Government devalued its
currency by 33% against the US dollar. Reforms are being carried out in
the organization of the public sector undertakings; they are to be oper-
ated on a commercial basis and receive financial autonomy so that they
will perform better both in financial and production terms.
11.       Resource mobilization in Burma is closely linked to the successful
implementation of the official price policy. The above-mentioned reduction
of price distortions will help the Government regairL control of trade and
therefore restore the tax base.    In addition, the Government has decided
to introduce a turn-over tax. The Government also substantially increased
interest rates on April 1, 1975 from 3.5% to 6-8% per annum for saving de-
posits and up to 12% for loans to public enterprises.   As far as resource
allocation is concerned, the 1974/75 budget has already included an increase
in the share of public investment to agriculture from 8% in the previous year
to 13%. It is Government's declared policy to give agriculture greater prior-
ity.
12.       Substantial foreign transfers of resources into Burma are required
in order to accelerate its economic development. Given Burma's low income
level and the severity of the foreign exchange cnnstraint, these transfers
should be on as concessionary terms as possible and should cover a part of
local cost requirements. During the last five yearn; aid commitments have
averaged $60 million a year. Total external debt as of March 1975 was $537
million, including an undisbursed balance of about S217 million. Despite
this low indebtedness, debt service ratio is about 20% because of the fall
in exports. Burma's gross foreign exchange reserves were estimated at $144
million in September 1975, equivalent to twelve monichs' imports, based on
the exceptionally low level of 1974/75 imports.
13.       Burma's development potential is appreciable.   The Burmese popula-
tion is well educated. Production potential in agriculture is excellent,
especially for paddy.  Exploitation of forest wealth is under way and could
be expanded further. Mineral resources are not yet identified sufficiently,
but they are likely to be substantial. Off-shore crude oil exploration has
recently been stepped up with bilateral assistance. The Bank Group in close



- 4 -
cooperation with the IMF is pursuing discussions with the Government regard-
ing further improvement in economic policies which would help develop Burma's
very promising potential for economic development. The Burmese Government
is now preparing a three-year economic program which will include new
policies and measures aiming at more rapid economic growth.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, of IFC in 1956, and
of IDA in 1962. Between 1956 and 1961 the Bank made three loans totalling
US$33.1 million, all for transportation projects. A loan for the Port of
Rangoon helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and storage
facilities, and the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment. Two
loans helped finance the postwar reconstruction and dieselization of the
railways. All three projects were satisfactorily completed and the loans
fully disbursed by FY68. No lending was requested or made between 1962
and 1973. Since 1973 IDA has made five credits totalling US$95.0 million.
In June 1973, IDA made two credits totalling US$33.0 million, both for
transportation projects. One credit is helping to rehabilitate the in-
land waterways fleet, the other is helping to finance the rehabilitation
of the railways' assets and acquisition of locomotives and rolling stock.
In June 1974, an IDA credit of US$17.0 million was made for an irrigation
project which provided small irrigation pumps and minor flood embankments
to increase the production of rice and jute for export, and other crops.
In July 1974, IDA made a credit of US$24.0 million for a forestry project.
This is helping to finance the rehabilitation and improvement of extraction
of timber for export. In May 1975, a US$21.0 million IDA credit was made
for the rehabilitation of the telecommunications sector. IFC has made no
investments in Burma, nor are any currently planned. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of October 31, 1975
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects; implementation of these
projects is proceeding satisfactorily. In addition, the Bank is Executing
Agency for a UNDP-financed multisectoral (umbrella) preinvestment and tech-
nical assistance project aimed at the development of a pipeline of priority
projects for external assistance, as well as a survey for the improvement of
navigational channels in the Rangoon River.
15.       The proposed Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most
immediate constraints to growth and particularly at increasing and diver-
sifying production for export in order to alleviate the shortage of foreign
exchange. To achieve this, the Bank Group is placing primary emphasis on
the development of the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors. The Bank
Group is also financing infrastructure improvements, such as transportation
and telecommunications, mainly to rehabilitate the facilities whose inade-
quacy has been increasingly impeding economic development.
16.       Two projects, for paddy production and mining, were appraised in
October/November 1975. The paddy project would help rehabilitation of paddy



-5-
land in lower Burma through construction and improvement of minor flood
embankments, drainage channels, land clearing, provision of irrigation pumps
and strengthening of supporting services. The mining project would comprise
rehabilitation and expansion of small scale tin mining.
17.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 15% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 5% of debt service. In five years,
the Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise
to about 20% and its share in the debt service to fall to about 2-3%.
PART III - AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK IN BURMA
18.       The agricultural sector in Burma dominates the economy (about 40%
of gross domestic product (GDP), 90% of exports and 70% of total employment).
The failure of crop production to grow sufficiently in recent years (about
1.9% a year) underlies the stagnation of economic growth. In the past dec-
ade, rice production in particular has failed to expand and a marked decrease
in export earnings from agricultural products has resulted (from US$220 M in
1962 to US$120 M in 1974). Small farmers with two to ten acres, growing rice
as their main crop, occupy most agricultural land; at present low levels of
productivity, many are little more than subsistence farmers. Past agricul-
tural policies of the Government of Burma (GOB) have emphasized land redis-
tribution and the establishment of controls over both rice procurement and
the supply of farm inputs. GOB is making new efforts to stimulate agricul-
tural production by liberalizing crop procurement prices (e.g., the price
of paddy was increased by 50% in July 1974) and encouraging greater use of
irrigation and high yielding varieties of rice.
19.       Though the direct contribution of livestock to GDP is small,
livestock play a critical role in agriculture. Cattle and buffalo provide
virtually all draft power for land cultivation and rural transport. A
deficiency in bovine numbers and productivity limits crop areas and delays
sowing dates, thereby restricting both crop yields and the frequency of
double cropping. In addition inadequate domestic production leads to a
strong and unsatisfied demand for imported livestock products, particu-
larly milk products and tallow.
20.       Between 1968/69 and 1972/73, according to cifficial statistics,
the national cattle and buffalo herd increased by around 2% per annum, the
number of goats and sheep declined, and that of pigs and poultry increased
substantially. Ownership of all forms of livestock is widespread and char-
acterized by small individual herds and flocks, cattle and buffalo being
kept primarily for draft purposes and pigs and poultry for subsistence and
sale. Though accurate figures are not available, mortality from infectious
disease is high. Animal disease control is limited by lack of vaccine,
equipment and transport. Livestock productivity is also adversely influenced
by low weaning rates, arising from poor nutrition due to lack of improved
pasture and other fodder.



- 6 -
21.       Primary responsibility for livestock development has traditionally
been assigned to the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science
(DAHVS) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF). This unit, headed
by a director, has reasonable technical expertise but inadequate funds and
lacks authority. Its work program is heavily oriented towards animal health.
Animal production has received little organized support, and limited invest-
ment in this sector has not addressed specific problems and potentials.
Essentially, insufficient planning, lack of coordination among departments,
and inadequate emphasis on priorities has resulted in low livestock produc-
tivity. To remedy these deficiencies, GOB recently established a new agency,
the Livestock Development and Marketing Corporation (LDMC), which has direct
responsibility for livestock production, non-veterinary livestock development
(e.g. pasture development, waterpoint construction and feed processing), and
livestock product processing and marketing. The LDMC is to play a key role
in the planning and development of the livestock sector.
22.       Livestock processing facilities are few, old and poorly equipped.
There are two municipal slaughterhouses in Rangoon and one municipal slaugh-
ter slab in Mandalay. To avoid depletion of draft power, slaughter of cattle
and buffalo is officially restricted to non-productive animals. Demand for
meat is strong but, until the availability of slaughter animals increases,
the improvement of meat processing facilities would be of little value.
23.       Milk processing is limited to a small GOB sterilization plant
(capacity 900 1/hour) in Rangoon, a GOB condensory (capacity 1,400 1/shift)
near Maymyo and about 150 small privately or cooperatively owned condensories,
mainly around Mandalay. Demand for milk in the city markets of Rangoon and
Mandalay has been increasing, particularly as traditional imports of sweet-
ened condensed milk are limited. City markets are supplied with raw milk,
usually adulterated, which passes through a chain of middlemen at uncon-
trolled prices. Supplies show a marked seasonal fluctuation; they average
about 50,000 1/day in Rangoon. Imports of dairy products, consisting pri-
marily of milk powder for infants (3.6 M lb in 1973) and condensed milk
(0.3 M lb in 1973), have been declining due to lack of foreign exchange
(total dairy imports were 37.7 M lb in 1969, only 4.1 M lb in 1973).
24.       The two immediate problems facing the livestock industry of Burma
are to increase the quantity and quality of draft cattle available for crop
cultivation and to substitute the present imports of processed milk by domestic
production. The inputs required to bring about these production increases
are in very limited local supply, e.g. there are few dairy animals with the
genetic potential for high milk production, feed supplies are critically
short, trained and experienced personnel are below requirements, research
information is lacking, and the extension, artificial insemination (AI),
vaccine production and market and processing services are insufficient.
25.       Dairy cattle improvement is largely dependent on an expansion in
AI services, for AI provides the only practical means of producing reasonable
numbers of specialized dairy animals in a short period of time. To be of use,



- 7 -
breed improvement must be accompanied by improved feeding, husbandry and mar-
keting services. At present the village farmer has little incentive to pro-
duce milk for the market because milk collection at the village level is
poorly organized. The establishment of producer milk cooperatives to col-
lect and sell village milk could provide a promising approach to the market-
ing problem.
26.       Improvement of the fodder base involves mainly an improvement in
the quantity and quality of the grazing on which local cattle subsist. Suf-
ficient trials have now been carried out in Burma to show that low cost pas-
ture improvement is practical and financially attractive.
27.       An increase in the number and quality of draft animals on small-
holdings is mainly dependent on increasing fodder supplies, associated with
incentives to increase the breeding productivity of the existing cattle and
buffalo population. The additional demand for draft power resulting from
incentives of relatively high paddy prices now prevailing will encourage
increases in cattle and buffalo prices, while an imrproved market outlet for
slaughter stock would encourage farmers to retain more productive breeding
females than they do at present.
28.       The potential benefits inherent in increased fodder supplies, in
breeding better stock and in improving market outlets will only be realized
as Government services to the industry are equally improved. Better disease
control facilities, and expanded extension, research and training services
are required. The rehabilitation of the Government: farm network would facil-
itate the basic rural infrastructure needed to supply these inputs to the
smallholder.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The project was identified and prepared with the assistance of the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program which sent missions to Burma in April and October
1973. The project was appraised by a Bank mission in October 1974. A report
entitled "Burma-Appraisal of Livestock Project" (No. 783a-BA) dated December 1,
1975, is being circulated separately to the ExecutLve Directors. A credit and
project summary is attached as Annex III.
30.       At negotiations held in Washington in November 1975, the Govern-
ment was represented by a delegation led by Dr. Bo Lay, Deputy Minister of
Agriculture and Forests.
Project Description
31.       The proposed project, the first in Burma in the livestock sector,
would help lay the base for the development of the sector. The project is
directed primarily to the transfer of technical improvements required to
increase livestock production. It would increase the quantity and quality



- 8 -
of livestock in the main agricultural area of Central Burma in order to
provide increased draft power for crop production and transport; milk and
beef production would also be increased, resulting in annual foreign ex-
change savings of about US$4 million at project maturity. The project area
contains more than 50% of the national herd (about 5 M head of cattle and
buffalo), about 80% of the cultivated land as well as the principal milk
and cattle markets (Rangoon and Mandalay). Investments under the project,
mainly in the public sector, would be made to improve veterinary, livestock
extension and marketing services, vaccination facilities, pastures and
water points, research and training facilities, and dairy farming and process-
ing. The project components are:
(a) development of a veterinary and livestock extension
service to cover about 375,000 bovines owned by
250,000 farm families (most with holdings of 5 acres
or less);
(b) production of vaccine against animal diseases;
(c) improvement of about 20,000 acres of communal pasture
in about 300 villages;
(d) construction of water points in about 50 villages in
Upper Burma, where lack of drinking water frequently
limits optimum land use and livestock numbers;
(e) development of ten livestock development centers (LDC)
for the multiplication and supply to farmers of improved
stock, pasture seeds, artificial insemination (AI) services
and practical pasture and livestock production research
studies; the importation of improved cattle, pigs and
poultry, and cattle semen for the LDC and specialized
dairy farms would be an integral part of project activities;
(f) development of smallholder dairy production based on cross-
breeding and improved nutrition together with the construction
of two specialized dairy farms, as well as small dairy units
on four selected LDC; improved milk marketing and processing
would be provided by constructing and operating, near Rangoon,
a milk processing plant, and associated milk collection
centers whereas a feasibility study for a further milk plant
near Mandalay would also be undertaken under the project; and
(g) provision of technical assistance and training facilities
for diploma and undergraduate veterinary students.
Project Execution
32.       The project would be implemented over a period of five years by
three main GOB agencies:



- 9 -
(a) the Livestock Development and Marketing Corlporation
(LDMC); for livestock research, stock multiplication
on ten livestock development centers, two dairy farms,
communal pasture improvement, the creation of a new
milk processing unit, and village stock water supplies;
(b) the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Science (DAHVS) of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forests; for expanded vaccine production, diagnostic
services and a greatly strengthened field service;
(c) the Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Science (IAHVS) of the Ministry of Education; for
strengthening training on animal hubandry and
veterinary science at the university level.
For project control and coordination, a Project Policy Committee would be
established under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture
and Forests. It would include representatives from the Ministries of Agri-
culture and Forests, Planning and Finance, and Education. The Committee
would lay down appropriate policies, supervise, and monitor project imple-
mentation. To carry out these functions the Project Policy Committee would
have a small secretariat headed by a livestock project coordinator. This
secretariat would also assist other project agencies to carry out International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement procedures and would submit disbursement
applications to IDA on behalf of GOB. Establishment of the Project Policy
Committee and recruitment of the livestock project co-ordinator would be
conditions of effectiveness.
33.       In order to provide effective support to project activities, GOB
would engage about 19 man-years of consultant staff. The design and construc-
tion of the milk plant would be carried out under consultant guidance. Spe-
cific technical activities involving vaccine and diagnostic services, pasture
and livestock research would be supported by short term consultancies. To
improve the quality of livestock and veterinary education, which is particu-
larly weak because past educational policies in Burma concentrated mainly
on crop production, the project would also provide for consultant services
for undertaking a critical review of the existing training programs. Subject
to this review, the project would provide for overseas fellowships for teach-
ing staff and consultant staff to strengthen teaching programs.
Cost, Financing and Relending
34.       Total project cost is US$12.8 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$6.4 million equivalent; the local cost component
of US$6.4 million equivalent includes about US$1 million for import duties
and taxes. The proposed IDA credit of US$7.5 million would finance the
full foreign exchange component and US$1.1 million equivalent of local
currency costs, or about 60% of total project costs (64% of total costs net



- 10 -
of taxes). IDA financing of this modest level of local costs is justified
as mentioned in paragraph 12; it will also respond to GOB's efforts in
undertaking this first stage of an innovative and comprehensive livestock
development program.
35.       GOB would establish a project account with the Ministry of Plan-
ning and Finance through which the proceeeds of the IDA credit would be
channeled. IDA funds used directly by GOB agencies for activities which
do not produce revenue (US$5.0 M) would be regarded as incremental budget
allocations. Funds used by LDMC for activities which generate direct rev-
enue (US$2.5 M used for livestock development centers, dairy farms and milk
processing facilities) would be relent by GOB, under a subsidiary loan agree-
ment, for 15 years including 5 years of grace with interest at 8.5% p.a.;
LDMC would bear the exchange risk. The GOB contribution to the project would
be K 33.1 M (US$5.3 M), comprising loan funds of K 13.4 M (US$2.2 M) to LDMC
and K 19.7 M (US$3.1 M) as incremental budget allocations.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       All contracts in excess of US$50,000 for equipment, vehicles, and
imported construction materials would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Milk proc-
essing equipment and its installation would be procured on turn-key contract,
also by ICB. Smaller items (less than US$50,000), for which ICB is not prac-
ticable, would be purchased following Government procurement procedures, which
are satisfactory. Imported livestock and semen would be procured on the basis
of price quotations from at least three countries where suitable animals are
available. Because of the absence of private contractors, civil works, which
are quite small and scattered over a wide area, would be carried out by GOB
force account and by the GOB Construction Corporation.
37.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against 100%
of foreign expenditures, or 80% of local expenditures for imported goods
procured locally, of transport, farm, milk processing, training and research
equipment, livestock, and semen and veterinary medicines; 80% of construction
costs for the Rangoon milk plant, and of civil works executed by force account
(teaching and boarding facilities, veterinary posts and water development);
and 100% of contract expenditures of consultants engaged for the project and
of overseas training and travel for Burmese staff. A condition of disbursement
against the veterinary education component would be that the GOB and IDA had
agreed on an overall veterinary education program to be developed under the
project. In order to avoid disbursement delays for this component, the credit
would include retroactive financing for consultant services to undertake a
review of the existing veterinary education and livestock technology programme.
The amount of retroactive financing would be up to a maximum of US$100,000
equivalent.
Benefits and Justification
38.       The primary benefit from the project would be an increase in
the quality and number of draft animals for crop production and transport.



- 11 -
Through crossbreeding and pasture improvement milk and beef production, mainly
by small farmers, would also be increased, milk production by about 11,000
tons and beef production by 5,000 tons per year (20,000 slaughter animals).
The project would markedly improve the quality and value of livestock owned
by about 250,000 small farm families, most with 5 ac cr less. Assuming proj-
ect benefits of K 61 M per annum, average benefits per family are K 244
(US$60); this compares with average present income levels of about K 1,500.
The project would lead the way to further projects for improving livestock
production. The annual value of incremental production at project maturity,
about year 6, would be about US$10 million, of which about 40% would be
foreign exchange savings. No problems in marketing thte project output are
expected. The project would provide a small amount of permanent employment
(for about 500) and temporary employment (about 750 man-years for water point
construction and pasture development). The estimated rate of return to the
economy would be about 26%; it is not significantly sensitive to cost and
price changes.
39.       Mainly by improving rice production through better and more
reliable draft power for cultivation, the proposed prcject would help GOB
to stimulate overall agricultural production. The extension and research
activities in pasture and water point development, in breed improvement
and disease control, would also encourage sound animal husbandry in vil-
lages outside the project area, the value of which cannot be quantified
with reasonable accuracy.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANiD AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Union of
Burma and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed credit are beirLg distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
41.       Special features of this credit are referred to in paragraphs 34
and 37 of this Report.
42.       Additional conditions of effectiveness include establishment of
the Project Policy Committee, recruitment of a livestock project coordinator
in consultation with IDA, and execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement on
behalf of the Borrower and LDMC (Section 6.01 of the DCA).
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
