F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The proposed loan will support significant and sustainable reforms in key areas of public
administration. These reforms would expand fiscal space for public investments. They
will also allow the State to use more effectively its own resources and those transferred
by the Federal Government to undertake a program of targeted capital investments and
improve its management capability. Such improvements are a necessary condition for
eventually meeting the high order objectives of reducing poverty levels and achieving
levels of economic growth comparable to those of other states in the region. In addition,
the proposed loan will help the State to comply with the Federal Fiscal Responsibility
Law (FRL), a purpose shared by Brazil#s Federal Authorities.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Background

1.      Located in the Northeast (NE) region, Alagoas is a small state with 27.8 thousand
   2
km (0.3 percent of Brazil’s territory), a population of 3 million inhabitants (1.5 percent
of Brazilian population) and a GDP amounting to R$15.8 billion in 2006 (US$7 billion or
0.7 percent of Brazil’s GDP)1. Public administration services and the sugarcane-ethanol
cluster are the most important state economic activities.
2.      Alagoas is one of the least developed states in Brazil. In 2006, its per capita GDP
achieved R$5,200 (or US$2,200)2, the third lowest in the country, only 40 percent of the
national average and 80 percent of the Northeast Region average. Income inequality is
extremely high with a Gini index of 0.59, one of the highest in the country (Gini for
Brazil is 0.55). Low income per capita and high income inequality resulted in the highest
poverty rate in the country, with 48 percent of the state population living below the
poverty line (the national poverty rate is 22 percent).
3.      Medium term economic and social development trends have been poor. Alagoas’
economic growth rate in the 90’s and 00’s decades lagged behind both the regional and
national averages. From 1985 to 2006 economic growth in both the NE region and for
Brazil as a whole reached 2.6 percent. During the same period, the annual growth rate of
the Alagoas’s economy was only 1.8 percent, the lowest economic growth rate in the NE.
4.      Aligned with slow GDP growth, the State has experienced for nearly two decades
one of the most difficult fiscal situations in Brazil. Excessive personnel expenditures
resulted in continuous fiscal deficits and high indebtedness. This, in turn, had hampered
the Government of Alagoas’ (GoA) ability to invest and constrained the State’s capacity
to provide adequate economic infrastructure and public service delivery.
5.     Moreover, high levels of current expenses and lack of access to credit in the last
decade have led to a strong dependence on federal capital transfers to finance investment
spending. These fiscal constraints are causing a downward spiral whereby weak state
capacity was leading to a reduction in the quality of public services, lower economic
growth, which led to lower revenues and a more precarious fiscal equation.

Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.      The proposed operation was fully consistent with and closely linked to the
objectives of the Brazil Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2008-2011. Sound
macroeconomic management, fiscal reform, efficient public sector management, and
good governance were key pillars of the CPS strategy for achieving inclusive economic
growth. CPS also identified support for the states and improvement in fiscal management
as two of the most important areas of Bank engagement. Furthermore, the partnership

strategy was developed in close consultation with the federal authorities, responding both
to the state needs and requests by the National Treasury Secretariat (STN).
7.       The proposed operation also reinforced fiscal discipline at the subnational level.
As a result of a strong fiscal adjustment and good revenue performance, in 2008 Alagoas
reached the FRL limit on indebtedness and met all of the targets under the Fiscal
Adjustment Program (PAF) for the period 2007-09. The DPL became possible due to
good fiscal performance in 2007 and 2008 opened space for new borrowing. Moreover,
the loan supported measures aimed at increasing the state’s ability to satisfy FRL
restrictions and the requirements of the debt renegotiation contract signed with STN.
8.     Lastly, by supporting one of the poorest sub-national governments in Brazil, the
operation also responded to an IEG study which assessed the Bank’s engagement with
sub-national governments in large federal client countries. IEG recommended that the
Bank deepen its involvement in the lesser developed sub-nationals to enhance operations’
poverty impact, to provide the Bank with tested prototypes and to create desirable
demonstration effects for the broader community of lagging states.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
9.      The proposed loan will support significant and sustainable reforms in key areas of
public administration. These reforms would expand fiscal space for public investments.
They will also allow the State to use more effectively its own resources and those
transferred by the Federal Government to undertake a program of targeted capital
investments and improve its management capability. Such improvements are a necessary
condition for eventually meeting the high order objectives of reducing poverty levels and
achieving levels of economic growth comparable to those of other states in the region. In
addition, the proposed loan will help the State to comply with the Federal Fiscal
Responsibility Law (FRL), a purpose shared by Brazil’s Federal Authorities.
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
10.     PDO was not revised.
1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
11.    The operation supported essential policy reforms and institutional strengthening
actions in 10 areas within four broad components of the government program: fiscal
adjustment, human resource management, social security and public sector
modernization. Table 1 depicts only tranche conditions for the sake of simplicity,
although the original table included benchmarks as well.

  PDO indicators are written in bold and the last column indicates whether the indicator was achieved or
not. The operation also has two key outcome indicators listed in the loan and program summary that are
slightly different from the results indicator matrix. These are primary balance/ NCR instead of the nominal
value of primary balance and net operating balance/ NCR instead of the nominal value of gross operating
value. The ICR team decided to report on the indicators as they are purported in the result indicator matrix.
5
  The original results indicator matrix included two baseline years: 2007 and 2008. The ICR team opted to
judge the improvements against the 2008 figures. Thus, only the 2008 baseline is reported in the table.
6
  PAF stand for Adjusting and Restructuring Fiscal Plan. It is a three year rolling fiscal plan signed between
the state and STN as part of the 1997-99 state debt bailout promoted by the federal government. Therefore
all indicators with PAF in brackets mean that the indicator was calculated according to the PAF
methodology as opposed to the ones that have FRL (Fiscal Responsibility Law) in brackets, which were
calculated according to the FRL reporting standards. The main difference is the scope. FRL methodology
encompasses all state government bodies and corresponding revenues (except non treasury dependent state
owned companies), while PAF covers only treasury revenues such tax and transfers.
7
  The original baseline number was 54 and the target was 51. The team decided to adjust the baseline and
the target since the original numbers could not be reconstructed and it seemed to the ICR team that there
was a problem of scale in the numbers. Thus, based on the latest information provided, the baseline would
amount to 64 in 2008, thus showing that the state dependence on transfers has in fact decreased.
8
  The 2010 and 2011 GDP figures will only be available by year end 2012 and 2013 respectively. Therefore,
the ICR team estimated the state nominal GDP from the national GDP (already available from official
sources) assuming that the Alagoas share in the Brazilian GDP remained the same as in 2009.

Component 1: Consolidating the Fiscal Adjustment
15.    GoA has maintained good fiscal status under the Brazil’s FRL not only during the
time of the second tranche disbursement, as required by the tranche release condition, but
throughout the operation and most importantly, even after the loan was closed.
16.     Fiscal Balance. Five out of the six indicators were achieved. The primary balance
for the consolidated public sector calculated according to the FRL standards was the only
target missed. This however does not signal frailty of the GoA fiscal management, but
rather a problem with the target set. The primary balance according to the FRL is always
lower than in the PAF standard due to methodological issues. However, in the results
matrix the values for primary balance targets in the LRF are greater than in the PAF.
Thus, had the operation set an LRF primary balance target compatible with the
corresponding PAF target the GOA would have probably achieved it.
17.     Revenue. The main reform supported was the introduction of a fact-based
analytical approach to tax inspection. It also allowed feedback information to flow from
tax agents in charge of inspecting taxpayers to those responsible for planning tax actions.
This approach called, GMR (Gestão Matricial de Receitas) allowed the State to obtain
real gains in tax revenue collection, even in 2009, during the crisis, when tax revenue
grew 2.5 percent in real terms. As a result, all indicators relating to this area were
achieved.
18.     Expenditures. All targets relating to expenditure control were achieved. Good
revenue performance helped, but improvement in processes done by the GoA is not to be
neglected also. Since 2007, the GoA adopted budget procedures that have helped to
control expenditures and deliver balanced budgets. Sectoral spending ceilings have been
set and enforced by the Secretariat of Finance. Increases in payroll and recurrent
expenditures are decided on a collegial basis by the central secretaries and line secretaries
involved with Governor participation and only when allowed by FRL limits.
Expenditures are no longer canceled after the State has committed to them and
obligations owed by the government are honored in due time.


                                              9
19.     The GoA has showed some progress on procurement reforms. The delay in
government purchasing was one of the bottlenecks identified for low government
efficiency. Even though the targets were not achieved, progress was reported on both
indicators. The number of items purchased through electronic price registration increased
from 653 to 906, while the time to complete a reverse auction decreased from 146 days in
2008 to 93 in 2011.
Component 2: Improving Human Resources Management
20.   The objective of this component was twofold. The first one was to tackle the
expenditures wastes due to poor controls on the payroll and the second was to institute an
HR policy adequate to the State’s needs and geared to enhance civil service performance.
21.    Information System and Management of Payroll. The state acted promptly to
address the issues on payroll management and control. A census and audit of the payroll
was done. The government also acted on the audit findings by sending them to the Public
Prosecutor office. All this measures were tranche release conditions and were complied
by GoA. Therefore, the fact that the targets for the number of civil servants registered in
the census and number of audits were missed reflect mostly poorly set targets rather than
problems with government actions. On the other hand, the missed target for savings on
payroll reflects a government decision to send the findings to the Public Prosecutor
Office and wait for its decision, while the GoA could have taken administrative measures
to curb irregular payments pari passu. Nevertheless, according to preliminary estimates
supplied to the Bank the potential savings amounted to nearly two percent of the payroll.
22.     Additionally this component foresaw the procurement of a new HR system and its
implementation as first and second tranche benchmarks. After lengthy discussions, the
GoA decided to procure the system instead of developing it in-house. The
implementation of the new system was not as smooth as expected and to make matters
worse the IT provider of the former system went bankrupt, which hindered the state of
having the two systems running in parallel for a transitioning period. This problem
drained a lot of resources from the GoA that could otherwise be devoted to other
improvements. Currently, the state decided to have its IT company customize the new
system to solve the problems identified, while at the same time it managed to have the
old system operating again.
23.     Definition of a Strategy for Human Resources Management. This component did
not include any tranche release condition, but only benchmarks. They related to the
establishment of an HR committee to oversee the GoA HR policy and the formulation of
a workforce planning. The state made clear efforts to implement such policies. It hired
consultancies to execute the workforce (WF) planning and staff training. Nonetheless, the
intermediate products delivered for the workforce planning were unsatisfactory and the
contract was revoked. Therefore, the target on WF was missed.
24.     As part of the enhancing civil service performance and adequate HR policy, the
results matrix for this area also included indicators on training, absenteeism, and strikes.
The target on training was missed because the state made available “off the shelf? courses
supplied by the vendor, skipping the preliminary task of defining the matrix of
competencies for the State Government. Thus, out of the first 2,000 training spots made
available, only 1,000 servants enrolled and even less workers – 400 servants – concluded


                                            10
the training. The baseline for the indicator on absenteeism was not recorded even though
the GoA provided the numbers. Nonetheless, the abovementioned problems with the HR
system prevented the government to report reliable figures on this indicator. The fourth
indicator was not achieved since the HR committee did not prove itself very effective.
Lastly, the number of work days lost due to strikes was reduced due to the
implementation of a permanent negotiating committee with the civil servants’ union. The
Bank will continue to support the state in the issues of training and WF planning in the
next loan.
Component 3: Reducing the State Social Security Deficits
25.     One big source of imbalance in Alagoas has been the civil servants retirement
system. In order to curb the fiscal pressures arising from pensions, the DPL supported
structural, administrative and parametric reforms in the social security system. Broadly
speaking, the DPL required the adoption of federally mandated rules.
26.     Administrative Reforms – The single administrator (AL Previdência) was
instituted by state legislation and it is now operational. The cross-checking of the state
pension database with federal databases was also accomplished, however due to IT
technical problems between the two systems, as documented by the second tranche
release document, only one cross-checking was possible. Lastly, the GoA fulfilled all
requirements to obtain the CRP11 without judicial recourse. Nevertheless, the CRP was
not issued administratively because it required the state to drop a judicial claim against
the federal government. After the second tranche disbursement, the other state powers
(Legislative, Judiciary, …) refused to hand over the administration of its pension benefits
to AL Previdência, which in turn led the state to lose the CRP, as shown in Table 3.
Although this recourse can be extended, it is expected that all powers will reach an
agreement as it has occurred in other states.
27.     Parametric reforms. The state implemented new rules to calculate survivor and
pension benefits, as well as to grant exemptions of the pensions’ contribution, all in
accordance with federal legislation. As a result, the cash deficit of the civil servants
pension system was reduced as envisaged. However, some of the indicators under this
component were not met, namely the expected increase in civil servants contributions did
not materialize while the ratio of pensioners and survivors to active personnel increased
more than expected. It is not clear whether the targets of the corresponding indicators
were inadequately defined or whether there were other factors or even inaccurate data
that countervailed the positive impact of the reforms that the loan supported.
28.     Structural Reforms. The most successful reform was the transition –on a phasing-
out basis- from a pay as you go (PAYG) to a funded pension system. The State’s pension
fund for new employees (those hired after December 31, 2006) shows an actuarial surplus
as of R$ 52.5 Million. Naturally, there is a large actuarial deficit for the system as a

security system is in compliance with the federal rules.



                                                      11
 whole, but this is due to the fact that the great majority of employees, pensioners and
 survivors are still financed in a PAYG way. Lastly, the current figures for the actuarial
 deficit of the state are much larger than the baseline and the target, because the state
 failed to inform the deficit on comparable standards to the baseline and target.
Component 4: Strengthening Public Sector Management
 29.     The objective of this component was to address failures in the budget process that
 were compromising the allocative and operational efficiency of the budget. In order to do
 so, a Bank diagnostic and action plan was undertaken together with the client.
 30.     Strengthening the Process of Budget Elaboration and Execution. The approval of
 the action plan, the establishment of a steering committee to oversee the plan and the
 effective implementation of at least five out of nine actions were tranche release
 conditions for the budget area, all fulfilled by the client.
 31.     The Bank adopted the PEFA indicators to monitor the developments in this area.
 The aggregate expenditure out-turns compared with original approved budget scored A in
 2010 and slightly deteriorated in 2011, scoring B. The result, however, still represents an
 advance relative to 2008. Through the implementation of two legal decrees (Decretos No.
 6.582/10 and 6.581/10), the State managed to adequately define planning competencies
 between central and line secretariats. The state also succeeded in the formulation of
 guidelines for preparation of PPA, LDO and LOA. A course on planning and budget was
 delivered by Fundação João Pinheiro and manuals on the elaboration of PPA, LDO and
 LOA were concluded in November 2010 and submitted for approval in 2011, which led
 the state to score A in the second and third indicator for area 4.1.
 32.    Regarding Macro-Fiscal Programming, during 2010 a finance specialist was
 designated to work on the statistical monitoring and to formulate the State of Alagoas
 Fiscal Policy. The creation of an Office of Studies and Projections, subordinated to the
 Secretary of Finance in 2011 should begin to consolidate the work on macro-fiscal
 programming. The definition of budgetary ceilings was applied during the budget
 elaboration in 2010. The use of this tool was extended in 2011 and also applied for the
 PPA 2012-2015 elaboration, justifying the “A? mark in the last indicator. Currently,
 SEPLANDE clearly recognizes the benefits of budgetary ceilings.
 33.    Introduce Results Based Management and Strengthen Strategic Investments. This
 area envisaged the improvement of government service delivery through the gradual
 adoption of intensive monitoring in a selected set of government programs. The tranche
 release conditions required the establishment of an office to perform the intensive
 monitoring of program, the amendment of the multiannual plan to include the priority
 programs to be monitored as well as a satisfactory execution of it.
 34.     The targets on the number of priority programs established and monitored
 intensively were achieved. On the other hand the indicators on the execution of the
 priority programs, measured by the amount spent and the degree of budget execution
 were not achieved. In 2011, the priority programs’ budget execution reached 57 percent,
 nearly reaching the 60 percent target set for 2010.
 35.     Even though the numerical targets were not met, the monitoring of the portfolio of
 priority projects was substantially improved, due to the creation of the “Diretoria de


                                             12
Gestão Estratégica - Escritório de Projetos? in the Secretariat of Planning, just to
implement this activity. More importantly, the rationale and the know-how behind it were
absorbed by the state government, signaling its sustainability.
36.     In 2011, after a significant administrative reform the “Diretoria de Gestão
Estratégica?, was superseded by the “Superintendência de Modernização da Gestão?.
This office is in charge of the intensive program monitoring in the new “Alagoas Tem
Pressa?, which is the main government strategy. Moreover, the results-based
management strategy was deepened, focused on the performances of the State
Government, guiding the Government to achieve results and including such tools as
strategic planning, budgeting planning and implementation, results monitoring and
evaluation.
2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
37.   Government commitment was strong, however changes in the secretariat and in
key positions at times slowed program implementation and contributed to institutional
memory loss.
38.     Background analysis was sound. The design of operation tackled the critical
issues. The HR component was affected the most by changes in government and external
factors such as the bankruptcy of the former payroll IT provider and inability of
consultants to deliver high quality outputs to the tasks contracted. Nonetheless, the
component was overly optimistic in the sense that it required a very low capacity
government to implement policy reforms (workforce planning) that had not been
implemented in any other state in Brazil. Lastly, the risks faced by the operation were the
ones identified in the preparation stage.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
39.     M&E design. The results indicator matrix was composed of adequate indicators to
monitor progress toward the PDO in all components. Nonetheless, the number of
indicators in the matrix (44) and the redundancy of some of them (Primary Balance –
PAF and FRL) indicate that some indicators could have been dropped without
compromising the M&E design.
40.    M&E Implementation and utilization. The indicators that were collected properly
and used more widespread were the ones already in place before the operation, such as
the ones mandated by FRL and PAF. The GoA exhibited some difficulties in collecting
data for other indicators especially in human resources and social security, which is
evidence that the indicators were not being used in their routine decision-making process.
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
41.      The Bank is already preparing a follow-up investment loan with the client
(Alagoas Poverty Reduction and Economic Inclusion Project – PREIP – P126620). This
new loan will build upon the reforms supported by this DPL to assist the government in
its strategy to reduce poverty by strengthening the social programs’ cadastre and maternal
health initiatives. It will also continue to support public sector reforms, especially on HR.
Given the low capacity of the State, a strong technical assistance component as well as
intense cooperation and client support is strongly advised.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
42.     The objective of this loan was of high overall relevance both to the state and the
federal government as well as to the Bank during its appraisal and has remained so until
the time of the ICR. First and foremost, Alagoas is one the poorest states in Brazil, which
magnified the poverty impacts of this operation. The DPL is consistent with Brazil CPS
2008-2011 to the extent that it fostered public management efficiency and effectiveness,
sought to improve quality in public expenditures and engaged in results-oriented public
sector reform. It has also helped to reinforce the fiscal sustainability framework in the
country, an explicit request from the federal government. Moreover, this DPL
engagement also served the Bank as a learning opportunity to engage with Northeastern
states using the DPL instrument. This allowed the Bank to expand its engagement with
other states in the region in the 2012-2015 CPS.
3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
43.    The operation was successful in achieving most of its objectives. Fiscal space for
public investment was expanded and state finances were brought into compliance with
the subnational fiscal framework. Management capability was enhanced, especially in
terms of administering priority projects.
44.     The success of the operation can also be seen by the PDO indicators and other key
outcome indicators listed. Both PDO indicators were achieved. Key indicators such as the
PEFA ones and payroll expenditures in terms of NCR were also achieved. Overall, out of
the 44 targets in the results matrix, 27 were achieved.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
45.      The operation was rated moderately satisfactory since the PDO indicators were
achieved. Furthermore, other key indicators related to the operation’s objective were also
fulfilled as explained in the above paragraph and in section 2.1. Some shortcomings were
recorded however, in the HR and social security components, although these haven’t
stopped the reforms to achieve most of the intended objectives.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
46.    One noteworthy institutional change was the expansion and embracement by the
governor of Results-Based Management (RBM) through the “Alagoas Tem Pressa?
program. This program which has mirrored successful experiences in other states,
especially Pernambuco, encompasses a series of priority government interventions and
has benefited from the experience gained with the RBM reforms supported by the DPL.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate
47.    For the fiscal adjustment, the main risks are related to the sustainability of the
adjustment into the next electoral cycle12 since the state holds a long tradition of fiscal


12
     The next government elections are scheduled to take place in 2014.


                                                      14
profligacy and mismanagement. However, the recent case of Rio Grande do Sul13, where
the election of an opposing party reinforced the fiscal responsibility values gives a good
precedent for Alagoas. Furthermore, the reformed processes implemented at SEFAZ and
SEPLANDE, as well as the reaped benefits of a more sustainable fiscal situation are risk
mitigating factors going forward.
48.     The greatest risks to development outcomes relate to the HR and social security
reforms. The public payroll exerts a great impact in the state economy so any measure
that might affect the status quo is opposed by strong interest groups. This can be seen by
the reluctance of the Legislative and other powers to adhere to the social security single
administrator and the slow follow-up on the payroll audit.
49.      The risk to development outcome is deemed moderate since the government is
committed to the reforms, will be in office until 2014 and the Bank will remain engaged
with the client. On the other hand, the political economy of some of the reforms may
affect its sustainability.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
50.     The Bank conducted a satisfactory job in preparing the operation. Local experts
were identified and employed for diagnostic work. Bank staff actively assisted the
government in devising a financial structure for the operation that would derive the
highest benefit for the client as well as helped the client through Bank procedures and
negotiations with the National Treasury Secretariat. However, it failed to put together a
suitable results matrix, which in turn led to difficulties in tracking the success of the
operation. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is thus rated moderately
satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
51.     The Bank employed the same experts in the supervision stage of the operation at
least until the 2nd tranche disbursement, which allowed the Bank to guide state officials
through the policy reforms supported and closely monitor the achievements. The Bank
has also extended invitations for government officials to attend trainings provided by the
Bank in the areas of the reforms supported. Lastly, the drawbacks faced by reforms in HR
and social security after the second tranche release could have been identified before the
ICR, however it is unclear whether the Bank would have had the ability to prevent them.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance



13
  Rio Grande do Sul and Alagoas were at project appraisal epoch, the only two states not complying with
the subnational fiscal responsibility framework. They both embarked in Bank supported fiscal reforms at
the same time. However, the former governor of Rio Grande do Sul was not reelected, but the reforms
implemented during her tenure with Bank support were mostly maintained and some of them were even
deepened such as the social security reform. More detail can be found at the Rio Grande do Sul Fiscal
Sustainability for Growth DPL ICR.


                                                   15
      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
52.     Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory as it ensured quality at entry
and during implementation for the operation. No waivers were sought for the second
tranche disbursement and no major issues interfered with preparation and implementation.
After second tranche disbursement, however, there were some problems in the HRM and
pensions components that were not spotted in the previous ISR.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
53.     Government commitment to the reforms and achievement of the development
objectives was undisputable. The inclusion of objectives and targets mandated by federal
legislation reinforced government ownership. On the other hand, readiness for
implementation was hampered by the government’s low capacity and change of key
government staff. The inability to internalize the operation’s M&E arrangement, to report
properly on the targets and the difficulty to coordinate the actions between the
government agencies involved were also obstacles during implementation.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
54.     The State Secretariat of Finance was the implementing agency and as such
showed strong commitment to the program and invested great efforts in coordinating all
stakeholders involved. Nonetheless, it was not able to consolidate and evaluate the
indicators of the result matrix before sending the figures to the Bank.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
55.     The overall borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Government and
implementing agency commitment were outstanding. Shortcomings recorded were
related to inter-government coordination, loss of institutional memory and internalization
of M&A framework.
6. Lessons Learned
56.   The main lesson that can be drawn from this operation is related to the adequacy of the
M&E framework.
57.      The main lessons are:
            Too many indicators don’t necessarily imply a good M&E framework. This DPL had
             a total of 44 indicators in its results indicator matrix. Furthermore, several different
             indicators were used for key outcome indicators in the loan and program summary
             table, inflating the number of indicators to close to 50, which is not only difficult to
             manage by the Bank, but especially by low capacity clients.
            Avoid redundant indicators. The first component in the results indicator matrix had
             16 indicators; however some of them were redundant like measuring the primary
             balance according to LRF and PAF methodology. Although, the numbers differ from
             each other, they both respond to the same policies and move in the same direction.
             The fact that one target was achieved and the other was not just reflects issues in the
             calibration of the target and not a failure of the reform.


                                                 16
           If different indicators track the same reform, use only one indicator. In the case of
            social security reforms, the results matrix included indicators for revenues,
            expenditures and deficit (both cash and actuarial). However, the same reforms could
            be tracked with just one indicator.
           Leave a How-to-Manual with the client to help internalize the M&E framework. This
            operation involved monitoring around 50 indicators, many of them were not familiar
            to the client. Thus, it is understandable that the client had trouble internalizing the
            M&E framework. The first step to reduce this problem would be to leave a document
            with the client – a How-to-Manual – stating step by step how to calculate the
            indicator, the data sources used and other methodological issues to be taken care of.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

  1. The GoA has prepared the borrower’s ICR and delivered it to the team during the ICR
     mission that took place from April, 3rd to 5th. The report was 66 pages long and had no
     executive summary. The World Bank team commends the state for preparing the report
     on a timely manner as well as for the warm reception and attention given to the team at
     the ICR mission.
  2. The GoA reported to have obtained satisfactory results regarding fiscal consolidation,
     increased fiscal space for investment, public sector management strengthening, especially
     in HR management. It also highlights the institution of AL Previdência and the creation
     of a fully funded pension system as a major reform accomplished.
  3. The state reported presents in detail the data sources and evidences for the
     accomplishment of the targets, as well as the justifications for the targets not achieved.
  4. On June, 6th the Bank made a presentation through video-conference for GoA officials on
     the draft ICR. The intent of the presentation was to give the client the opportunity to
     comment on the document. The draft ICR and the presentation were shared with the
     client on May, 31st. The comments received are listed below.
  5. Regarding the savings on payroll due to the elimination of irregularities, the GoA
     officials informed the Bank that the Public Prosecutor’s office suspended all
     administrative measures that were taken by the Executive Branch. The Bank team noted
     however that such information was not provided at the client’s ICR, neither during the
     ICR mission conducted in April.
  6. GoA officials noted that one hindrance to align the state compensation policy with wages
     paid by other states was the difficulty to obtain this information from other states. The
     Bank team acknowledged this obstacle and remarked that such factor is registered in the
     client ICR as well as in the Aide-Memoire of the last mission. Furthermore, it was told
     that a task force has been set within the Public Management State Secretaries Forum
     (CONSAD), with support from Fundação João Pinheiro to address this issue.
  7. In relation to the state social security the GoA officials reported that many civil servants
     have retired in the last couple years. They claimed that in 2011 more than 5,000 have
     retired and the expectation for 2012 is the retirement of around 3,000 servants. As for the
     actuarial deficit, government officials claimed that the difference between the target and
     the actual numbers is mainly attributable to the new criteria introduced by the firm hired
     in 2009 to carry out the actuarial analysis for Al Previdência.
  8. Government officials expressed satisfaction with the ratings given and praised the
     suggestion included in the lessons learned section to leave a M&E manual with the client,
     in order to facilitate the absorption and production of the statistics required. The client
     highlighted that it was hard to reproduce the numbers since they had not documented the
     calculation done for the baseline and targets.
