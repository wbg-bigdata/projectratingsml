NEMORANDVM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
QF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO TEE REPUBLIC OF TURXEY
FOR THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey for US$100.0
million equivalent. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 17
years maturity, including a 5 year grace period, and would help to finance an
industrial technology development project. The project will be co-financed by
the IFC for US$5.1 million.
2.        Country and Sector Background.  The reform of Turkey's policy
framework over the last decade has fostered an era of rapid economic growth
and structural change. Trade liberalisation and domestic price deregulation
have created competitive pressure on firms to increase productivity.
Incentives for exporters have generated opportunities for learning through
interaction with buyers, suppliers and competitors in the international
markets. Financial market reform is providing a consistent framework for
resource reallocation towards high productivity sectors. The most striking
indication that this strategy is working has been the export response of the
manufacturing sector. A significant shift in relative prices in favor of
export industries coupled with domestic stabilisation efforts resulted in a
sustained growth of manufactured exports from US$1.0 billion in 1980 to just
over US$9.0 billion in 1988.
3.        Over the last two years however, appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate and a sharp reduction in export subsidies have severely
curtailed growth of manufactured exports. Moreover, the composition of
exports in terms of commodity compositicn and geographic destination requires
further structural diversification. A high proportion of Turkish manufactured
exports are supplied to politically volatile, low value added or price-
sensitive markets. Sustained productivity growth through investment in
physical plant and equipment, know-how acquisition and a shift into higher
quality products is essential if firms are to build competitive advantage in
more discriminating market segments.
4.        With the first round benefits of structural adjustment realised, the
GOT now is looking for additional policy instruments to increase the long run
rate of productivity growth in the economy. Within the context of a stable
macroeconomic environment and a rational incentive framework, selective
industrial technology development (ITD) initiatives to offset free rider
problems and capture externalities are moving to the centre-stage of
industrial policy. In the first phase of the program, the focus will be on
investment in a national framework for quality assurance consistent with OECD
standards, introduction of market forces into the research and development



- 2 -
(R&D) system and catalysing the supply of innovation finance. Second phase
projects are likely to include further work on informatics, intellectual
property rights, science parks, technical manpower, consumer protection
legislation and reform of public R&D financing. By providing technical and
financial support at this point, the proposed Project can exert a positive
influence over the future direction of the ITD agenda in Turkey.
5.        The Project is proposed in light of policy reforms and institutional
changes being undertaken and planned on the macro, financial and industrial
fronts. Macroeconomic performance has improved with an acceleration in the
rate of growth to over 10% in the first half of 1990 from a sluggish 1.7X in
the whole of 1989. Wholesale price index (WPI) inflation abated from 68X in
late 1989 to a rate of 34% for the first 9 months of 1990. The Government has
introduced significant adjustment measures to raise revenue in anticipation of
the fiscal impact of the Gulf crisis. Nevertheless, further fiscal adjustment
effort remains essential to reduce the PSBR to a more sustainable level, and
to mitigate the conflict between monetary and fiscal policy. In the financial
sector, policy reforms to phase out the preferential credit system and
institutional changes to the supervisory and prudential framework have been
successfully completed under the Second Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL
II). In the industrial sector, discussion with the GOT on an adjustment
program has focused on a rationalisation of the tax and incentive system, a
program for state enterprise reform, trade policy and further reductions in
taxes on financial intermediation. GOT has implemented a number of reforms
and assuming sustained progress on these fronts, private demand for modern
technological goods and services is expected to continue growing. A key task
today is to address supply side weaknesses in the ITD institutional and policy
framework that constrain the performance of Turkish industry.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Project forms an integral part
of the Bank's country and sector assistance strategy. In the industrial
sector, it supports Turkey's integration into the international economy by
strengthening the institutional framework for demonstrating compliance with
OECD quality assurance standards, and by accelerating the shift from reliance
on imported technology to investment in internal ITD effort that complements
outward-oriented know-how acquisition. In the financial sector, the Project
complements the GOT's strategy to develop the capital malKets by establishing
the venture capital industry as a source of innovation finance for technology-
oriented companies. The GOT aims to accelerate its own learning in the ITD
policy field and has therefore requested the Bank assistance. Through a
decade of research followed by operational experience, the Bank is well
positioned to transfer knowledge to GOT on best ITD practice. The lessons of
this international experience have fed directly into project design, which
emphasizes the role of the private sector in ITD, the balance between
knowledge generation (R&D) and technology diffusion, and linkages between ITD
strategy and the competitive market environment.

7.        prolect Objectives.'l The proposed Project has the following
objectives: (a) to develop the metrology, standards, testing and quality
system to international standards by capacity building in the key public
sector institutions and by establishing a framework for greater private sector
participation in the system; (b) to make research and development market
driven by financing projects on a matching basis with the private sector; and
(c) to foster the growth of a venture capital industry by introducing a
supportive legal and regulatory framework, by rationalizing the tax
environment and by establishing a role model company.
8.        Prolect Description.  The first component of the proposed Project
would provide US$56.7 million of the Bank loan towards a total US$74.2 million
program whose objective is to develop a Metrology. Standards. Testing and
Ouality QMSM) system that meets OECD requirements and also the demands of
Turkey's evolving industrial base. The Project will help finance investments
in four sub-components: (a) laboratories, measurement equipment and training
for the public agency (TOBITAK) responsible for metrology; (b) the development
plan of the Turkish Standards Institution (the lead public agency for MSTQ)
including a calibration, testing and training facility in Istanbul; (c) the
start-up costs of a National Accreditation Council to support a private
testing and certification industry; and (d) the start-up costs of a
Professional Institute for Quality Assurance, and a National Media Campaign
for Quality Education. The second component would provide US$43.3 million of
the Bank loan to a US$92.4 million research and development program that will
be managed by an independent Foundation, whose shareholders include both
public and private sector representatives. The objective of the Foundation is
to encourage greater private R&D effort by providing seed capital for: (a)
Strategic Studies on the competitiveness of key industries vis-a-vis economic
and technological changes occurring in the international market; and (b) ITD
Challenge Programs involving a mix of applied research, development of
training programs and information services, international joint ventures for
technology transfer, etc. Sub-projects will be financed through a mix of
grants, income notes and conditional loans with the medium term goal that the
Foundation become self-financing. The third component will support
development of the venture calpital industrv by (a) introducing under the
Capital Market Board a supportive legal and regulatory framework consistent
with the model in other OECD countries, (b) rationalizing the tax treatment of
the industry to avoid taxation of financial intermediation; and (c)
establishing a private venture capital management company and fund to act
inter alia as a role model for the industry. The IFC is providing up to
US$5.1 million finance to the operation that aims to generate US$89.0 million
investment in innovative business projects (with US$6.6 million estimated as
the costs of venture capital financial intermediation).
9.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreements with the Government
on the following were reached: (i) NSTO System. The Government would (a)
during the life of the Project provide budgetary allocations to TOBITAK of
1 GOT preparation of this Project was partly funded by the Japan Grant
Facility.



- 4 -
US$19.9 million; (b) provide US$42.4 million for inivestment by TSE in the form
of an income note based on TSE revenues with an amortisation schedule of 17
years including a 5 year grace period; (c) place the National Accreditation
Council on a legal basis independent of TSE by December 31, 1994; and (d)
revise legislation that provides TSE with a de jure monopoly over
certification services by December 31, 1992; (ii) Research and DeveloRment.
The Government would (a) guarantee the tax exempt status of the Foundation;
(b) ensure the contractual freedom of the Universities and public research
institutes in their transactions with the Foundation; and (c) develop a
consistent accounting framework to identify sources and uses of resources for
technology development; (iii) Venture Capital. The Government would (a)
maintain a regulatory framework conducive to the development of the venture
capital industry; and (b) ensure that venture capital funds as defined under
the Capital Market Board regulations would not be subject to double taxation.
10.       Environmental Aspects.  The proposed Project has been reviewed under
the provisions of Operational Directive 4.00, Annex A, "Environmental
Assessment" and placed in Environmental Screening Category B. The project
will not require the preparation of an environmental assessment; however,
environmental review procedures have been adopted for project supported
activities. The proposed Project will support the environmental objectives of
the GOT. First, the MSTQ component will strengthen the institutional capacity
to prepare standards that reflect environmental and energy conservation
guidelines (e.g., in the building materials industry), and to ensure accurate
testing of vehicle emissions. Under the second component, the Foundation is
planning to include energy conservation as an area of strategic focus for
applied research and development. Third, portfolio companies financed under
the venture capital component are expected to have an exceptionally low
probability of causing environmental damage. Each portfolio company will
however, be required to demonstrate compliance with the environmental
protection regulations of the GOT and municipal authorities. This approach to
environmental protection will be reflected in the policy statement of the
Venture Capital Company.
11.       Project Benefits and Risks.  The Project will generate three main
benefits. First, it will catalyze private investment in ITD. For some firms,
the benefit of the Project will be the finance that venture capital mobilizes
for innovative investments. For a much larger group, the main consequence
will be a MSTQ system that enables improved quality management. Second, the
Project will strengthen delivery of public services where market imperfections
result in an under-investment of private resources. In this respect, the
project has focused on investment in MSTQ, preempting a potential competitive
disadvantage of Turkish firms in OECD markets, and on the provision of seed
capital through the Foundation for ITD in industries where Turkey can develop
a dynamic comparative advantage. Third, the Project will strengthen linkages
between private and public stakeholders in the technology community, and will
improve the coordination of bi- and multi-lateral aid flows to the science and
technology sector. The Project is financing two new institutions, the Venture
Capital Company and the Foundation that will invest in sub-projects where the
payback can be hard to quantify and where failures are an inevitable part of
the innovation process. Nevertheless, the Project has been designed to



- 5 -
minimize these risks. First, the major financial commitment is to its lowest
risk component - the NSTQ system, whose long term significance is unlikely to
be affected by short term economic cyclicality. Second, the active role
played by the private sector in project preparation and implementation will
ensure the commercial relevance and client orientation of the Project
components. Moreover, the design of each component transfers best
international practice to Turkey.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the loan.
