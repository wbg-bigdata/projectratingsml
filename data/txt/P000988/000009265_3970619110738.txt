PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Basic Education
Development Project in Guinea-Bissau (Cr. 1914-GUB) for which a credit in the amount
of SDR 3.1 million (US$ 4.3 million equivalent) was approved on June 7, 1988 and made
effective on December 5, 1988.
The credit was closed on December 31, 1995, six months after the original closing
date. The final disbursement took place on February 28, 1996.
The ICR was prepared by Carmen E. Perez-Castano (Task Manager AFTH2),
with contributions from Mr. Emesto Toro (Education Specialist/ Consultant), and Myrina
McCullough, Program Assistant (AFTH2), and edited by Mrs. Pushpa N. Schwartz.
Comments were received from Mr. Leonardo Concepcion (EC2HR) and Tonia Marek
(AFMSN), former Task Managers, and Clemencia Chiappe (Consultant).  It was
reviewed by Messrs. Ok Pannenborg (Divison Chief, AFTH2) and Mahmood Ayub
(Director, AFC14).
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission of February 13, 1995 and continued during a second mission in October 1996.
The ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement, supervision
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and other materials in the
project files, field visits, and discussions with project staff and SIDA and UNDP offices
in Bissau. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by submitting a
separate evaluation of project implementation, providing information for the statistical
tables, and reviewing the draft of the ICR.

Introduction
1.    The Basic Education Development Project (PDEB) was the World Bank Group's
first contribution to the education sector in Guinea-Bissau since the country attained
independence a decade ago. In accordance with the objectives of the country's Structural
Adjustment Program, PDEB was to support the Government's efforts to increase the
productivity of its human resources and enable it to better allocate its limited resources;
specifically, the PDEB was aimed to provide the institutional and policy framework for
integrating investments in the education sector.
Project Objectives
2.    PDEB's two major objectives were: first, to improve the quality, efficiency, and
access of basic education through:  (i) teacher training; (ii) inspector training; (iii)
improvement of the curriculum and teaching materials; and (iv) rehabilitation and
construction of primary schools; and second, to strengthen education management and
planning through:  (i) reform  of the Ministry of Education's (MECD, later MEN)
organizational structure, and (ii) establishment of a project coordination unit.
3.    These objectives were appropriate, relevant, and important for addressing the key
issues in basic education in a country with a very low level of literacy. But they were also
very ambitious and unrealistic, given the institutional capacity, skills, and experience
available in the country. Project design was complex and demanding as the components
required simultaneous implementation of major changes in many areas. The notion of pilot
experiments to learn how best to achieve the desired goals was ignored.
Achievement of Objectives and Implementation Record
4.    Project objectives were achieved partially.  The objective of improving basic
education curriculum and textbooks was carried out through establishing one six-year



i.
integrated curriculum; but this change was only nominal, with no improvement in curriculum
content and relevance. New study programs are still being revised; the content of these study
programs is beyond the capacity of both the teachers to teach and the students to learn. The
new textbooks and teacher guidelines were designed and produced, with assistance from the
Swedish International Development Authority, by Editora Escolar, which has become a
highly technical editorial and publishing office. But the distribution of textbooks has been a
major problem because of MEN's inefficient administrative and financial arrangements.
5.    The training of teachers and strengthening of the inspection service to increase
primary teachers competence were achieved only partially. The goal of training 3,000
teachers was reduced to 1,200 at the mid-term review, but in the end only 671 teachers were
partially trained. The goal for inspectors was also revised downwards to 60 inspectors; and
30 "trainers of trainers" were to be trained. Only 52 inspectors and 29 trainers were trained,
and they began to carry out their functions near the end of PDEB. Their impact has not been
noticeable yet, as they did not have a plan of activities, clear operational guidelines, or the
required institutional leadership and support.
6.    The objective of rehabilitation of primary schools was partially achieved; only 90 of
the 330 planned classrooms were rehabilitated; 44 new classrooms were built, and sanitary
facilities were built or upgraded, and a few homes for principals, teachers, and Regional
Directors of Education were built, and 6 regional Directorates of Education were
rehabilitated and 2 others constructed. Because the anticipated community participation
failed to materialize, local and foreign firms were engaged for construction and
rehabilitation, thereby increasing costs.
7.    The objective of establishing an efficient organization structure at MEN was partially
achieved. The new structure continues to suffer from a lack of dynamism and weak
operational capacity. MEN's new Office of Planning , responsible for planning and research
and coordination and implementation of all externally funded projects and programs, made
little difference in improving MEN's implementation and coordination capabilities in the
absence of programming and coordination skills. A school map study was completed but not
applied. The nine Regional Secretariats of Education, created under the decentralization
policy, are beginning to become more active in improving access to and quality of education.
The Organic Law of Education was amended, but has not yet come into force.
8.    The budgetary and efficiency measures to reduce costs and relate expenditures to
development priorities did not materialize. MEN's share of the national budget should have
been 13% in FY95, but was only 10.4%; basic education accounted for only 48% of MEN's
total expenditure, when it was expected to rise to 60%. The teacher:pupil ratio rose from
1:25 to 1:30, far short of 1:39, the goal for 1995. Automatic student promotion was decreed
but not enforced. The revised national student evaluation system has worked against student
promotions and it does not test students' cognitive ability. A 1990 statute has started to
regularize relationships between the Government and private schools and an office in MEN
was given responsibility for private schools. A steadily growing trend favors the opening of
more religious, community-based, and both profit and non-profit making schools.



iii
Project Sustainability and Bank and Borrower Performance
9.    Overall performance of both the Bank and the Borrower was unsatisfactory. The
Bank failed to strengthen sufficiently Borrower's capacity before credit effectiveness. PDEB
was designed to effect a nation-wide reform, without conducting pilot experiments to test its
feasibility, resulting in the need to scale down PDEB objectives substantially and turning the
project more into an infrastructure rehabilitation project rather than one that increased
institutional capacity and improved the quality and access to basic education.  The
Borrower's lack of commitment was reflected in no increase in the budget for basic
education, persistent delays in counterpart funding, and ineffective leadership in managing
and coordinating implementation of PDEB. Six audits were qualified.
Assessment of Outcome, Future Operation, and Key Lessons Learned
10.   On balance, project outcome is unsatisfactory.  The current problems in the
education sector will require a systematic, diversified, and sequential plan for at least ten
years, starting with an immediate Basic Education Emergency Project that is being prepared
at the request of the Government. It will aim to address deficiencies in financial and human
resource management that currently affect the presence of teachers in classrooms, the
inadequate supply of primary education, and slow growth in enrollment, particularly in rural
areas, and it will help to promote improvements in quality through hands-on teacher training
and teaching materials. It will also seek to enhance the social value of education among
communities through social marketing techniques.
11.   The key lessons learned are: (a) nation-wide basic education reform is too ambitious
to undertake for a country such as Guinea-Bissau that lacks implementation capacity and
leadership to manage such a project; (b) complex project management arrangements that are
put in place and that require a high degree of internal coordination within a ministry, which
itself is undergoing restructuring, do not work well; (c) pilot experiments can help reduce the
risk of failure and can help in designing appropriate solutions to achieving the objectives of
an educational reform program; (d) pre-appraisal and appraisal missions need to identify and
assess more carefully the Borrower's implementation capacity and help design a realistic
project that can be implemented; and (e) Borrower commitment is essential to successful
project implementation, and the Borrower must vest the requisite decision-making authority
in the implementing agency. For a reform as fundamental as basic education reform to be
successful, the Borrower should attempt to mobilize the communities and the nation as a
whole to gain their acceptance and support.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1914-GUB)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    The Basic Education Development Project (PDEB) was aimed to provide the
institutional and policy framework for integrating investments in the education sector.
The project was designed in coordination with other donors to improve the overall
resource allocation in the sector. PDEB had two major objectives: the first was to
improve the quality, efficiency, and access of basic education through: (i) teacher
training; (ii) inspector training; (iii) improvement of the curriculum and teaching
materials; and (iv) rehabilitation and construction of primary schools. The second was to
strengthen education management and planning through: (i) reform of the Ministry of
Education's (MECD, later MEN) organizational structure, and (ii) establishment of a
project coordination unit (PCU).
2.    Project objectives were consistent with the education sector development policies
in Guinea-Bissau's Second National Development Plan and with IDA's education sector
policies. They were appropriate and relevant to the policy decisions seeking to address
deficiencies in schooling in a society with a very low level of literacy. They were
important for addressing key issues in the provision of quality education and sought to
reform the basic education curriculum, prepare teachers to teach with the aid of new
materials and textbooks, and improve school supervision and school facilities within a
decentralized and more efficient education system. They were clear and had quantifiable
targets that could be monitored during project implementation. But the objectives were
also very ambitious since they covered a wide variety of simultaneous activities
necessary to carry out a thorough educational reform in a country with a very weak
institutional capacity. Given the country conditions portrayed in the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR), they also have to be judged unrealistic because their achievement
required institutional and operational prerequisites in terms of skills, experience,
organization, and knowledge of procedures that were all sorely lacking.
3.    The project design was complex and demanding. The components comprised
activities that were to be implemented simultaneously and that would introduce major
changes in many areas; the notion of conducting pilot experiments was ignored and with
it the possibility of learning how best to proceed towards attainment of the desired goals.



2
Furthermore, the MEN was not sufficiently equipped to manage a project that required
the participation of several partners, including external development agencies and the
community. The MEN itself was to undergo restructuring during project implementation
and this made PDEB implementation all the more complicated.
4.    The following project risks were correctly foreseen: (a) the demand for tight
coordination in implementing the various components might be too complex for MEN
due to weaknesses in the lower echelons of MEN and the PCU; (b) the institutional
development objectives could be difficult to achieve; and (c) the need to accommodate
the needs of the culturally diverse society might necessitate a rethinking and possible
changes to the approach in reforming the basic education structure as experience was
gained. The project was not able to compensate for these risks in implementation
because: (i) the demand for tight coordination was too complex for MEN, and the
institution-building measures through administrative reform to develop staff competence
and efficient management procedures were weak and ineffective and they did not have
sufficient, salutary impact on project management; external management consultants
were not able to overcome problems related to authority and decision-making, and only
after the mid-term project review were responsibilities for project implementation more
appropriately assigned; (ii) the Government was not fully committed to the reform; it
failed to provide the requisite budgetary resources for education and enforce the new
regulations that would have had a direct impact on access to education; and (iii) no pilot
experiments were carried out to evaluate systematically the implementation processes and
build on experience, so that the nation-wide implementation of the reform was made
more risky. The modifications to the reformn agenda that later became necessary were
thus grounded on the failures of the original strategies, and a transformed project
management as well as the education reform itself became "a trial and error exercise." In
sum, PDEB can be better characterized as "a set of interventions" than a project because
the coherence or focus essential to a project was altogether lacking.
B.   ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.   Improving the Basic Education curriculum and textbooks. This objective was
partially achieved. The earlier curriculum, comprising a first cycle of four years (Ensino
Basico Elementar, EBE) and the second of two years (Ensino Basico Complementar,
EBC), was replaced by a six-year integrated curriculum that was divided into three equal
cycles. But this change was nominal only; in practice it produced hardly any integration
of basic education in grades 1-6 and virtually no improvement in the curriculum content
and relevance. New study programs were prepared with the help of an expert provided
by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), but these are still being revised
by the Department of Programs (DEPRO) in the National Institute of Educational
Development (INDE). The content of these study programs are beyond both the capacity
of teachers to teach and the students' ability to learn because the new programs do not
take into account the weak academic preparation of teachers, the lack of teaching
materials in urban and rural schools, and the language problems encountered by the



3
children in the classroom. Portuguese is the official language of instruction, but most
students do not understand Portuguese, so the teachers have to explain subject matters
either in the commonly spoken crioulo language or in one of the more than 20 other
languages spoken in the country.
6.    Textbooks and the accompanying teacher guidelines were designed and_produced
for the new six-year integrated basic education curriculum with assistance from the
Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA). The production was carried out at
the Editora Escolar, thereby establishing a highly technical editorial and publishing
office; a printing machine was supplied from PDEB funds. The distribution of textbooks
was, however, a major problem; MEN's inefficient administrative and financial
arrangements caused delays in textbook delivery. After the mid-term review, PDEB
financed 9,000 textbooks for the 7th-9th grades, so that funds were redeployed to procure
textbooks for secondary education.
7.    Improving  pre-service and  in-service  teacher-training  programs and
strengthening the inspection service to increase competence of primary teachers.
This objective was achieved onlypartially. The pre-service teacher-training program was
financed by SIDA and therefore PDEB provided no inputs for this component. The
programs of the primary teacher-training centers (Escolas Normais) were adjusted to
equip student-teachers with the competencies required by the new integrated curriculum.
The goal of providing in-service training to some 3,000 teachers throughout the country
was not achieved; only 100 teachers were trained during PDEB's first three years because
of insufficient trainers. The goal was reduced to 1,200 at the mid-term project review,
and a new strategy was devised to achieve this goal. A three-year program was designed;
teachers were grouped according to their academic background and were to receive two
months of intensive academic training, followed by six months of distance learning, to be
implemented by the school inspectors. However, only 671 teachers benefited from the
intensive training, and the distance learning could not be carried out because it required
570 trainers, a number that proved unrealistic to achieve. PDEB financed consulting
services for distance leaming, provided bicycles for 240 teachers, motorcycles for 96
inspectors, equipment and office furniture, as well as training seminars. After the mid-
term review, both IDA and the Borrower agreed that even the revised goal had been too
ambitious, and they agreed on yet another strategy. PDEB would train 60 inspectors and
30 "trainers of trainers" to carry out the in-service training in the field.
8.    This final strategy failed to provide in-service teacher training nationally. Only
52 inspectors were trained to serve in the various regions. Academic prerequisites were
defined for individuals wishing to join the inspectors' program. They included an
intensive six-month, 600-hour theoretical training and four months of practical training,
In fact, this training never took place, and the preparatory academic prerequisites were
thus not met. As for the trainers, seven of them failed the final exams and one dropped
out. PDEB did manage to train some 29 trainers of trainers. Their course work was
administered by 15 Portuguese faculty from the Escola Superior de Educacao of the
University of Setubal and 14 local faculty. Ten training modules were produced for



4
Portuguese, mathematics, natural and social sciences, music and the arts, psycho-
sociology of education, and school management. The trainers' course was co-financed by
the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (FCG) of Portugal and IDA. For the fieldwork,
guidelines were produced by a team of local and Portuguese specialists from the
University of Setubal, with financing from the FCG and the Camaes Institute, also of
Portugal. These activities, however, were carried out too late in the project cycle to have
an impact on meeting project objectives. The inspectors and trainers of trainers began to
carry out their functions, but they had a very limited impact on the quality of education in
Guinea-Bissau, because they were so recently installed and did not have a plan of
activities, clear operational guidelines for their work, or the required institutional
leadership and support.
9.    Rehabilitation of primary schools. This objective was also partially achieved.
Some 90 classrooms were rehabilitated, compared with 330 planned; 44 new classrooms
were built in four regions--Biombo, Oio, Quinara, and Tombali; sanitary facilities for
schools were built or upgraded; and 5 administrative offices and 15 homes for teachers,
school principals, and Regional Directors of Education were also rehabilitated. In
addition, PDEB supported rehabilitation of 6 and construction of 2 offices for the
Regional Directorates of Education. These accomplishments fell far short of the original
project targets. This was partly due to the lack of community participation in undertaking
low-cost school rehabilitation which the PDEB had counted on. Because the cooperation
was not forthcoming, PDEB had to turn to local and foreign firms for contract bidding
and construction. The procurement rules and regulations were revised to make this
feasible. Some 75% of the civil works were completed within a year once the
procurement procedures were in order.
10.   Establishment of an efficient organizational structure at MEN. The objective
of establishing an efficient MEN organizational structure with improved operational
capacity was partially achieved. A new structure was devised for the MEN, but it
continues to suffer from a lack of dynamism and weak operational capacity. MEN's
Office of Planning was to be made responsible for educational planning and research, and
for the coordination and implementation of all externally funded projects and programs.
But in the absence of a clear strategy and plan of action, the minimal technical assistance
(TA) made very little difference in improving MEN's structure and planning,
implementing, and coordinating capabilities. A school map study for use in planning was
completed but not applied. The decentralization policy that was implemented with the
creation of nine regional offices, direc,coes regionais, is beginning to make the education
system more consistent with the country's administrative divisions at the provincial,
regional, and local levels. These Regional Secretariats of Education were equipped and
furnished by SIDA. They are becoming more active and taking initiatives to improve
access to education and to improve the quality of educational services, building on the
role that they are assigned under the draft Organic Law. The text of this law was
approved, but it was later amended and has yet to come into force, even though the
education system is supposed to operate under the organization, regulations, and
responsibilities defined in the Organic Law.



5
11.   Budgetary and efficiency measures to reduce costs and relate expenditures to
development priorities in education. This objective was not achieved. The resources
allocated to education in the national budget were to increase gradually from 11.2% to
13%. In spite of early optimism, no increase in educational resources was observed. The
budget share allocated to education was either stagnant or declining. MEN's share of the
national budget should have been 13% in FY95, but was only 10.4%. MEN's
administrative costs as a percentage of the recurrent budget totaled 22.5% in FY94
compared to the projected estimate of 10.5%. Basic education accounted for only 48% of
MEN's total expenditure in FY94, when it was expected to rise to 60%.
12.   To increase the education sector's internal efficiency, the teacher:pupil ratio rose
from 1:20 to 1:30, far short of the goal of 1:39 by 1995. Automatic student promotion
was decreed but not enforced, so that about 37% of the 1st grade vacancies are taken up
by repeaters, thereby limiting access for new students. Nearly one-half of primary school
enrollment is concentrated in the first two grades, indicating that transition to the higher
grades of the six-year integrated basic education curriculum is difficult. The national
student evaluation system, which was revised and redefined, in accordance with PDEB
standards, has worked against student promotions; examinations are selective in practice
and do not thoroughly test the students' cognitive ability. Promotions depend more on
bureaucratic exigencies than on student achievements.
13.   A statute promulgated in 1990 specified norms for the creation and operation of
private schools and has started to regularize relationships between the Government and
these schools. The most recent MEN reorganization in 1996 established a central office
with responsibility for private schools--103 madrassas, and 79 private schools run by
churches, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), cooperatives, and profit-making
organizations.
14. New management arrangements between MEN and the private schools are being
worked out; one example is that several private Catholic schools were put under the
direction of the Church, reverting to the pre-independence situation. The Government is
paying the salaries of teachers, while the schools are being managed by the Church, e.g,
training, supervision, and motivation of teachers, maintenance of school infrastructure,
and promotion of community participation. A steadily growing trend favors the opening
of more religious-sponsored and other private schools.
C.   IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING
THE PROJECT
15.  Implementation of PDEB was affected by several factors internal to the project:
(a) limited technical expertise to carry out a major basic education reform, resulting in
changing strategies without any pilot testing of their feasibility;



6
(b) lack of qualified staff in the PCU before and even after the project mid-term review,
aggravated by the top MEN officials usurping decision-making from staff on major
operational matters and the absence of clear lines of responsibility, operational
guidelines, and procedures for coordinating implementation of the project
components. In addition, lack of knowledge and expertise among PCU staff in
accounting and procurement caused major problems, such as untimely release of
funds or their release for ineligible expenditures. At least six audits were qualified.
(c) MEN's failure to: (i) develop the capacity for planning, budgeting, and establishing
educational priorities; rationalizing the use of resources made available by various
donors; (ii) exercise leadership in coordinating implementation of educational
programs and projects; and (iii) make proposals for improving education in the
context of the national budget; and
(d) underestimation of construction costs, principally because heavy reliance was placed
on community participation in school rehabilitation; the actual cost of construction of
about $15,000 per classroom turned out to be much higher than in most other
neighboring West African countries.
16.   Among the external factors affecting implementation was the limited banking
facilities in the country when the PDEB was started. A special account had to be
maintained in Lisbon with a Portuguese bank. As a result, all accounts were channeled
through the Central Bank of Guinea-Bissau, causing delays in payment of invoices,
temporary deviations of funds from the PDEB account, as well as other accounting
problems. These were alleviated when the Totta & Azores Bank opened a branch in
Bissau. Some delays in implementation of the civil works, after the mid-term review,
were caused by the conduct of the contracting firms and the geographical remoteness of
the works performed.
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
17.   The major legacy of the PDEB is the improved school buildings. However, since
no provision was made for maintenance, the sustainability of the new and rehabilitated
school facilities is at risk. The local urban and rural communities show no interest in
maintaining them. Mobilizing community interest to take over school maintenance is a
dubious proposition, as this will require a fundamental change in cultural values. The
social prestige of schooling and teachers continues to be low among the people even after
the completion of several education projects in Guinea-Bissau. This lack of maintenance
of facilities will most likely worsen until the Government defines a policy for school
maintenance, enforces the policy, provides the budgetary resources, and makes the
necessary expenditures. Some efforts to correct this situation are being made. The
Government, in collaboration with the Counterpart Fund for the General Import Program,
supported by the European Union, is providing resources for the recurrent budget to
finance non-salary expenditures, such as teaching materials, regular maintenance of
school infrastructure, and in-service teacher training.

18.   The sustainability of The National Inspectorate Service (NIS) and the trainers'
program, both of which came into being near the end of the PDEB, is uncertain. It will
depend in part on the success of MEN to deploy the inspectors and trainers in activities
aimed at improving school productivity and provide the necessary support and financing.
E.   BANK PERFORMANCE
19.   Overall Bank performance was unsatisfactory. A joint World Bank-UNESCO
(United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) mission in March
1985 pre-identified the project and produced a preliminary draft proposal; the project
components were suggested and prepared by UNESCO. The project conceived at this
stage was to focus mainly on basic education, institutional development, and agricultural
vocational education. In basic education, it was to support the Government in a pilot
effort to test the integrated basic education reform in two provinces and lay the
groundwork for further development.
20.   During pre-appraisal and appraisal attempts were made to provide the
institutional and policy framework for integrating donor investments in the education
sector. The pre-appraisal mission constituted a joint committee of IDA and the
Government that included the MEN, INDE, DGE (Office of Education), Directors of
Higher Education and the Technical Training Institute (ITFP), a Ministry of Finance
representative, and a Vice Director from the Ministry of Planning. Since the preliminary
studies were not ready the mission decided to remove the vocational training component
and instead concentrated the scope of the project on two issues: basic education--quality
and access--and institutional development. The appraisal mission maintained this
decision but it now envisaged a nation-wide integrated basic education reform, that was
far more ambitious than what had been planned earlier.
21.   Four supervision missions conducted before the mid-term review were not
effective in assisting the Borrower to develop sufficient familiarity with Bank procedures
and alleviate delays, bottlenecks, and mismanagement. By the mid-term review (May
1992) PDEB registered a disbursement lags of about 40%. The project was rated 3 in all
of the mandatory ratings. The review mission prompted discussions between IDA and
the Government on how to refocus PDEB. After a thorough assessment, it was decided
that adjustments in all the PDEB components were necessary, while keeping to the
original project objectives. The principal changes related to: school rehabilitation and
construction that was to be done under contracts, and phasing teacher training and the
development of inspector and trainer of trainers corps. In addition, the targets were
scaled down, PCU was to be restructured, and TA for accounting was provided. The final
supervision mission of February 1995 reported that once down-sized, PDEB would be
able to achieve the scaled down targets. It is also worth noting that the project had five



8
different Task Managers, a point that was raised by the Borrower as an important element
that affected project supervision.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.   Overall, borrower performance was unsatisfactory.    The Government
participated in project identification and preparation. Along with UNESCO and FCG it
prepared the sector assessment and identified project components; it also participated in
the SIDA, AfDB, and UNDP sector cooperation agreements. MEN provided inputs,
including the framework document for education sector development, annual statistical
data, assessment of textbook production, a proposal for teaching of Portuguese as a
second language, assessment studies and a proposal for a new organizational structure, a
proposal for the Organic Law and the teacher statute, and a list of schools to be built or
rehabilitated. The Borrower participated in the pre-appraisal and appraisal of PDEB.
During negotiations, the Government presented all the necessary documents and
complied with IDA's requirement to establish the Special Account.
23.   Borrower performance during implementation was unsatisfactory. In spite of
individual commitment shown to PDEB by MEN officials at the highest level, this was
not translated into an increased sector budget, or the development of priorities in
education to use donor funds more efficiently, or rationalization of inve-stments to
accomplish concrete results, or the availability of counterpart funds in a timely fashion.
PDEB required strong and continuous leadership to manage different donor-assisted
projects and PDEB components and executing units, and this leadership was lacking for
the most part. The division of project implementation responsibilities between PCU and
GEP, and the divorce of financial management from PCU's implementation functions,
led to problems with project finances. At least six audit reports were qualified. Finally,
the heavy demands posed by the large civil works component in PDEB gave the project
the look more of a civil works-infrastructure project than one to provide a framework for
integrating investments in the education sector. Civil works accounted for 49% of project
costs; equipment; materials, and furnishings for another 32%; or a total of 81% for both.
G.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
24.   The outcome of PDEB can be summarized as follows:
(a) Curriculum and Evaluation. An integrated six-year new basic education curriculum,
subdivided into three two-year phases, was devised. Study programs were prepared
for all six grades, but textbooks and teaching materials were available for only grades
1-4. Automatic student promotion was approved but not applied. A mechanism to
assess student achievement was designed, but it is flawed. The integration of EBE
and EBC was nominal, and no practical difference in terms of an integrated basic
education system is observable.



9
(b) Training. The in-service training program provided a core group of school inspectors
and trainers of trainers, while pre-service teacher training produced revised
instructional programs for the two teacher-training schools. A set of modules was
produced for academic and professional training. Specifically the program though
incomplete, trained 29 trainers of trainers and 56 school inspectors and equipped them
with means of transportation to facilitate access to schools. Altogether some 700
teachers received partial in-service training to give instruction in the new curriculum.
(c) Civil Works. Under PDEB, 90 schools were rehabilitated and 44 new classrooms
were constructed and sanitary facilities were built or improved.  In addition,
residences for 9 teachers and 2 new regional offices were built and 6 more offices
rehabilitated.    -
(d) Institutional Development A process of regional decentralization has been underway
with the Regional Secretariats of Education becoming more active. A special office
was created at the top level of the MEN to manage relationships with private schools.
A school map study was developed for the first time in the country, but not applied.
H.   FUTURE OPERATION
25.   The current problems in the education sector will require a systematic, diversified,
and sequential plan for at least ten years, starting with an immediate Basic Education
Emergency Project. This project is being prepared at the request of the Government to
address deficiencies in financial and human resource management that currently affect the
presence of teachers in classrooms, the inadequate supply of primary education, and slow
growth in enrollment. The project will aim to increase school access by expanding the
supply of primary schools covering grades 1-4-6, especially in rural areas, and promoting
the social value of education through social marketing techniques. Improvements will be
sought in education quality through the provision of textbooks and teaching materials as
well as through in-service, "hands-on" teacher training. Improved financial and human
resource management will also be sought so that teacher salaries will be paid on time,
bureaucratic routines in personnel management will be established, and an operational
system will be put in place to improve the data bank.
I.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   The PDEB experience offers some key lessons:
(a) Nation-wide basic education reform is too ambitious to undertake for a country such
as Guinea-Bissau. IDA overestimated the capacity of the implementing agencies and
expected results far too quickly. INDE, which was a new institution, did not have the
capacity to carry out the tasks it was charged with--curriculum change, textbook
design and production, teacher training, and student evaluation--nor was it able to
provide leadership for the various actors in the reform, within MEN, the Regional
Secretariats of Education, and among the donors.



10
(b) Complex project management arrangements that are put in place and that require a
high degree of internal coordination within a ministry, which itself is undergoing
institutional restructuring, do not work well. MEN lacked the capacity to exercise
leadership, coordinate, and oversee simultaneous interventions on several fronts, in
some cases financed by different donors under their particular procedures and
regulations. It lacked the institutional structure and experience to manage a complex
set of activities and to assess the feasibility of the strategic decisions needed for
reform of the basic education system.
(c) Pilot experiments can help reduce the risk of failure in the undertaking of an
ambitious educational reform program and can help in designing appropriate
solutions to achieve the objectives of the program. Such pilot experiments would
have been particularly useful since the SAR did not clearly define the role of PDEB
and indicate how it meshed with other donor interventions.
(d) Pre-appraisal and appraisal missions need to identify and assess more carefully the
Borrower's implementation capacity and help design a realistic project that can be
implemented. Since implementation capacity was weak in PDEB, IDA should have
taken actions to strengthen it by the time of credit effectiveness.
(e) Borrower commitment is essential to successful project implementation. Borrower
commitment in evidence during identification and preparation must continue
throughout implementation. It must vest the requisite decision-making authority in
the implementing agency. Furthermore, the nation as a whole and the communities
have to be mobilized sufficiently to accept a reform as fundamental as- the basic
education system reform. The Government should have recognized the need for new
actors such as churches, communities, and NGOs in expanding and improving
education, and should have given them an appropriate role and recognition in return
for their help in increasing enrollment and contributing resources to improve
educational access, equity, and quality.
