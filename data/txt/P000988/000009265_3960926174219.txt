MEMORANDUM AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for SDR 3.1 million
(US$4.3 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a
basic education development project.
2.        Background.  The economy of Guinea-Bissau, one of Sub-Saharan
Africa's poorest countries (US$170 GNP/capita in 1986), is undergoing a
program of structural adjustment with the assistance of the Bank. Its
education system, however, has been unable to respond effectively to the
human resource development demands of the post-colonial period, and supply
the trainable manpower needed to direct the economy towards sustainable
growth. The constraints in the education sector lie in: the poor quality
and efficiency of the primary education system; its lack of schools; the
low competence of its teachers; and the low institutional capacity of the
Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECD) to plan and administer
sectoral development. Consequently, illiteracy is about 85%: only about
58% of the primary school age (7-12 years) population attend school and
only about 9% of grade 1 entrants finish grade 6; and less than 2% of the
total population have completed secondary education. To address these
problems, the Government's education sector strategy under its draft Second
National Development Plan (1988-1991) has given priority to the improvement
of primary education and of institutional capacity in MECD. The Government
has sought assistance from various donors, but has not adeqtately defined
the institutional and policy framework, or the aid coordination mechanism
to integrate these development efforts.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank Group has to date
extended assistance (US$81.0 million via 11 credits) to various sectors in
Guinea-Bissau (transport, petroleum exploration, health and family
planning, agriculture, and macro-economic management - both technical
assistance and balance of payments support). The Bank recognizes the
urgent need for a comprehensive approach to education and, in the context
of its country assistance strategy, it intends to play a major role in
helping the social sectors. The proposed Basic Education Development
Project would be the first Bank operation in this sector. The proposed
project would support the Government's strategy in basic education and
would: (a) reinforce the country's program for the development of its human
resources; (b) establish conditions for sound sector development by means
of policy and financial measures and investment programs; (c) produce
long-term improvements in the management and delivery of educational
services; and (d) foster much needed coordination among multilateral and
bilateral co-donor agencies, thus improving overall resource allocation in
the sector. IDA's involvement in the project would provide an integrative
element in development efforts in the sector.



4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project addresses the major
policy objectives for the education sector as defined in the Government's
draft Second National Development Plan. To foster aid coordination among
donors and improve overall resource allocation in the sector, the proposed
project has been designed in consultation with other multilateral and
bilateral agencies operating in the country and would provide the
institutional and policy framework for and complement current investments
in the development of the education system. The project focuses on
improving primary education and building institutional capacity in the
education sector and aims to; (a) improve the quality, efficiency,
relevance and access of primary education; and (b) strengthen the
institutional capacity of MECD to plan and manage the development of the
education system.
5.        Project Description.  In order to achieve the first objective,
the project would: (a) improve the content and relevance of the basic
education curriculum and teaching materials; (b) improve pre-service and
in-service primary teacher training programs, strengthen the teacher
inspectorate services, and train about 3,000 primary teachers to increase
their competence; and (c) rehabilitate about 330 classrooms in existing
dilapidated primary schools. The second objective would be attained by:
(i) establishing an efficient organizational structure for MECD; (ii)
implementing a staff development program; (iii) providing basic office
equipment and upgrading physical facilities; and (iv) introducing budgetary
and efficiency measures to reduce costs and link expenditures to
educational development priorities.
6.        The project, to be carried out over a six-year period, would
finance civil works, vehicles, furniture and equipment, training and
technical assistance and project administration costs. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$4.65 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$3.02 million (65%). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group Operations in Guinea-Bissau are given in Schedules C and D
respectively, followed by a map of the country. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7131-GUB, dated May 18, 1988, is also attached.
7.        Agreed Actions.  Agreements were reached on the timetable for:
(a) implementing the unified six-year primary curriculum with properly
structured and sequenced subjects at the national level; (b) introducing
automatic promotion progressively from grade 1 to 5; (c) the review of the
revised student examination and testing standards; (d) development and
prodaction of appropriate primary textbooks and teaching materials; (e)
restructuring MECD, defining responsibilties of organizational units,
reduction of MECD's non-technical staff and development of professional
staff; and (f) gradual increase of student-teacher ratios from 25:1 to
40:1. In order to sustain the qualitative improvements envisioned in the
project and allow for expansion of primary education, the Government
would: (i) take all necessary measures to adopt the Provisional Law of the
Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports by December 31, 1988; (ii)
maintain the share of MECD in the operational budget for 1988-1991 at least



-3-
at 11.2% of the total Government budget and increase this gradually as
mutually agreed with IDA during annual reviews; (iii) present for IDA
review the recommendations of the study on private education by March 31,
1990; and (iv) convene joint annual and mid-term reviews of project
implementation progress, MECD budgetary allocations and investment and work
programs with IDA and other agencies involved in the project.
8.        Justification and Benefits.  The project would provide the
institutional framework needed for the continuous improvement of and future
investments in the sector. In the medium term, the project would produce
benefits to education through the improvements in teacher competence,
access to learning materials, better quality of instruction, and an
increase in school places to children uow locked out of the system. It
would allow the Government to provide the full six years of quality
education in smaller villages. In the longer term, the project would
improve the quality and efficiency of basic education, and increase access
to further levels of education. Increased literacy would contribute to
higher productivity in agriculture and other sectors because of the
improved trainability of the labor force.
9.        Risks.  There are several risks: (a) the demand for close
coordination in implementing the various components may be too complex for
MECD; (b) the institutional developnLent objectives could be difficult to
achieve; and (c) the need to accommodate the demands of the culturally
diverse society could necessitate changes to the approach in reforming the
basic education structure as experience is gained. The first risk would be
minimized through administrative reform to develop staff competence and
introduce efficient management procedures, and engagement of management
consultants to provide implementation support. The second risk would be
minimized through a continuous dialogue with the Government at the highest
levels in order to maintain its commitment to the reform, and through
annual and mid-term reviews of project performance to identify weaknesses
and prescribe corrective measures. The third risk would be minimized
through careful evaluation of the results of the pilot phases of the
education reform before these are applied nationwide. The annual and
mid-term reviews by the Government and IDA would be conducted in
collaboration with other agencies (UNDP, SIDA, ADB and EEC) involved in the
project.
10.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
