SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises two agriculture and agro-industries projects
in two of Yugoslavia's less developed republics, Montenegro and Macedonia.
The projects would help achieve the agricultural development objectives of
the two Republics, namely: to increase agricultural production both for the
growing domestic market and for exports, to raise productivity and income,
particularly on private farms, to expand agro-industrial processing capacity,
to improve product quality and to stabilize food supply. They address the
major agricultural development constraints, i.e. the lack of capital for
large investments in land development, irrigation and food processing in the
social sector, and the lack of market outlets and credit for the purchase of
on-farm investments in the private sector; they would also help strengthen
the organization and appraisal/supervision capacity of the two borrowing
banks, Investiciona Banka, Titograd (IBT) and Stopanska Banka, Skopje (SBS).
The project investments have high priority in the 1976-80 Agricultural
Development Plans of the two Republics. They are in line with the Bank's
lending strategy for agriculture in aiming at production growth, expansion of
processing capacities, support for private farmers and institution building.
ii.       The projects would provide credit through IBT in Montenegro and
SBS in Macedonia to eleven social sector enterprises and some 1,000 private
farmers for investments in agricultural processing facilities and primary
production. Processing investments would include wine and wine-by-product
processing, cold storage, vegetable and fruit processing, vegetable collection,
tobacco drying, dairying and slaughtering facilities; in primary production
the project would finance irrigation facilities, vineyard and fruit tree es-
tablishments, livestock and vegetable production, and on-farm mechanization.
iii.      The two borrowers would be IBT for the proposed loan to Montenegro
and SBS for the loan to Macedonia. A project agreement would be concluded
with the "Agrokombinat July 13" (AK) in Titograd, which would implement the
Montenegrin project. SBS would be responsible for implementing the Macedonian
project.
iv.       The Montenegrin project would cost Din 1,001 million (US$55.6 mil-
lion) of which 36% or Din 362 million (US$20.1 million) would be foreign
exchange. The Bank loan of US$26 million to IBT would finance the foreign
exchange cost and interest during construction on the Bank loan of US$5.9
million. The sub-borrower would contribute 5% of the project cost and IBT
would finance the remaining 59% of project cost, of which 20% would be out of
resources from the Federal Fund for the Less Developed Regions (FNP) and 39%
from IBT's own funds. Interest during the grace period on the FNP funds would
be capitalized.
v.        The Macedonian project would cost Din 1,008 million (US$56 million)
of which 37% or Din 378 million (US$21 million) would be the foreign exchange
component. The Bank loan of US$24 million to SBS would finance the foreign
exchange cost and interest during construction on the Bank loan of US$3 mil-
lion. The sub-borrowers would contribute 20% of the project cost. SBS would
finance the remaining 43% of project cost as well as interest during construc-
tion on its loans.



- ii -
vi.       The onlending interest rate to sub-borrowers on IBRD funds would be
11% p.a. in Mlacedonia. It would be 9% p.a. to the AK in Montenegro plus a fee
of 2% p.a. for guarantee and other charges resulting in an effective rate of
11% p.a. The interest rate on local funds would be the local rate for similar
investments prevailing at the time the subloan is made. The maturity for IBRD
funds would be 15 years including a 3-year grace period. The repayment and
grace periods on the local funds in Macedonia would be determined on the basis
of each sub-project's cash flow projection to suit the requirements of the
sub-project. In Montenegro the maturity would be 20 years including a grace
period of 3 years for FNP funds and 8 years including a grace period of 3
years for IBT's own funds. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the
sub-borrowers for sub-loans to the social sector and by the Government of
Macedonia for sub-loans made to private farmers.
vii.      The processing facilities (US$18.7 million in Montenegro and US$43.7
million in Macedonia) would be procured by the respective sub-borrowers under
international competitive bidding procedures according to IBRD Guidelines,
under supervision of IBT and SBS, respectively. The civil works and equip-
ment for the irrigation facilities, infrastructure investments and collection
center (US$10.7 million) as well as investments for plantation establishment
and on farm-development (US$38.5 million) would be phased over four years and,
due to their relatively small individual size, are not likely to be attractive
to foreign firms. These items if exceeding US$50,000 would be procured under
local bidding procedures, which have proven to be satisfactory to the Bank;
items costing less than US$50,000 would be procured through existing commer-
cial channels.
viii.     The projects would contribute to achieving the objectives outlined
in the Agricultural Development Plans of Montenegro and Macedonia. They
would increase production of mainly fruits and vegetables, wine, beef, lamb
and milk and milk products, improve food product quality and help stabilize
food supply. While the projects' incremental production would largely be
marketed domestically, exports of meat, fruits and vegetables would increase
foreign exchange earnings by about US$100 million over the projects' lifetime.
Total net foreign exchange earnings and savings taking into account the proj-
ects' import components would be about US$60 million (at 1976 prices). The
projects would generate about 1,800 permanent employment opportunities and
reduce underemployment for an additional 23,600 farmers. Almost 55% of the
proposed loans would directly or indirectly benefit an estimated 23,600 small
farmers of which an estimated 12,000 farmers would belong to the target group
with a per capita income of less than US$340 per year. The economic rates of
return for the Montenegrin and Macedonian projects, including administrative
and training expenses would be 17% and 26%, respectively. These rates do not
reflect non-quantifiable benefits including those from improved resource
allocation due to training and institution building.
ix.       Having received satisfactory assurances as summarized in Chapter VII,
the projects would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$26 million, equivalent,
to IBT and US$24 million, equivalent, to SBS, both for a term of 15 years,
including a grace period of 3 years.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
the Governments of the Socialist Republics of Montenegro and Macedonia have
requested Bank loans for two Agriculture and Agro-Industries projects. They
would provide credit for agricultural processing facilities, including wine
and wine-by-product processing, cold storage, vegetable and fruit processing,
vegetable collection, tobacco drying, dairying and slaughtering facilities;
they would also finance irrigation facilities for the establishment of
vineyard and fruit plantations, as well as investments in livestock, fruit
and vegetable production, and on-farm mechanization. The projects cover both
private farms and social sector enterprises in the less developed Republics
of Montenegro and Macedonia. They aim at expanding agricultural production
and processing capacities in the two Republics; at improving the marketing
of agricultural products, particularly of private farmers' production; at en-
hancing through credit and extension the productivity and income of the rural
population, particularly of private farmers, and at strengthening the appraisal
capacity of the borrowing banks. The projects' investments are of highest
priority in the 1976-80 Agricultural Development Plans for Montenegro and
Macedonia (Annex 1).
1.02      The projects would represent the fourth and fifth Bank loan for
agriculture and agroindustries in Yugoslavia, following the first Agroindus-
tries Project in Macedonia (894-YU) in 1973, the first Agricultural Credit
Project (1129-YU) in 1975 and the Metohija Multipurpose Project (1360-YU) in
1977. Other IBRD loans for multipurpose projects included small agricultural
components. The Montenegrin project was prepared by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Programme and the Macedonian by .Stopanska Banka Skopje.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission in
May/June 1976, consisting of Messrs. Heidhues, Bhargava, Wolffelt and Ms.
Hashimoto (Bank) and Messrs. Gioia and Weinschenck (Consultants).
*    In the Annexes of this Report the two projects together are also referred
to as AGRICULTURE AND AGROINDUSTRIES II PROJECT YUGOSLAVIA.



-2-
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Geography and Climate
2.01      Montenegro and Macedonia are both characterized by extremely moun-
tainous terrain covering 93% of the total area of Montenegro and 75% of
Macedonia. These areas are unsuitable for field crop production, but ex-
tensive upland pastures make possible sheep and some cattle grazing. The
plains and valleys suitable for cultivation allow intensive grain, vegetable
and fruit farming. Two basic climatic zones common to both Republics largely
coincide with the area delineation between mountains and plains - (i) the
Mediterranean (or modified Mediterranean) in the eastern and central parts of
Macedonia and the coastal belt in Montenegro, and (ii) the continental climate
zone prevailing in the mountainous regions of the two Republics.
Agriculture in the Economy
2.02      Agriculture contributes 15% to the total GMP 1/ of Montenegro
and 23% to that of Macedonia, and absorbs 40% and 32% of the active working
population of the two Republics respectively. Though agriculture's role has
been declining relative to the rest of the economy with the rapid progress of
industrialisation, it still remains an important sector in the overall devel-
opment of the two Republics.
2.03      Agricultural production expanded at an average annual growth rate
of 2.8% in Montenegro and 3.6% in Macedonia between 1966 and 1975. In both
Republics, fruit and vegetable production grew most rapidly, encouraged by
the rising relative prices and increased availability of irrigation facili-
ties. The increase in vegetable production was achieved largely by area
extension rather than by yield improvements.  On the other hand, the active
agricultural population declined by 1.5% annually in Macedonia and by 1.7% in
Montenegro between 1961 and 1971. The net result of production growth and
labor input decrease was the growth of labor productivity by an average annual
rate of about 4.5%.
Organization of the Agricultural Sector
2.04      Agriculture of Montenegro and Macedonia, like that of the rest
of Yugoslavia, is characterized by the parallel existence of two sectors -
social and private.
2.05      The social sector consists of agricultural kombinats, state farms
and agricultural cooperatives (Zadruga) and other organizations such as
veterinary and research stations. These organizations operate under the
principles of social ownership of the means of production and workers'
1/   The GMP concept differs from the GNP concept, as the former excludes
certain services, such as public administration, defense, education,
health and social insurance.



-3-
self management. In 1973, the social sector held 5% (Montenegro) and 2:
(Macedonia) of the cultivated land; employed 1.9% (Montenegro) and 8.8%
(Macedonia) of the agricultural labor force; produced 8% (Montenegro) and 30%
(Macedonia) of the agricultural product; and contributed 35% (Montenegro) and
45% (Macedonia) to the market production in the Republics.
2.06      The social sector has been the dynamic force in the development of
modern agriculture in Yugoslavia and, in both Republics, its performance has
been remarkable. In Montenegro production in the social sector rose at a
trend rate of 5.4% between 1962 and 1975, while in Macedonia, the social
sector recorded an average rate above 9% between 1965 and 1975. The main
explanations for the rapid growth of the social sector in agriculture are:
(i) heavy concentration of investments in this sector, absorbing more than
two-thirds of the gross fixed investment in agriculture in the post war
period; (ii) a much greater "intellectual input" of university trained workers
in the social sector; and (iii) much greater emphasis on research in the social
sector.
2.07      The private sector in both Montenegro and Macedonia occupies by far
the larger part of the cultivated land and employs more than 95% of the total
agricultural labor force. It consists of 62,000 holdings with an average size
of 4.9 ha in Montenegro and of about 160,000 farms with an average size of 3.1
ha of cultivated land in Macedonia.
2.08      The production in the private sector increased by 3.2% in Macedonia
and by 2.5%-3% in Montenegro, falling far below the performance of the social
sector. The major causes for the low productivity and yields in the private
sector and the increasing productivity gap between the two sectors are:
(a) a generally lower quality of land; (b) lower share in the irrigated area;
(c) inferior varieties of seeds, plants and animals; (d) low degree of mech-
anization; (e) low fertilizer input; and (f) small farm size and scattered
holdings.
Cooperation between the Private and Social Sectors
2.09      The private and social sectors are for the most part complementary
rather than competitive. Labor-intensive crops, such as vegetables and
tobacco, are almost exclusively produced in the private sector, which also
has 95%-98% of the cattle and 92%-99% of the sheep. Cooperation between the
social and private sectors takes the form of trade in inputs and output,
provision of services by the social sector such as supply of fertilizers,
harvesting, cultivations, marketing and credit and the contracting of joint-
production. While such cooperation brings considerable benefits to the private
farmers, it is fairly limited and declining - limited because of the concen-
tration of social sector organizations in the valleys and high plains and
consequent lack of cooperation possibilities in the mountains; declining
because of the increasing importance of off-farm income of private farmers
and the dissemination of new production techniques in the private sector, both
factors that make contract cooperation far less attractive to private farmers.



-4-
Marketing
2.10      As elsewhere in Yugoslavia, Montenegro and Macedonia have "organized"
markets with "authorized purchases" by social sector enterprises existing side
by side with "informal" markets where the peasants sell directly to consumers.
2.11      The importance of the organized markets is relatively high in
Macedonia because of the orientation of large parts of the private sector's
production for delivery to other parts of Yugoslavia or to exports. In
1974, 42% of wheat, 27% of tomatoes, 63% of grapes, 58% of eggs and 73% of
mutton were sold in the organized market. Private farmers also form groups
to ship significant quantities (especially of early vegetables) directly to
local markets of larger cities in the northern Republics. In Montenegro the
role of the "organized market" has been less significant, accounting for less
than 10% of total production going through the "organized market", reflecting
the predominantly subsistence nature of agriculture in Montenegro.
The Agroindustries Sector
2.12      In Montenegro, due to its mountainous topography, agricultural
production is low and communications are difficult for effective collection
of produce to feed industry. The main agricultural production area is the
Cemovsko Polje plain, which will be developed under the Project. Macedonia,
on the other hand, is a major producing region within Yugoslavia. Never-
theless, the share of Macedonia in Yugoslavia's total processed vegetable
production has declined from about 25% in 1960 to 15-16% in recent years.
This is largely due to the fact that the expansion and replacement in the
processing industry has not kept pace with the expansion of fresh vegetable
production. Both Republics have an undeveloped agro-industrial base.
Development Strategy and Priorities
2.13      Basic Principles.  The basic objective of the Agricultural Develop-
ment Plans for the two Republics is to raise agricultural production to meet
expected domestic needs and to allow for some exports by emphasizing (a) the
further development of the social sector through modernization of production
techniques, expansion of processing facilities, better utilization of avail-
able resources and the adjustment of production to changes in demand; and (b)
the development of private farms primarily through cooperation with the social
sector to ensure further progress in the socialization of agriculture and
rural areas.
2.14      Measures.  To achieve its objectives, the Plans focus on three areas:
(a) price policies, (b) investment policies and (c) support for cooperation
between the social and private sectors.
2.15      Investments.  Annual investments are expected to reach Din 1.5 bil-
lion in Macedonia, more than a 50% increase against the previous plan period,
of which 13% would be in the private sector. In Montenegro, the plan calls



-5-
for Din 1.5 billion investments for the entire period, of which about one-
third is planned in the private sector. Special incentives are foreseen
for encouraging mobilization of enterprises' own resources - income tax
rebates for agricultural investments, turnover tax exemptions, interest rate
subsidies for investment credits, reduction of import duties on imports of
agricultural machinery and increase in the foreign exchange retention quota
from depreciation charges.
2.16      Production Growth.  The Macedonia draft development plan projects
for the period 1976-80 an annual production growth rate of 4.5% for the
agricultural sector as a whole (8.5% in the social sector and 4% in the
private sector). For Montenegro, the growth target is 4.0% for the agricul-
tural sector (7.5% in the social sector and 3.8% in the private sector).
2.17      Evaluation.  The Agricultural Development Plans represent the first
instance in which Yugoslavia's development policy addresses itself specific-
ally to the problems of private farmers. On the other hand, they recognize
the large investment needs in the social sector for irrigation, land devel-
opment and processing facilities and therefore continue to place the major
emphasis on the social sector. The measures outlined for the promotion of
the private sector are: (a) increased cooperation between the two sectors and
establishment or improvement of the extension service in order to achieve a
more rapid transfer of modern technology to the private sector; (b) provision
of credit for on-farm investments.
2.18      These measures address the most serious bottlenecks in the develop-
ment of the social and private sectors. However, the support measures for
the private sector are practically limited to farmers that either form an
association or cooperate with the social sector on a contractual basis. In
this way they will not reach the farmers in the remote mountainous regions,
where the social sector is not represented and where the scope for cooperation
is limited. Rural development investments with emphasis on infrastructure
components would be a pre-condition for improving productivity and marketing
of these farms. In addition, socially oriented programs would have to com-
plement production supporting measures, particularly where the natural con-
ditions are most unfavorable for agricultural production. The five year plan
apparently realizes these difficulties and hence projects low and realistic
growth rates for the private sector. The consequent widening gap in incomes
between the two sectors will reinforce the emerging trend for private farmers
to seek additional sources of income outside the agricultural sector. But
this would present problems for farmers in the mountainous regions who lack
alternative economic activities. To reach these farmers specific measures
would be necessary including improvement of infrastructure facilities and
Government supported credit schemes. The projected growth rates for the
social sector seem realistic considering the relatively large proportion of
investments in irrigation and the corresponding follow-up investments at the
farm level.

III. FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
A.  Banks:  The Proposed Lending Channels
Organization and Ilanagement
3.01      The two banks involved in the projects are:  Investiciona Banka
Titograd (IBT), Republic of Montenegro, and Stopanska Banka, Skopje (SBS),
Republic of Macedonia. 1/ SBS was the borrower under the Agroindustries
Project - Macedonia (Loan 894 YU).  Both banks are participating banks in
the First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1129 YU) and are borrowers under
the First and Second Industrial Credit Projects. 2/ In each case the Founders'
Assembly, the apex governing body, establishes the banks' business policy
annually. It also appoints the chief executive, i.e. General Manager, and
guides the banks' operations. Changes in management are infrequent, and
professional competence is the main criterion for selection and appointment
at all levels. The staff of the banks appears generally experienced and
capable.
Financial Structure
3.02      Most short-term resources consist of deposits and borrowings from
the National Bank of Yugoslavia through rediscount facilities. The long-term
resources comprise loans from Fiederal and Republic funds, foreign borrowings,
founders' funds and long-term deposits. The short-term commitments generally
match the short-term resources. The long-term commitments of both SBS and IBT
exceed the long-term resources. However, each bank limits its over-commitments
to the amount of resources it is fairly certain to receive as per the Develop-
ment Plan from the Fund for the Accelerated Development of the Less Developed
Regions (FNP) during the period in which it has to meet these commitments.
Also the banks' level of liquidity is monitored by the National Bank under its
liquidity rules.
3.03      The total assets of IBIT and SBS as of December 31, 1975 were Din
10.4 and Din 34.5 billion respectively, representing a growth of 21.5% and
22.4% over the previous year. I'he long-term loan portfolio accounted for
63.3% (IBT) and 55.8% (SBS) of the total assets. Each bank also manages,
at no risk to itself, substantial funds on behalf of Federal and Republic
Governments and socio-political organizations. The current ratios of the
banks are near 1.1:1 and are satisfactory. The long-term debt/equity ratios
are high; 13.7:1 and 6.7:1 respectively for IBT and SBS. The high debt/equity
1/   The "13 July" Agrokombinat, which is implementing the Montenegrin
project, is discussed in para 3.12 below.
2/   Both the SBS and IBT as recent borrowers under the Second Industrial
Credit Project (Loan 1277 YU) are described in more detail in the
Appraisal Report No. 1058YU.

ratios do not pose a danger to the banks' solvency as most of the long-term
debt is loans from Federal or Republic authorities, repayments of which are
tied to the corresponding repayments by the enterprises to the banks. Finan-
cial structure and performance of the banks is satisfactory, keeping in view
that the banks have close ties with their respective regional economies, both
in funding and lending operations and they merely seek to earn sufficient
revenues to cover all their expenses and financial obligations.
Lending Operations
3.04      Both banks operate as mixed commercial/investment banks and their
loan accounts are fairly evenly distributed among enterprises in all sectors
of the economy, indicative of a reasonably diversified loan portfolio. An
important part of SBS's current loan operations deals with the agricultural
sector (of short-term loans 12.4% to agriculture and of long-term loans 8.5%).
In IBT, lending to agriculture comprised only 7% of total short-term loans
and 3% of total long-term loans. Both banks are the major source of credit
to the agricultural sector in their respective Republics.
Portfolio Evaluation
3.05      As agreed under the Second Industrial Credit Project full audits
of both banks will be available in two or three years from now (see also para
5.12). Until the full audit reports including an analysis of the banks'
portfolios are available, the assessment of the quality of their portfolios
is incomplete. However, according to the banks' unaudited balance sheets the
arrears as percentages of loan portfolio have been small (1% and 1.9% for IBT
and SBS respectively) and are fully covered by each bank's provisions against
bad debts (Reserve Fund). An assessment of the banks' exposure to large
borrowers and borrowers in default could not be made since the banks' records
do not show aggregate loans to an enterprise. This is not a problem for SBS
and IBT since they have access to the borrower's financial statement and the
list of its debt whenever a request for grant or renewal of a loan is made.
However, this information is required by the Bank to evaluate the SBS and
IBT's loan portfolio and would be provided under the financial reporting.
Creditworthiness
3.06      Pending full audits, the creditworthiness of SBS and IBT cannot
be fully established along conventional lines. However, for the following
reasons they are suitable borrowers for the proposed IBRD loan: 1/
(a) The founders have unlimited liability towards the banks'
obligations. Creditors of the banks thus have legal re-
course to all assets of founders, many of which are large
industrial enterprises with substantial assets;
1/   Both banks were accepted as borrowers under the First and Second
Industrial Credit Projects (Loans 1012 YU, 1013 YU and 1277 YU).



-8-
(b) The banks are closely integrated with the economy of the
Republics and their liquidation in case of financial crisis
is inconceivable;
(c) The banks have generally qualified and experienced management
and staff. Experience shows that both SBS and IBT's financial
management has been adequate with no significant losses;
arrears have been manageable, and obligations have been met
satisfactorily.
(d) The bulk of each bank's long-term debt consists of Federal and
Republic funds, which are generally allocated as per regional
development plans with repayments by the bank tied to the
corresponding repayments by the enterprises. 1/ Thus the high
debt/equity ratio is not considered dangerous to the banks'
solvency.
Lending Policies and Procedures
3.07      Investment proposals that enterprises submit to SBS and IBT for
financing are appraised and approved in a branch office or in the head office,
depending on the financing plan and/or complexity of the project. Under
IBRD financed projects both banks have considerably improved their appraisal
methods. However, several weaknesses remain, particularly insufficient tech-
nical appraisal of data and specifications furnished by the loan applicants;
inadequate economic and market analysis, and scanty attention to contingency
allowances on cost estimates. Strengthening of the technical and financial
appraisal capability of both banks for agroindustrial lending would be an
institution building objective under the project. Both banks, with some
strengthening in staff, are considered capable of submitting adequately
appraised projects for financing under the project.
3.08      Systematic supervision is directed by both banks only to problem
projects or projects under construction. Supervision is done mostly by the
branches of the banks. Both banks need to supervise projects more regularly
during and after construction to monitor and analyze the actual results
against appraisal estimates, and to take appropriate action where needed.
The supervision work needs to be centrally coordinated at the head office
to cover various facets of the borrower's dealings with the bank and for
effective feed-back to investment and other operational departments. The
procurement and disbursement methods are sound.
On-lending Interest Rates
3.09      Interest rates on loans and deposits are fixed each year by each
individual bank's Assembly of Founders. The banking structure, where the
borrowers are at the same time the bank's major founders (shareholders), has
1/   In case of genuine difficulty in repayment by enterprises in the past,

led to relatively low interest rates. Furthermore, Federal, Republic and Com-
munal funds are provided to the banks at low cost with predescribed margins
for on-lending or are used to subsidize interest rates. While the Yugoslavs
consider low interest rates on investment credits important for encouraging
investments and use subsidized rates to channel resources into priority
areas, low interest rates, inter alia, may have contributed to excess demand
for investments with in the past inflationary effects, to the choice of highly
capital-intensive production techniques, and to overdesign of investment
projects. They may have also negatively influenced resource mobilization.
These issues are addressed in an Interest Rate Study recently completed by
Vojvodjanska Banka under the First Agricultural Credit Project (1129-YU). The
Study will be the basis for a discussion with the Yugoslav Authorities on the
impact of the existing interest rate regime on resource allocation and mobiliza-
tion in the agricultural sector and on appropriate measures to improve resource
allocation and mobilization in the sector.
3.10      Interest rates for long-term loans to agriculture in the two
Republics vary from 5%-5.5% on loans made out of Federal funds up to 11.5%
on loans from the banks' own resources, with most of the lending done at
7%-8%. Interest rates for investments in priority subsectors may be subsi-
dized to even lower levels such as 3% for irrigation in Macedonia. These
interest rates are reviewed and could be revised every year. The present
interest rates imply negative real rates given the high rate of inflation
(25% in 1974, 18% in 1975 and 11%-12% estimated for 1976).
Forecasts
3.11      The investment planning in SBS and IBT is limited to one year
within the framework of their annual business policy. Both banks prepared
five-year projections of their operations and resources based primarily on
the Plan (1976-80) for their regions. However, these projections are ten-
tative and have high margins of error. For the Plan period 1976-80 the
projected resource gaps of 30% and 35% of the total long-term resource re-
quirements of IBT and SBS respectively are high but expected to be filled
largely with unidentified foreign borrowings. However, considering the
caution exercised in use of long-term resources (para 3.02) no difficulty is
anticipated in both banks being able to discharge their financial obligations
under their respective projects. The funds they need for the projects will
come mainly from Federal funds, which are assured under existing agreements.
Also the amount involved is small relative to overall operations of the banks.
The projected income statements and balance sheets (Annex 3, lables 9 through
12) indicate satisfactory debt-service coverage through 1980 and the current
ratio of a little above 1:1. Both banks are also expected to remain credit-
worthy in future years.
B. "Agrokombinat July 13"
3.12      The "Agrokombinat July 13" (AK) is, as the sole sub-borrower under
the Montenegrin project, responsible for the physical execution of the proj-
ect. It was created in 1963 by amalgamation of small agricultural production



- 10 -
and processing units. With its 2,800 employees it is the largest of four
agrokombinats in Montenegro. It: is an autonomous body structured along the
lines of social sector enterprises and managed by its workers, with the
status of legal person with mortgage and sale rights for the assets. Its
workers' council is the apex bocy which decides the basic policy of AK and
is composed of members elected from amongst the employees. The General
Manager is the chief executive cf AK and apointed by the workers' council.
He is elected for four years with the possibility of re-election. The man-
agement of the AK appears competent. The operations of the AK are carried
out by 26 basic economic units (WB Chart 16334). The AK is engaged in a
broad spectrum of activities covering primary agricultural production (crop
production, milk and livestock production, and plantations), agro-processing
industries (slaughterhouses, bakeries, fisheries, flour mills, winery, dairy
and feed mills), and marketing services (cooperative marketing, supermarkets,
retail and wholesale sales centers). It has substantial experience in irriga-
tion, fruit tree and vineyard operations and wine production; it has also
conducted for about six years pilot operations in the project area in vine
yard and fruit tree production, focussing on experiments with grape and tree
varieties, water and fertilizer applications and cultivation methods. The
financial position of AK, although small, is sound and its financial perform-
ance has been satisfactory. In the context of the self management system
prevailing in Yugoslavia, the financial objective of the AK is to maximize
the average net income per worker. Net income increased from Din 38 million
in 1973 to Din 110 million in 1975. The average net income per worker was
Din 35,500 in 1974 and increased to Din 39,500 in 1975.
C. Performance Under the Macedonia Agroindustries and the
First Agricultural Credit Projects
3.13      The objective of the Macedonia Agroindustries Project, to assist in
financing part of Macedonia's Agricultural Development Program relating to
investments in the social sector (livestock, agroindustry, storage and fish
ponds) and the private sector (farm mechanization, plantations, livestock
and vegetable production) was generally achieved up to the Bank's expecta-
tions and appraisal report estimates. Three studies were undertaken under
the project to provide a clearer understanding of private farm operations
and productivity improvement opportunities, marketing prospects for agricul-
tural products and further needs and benefits of various irrigation schemes.
All loan funds (US$31 million) under the Project have been committed and the
implementation of sub-projects is progressing satisfactorily. Disbursements
have reached US$22.80 million, or 74%. Delays in the implementation of some
sub-projects occurred because of procurement problems, which, for the most
part, have been successfully resolved, and heavy cost overruns (63% over
appraisal estimates) accompanied by difficulties in obtaining additional
financing. However, the rate of disbursements has significantly improved
recently and the actual disbursements as percentage of appraisal estimated
disbursements have improved from a low of 38.8% in early 1975 to 90% in
mid-1976. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 1978 as per
appraisal estimate.



- 11 -
3.14      The physical execution of the project has basically conformed to
the number and purposes envisaged in the Appraisal Report. Of the 43 sub-
projects envisaged and actually approved in the social sector, 21 are com-
pleted, 16 are nearing completion by the end of 1976 and 6 have not started
yet. The funds for sub-loans to the private sector through kombinats and
cooperatives are also fully committed and there is a carry over of loan
applications which will be covered under this project and the Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 1129-YU). The three studies under the project are com-
pleted and are being reviewed. The marketing and small farm credit studies
have contributed significantly to the development and appraisal of this
project. SBS has fulfilled all loan covenants satisfactorily.
3.15      Under the project the Agriculture and Forestry Loan Department of
SBS was reorganized and strengthened to more effectively handle its lending
operations. The appraisal procedures of SBS were streamlined to overcome
the major weaknesses and the appraisal reports have shown consistent improve-
ment, although some weaknesses still remain. The accounting and disbursement
procedures followed under the project were satisfactory. The progress in
developing appropriate management information systems and regular supervision
has been less than satisfactory. Greater attention will be focused on man-
agement information systems, regular supervision and adequate review and
provision for effects of inflation on costs. SBS's borrowing relationship
with the Bank has been helpful in gaining entry into foreign capital markets;
and arranging foreign co-financing for sub-projects.
3.16      The First Agricultural Credit Project included SBS and IBT as
participating banks. They were responsible for implementing the project
in Macedonia and Montenegro, respectively. Of the amount allocated to
Macedonia (US$5.1 million) and Montenegro (US$0.7 million) 49% and 40%
respectively were committed as of December 1976. Commitments for social
sector subprojects are running ahead of those for the private sector, due
largely to institutional arrangements in Yugoslavia, but a substantial pipe-
line of private sector subprojects should ensure the desired balance.
IV. THE PROJECTS
A. Summary Description and Objectives
4.01      The projects would provide credit to support Montenegro's and
Macedonia's long-term objectives of self-sufficiency in and increased exports
of agricultural production. They would make funds available through IBT and
SBS for credits to eleven social sector enterprises and some 1,000 private
farmers for investments in agricultural processing facilities and primary
production. Processing investments would include wine and wine-by-product
processing, cold storage, vegetable and fruit processing, vegetable collection,
tobacco drying, dairying and slaughtering facilities; in primary production



- 12 -
the project would finance irrigation facilities for and the establishment of
vineyard and fruit plantations, as well as investments in livestock, fruits
and vegetable production, and on-farm mechanization. Detailed project
descriptions and investment models are given in Annexes 4-7.
4.02      The projects would help achieve the Republics' agricultural develop-
ment objectives to increase agricultural production for the domestic market
and exports, to expand agroindustrial processing capacity, to improve product
quality, to stabilize food supply and to raise productivity and income, par-
ticularly on private farms. The investments have priority in the 1976-80
Agricultural Development Plans of Montenegro and Macedonia. Major constraints
to the further development of agriculture in the two Republics would be al-
leviated, i.e. for the social sector, the lack of capital for large invest-
ments in land development, irrigation and processing facilities and, for the
private sector, the lack of market outlets and credit for the purchase of
on-farm investments including better quality breeds, seeds, fertilizers and
agricultural machinery. The investments in processing facilities and in fruit
production, livestock and mechanization are expected to result in increased
production of mainly wine, table grapes, peaches, sour cherries, potatoes,
tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, milk and meat. The investments in wine pro-
cessing, fruit and vegetable production and processing and livestock produc-
tion and slaughtering facilities would also enhance export possibilities.
Expansion of the social sector's processing and marketing facilities would
create improved marketing outlets for private farmers' production and promote
cooperation between the social and private sectors. The projects would also
aim at strengthening the organization and appraisal and supervision capacity
of IBT and SBS.
B. Detailed Features
Montenegro
4.03      Prolect Components.  This project would provide for (i) the estab-
lishment of a 2,000 ha sprinkler irrigation system in Zone C of the Cemovsko
Polje plain, owned by AK and located south of Titograd, using both groundwater
and Lake Skadar water; (ii) land preparation for and planting of 1,300 ha of
vineyards with wine and 200 ha of vineyards with table grapes, 200 ha of peach
and 300 ha of sour cherry plantations, and 60 ha of windbreaks; (iii) 14 km
farm roads, equipment sheds and supporting facilities and experimental research
on new fruit tree varieties (30 ha); (iv) a winery with an annual capacity of
10 million liters including byproduct processing facilities; (v) a 3,000 m ton
cold store with blast freezing, grading and packing facilities for fruits and
vegetables; and (iv) a collecting center with a total of 500 m2 collecting and
storage space in the neighboring area. Preliminary design work on the irriga-
tion system, plantations and winery and cold stores has been completed. How-
ever, on the appraisal mission's suggestion the irrigation system would be
modified to a simpler and less capital-intensive design: the Lake Skadar
water would be pumped into a reservoir from where it would serve the distri-
bution system by gravity, instead of being pumped directly to the sprinkler



- 13 -
network; and the distribution equipment would consist of portable aluminum
pipes and sprinklers, instead of a heavy "boom o rain" equipment. A detailed
description of the individual components is given in Annex 4, para 17.
Macedonia
4.04      Project Components.  This project would include (i) processing facil-
ities in the social sector including a dairy plant, slaughterhouse, potato
cold store and fruit and vegetable processing facilities; and (ii) investments
for the private sector in grape and fruit production, plastic greenhouses and
mechanization for vegetable production, livestock and tobacco drying facili-
ties. Subloans would be provided for buildings and related infrastructure,
processing equipment, agricultural machinery, plantation establishment and
high quality livestock. Investments would be phased over a four year imple-
mentation period. US$100,000 would be provided to finance a feasibility study
for a wholesale marketing center in Macedonia, proposed in the marketing study
conducted under the Macedonia Agroindustries I Project (894-YU). A detailed
description of individual components is given in Annex 6, Chapter A.
C. Cost Estimates
4.05      Total project cost for the Montenegrin project is estimated at
Din 1,001 million (US$55.6 million) of which Din 361.6 million (US$20.1 mil-
lion) would be the foreign exchange component. Total project cost for the
Macedonian project is estimated at Din 1,008 million (US$ 56 million) of
which Din 378.4 million (US$21 million) would be the foreign exchange compo-
nent. Details of investment costs are shown in Annex 5 for Montenegro and in
Annex 7 for Macedonia and are summarized on page 14.
4.06      Cost estimates are based on May 1976 costs.  A physical contingency
of 15% for the irrigation and 5% for the other components (averaging 5.4%) and
a 49.2% price contingency have been added to the Montenegrin project; and an
average 5% physical contingency and an average 30.4% price contingency have
been included in the Macedonian project costs to meet expected inflation in
foreign and local costs during the implementation period.

The Bank loans would be in amounts of US$26 million for the Montenegrin proj-
ect and US$24 million for the Macedonian project (in each instance the loan
is expected to finance 100% of foreign exchange cost and interest during con-
struction on the Bank loan). The loan for Montenegro would be made to IBT,
which is familiar with administrative and disbursement procedures for IBRD
loans, for 15 years including three years of grace for on-lending to AK. The
loan for Macedonia would be made to SBS also for 15 years including three
years of grace for on-lending to sub-borrowers. The local financing for the
Montenegrin project would be provided by IBT (US$34.3 million, equivalent) and
AK (US$3 million, equivalent). IBT's loan would be funded from the FNP fund
(US$12.9) and from its own resources (US$21.4). The FNP funds would be onlent



- 16 -
to AK with a 20 year maturity including a three year grace period on a
"staggered basis", i.e. counting the full grace and maturity period from the
time of disbursement; interest during the "staggered" grace period would be
capitalized. IBT's own funds would have an eight year maturity with three
years of grace, again applying the "staggered" system; interest on these
funds would not be capitalized. The Government of Montenegro would cover any
deficit that may occur in AK's cash flow during the lifetime of the loan. 1/
The local financing for the Macedonian project amounting to 43% of individual
sub-project cost would be provided by SBS; the grace and maturity periods
would be adjusted to the needs of individual subprojects. Subborrowers would
contribute a minimum of 20% of subproject costs. IBT and SBS would also
finance any cost overruns that may occur in their respective projects.
Assurances on these financing terms were obtained during negotiations.
4.08      Both projects require financing of interest during construction.
The Montenegrin project investments in vineyards and fruit tree production have
a long gestation period and, therefore, a slow build up of cash flow as shown
in the project's cash flow projections (Annex 5, Table 4). The individual
processing investments in Macedonia also will not produce revenues for the
first three years and, taking into account their phasing over the project's
implementation period, would require financing of interest during construction
for four years. The subproject cash flows are given in Annex 7, Tables 4, 7,
10, 13, 16 and 19, and Annex 10, Table 2 for the total project. Without the
inclusion of interest during construction financing of US$5.9 million and US$3
million in the Bank's loans to IBT and SBS respectively, the cash flow posi-
tion of the beneficiaries and of the borrowers would be imprudently stretched
in meeting their obligations including the servicing of the proposed Bank
loans. With the inclusion of interest during construction on the proposed
Bank loans and the financing arrangements discussed in para 4.07, the subbor-
rowers' repayments under the two projects would be sufficient to enable IBT
and SBS to repay the respective IBRD loans within 15 years with three years
of grace and level payments of principal.
E. Disbursements
4.09      Bank disbursements would extend over about 6 years in Montenegro
and 5 years in Macedonia. An estimated disbursement schedule is given in
Annex 9. Disbursement of the IBRD loan in Montenegro would be made against
100% of foreign expenditures or 36% of local expenditures, up to a maximum
of 36% of total project cost. In Macedonia the IBRD loan would be disbursed
against 100% of foreign expenditures or 37% of local expenditures, up to a
maximum of 37% of the total cost of subprojects, as well as 100% of foreign
expenditures for the market center study. Disbursement requests would be
supported by full documentation including procurement contracts in both
I/   Such deficit is projected to amount to about US$18 million, equivalent,
during 1982 to 1987 and would require terms similar to those on which the
FNP funds are lent to AK.



- 17 -
Montenegro and Macedonia except for SBS subloans to private farmers for which
IBRD would disburse against certificates of expenditure. For the latter,
documents and contracts would be available for review by IBRD during super-
vision. Assurances on these disbursement procedures were obtained during
negotiations.
F. Procurement
Processing Facilities
4.10      The winery and cold store in Montenegro (US$18.7 million) would be
procured by AK and the processing facilities in Macedonia (US$43.7 million)
by the respective sub-borrowers under international competitive bidding
procedures according to IBRD Guidelines, under the supervision of IBT and SBS,
respectively. These facilities, except the tobacco drying sheds, would be
procured under a turnkey contract since the civil works need to be closely
integrated with the electrical-mechanical equipment. Domestic manufacturers
would receive a 15% margin of preference or the actual level of import duty,
whichever is less, in bid comparisons.
Irrigation Facilities, Collection Centers and Infrastructure in Montenegro
4.11      The civil works and equipment for the irrigation facilities (US$8.7
million) would be grouped into five contracts. The contracts would be phased
over four years and too small to attract foreign firms. The infrastructure
investments and collection center (US$2.0 million) are simple structures
mainly of civil works which due to their relatively small size are not likely
to be attractive to foreign contractors. These items would be procured, by AK
under IBT supervision, under local bidding procedures, which apply nationwide
and which have proven to be satisfactory to the Bank under ongoing projects.
The Bank would receive copies of draft designs for review and all contracts
as well as the bid evaluation reports.
Items for Plantation Establishment and On-Farm Development
4.12      Items for plantation establishment and on-farm development (US$38.5
million) would not be suitable for bulk procurement and international competi-
tive bidding because investments would be phased over 4 years and, in Macedonia,
dispersed throughout the Republic. Subborrowers would, under the supervision
of IBT and SBS, purchase equipment, fertilizer, seeds, planting material,
livestock and construction materials costing less than US$50,000 directly
through existing commercial channels, which include both domestic and inter-
national suppliers. The total of such direct procurement would be about
US$8.5 million. Such items exceeding US$50,000 (totalling about US$30 mil-
lion) would be procured by the sub-borrowers under IBT's and SBS's supervision
through local bidding procedures. The Bank would receive contracts and bid
evaluation reports on all items except those for on-farm investments in the
private sector (see para 4.09). Machinery and equipment dealers maintain
adequate supplies of spare parts, provide services and repair facilities



- 18 -
and are suitably competitive. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that the procurement procedures outlined in paras 4.10 through 4.12 would be
followed.
G. Environmental Impact
4.13      The project is not expected to have significant adverse environ-
mental impact on the project area. All processing facilities would have
adequate effluent treatment facilities.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization
5.01      The proposed loans would be channelled through IBT for the
Montenegrin and SBS for the Macedonian project. The IBT loan would finance
investments of AK, which would be responsible for the implementation of the
Montenegrin project.  A project agreement with AK would detail its responsi-
bilities. Accordingly IBT's role would be limited, apart form providing part
of the financing, to loan administration and financial coordination and
supervision. On the other hand, the loan to SBS would finance investments of
numerous social and private sector subborrowers and, therefore, SBS would be
responsible for implementing the Macedonian project.
5.02      IBT's organization (with some staff strengthening as discussed
below), financial condition and operating policies are adequate for its role
under the project. IBT's IBRD Operations Unit, which handles all work re-
lating to lending under IBRD financed projects, would also be responsible
for this project. The unit consists of five experienced economists and, for
agricultural work, it draws on the expertise of an agroindustries engineer
and an expert in agronomy/forestry from its Technical Group. Short-term
consultants are hired when needed. To handle the increased work load under
this project, the Unit's staff would need to be increased, to administer
efficiently the proposed loan. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
from IBT that it would appoint to the Unit a qualified and experienced agri-
culturist/agro-industries expert and a senior credit officer by September 1,
1977.
5.03      The Agricultural Operations Department in SBS is responsible for
implementing the first Agroindustries Project. It has sufficient expertise
in agriculture, livestock, irrigation and economic and financial analysis
areas. However, experience under the first Agroindustries Project indicates
continued weaknesses in appraising agroindustry subprojects, particularly
their technical and marketing aspects and in international procurement.
The SBS needs to strengthen the staff in its Agricultural Department by
appointing an agroindustries specialist and a marketing specialist both



- 19 -
to improve the appraisal analysis and to handle the increased volume of
business under the project. It also needs outside technical assistance in
international procurement. Furthermore, the coordination between different
departments of SBS under IBRD financed projects needs to be improved to avoid
delays in project implementation. To carry out effectively the supervisory
and administrative functions with respect to the project, the SBS would form
and maintain a unit staffed by five senior staff members. The unit, to be
headed by an Assistant General Manager of the SBS, would also include the
Director and Assistant Director of the Agriculture Loan Department and a
representative each from the Disbursement and Collection and the Foreign
Exchange Department. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
SBS that it would by September 1, 1977, appoint a qualified and experienced
agroindustries and a marketing specialist, employ consultants acceptable to
the Bank to assist in international procurement and form a coordination unit
as described above. With these proposed additions in staff and organization,
together with its satisfactory financial condition and operating policies
(Chapter III), SBS would be adequately equipped to implement the project
efficiently.
5.04      A Project Unit, organized as a Basic Organization of Associated
Labor (BOAL), would be created within AK for the implementation of the project
in Montenegro. The Unit would include the Project Unit Director and qualified
irrigation engineers, agronomists and procurement specialists and employ con-
sultants for specific technical and international procurement matters. The
Unit would have an executive committee consisting of: General Manager of
the Agrokombinat, who will also be the President of the executive committee;
Director and Division Chiefs of the Project Unit; Director of the internal
bank of AK; and the Director of the Agro-Economic Institute of AK. The
executive committee would be responsible for the Unit's operating policies
and procedures and supervise the project implementation. It would also play
a coordinating role between AK, the Secretariat of Agriculture and IBT. The
detailed organization of the Unit is described in Annex 3. Assurances were
obtained that AK would establish the Project Unit as described above prior to
effectiveness of the proposed loan, and continue to maintain it until comple-
tion of the project. The Director of the Project Unit has been designated
and participated in the negotiations. Assurances were obtained at the time
of negotiations that by September 1, 1977, the AK (i) would appoint other key
staff, appropriately qualified and experienced, and (ii) would hire consul-
tants, acceptable to the Bank, for irrigation work and procurement matters.
After the project's implementation, its facilities would be transferred to
the Agrokombinat's respective operating units. These units are adequately
organized and staffed, and follow satisfactory policies to warrant efficient
operation of the project facilities.
Training and Technical Assistance
5.05      A course in appraisal criteria and techniques used in Agro-
industries and Agriculture credit projects would be organized by SBS. IBT
would be invited among other banks to participate in the seminar. SBS would
also organize a procurement course with participants including staff of the
AK and other social sector enterprises likely to be sub-borrowers under the
project as well as IBT and other interested banks. The courses would be



- 20 -
held prior to March 1, 1978, and their contents would be acceptable to the
Bank. Assucances to this effect were obtained during negotiations. Efforts
would also be made to train SBS and IBT staff in agro-industrial lending
through participation in EDI courses.
B. Policies and Procedures of Projects Sub-lending
Appraisal Criteria
5.06      The IBT and the SBS would appraise the sub-projects and make the
sub-loans following the on-lending policies, procedures, terms and conditions
described in Annex 12. In summary, IBT would review AK's loan applications
taking into account particularly possible changes in the economic and market
environment, and the project's and AK's financial situation. SBS would
appraise each subproject paying particular attention to their technical,
financial and economic viability, to the marketing and supply aspects, the
inclusion of adequate contingency allowances and the creditworthiness of the
subborrowers. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
5.07      Assurances were obtained that IBT and SBS would ensure that the
seasonal credit requirements of each sub-borrower during the implementation
of the sub-project would be met.
On-lending Interest Rates
5.08      The interest rate for on-lending the IBRD funds under the Montenegrin
project would be 9% p.a. plus a fee of 2% p.a. for guarantee and other charges
resulting in an effective rate of 11% p.a. It would be 11% p.a. in Macedonia.
The interest rate on local funds would be the local rate for similar invest-
ments prevailing at the time the subloan is made. The foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the sub-borrowers in the social sector and by the Government
of Macedonia for sub-loans made to private farmers. The banks would take
adequate steps to protect themselves against the exchange risk of the foreign
exchange surplus accruing to them from sub-loan repayments occurring earlier
than amortization payments of the Bank loan. Assurances on these arrangements
were obtained during negotiations.
Free Limit
5.09      The IBT would grant the sub-loans to AK after reviewing the updated
loan applications. The sub-project has been fully appraised by IBRD and
normal control on implementation and design will be exercised through Bank
approval of tender documents and in terms of the Project Agreement with AK.
On these premises no prior approval by the Bank for the granting of sub-loans
to AK by IBT would be necessary, unless a major change in project design
would occur.
5.10      In view of SBS's continued weaknesses in sub-project appraisal
(para. 5.03), it would forward to IBRD its appraisal reports for social
sector sub-projects whose project costs exceed US$1.5 million, for review



- 21 -
and approval. In addition, the SBS would forward to IBRD for approval
also subprojects in the private sector having an aggregated investment cost
above US$1.5 million. This would result in the Bank reviewing about 6-7
subprojects for a total amount of US$ 45.0 million, or about 80% of the
Macedonian project. Assurances to this effect were obtained during nego-
tiations.
C. Project Monitoring
Audit
5.11      The IBT and SBS each would maintain an account for its respective
project. This would include disbursements made under the projects for all
sub-loans.
5.12      As required by Yugoslav law all banks and enterprises are audited
annually by the Social Accounting Service (SDK). Normal audit by SDK, which
is limited to verification of cash balances and checking of financial state-
ments for mathematical accuracy and comparisons with previous years, does not
conform to internationally accepted standards.  SDK has implemented a training
program for its staff, with the Bank's support, to undertake internationally
accepted audits of Yugoslav banks including SBS and IBT.  A reclassification
of the accounts of SBS and IBT was done by SDK for the year 1974 to eliminate
double counting. Interim audits of the 1975 accounts of SBS and IBT have
been done. Full audits with audit opinion on both banks are expected in
about 2 to 3 years as per schedule agreed under the Second Industrial Line of
Credit (Loan 1277-YU). Assurances were obtained from both SBS and IBT that
they would submit audit reports satisfactoty to the Bank, within four months
from the end of each fiscal year. Assurances were also obtained that the
banks will compile and furnish information on their loan portfolios in such
a fashion as to enable analysis of the quality of the loan portfolio.
5.13      The AK would maintain separate accounts for transactions under the
project and submit annual audit reports acceptable to the Bank within four
months of the end of each fiscal year. Assurances to this effect were ob-
tained during negotiations.
Supervision
5.14      SBS and IBT need to strengthen their supervision system to ensure
adequate technical and financial supervision of sub-projects during and after
construction. SBS would also require the social sector sub-borrowers and
the social sector enterprises borrowing on behalf of private farmers, to sub-
mi  SDK certif-` A  inancial statements within six months of the end of each
fiscal year. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.



- 22 -
Reporting Requirements
5.15      The SBS and the IBT would provide the Bank within 3 months after the
end of each quarter and year, respectively, with quarterly and annual reports
covering the progress of the projects, sublending operations under the proj-
ects, the financial statement, including all necessary information required
to assess the quality of their loan portfolio and general data on agricul-
tural and economic policy and market and financial environment affecting
the implementation of the projects. AK would submit through the IBT to the
Bank quarterly progress report on the physical execution of the project.
The SBS, IBT and the AK would set up project monitoring systems by March 1,
1978, to be designed on the basis of the study on project impact undertaken
under the First Agroindutries Project Macedonia and acceptable to the Bank and
would, on completion of the projects, evaluate the project benefits and assess
the economic impact thereof. Assurances to these effects were obtained.
D. Retroactive Financing
5.16      To start implementation expeditiously and to avoid delays AK intends
to appoint consultants for the detailed irrigation design work, order root-
stocks for the first 200 ha of vineyards and purchase machinery for land
development prior to the expected signature date of the proposed loan to IBT.
The appointment of the consultants and procurement of the goods would be done
in accordance with Bank guidelines. Retroactive financing for these expendi-
tures up to an amount of US$300,000 is recommended under the IBT loan.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production, Markets and Prices
6.01      Production.  The incremental annual production generated by the
projects would be:

/1   About 50% of the beef and mutton would be slaughtered in the project-
financed slaughterhouse.
The total value of annual incremental production at full development is es-
timated at Din 650 million (US$36 million) at 1976 prices. The incremental
primary production in the private sector would result from expanded area,
increased number of animals and increased yields ranging from 21% for beef
to 59% for milk (Annex 7).
6.02      Raw Material.  The winery and cold store in Montenegro would de-
pend for their raw material supplies on AK's production of wine grapes, table
grapes, peaches and sour cherries; and on the private farmers' vegetable pro-
duction from the neighboring areas. At full development, 14,700 m tons of
wine grapes would be converted into 9.56 million litres of wine; and 100 m
tons of table grapes, 2,000 m tons of peaches; and 200 m tons of sour cherries
would pass through the cold store. In addition, 3,400 m tons of vegetables
from private farmers would be collected and stored in the cold store.
6.03      The social sector processing units in Macedonia would receive their
raw material from social sector enterprises and private farmers, including
those financed under the project. Processing facilities have been a major
constraint on increased production and marketing, particularly for the private
sector; adequate supplies for the processing plants would be secured.
6.04      Markets.  Most of the incremental production of commodities financed
under the projects would be marketed domestically. With Yugoslavia's GNP
expected to rise substantially and further increases in tourism, the market
prospects for the projects' production are good. Some early vegetables and
fruits, particularly peppers, tomatoes, table grapes, peaches and cherries



- 24 -
as well as a substantial amount of the processed products, notably apple
juice concentrate, apple puree, frozen cherries and processed tomatoes,
would be exported, both to Western European and COMECON markets. The in-
cremental sheep production and the slaughterhouse investments in Macedonia
would assure continuity and expansion of exports to Italy and Greece and
enable Macedonia to exploit more fully new export markets in Arab countries
in North Africa and the Middle East. Expanded tobacco production would
largely supply the domestic market. A detailed discussion of market aspects
of the projects' commodities is given in Annex 2.
6.05      Wine to be produced under the Montenegrin project, equivalent to
about 2% of Yugoslavia's present production, would be marketed mainly domes-
tically. Demand for wine is projected to increase at about 6% p.a. 1/ and
somewhat higher for the project's high quality "Vranac" wine. The strong
demand for Vranac, as indicated by prices considerably above those for other
wines, is expected to continue. While export markets for ordinary wines are
stagnating or even decreasing, about 15% of the project's wine production,
which would qualify for the "appellation controlee" label of the Yugoslav Wine
Fund 2/, would have good market prospects in Western Europe and the United
States.
6.06      Prices.  Farmgate prices as well as farm input prices with few ex-
ceptions have, in practice, been determined by demand and supply. The Gov-
ernment's efforts to contain increasing prices have failed, largely because
of the inadequate price control mechanisms (Annex 1, paras 32 and 33). The
incremental production from the projects, which would result in substituting
for or reducing the growth of imports, or supplying otherwise not satisfied
needs, would not induce a reduction in producer prices since the expected
demand increase is likely to exceed the additional production. Thus rising
farmgate prices due to excess demand are expected, but they would increase
less than without the projects.
B. Financial Benefits
6.07      Under the Montenegrin project, the winery sub-component is projected
to generate a financial rate of return of 13% and the fruit orchards and cold
store component 17.7%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the financial
rates of return would range from 10.1% to 16.2% if the investment, or operat-
ing costs were to increase or the benefits to decrease by 10% (Annex 5). In
Macedonia the financial rates of return of the investments vary between 13%
1/   Demand on organized markets, which are supplied by social sector
enterprises.
2/   The Yugoslav Wine Fund awards the appellation controlee grade in
accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Office International
du Vin, of which Yugoslavia is a member.



- 25 -
and 28% (Annex 7). The sensitivity analysis yields the following: if invest-
ment costs would increase by 10% the financial rates of return would vary
between 11% and 24%; an increase in operating expenses by 10% would result in
financial rates of return between 11% and 25%; and if revenues were to drop by
10% the rates would range from 8% to 21%. All calculations are based on April
1976 Yugoslav prices for both inputs and outputs.
6.08      In Macedonia about 10 social sector enterprises and 960 private
farmers would receive credit under the project. The annual incremental
income of social sector enterprises at full development would be US$28
million, raising the income of the workers' families by an average of about
63%. In the private sector, the farm families' total annual income would
increase by US$4.6 million due to loans under the project. In Montenegro the
annual incremental income of the Agrokombinat is estimated at US$7.5 million.
The average workers' family income is projected to increase by about 55%.
The investment cost per beneficiary family for the two projects would amount
to about US$2,300.
C. Economic Justification
6.09      The Montenegrin project would focus on increasing production in
the social sector. AK would develop 2000 ha of land which so far has been
unsuitable for any agricultural production. During more than five years of
research and trial production AK established the project area's suitability
for grape and certain fruit tree production, which would be undertaken under
the project; it also gained experience in the most appropriate methods of
land development, irrigation, cultivation and fertilizer and pesticide use.
With no alternative agricultural use of the land, the project's economic
benefit to the Montenegrin economy would be substantial as reflected in the
economic rate of return of more than 17%. The project would complement the
Bank's lending under past and forthcoming agricultural credit operations in
Montenegro, which provide credit to private farmers, as well as the Govern-
ment's own allocation of credit to the private sector in the 1976-80 Agricul-
tural Development Plan. With the amounts foreseen for private farmers under
both the Second Agricultural Credit Project, which is planned to be presented
for consideration by the Board later this year, and Montenegro's Agricultural
Development Plan 1976-80, the needs of the private sector would be adequately
covered.
6.10      The Macedonian project would emphasize increasing the agricultural
processing and marketing capacity in the social and production in the private
sector. Apart from credit channelled directly to private farmers, the pro-
cessing facilities in the social sector would indirectly benefit private
farmers by providing marketing outlets and thus alleviating one of the main
constraints to increased production in the private sector.

6.11      Foreign Exchange Earnings.  The projects in concentrating on the
domestic market would, over their 30 years lifetime, generate about US$100
million in foreign exchange through increased exports. Taking into account
foreign exchange savings through import substitution and direct and indirect
import components of investments and operating costs, the total net foreign
exchange earnings or savings are estimated to amount to the order of US$60
million (at 1976 prices). This has been taken into account in the economic
rate of return calculation.
6.12      Employment.  The projects would generate an estimated 1200 man
years permanent jobs in Macedonia and 630 in Montenegro. For an additional
23,600 farmers (those receiving credit plus indirect beneficiaries), the
projects would reduce underemployment and provide means to use more fully
their free capacities in buildings. The additional investments and consump-
tion of inputs, such as fertilizer, pesticides, fuel, via their backward
linkages, and the increased production via forward linkages, would generate
sizeable indirect employment opportunities which were not quantified. The
productivity aspects of employment have been taken into account in the eco-
nomic rate of return.
6.13      Income Distribution.  The projects would finance investments in two
less developed regions in Yugoslavia with a per capita income of about 30%
below the Yugoslav average. Moreover, about US$4.4 million or 18.5% of the
proposed Bank loan to SBS would directly benefit an estimated 2,100 small
farmers in Macedonia 1/, of which about 1,350 farmers would belong to the
target groups with annual per .zapita incomes below US$340. Their incomes are
estimated to increase by about 40% for mechanization investments up to around
130% for livestock farmers.  The processing investments would bestow indirect
benefits by providing marketing outlets for their incremental production to
some 21,300 farmers in MacedonLa and about 170 farmers in Montenegro (Annex
11, Table 4), of which more than half are estimated to belong to the target
groups. The Macedonian project would also assist the efforts to reduce the
income gap between the social and private sectors.
6.14      Economic Rate of Return.  Based on the assumptions discussed in
detail in Annex 11 the economic rates of return were calculated for the
respective projects (see Tables 2 and 3 of Annex 11). The Montenegrin project
would generate a 17.3% rate of return; and the Macedonian project 25.6%. These
rates of return do not take account of the non-quantifiable benefits resulting
from the contribution of the project to improved resource allocation in the
agricultural and agroindustries sectors through training and institution
building. Sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the stability of the
respective rates of return to variations in project cost and benefit streams.
The variations are expected nol: to exceed 10% of the base estimate. The
results are:
1/   Farmers receiving credit, farmers benefitting from the tobacco drying
sheds which are processing tobacco solely supplied by private farmers,
and farmers sharing in mechanization investments.

Investment Costs    +10%               16.0%                23.2%
Operating Costs      +10%              15.9%                19.8%
Benefits             -10%              14.4%                17.0%
Both projects' rates of return are most sensitive to variations of benefits.
However, even under a pessimistic assumption of 10% lower benefits, the rates
of return remain satisfactory.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from IBT and AK as well
as from SBS that they would implement the respective projects and follow the
financing, disbursement, procurement, lending and reporting procedures discussed
above as well as implement the staffing and organizational requirements
outlined above.
7.02      The conclusion of a loan agreement between the IBT and the AK
securing the local financing and an agreement on on-lending of the Bank loan
to the AK, both acceptable to the Bank, would be conditions for making the
proposed loan to IBT effective. The establishment of the Project Unit within
AK would also be a condition of the loan's effectiveness.
7.03      Having received adequate assurances from the respective borrowers
and AK, the Montenegrin project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$26
million, equivalent, to IBT for a term of 15 years including a three year
grace period; the Macedonian project would be suitable for a Bank loan of
US$24 million, equivalent, to SBS for a term of 15 years including a three
year grace period.

The Agriculture and Agro-Industries Sector, Policies and Priorities
A. The Agricultural Sector
1.        The role of the agricultural sector in the economy of Montenegro and
Macedonia is outlined by the following indicators:

Agriculture contributed 14.9% to the total GMP of Montenegro, and 23% of the
total GMP of Macedonia, and absorbs 40% and 32% of the active working popula-
tion of the two republics respectively. Though its role has been declining
relative to the rest of the economy with the rapid progress of industrializa-
tion, it still remains an important sector in the overall development of
the two republics.
Production
2.        Total agricultural production grew between 1966 and 1975 at an
average annual growth rate of 3.6% in Macedonia, 2.8% in Montenegro. Fruits
and vegetable production increased most rapidly, encouraged by the rising

relative prices and expanded irrigation availability, mainly at the expense
of extensive grain production. Macedonia in addition increased significantly
the production of rice and sunflowers.

Most of the expansion of the vegetable production (and sunflowers in
Macedonia) was achieved by an expansion of the cultivated area. Yields
increased most significantly in the production of grain and rice.

3.        In the meat sector, the production of broilers increased most sig-
nificantly, increasing its share in total meat production between 1966 and
1974 from 9% to 17% in Macedonia and from 31% to 43% in Montenegro.
4.        Milk production in Montenegro increased continuously during the
last decade with average annual growth rates of 4-5%, due mainly to higher
yields per cow (75% of the incremental production). In Macedonia, milk
production stagnated until 1971 and began to rise since then with increasing
growth rates of 5-6%, based almost exclusively on an increase in the number
of cows rather than the higher yields per cow.

Agricultural Inputs
5.        Land Use.  Agricultural land use has changed in both republics
since 1963 in favor of high value fruit production.  Both republics reduced
their arable land (mostly meadows and pastures) by 7% and increased the area
under orchards and vineyards; newly irrigated land was predominantly planted
with vineyards and orchards. In Macedonia, 4% of total agricultural land
in 1974 was under irrigation and about 2% in Montenegro. The irrigated area
has increased by about 57% in Macedonia between 1965 and 1974 while it stag-
nated in Montenegro.

6.        Agricultural Population.  The active agricultural population dec-
lined by 1.5% annually in Macedonia and by 1.7% in Montenegro between 1961
and 1971.

7.        Fertilizer.  The application of fertilizer in the two Republics fol-
lowed roughly the overall development in Yugoslavia, although its level is
still below the Yugoslav average. It has risen in both republics by 8%-9% an-
nually since 1965, but reached only about 70% of the average per ha consumption
in Yugoslavia.

8.        Power.  The number of horses has remained practically constant in
both Republics since 1960, while the number of tractors increased. Most of
the tractors and agricultural machinery was purchased after 1970, particularly
by the private sector. The pace of mechanization was, however, remarkably slow
compared with other regions in Yugoslavia. While the number of tractors in-
creased by 10.6% per year during 1961-1973 in Yugoslavia, the rate of increase
is only 5.4% and 3.9% for Macedonia and Montenegro, respectively. Accordingly,
the hectarage per tractor is much larger in Macedonia and even more so in
Montenegro.

9.        Productivity.  Productivity in the agricultural sector is lowest
in Montenegro both because of the low level of modern input use as well as
extremely unfavorable natural conditions. Macedonia's agricultural sector,
on the other hand, is much more advanced and enjoys more favorable conditions.
The growth rate of production and the decrease in labor input amounted to an
average annual growth of labor productivity by 4%-5% in both Republics. The
labor productivity in agriculture in 1974 in Macedonia was about 7% higher
than the average for Yugoslavia; in Montenegro it was 11% lower in 1974.

Natural Conditions
10.       Both republics are characterized by extremely mountainous terrain,
with peaks rising well over 2,500 m. Plains and valleys suitable for culti-
vation make up hardly more than one quarter of the total surface of Macedonia,
while in Montenegro, which has the lowest ratio of arable land to total sur-
face area, a mere 6.8% of the land surface is in the plains, and only 15% of
the plains has favorable agronomical characteristics. The rest are either
sandy and unsuited to crop production, suffer from drainage problems, or are
liable to flooding. The mountains, with steep slopes, heavy soils and karst,
are generally unfavorable for crop production, but extensive upland pastures
make possible sheep and some cattle growing. The agricultural sector of
Montenegro and Macedonia has, accordingly, a "dual" structure, characterized
by extensive mountain farming oriented towards livestock and intensive lowland
crop farming.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
11.       The pattern of farming is also determined by the climatic conditions
which divide both Republics into two distinct zones - the Mediterranean (or
modified Mediterranean) climatic zone in the eastern and central parts of
Macedonia and the coastal belt in Montenegro, and the continental climate
zones prevailing in the mountainous regions of the two republics.
Organization of the Agricultural Sector
12.       Agriculture of Montenegro and Macedonia, like that of the rest of
Yugoslavia, is characterized by the parallel existence of two sectors - social
and private. Their relative importance is shown in the following table.

13.       The Social Sector.  The social sector has its origin in the post
war collectivization policy and received further impetus from the Agrarian
Reform which limited the size oE private holdings to 10 ha of cultivable land
and 25 ha of forest land. These limitations still apply. During the past ten
years the production capacity of the social sector has been increased, mainly
through capital investments, which increased by 163% in Macedonia and 72% in
Montenegro between 1965 and 1974 (Annex 1 Table 2). The increase of land
resources was limited to reclamation and purchase from the private sector
against lifetime pension payments to the private holders. It did not play
an important role during the last decade.
14.       The number of employees in the social sector (including processing
industries) in both Republics has remained at almost the same level since 1965,
fluctuating around 33,000 persons in Macedonia and between 3-4,000 persons in
Montenegro. However, the employment structure changed significantly especial-
ly in Macedonia, where the number of employees in primary production declined
by 7% between 1963 and 1974, from 26,900 persons to 24,900 persons.
15.       The social sector covers a variety of organizations, which include
agricultural kombinats, state farms and agricultural cooperatives (Zadruga)
and other organizations such as veterinary and research stations. There is a
tendency for social sector organizations in both Republics, as elsewhere in



ANNEX 1
Page 7
the country, to merge with the aim of achieving a more efficient use of
resources, especially of marketing and processing facilities and research and
planning services. In 1974, there existed only 48 autonomous kombinats and
93 autonomous cooperatives in Macedonia, against 80 kombinats and 521 coopera-
tives in 1970. In Montenegro there were only five kombinats and 9 cooperati-
ves in 1974, compared with 77 independent organizations in 1962. In Macedonia
the 12 most important social sector enterprises have formed the ZIKM (Central
Industrial Kombinat, Macedonia). The ZIKM is an umbrella organization which
supplies certain services to the enterprises of the organization such as
planning or assistance in planning, marketing and market research, and training
of staff. The social sector organizations which have formed the ZIKM remain
independent, autonomous organizations which pay the umbrella organizations for
their services and provide a financial guarantee for their existence.
16.       The social sector has been a dynamic force in the development of
modern agriculture in Yugoslavia and, in both Republics, its performance has
been remarkable. In Montenegro the volume of physical production in the social
sector increased at a trend rate of 5.1% between 1962-73, while in Macedonia,
the social sector recorded an average rate above 9% between 1965-73. The main
explanations for the rapid growth of the social sector in agriculture were:
(i) heavy concentration of investments in this sector; (ii) difference in the
"intellectual input" high-lighted by a 5.3% increase of university trained
workers in the social sector in Montenegro and 20% in Macedonia between 1963-
73, while the total employment in the social sector in the two Republics
remained at the same levels during this period-(para 14); and (iii) much
greater emphasis placed on research in the social sector as illustrated by the
existence of three major specialized research institutions in Macedonia that
do 65%-80% of their work for social sector enterprises, and an independent
research institute in Montenegro that derives some 40% of its resources under-
taking contract research for social sector enterprises.
17.       Growth rates of production within the social sector varied widely
between different subsectors, indicating the priority given to capital intensive
production.

19.       The share of the processing industry in the social sector's GMP in
the two Republics is relatively small in comparison with the rest of Yugoslavia.
About 20%-25% of the social product of the social sector of agriculture in
Macedonia is produced by the processing industry, while its share in Montenegro
is about 35%. The relatively small capacity is partly due to the orientation of
fruit and vegetable production towards early varieties for consumption in fresh
form. However, an expansion of processing facilities is justified considering
the planned expansion of vegetable production and the fact that both Republics
send part of their peak season production for processing to other republics.
Macedonia's relatively high share of sheep slaughtered in abattoirs shown
in the table below is due to strong export orientation of lamb production in
Macedonia.

20.       The social sector supplies more than 40% of the production sold on
organized markets in both Republics. This underlines its role in supplying
the cities. As elsewhere in Yugoslavia, the social sector is concentrating
on the labor extensive and capital intensive production lines, but it also
plays an important role in marketing labor intensive products of the private
sector, such as milk. The social sector markets 54% and 95% of milk marketed
in Montenegro and Macedonia respectively but shares only 55% and 24% of the
total production.

Private Sector
21.       The private sector in both Montenegro and Macedonia dominates in
terms of land area, labor force and production. It consists of 62,000 hold-
ings with an average size of 4.9 ha in Montenegro and of about 160,000 farms
with an average size of 3.1 ha of cultivable land in Macedonia.

An average of 4.1 persons live on a farm in Montenegro and about 3.6 persons
in Macedonia.  One active person worked on 2.6 ha of cultivable land in
Montenegro and 2 ha in Macedonia.
22.       The production in the private sector increased by 3.2% in
Macedonia and by 2.5% - 3% in Montenegro between 1970 and 1975.  Produc-
tivity and yields remained relatively low and the productivity gap between
both sectors continued to increase during the past plan period. The major
reasons are:
(a) a generally lower quality of land;
(b) lower share in the irrigated area;
(c) inferior varieties of seeds, plant and animals;
(d) low degree of mechanization;
(e) low fertilizer intput; and
(f) small farm size and scattered holdings.
23.       The income situation of the private farmers depends largely upon
the opportunities for off farm income, on the one hand, and on the possi-
bilities to intensify land use, on the other. The share of off-farm income
has increased considerably in both Republics. On the average off-farm in-
come contributes roughly half of the individual sector's total income in both
Republics. However, large differences exist with respect to:



ANNEX 1
Page 11
(a) the employment opportunities in the vicinity of the farms;
(b) the size of the farm;
(c) the natural condition of the farm location.
If unfavorable natural conditions coincide with a lack of opportunities
for off-farm work, as is the case in most parts of the mountains in
Montenegro as well as in Macedonia, the income of the farmers is extremely
low.
Cooperation between the Private and Social Sectors
24.       Cooperation between the social and private sectors takes the form
of trade in inputs and outputs, provision of services by the social sector,
such as supply of fertilizers, cultivation, harvesting, marketing and credit
and contract production. While such cooperation brings considerable benefits
to the private farmers, it is fairly limited - less than 5% of the farmers
in Macedonia, and 2% of farmers in Montenegro, are involved in contract
cooperation. Moreover, in both Republics, this form of cooperation shows
a declining trend. One explanation for the limited size of contract coopera-
tion may be that these two southern Republics, long under Turkish rule, have
not evolved a strong tradition in agricultural cooperatives as the northern
republics had done under the Austrian influence. Another reason is the
concentration of the major activities of the social sector in the valleys
and high plains and, therefore, a lack of adequate market outlets in the
mountains. The declining trend in contract cooperation is partly due to
the increasing importance of off-farm income, and the corresponding decreas-
ing interest in agricultural activities partly owing to the fact that
farmers are willing to enter into contract cooperation only so long as
they benefit in terms of learning new techniques and achieving higher
productivity.
25.       A more loose form of coooperation in the marketing of products
has gained importance in recent years in Macedonia. As Macedonia is a food
surplus region, the individual sector had to rely increasingly on the
social sector marketing its produce, particularly vegetables and fruits,
in other parts of Yugoslavia or abroad. The volume of the private sector's
production marketed via the social sector increased by 210% in Macedonia.
In Montenegro marketing through the social sector declined because as a
food importing Republic, private farmers had increasing opportunities to
sell their production directly on the local markets.

Extension Services
26.       Traditionally, prior to the setting up of independent extension serv-
ices, the provision of services to the private farmer, such as the introduction
of new varieties and improved breeds, and dissemination of new techniques was
made by social sector organizations. However, this arrangement had its limit-
ations. Unless private farmers had joined production agreements with social
sector organizations, they could not benefit from these services. Moreover,
social sector organizations have tended to concentrate in a small number of
comiiunes which are fairly well developed, and private farmers in underdeveloped
mountainous regions could not be reached by them. Hence, the distribution of
services has become uneven.
27.       In 1971, Macedonia established an independent extension service for
the development of private sector agriculture. In each of the thirty communes,
there is an independent extension station employing 2-4 university graduates
as experts. The services are fully financed from the republic and commune
budgets, the two sides sharing the financing in equal parts. The major objec-
tives of the extension services is the improvement of the production techniques
on private farms, the introduction of new varieties and the improvement of
breeds (in cooperation with the Veterinary Institute and the Institute for
Livestock Breeding). On the commune level, the extension service tries to
reach the farmers by carrying out production demonstrations and experiments
in higher yields varieties and breeds, offering technical advice and helping
farmers in preparing credit applications to be submitted to kombinats or banks.
In addition, the republic operates a central extension service that supports
the commune stations by supplying information materials, providing technical
assistance, facilitating exchange of knowledge and preparing local working
programs. In the periods 1974-75, the achievements of Macedonia's extension
service were as follows:
-    Artificial insemination of 71,000 cows (54% of total number
of cows in Republic).
-    Provision of 2,000 rams of good quality (0.2% of rams available
for service) and subsidies for 4,500 heifers (5.1% of Republic
total).



ANNEX 1
Page 13
Provision of 5,000 tons of seeds.
Provision of 541,000 fruit root stocks.
-    Carrying out of some 1,000 demonstration tests.
During this same period, it also assisted in providing credit for investments
in 1,300 tractors (23% of Republic total), 34,000 sheep (1.8% of Republic
total), 623 cows (0.5% of Republic total) and 236 holdings of orchards and
vineyard plantations. For the 1976 program, the Republic and the Communes
have set aside 20 million dinars and 10 million dinars respectively for
the extension service.
28.       In Montenegro, the extension service was officially initiated in
February 1976. Though it has not fully commenced its activities, the pro-
posal is to set up extension centers throughout the Republic. Each commune
is expected to have a center funded in part by the commune, and in part
through a central fund. A total of thirty-five persons is expected to be
working for the extension service on the Republic and Commune level.
Marketing and Prices
29.       As elsewhere in Yugoslavia, Montenegro and Macedonia have "organized"
markets with "authorized purchases" by social sector enterprises existing side
by side with "informal" markets where the peasants sell directly to consumers.

30.       The importance of the organized markets is relatively high in
Macedonia because of the orientation of large parts of the private sector's
production to delivery to other parts of Yugoslavia, or to exports. In 1974,
for instance, 42% of wheat, 27% of tomatoes, 63% of grapes, 58% of eggs and
73% of mutton were sold in the organized market (see Table above). However,
for sales to other republics, the private sector does not rely exclusively
on the social sector. Private farmers or informal groups of private farmers
send significant quantities (especially of early vegetables) directly to local
markets of larger cities in the northern republics.
31.       In Montenegro the role of the "organized market" has been less sig-
nificant. The Table in para 29 indicates that for all commodities other than
peppers, wool and mutton, less than 10% of total production goes through the
"organized market", reflecting the predominantly subsistence nature of agri-
culture in Montenegro.



ANNEX 1
Page 15
32.       Agricultural price policy rests on agreement reached by all the
members of the Federation, and currently three types of pricing arrangements
are used:
(i) Guaranteed minimum prices: applied to all important
agricultural goods (cereals, meat, wool) for which the
implementation of a price guarantee is technically possible;
(ii)  Minimum prices without guarantee of the Government:  Pre-
scribed mainly for those agricultural goods which need pro-
cessing, such as milk, sugar beet and other industrial
crops; and
(iii)  Prices free from intervention:  for goods which are marketed
in peasant markets or are highly perishable, so that effective
control is practically impossible.
33.       Guaranteed minimum prices are intended to be adjusted according
to changes in production costs. However, in practice the agricultural price
policy has not been able to prevent the actual prices from increasing above
the tolerance limit of 10% above the minimum over the past five years. The
Government lacks the necessary funds and storage capacity for maintaining a
buffer stock to smooth seasonal price fluctuations of basic staple products
like cereals and maize. The inefficiency of the price policy particularly for
grain has resulted in a similarly ineffective price control for those products
that are closely related to grain prices, such as pigs and broilers.

ANNEX 1

Taxation
34.       Social sector agricultural enterprises pay income and turnover
taxes and various compulsory and statutory contributions, in much the same
way as industrial enterprises. However, agricultural investments and most
inputs are exempted from turnover taxation. The income tax of kombinats
and cooperatives in Montenegro and Macedonia is proportional to their income.
The tax rate varies by region, ranging from 3.4% in Montenegro to 3% in
Macedonia. Compulsory and statutory contributions include a surcharge for
social insurance, allocations to the collective consumption fund, business
and reserve funds and payments to the Skopje Earthquake Reconstruction Fund
and the Fund for the Accelerated Development of the Less Developed Regions.
Private farmers pay a tax according to the cadastral value of their agri-
cultural land. The valuation is based on the estimated productivity of the
land with each republic applying its own rules in establishing yields, pro-
duction costs and prices to be used in arriving at cadastral income. The
valuation is updated every five years.
Agro-industries Sector
35.       Both Republics have a comparatively undeveloped agroindustrial base,
in Montenegro, due to its mountainous topography, agricultural production is
low and communications are difficult for effective collection of produce to
feed an industry. Consequently incentives are lacking to increase production
and volumes are generally insufficient to establish profitable agroindustries.
The main agricultural producing area is the Cemovsko Polje plain, whose poten-
tial will be partly developed under the Project.
36.       Macedonia is a major vegetable producing region within Yugoslavia
and there are substantial quantities of vegetables available for local pro-
cessing industries and for marketing in other Republics. The share of
Macedonia in the total Yugoslavia processed vegetable production has been
around 15-16% in recent years, having declined from about 25% in 1960. This
decline is due to the growing population of fresh vegetables in Macedonia
and the fact that the processing industry has not kept pace with the expan-
sion and, by having remained rather stationary, has become both insufficient
in capacity and to some extent obsolescent.
37.       In 1972, the industry processed 28,700 tons of vegetables represent-
ing a mere 6% of the total 483,300 tons produced.

38.       According to the above projections, the total output of vegetable
products in Yugoslavia will more than double the 1972 level and almost 50% of
the 1980 production will come from Macedonia. The greatest total growth will
be in canned products, although a considerable increase in frozen vegetables
production is also anticipated. Dehydrated vegetable output, which was neg-
ligible up to 1972 is expected to reach over 1,000 tons/year in Macedonia
and substantial increases are foreseen in the production of tomato juice and
other vegetable products.
D. Agricultural Development Policy and Priorities
39.       The disappointing performance of the agricultural sector in the
second half of the 1960s, with annual growth rates of production below 2%, and
awareness of the need to use more efficiently the resources of the private
sector, initiated discussions on an integrated policy approach for the agri-
cultural sector in the early 1970s. In July 1973 the Republics and Auto-
nomous provinces agreed on a common agricultural policy for the period up
to 1985. This agreement, called the Interrepublican Agreement on the Long-
term Development Policy for Agriculture, reflected the growing concern among
political and economic authorities that the country's needs for food can
only be met with the cooperation of the private farmers.
40.       Basic Principles.  The plan emphasizes as the basic principles
of the long-term agricultural policy:
(a) the further development of the social sector through
modernization of production techniques, expansion of pro-
cessing facilities, better utilization of available re-
sources and the adjustment of production to changes in
demand;



ANNEX 1
Page 18
(b) the development of private farms either through cooperation
with the social sector or through new forms of association
among private farmers to ensure further progress in the
socialization of agriculture and rural areas.
These principles have been adopted by all republics and provinces.
The operational part of the plan focuses on three areas:
(a) price policies;
(b) investment policies;
(c) private sector development policies through cooperation
and new forms of enterprises, the so-called associations.
The present price system as discussed above will be maintained in principle.
Market prices are intended to be kept within the range of + 15% of minimum
prices through interventionist purchases or sales. Minimum prices for live-
stock will be fixed in relation to the average price for maize. The ratios
aimed at are: for pigs 1:8.5; for heifers 1:10; for fattened sheep 1:6.9;
and for broilers 1:8.9.
41.       Investment Targets.   The draft development plans 1976-80 for the
two Republics envisage the following investment targets. Annual investments
are projected to reach 1.5 billion Dinars in Macedonia, more than 50% increase
against the previous plan period. In Montenegro, the plan calls for 1.5
billion Dinars investments for the whole period, of which about one-third is
planned for investment in the private sector. The figures include the
Cemovsko Polje project.
42.       Macedonia plans to spend the 7.5 billion Dinars foreseen for in-
vestments in agriculture as follows:
Irrigation                       Din 2 billion
Processing Industries            Din 1.5 billion
Primary Production               Din 4 billion of which about
1 billion is planned for the
private sector.
Montenegro plans to spend about 30% of the projected investments in the
northern regions for the promotion of livestock. The rest is to be spent in
plant and fruit production and irrigation.
43.       Financing.  The sources of financing will remain basically the same
as in the past. Investors' own Funds, including the contribution from the basic
turnover tax, will contribute about 30% of investments. The Federal Fund for



ANNEX 1
Page 19
the Less Developed Regions will contribute about 40% and the rest is expected
from international sources.
44.       To mobilize enterprises' own resource, the following measures al-
ready listed in the previous plan will be continued:
(a) income tax exemption for investments in agriculture;
(b) turnover tax exemption for investment credits in agriculture;
(c) interest rate subsidies for investment credits in agriculture;
(d) reduction of import duties on agroindustrial equipment not
produced in Yugoslavia;
(e) elimination of the Dinar deposit requirements with the National
Bank for foreign credits channelled into agricultural investments;
(f) increase in the foreign exchange retention quota from deprecia-
tion charges.
45.       Support will be continued to all social enterprises that establish
new or extend existing units for the cooperation with the private sector.
Moreover, new associations within the private sector will be promoted. These
associations may take various organizational structures, from loose coopera-
tion in machine services to full integration of individual farms in collec-
tive units, similar to the collective farms established in the early 1950s.
Farmers may leave the collective at any time with all their property, if
they wish to do so.
46.       Credits to private farmers will continue to be almost exclusively
channelled through cooperation arrangements with the social sector. Private
farmers' associations will also be directly eligible for bank credits.
47.       Growth Targets.  The Macedonia draft development plan projects the
same growth rates for 1976-80 as in the past plan period, i.e. an annual
production growth rate of 4.5% for the agricultural sector as a whole (8.5%
in the social sector and 3% in the private sector). Macedonia intends to
make full use of its competitive advantages in the markets for vegetables,
fruits, table grapes, rice and tobacco. It expects to increase is share
in the domestic markets for these products. For meat and milk, it intends
to raise the level of self-sufficiency of the Republic.
48.       Montenegro expects especially high growth rates in the production
of wine and fruit, taking into account the production of the Cemovsko Polje
project, which is expected to be in full production at the end of the plan
period. In the other areas slightly higher growth rates than in the past
are expected.

Evaluation
49.       The Agricultural Development Plan for the first time in Yugoslavia's
post-war development addresses particularly the private farmer besides pro-
viding comprehensive guidelines for further development of the social sector.
The major specific measures for the promotion of the development of the
private sector are:
(a) Promotion of cooperation with the social sector and estab-
lishment or improvement of the extension service in order
to achieve a more rapid transfer of modern technology
already available in the social sector.
(b) Provision of credit for small farm investments to comple-
ment private farmers' own financial resources and to increase
the incentive to use them for production purposes.
The measures address the most serious bottlenecks in the development of the
private sector. However, the support measures for the private sector are
practically limited to farmers that either form an association or cooperate
with the social sector on a contractual basis. In this way they will not
reach the farmers in the remote mountainous regions, where the social sector
is not represented and where the scope for cooperation is limited. Rural
development investments with emphasis on infrastructure components would be
a pre-condition for improving productivity and marketing of these farms.
In addition, socially oriented programs would have to complement production
supporting measures, particularly where the natural conditions are most un-
favorable for agricultural production. The five year plan apparently realizes
these difficulties in projecting low (but realistic) growth rates of private
sector production as compared with the projected growth rates for the social
sector. The resulting widening gap of incomes between both sectors will
reinforce the recent trend for private farmers to look for additional income
sources outside the sector. Since these opportunities are mainly available
around the cities and, frequently, in the more fertile plains the income
difference within the private sector will increase even further and may cause
serious development problems in the mountainous regions.



ANNEX I
Page 21
50.       The projected growth rates for the social sector have been achieved
in the past. Though it becomes more difficult to repeat them at the higher
level, it seems possible to realize them at least approximately, considering
the relatively large proportion of investments in irrigation and the corres-
ponding follow-up investments at the farm level.

Production
1.        Agricultural production in the Cemovsko Polje plain in Montenegro
and Macedonia depends largely on the availability of water. With irrigation
the project regions enjoy considerable comparative production and marketing
advantages for grapes, fruit, vegetables, rice, sunflower and tobacco, both
on the Yugoslav market and, for most products, on the European markets as
well. Production of these crops has expanded with the increase of the irrig-
ated area mainly at the expense of extensive grain production or grassland as
may be seen from the following data:

orchards, vegetable growing and livestock as well as through improving cul-
tivation methods and increasing the use of fertilizer and better seeds. It
would also influence the production and marketing structure by increasing
the production of early vegetables in plastic houses and by expanding the
capacity of the storage and processing industry.
3.        Vegetable Production.  Vegetable production covers about 10% of the
total arable land in Macedonia and about 40% of the cultivated land in Zone B



ANNEX 2
Page 2
of the Cemovsko Polje plain, the project region in Montenegro 1/. The private
sector produces practically the entire labor-intensive fresh vegetable crop,
which is largely sold on local peasant markets. Surpluses during the peak
season are also delivered to the processing facilities or trade organizations
of the social sector. The social sector farms, especially in Macedonia con-
centrate on capital-intensive production lines such as beans, peas and toma-
toes for their own processing facilities. The project would finance plastic
houses for the production of early vegetables, mainly tomatoes, peppers and
cucumbers. Plastic houses were also financed under the first agricultural
credit project and have found a very satisfactory response from private
farmers; production increased by more than 60% since 1973. Increased annual
production in plastic houses from the project at full development is proj-
ected to amount to 570 m tons. In addition mechanization will have an in-
direct impact on vegetable production which is estimated at 7,000 to 7,500 m
tons at full development.
4.        Fruit Production.  In 1974, Macedonia supplied 12% of the total
Yugoslav production of apricots, 11% of the apple production, 8% of the pro-
duction of pears, 4% of the production of peaches and 75% of the market pro-
duction of table grapes. Montenegro's share in total fruit production is
below 2%, except for peaches which amounted to 3.3% of the entire Yugoslav
production.
5.        Fruit production has been fluctuating with weather conditions.
However, yearly variations tend to be smaller in these two Republics than
in the rest of Yugoslavia. The production of apples, pears, sour cherries
and grapes shows a strongly upward moving trend since 1965. The area of
sour cherry and peach plantations has increased rapidly in recent years,
after a long period of stagnation (see Tables 4 and 5). Most of the new
plantations have not yet reached full production. In Macedonia the proj-
ect will result in an increase of orchard plantations in the private
sector of 110 ha and of table grapes of about 55 ha. In Montenegro, the
production of peaches, which amounted to 2,286 m tons in 1974 would be
raised by 3,200 m tons at full development of the project. The production
of sour cherries amounted to 143 m ton in 1974, 0.3% of Yugoslavia's total
production. The project would raise sour cherry production by 3,900 m tons
at full development.
6.        Tobacco Production.  Macedonia's annual tobacco production of 27,800
m ton in 1974 accounted for 47% of Yugoslavia's total production of 59,000 m
ton. Area and production have increased by 2-3% annually since 1971, after a
period of stagnation and decrease. tMacedonia and the rest of Yugoslavia grow
1/ For production data on vegetable, see Annex 2, Tables 2 and 3.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
mainly Oriental and semi-Oriental types of tobacco. Virginia tobacco ac-
counts for 15% of the total production; most of it is produced in eastern
Croatia. Production of Virginia tobacco was introduced in Macedonia in 1967
after a period of testing by the Prilep Tobacco Institute.  It is mainly
grown in irrigated areas and exclusively on private farms. Virginia tobacco
growing was supported by the tobacco drying sheds financed under the First
Agroindustries Project Macedonia.  It amounts, at present, to about 1,400 m
ton per year. Since 1971, Yugoslavia has exported about 18,000-20,000 m ton
of Oriental and semi-Oriental tobacco per year. Imports, mostly of Virginia
tobacco, declined from 5,500 m ton in 1971 to 1,800 m ton in 1974. Macedonia
enjoys very favorable climatic and soil conditions for growing Virginia tobac-
co. Substitution of Virginia tobacco for Oriental varieties as well as the
increase in area devoted to Virginia tobacco has been held back by the lack
of drying facilities. The total available drying facilities suitable for
Virginia tobaccos amount at present to 2,700 m ton (dried leaves).
7.        The project will increase the drying capacity by 800 m ton dried
leaves at full development, thus permitting an increase of the area urder
Virginia tobacco by 400 ha. The incremental production would mainly supply
the domestic market as the local demand for Virginia tobacco is expected to
increase with consumption of cigarettes, at a rate of 4-5% per year.
8.        Sheep Production.  About 25% of the total sheep herd is kept in
Macedonia. The number of sheep reached a peak of 2.2 million in 1968 and
subsequently has declined until 1972. Since 1972 it has increased again
with the improvement of the economic conditions and reached 1.9 million in
1975. 1.75 million sheep or 92% were kept in the private sector. The pre-
dominant race is the local Pramenka breed (in Macedonia subdivided into
two subraces: Ovcepola, which is kept in the east, and Shara, which is kept
in the west), with a low productivity (1-1.2 kg low quality wool per animal,
25-30 kg milk per lactation, and an average slaughtering weight of below 20
kg). The fertility rate is low with about 90-95 lambs per 100 ewes. The
average size of the herd in the private sector varies between 80 and 150
ewes; but herds of 500 sheep and more also exist.
9.        Macedonia's production of lamb exceeds its consumption.  Surplus
production is either exported or sold to other Republics. The production
of the low quality wool is processed locally. Market prices are low and
farmers frequently face difficulties in marketing the wool. High quality
wool from Merino sheep has a good market. Wool is sold at prices between 20-
25 Din per kg. The project would contribute to improved quality of both wool
and meat in the private sector. It would supply 20,000 sheep and produce at
full development 33,000 lambs, 1.8 million kg milk and 155,000 kg wool. In
addition, the new breeds would gradually upgrade existing herds and thus
further raise the production of quality lamb and wool.
10.       Milk Production.  Macedonia produced only 3.2% of the total milk
in Yugoslavia (2.9% of the cow milk and 25% of the sheep milk). Its share



ANNEX 2
Page 4
in the production sold on authorized markets is remarkably higher with 6.5%.
Macedonia is a milk deficit Republic. The number of cows fluctuated con-
siderably between 1961 and 1971. Since 1971 it has continuously increased
at rates between 5% and 6% annually, reaching 147,000 cows in 1975, of which
138,000 are kept in the individual sector. About 50% of these cows are the
Busha type of native race with low milk yields (usually around 800 kg per
cow and low meat producing pot:ential). About 20% are pure breeds (Friesians,
Montafons or Simmenthals) or F3/F4 cross breeds between Bushas and pure
breeds. About 30% of the cows are cross breeds at the F1/F2 level.
11.       The Government supports the improving of cattle breeds mainly in
the following ways:
(a) by artificial insemination. At present about 25% of the
cows in the individual sector are thus inseminated.
(b) by supplying and subsidizing selected "community bulls".
About 25% of the cows are inseminated at present in this way.
To avoid quality heifers being sold for slaughtering, the extension service
supports and subsidizes a heifer raising program for selected areas. The
project would assist the Government in these efforts by financing the pur-
chase of high quality breeds and investments in buildings and fodder pro-
duction on private farms. Its direct impact on the production of milk is
estimated at 2,700 m tons. The supply of high quality heifers to other
farmers will raise milk production indirectly.
Marketing
12.       The increase in production resulting from the project would be
absorbed predominantly by the domestic market. Exports would include some
of the early vegetables and fruit, wine and sheep production.
13.       Vegetable Marketing.  Most of the project's vegetable production
is consumed domestically, both within Montenegro and Macedonia as well as
in other regions. Most of the production "exported" to Yugoslavia's other
Republics is the surplus during the peak season for both processing and
direct consumption.
14.       The project region in Montenegro produces most of the vegetables
of the Republic (except potatoes). Its contribution to the Yugoslav market
is, however, marginal and restricted to the sale of some early vegetables
and some sales to processing industries. Macedonia's share in the total
Yugoslav production of tomatoes and peppers amounted to 28% and 35% respec-
tively in 1973/75. It contributed considerably to Yugoslavia's exports of
tomatoes and peppers.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
15.       The main buyer of Yugoslavia's peppers is the Federal Republic
of Germany, which absorbed 63% of Yugoslavia's pepper exports in 1974 (see
Table 10). Germany's pepper imports since 1967 increased by more than 30%
and are likely to continue to rise, although probably with slightly de-
creasing growth rates. Yugoslavia has maintained successfullly its compet-
itive position in West European markets against increasing competition,
mainly from Bulgaria, Romania and Spain. It can be expected that with their
closeness to the main market and long experience in marketing in this field,
Yugoslav exporters will continue to be competitive. Tomatoes were largely
exported to the German Democratic Republic (66% of total exports in 1973,
as shown in Table 10). In Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia meets heavy competition
of Comecon members, notably Bulgaria and Romania whose total 1972 exports
about equalled Yugoslavia's entire production. Because of poor market data
and the presence of state trading, Yugoslavia's prospects in the Eastern
European markets are uncertain and difficult to evaluate. Western Europe,
which absorbed about 10% of Yugoslavia's tomato exports, may become more
interesting in the future. Total demand in Western Europe is likely to
rise by approximately 2% per year. Macedonia's competitive position in
these markets would be strengthened by expanding the early production.
16.       Domestic vegetable consumption, excluding beans, has been growing
since 1966 at 3.5% to 4% per year, with slightly increasing growth rates
after 1969 (Table 13). Per capita consumption, approximately 84 kg in 1975,
is comparatively high relative to the country's per capita income level.
Production and consumption since 1965 developed more or less parallel, al-
though price development suggests that there might have been a slight
tendency of production to lag behind consumption in recent years except in
the main season (Table 12). The increase in consumption is likely to con-
tinue except for potatoes and beans. Yugoslav sources estimate the annual
increase of the future demand at 3-4% based on an income elasticity for
demand of 0.6 thus projecting a per capita consumption of 115-120 kg
(excluding beans and potatoes) in 1985. FAO projections, based on an
income elasticity of 0.5 arrive at consumption growth rates of about 3%.
17.       Seasonal prices have fluctuated in wide ranges during 1972-74,
(Table 12), indicating the uneven supply distribution during the year.
While there is some tendency towards oversupply during the main season,
the supply of fresh vegetables is low or non-existent between November and
May. In summary, it can be concluded that there is only limited room for
the expansion of consumption during the main season at prices that cover
production costs. There is, however, a large and growing need for vege-
tables outside the major season. This off-season demand can only be
satisfied if the supply is adjusted to avail of it. The project takes
this situation into account by providing for investments in plastic houses
to extend the growing season and for investments to enlarge the storage and
cooling capacity.



ANNEX 2

18.       Fruit Marketing.  The project region contributes considerably
to the supply of apples, table grapes and early peaches on the Yugoslav
market and to the export of table grapes and of early peaches. Fruit
consumption in Yugoslavia follows more or less the development of supply.
Imports are insignificant. Exports play a role only for soft fruits,
early peaches and table grapes; in 1974, 17% of their total market produc-
tion was exported.
19.       Exports of grapes have tripled in value since 1970.  The export
by volume increased by 115% between 1970 and 1974. East Germany has become
the major importer, with 1974 imports amounting to 43.6% of total Yugoslav
exports in 1974, followed by Czechoslovakia and Austria (see Table 11).
Yugoslavia's competitive position in the East European markets is good
and further export increases to these areas can be expected. In the West
European markets it meets heavy competition from other Mediterranean coun-
tries and there is probably only limited room for further expansion.
20.       Peaches are marketed predominantly in Yugoslavia.  Only less than
1% of the peach production is exported. The United Kingdom absorbed 44% of
total Yugoslav exports in 1974, 24% were exported by Austria and the rest
went to Comecon countries, notably to Czechoslovakia, the predominant buyer
of Yugoslavian peaches in the Eastern Bloc. Export prospects to Eastern
countries may improve somewhat. Demand for peaches in Western Europe is
likely to continue its steady growth since 1960. Yugoslavia has succeeded
to export against heavy competition from Italy and Greece, mainly the early
production from the project regions. It is likely to defend or even improve
its position successfully. Domestic market prospects continue to be good,
particularly as Montenegro and Macedonia enjoy the advantages of early produc-
tion. A consumption growth of 3% to 4% per year has been projected with the
demand for early production increasing even faster.
21.       The market for fresh apples is limited to domestic consumption.
Only concentrated apple juice is exported, mainly to the Federal Republic of
Germany (67%) and the United States (31% of total exports). Exports of con-
centrated juice increased 120% between 1970 and 1974. The demand has in-
creased rapidly as reflected by a price increase of more than 400% during
the same period. The project's production is expected to be marketed mainly
in the Federal Republic of Germany, where market prospects appear good.
22.       Yugoslavia's production of sour cherries is sold about evenly do-
mestically and abroad. Exports are well diversified with Eastern European
markets absorbing about 80-85% of total exports. The main exporters are the
Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, France and
Great Britain. The market prospects for sour cherries are excellent, both
in Yugoslavia as well as in Eastern Europe. Production has lagged behind
demand, and the situation is likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable
future.

23.       Market for Sheep Production.  Domestic consumption of mutton and
wool increased modestly since 1965 with average annual growth rates belo- 2',,
with a tendency to stagnate during recent years. The stagnating consumption
is mainly due to insufficient supply at prices that would prevent consumers
shifting to the consumption of pork and poultry meat.
24.       Exports decreased by almost 50% between 1967 and 1974 from 4,600
m ton to 2,370 m ton, although export prices increased drastically from
16 Din per kg (carcass weight) in 1968 to 43 Din per kg in 1974. About 99%
of all exports went to Italy in 1974. The EEC's import restrictions on meat
drastically reduced exports to Italy and prospects that they would return
to the previous levels are uncertain. Macedonia, which has a large share
in Yugoslavia's sheep exports, is particularly hard-hit. However, it should
be possible to market the relatively small portion of the production so far
exported (5% of the total production has been exported) partly on the do-
mestic market and partly on the new export markets. Domestic sales would
require a reduction in prices by about 15-20%. New export market prospects
appear in some Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The
slaughterhouse investments under the project, designed to allow slaughter-
ing according to international hygienic standards and to Moslem regulations,
would be essential in opening up such export markets. In 1975, Macedonia
exported live sheep to Tunisia as it lacked proper slaugthering facilities.
With suitable facilities and a determined export effort, Macedonia should be
able to gain ample access to these markets and to compete successfully
against other suppliers, such as Romania and Bulgaria.
25.       Milk and milk products are entirely consumed in Macedonia.  Per
capita consumption of milk increased from about 29 kg in 1965 to about 65 kg
in 1975, with annual growth rates slightly above 8%. The consumption level
is still about 20% below the average consumption of Yugoslavia, mainly be-
cause of the insufficient supply. Consumption of milk products increased an-
nually by 3-4% since 1965 and corresponds at present to the average per cap-
ita consumption in Yugoslavia of about 7 kg. Milk production in Macedonia
is not likely to meet the future demand. The investments in livestock and
dairy facilities under the project would help to close the gap.
The Wine Market
Past Development
26.       The area under vineyards in Yugoslavia declined slightly from
261,000 ha in 1965 to 248,000 ha in 1975. Production of grapes and wine
during the last 10 years showed a slightly upward moving tendency, with
an average annual growth rate of about 1-1.5% between 1965/67 and 1973/75.
However, growth varied significantly annually and by region: production
increased strongly in Montenegro and Macedonia, while it stagnated in Serbia
proper and Vojvodina. The latter shared 37% of the total production in 1974.

27.       Domestic consumption has increased continuously since 1965 with an
average annual growth rate of about 2%. With total production and consumption
moving parallel, the wine market appeared relatively stable during the last 10
year period. However, behind the overall wine market development there oc-
curred fundamental structural changes that may have significant repercussions
for its future development.
28.       Market Organization.  The organization of the wine market follows
in principle the general structure of agricultural markets. Like the market
of other products it consists of two parts:
(a)  the "unorganized (peasant) markets", where private farmers sell
their home-made wine directly. This market includes family
consumption of home-made wine in rural households;
(b) the "organized market" with authorized purchases, where
social sector enterprises sell commercially processed wine.
29.       The wine sold on the unorganized market is processed on private
farms using the farmer's own grapes. The share of the unorganized market
in total production is steadily declining, although it still amounts to
about 75%; the share varies widely between the Republics ranging from 0%
in Kosovo to 80% in Slovenia.

Slovenia                                          80
Serbia Proper                                     61
Kosovo                                             0
Vojvodina                                         79
30.       The organized market consists of:
(a) wine from grapes of the social sector and processed in social
sector wineries;
(b)  wine from grapes produced in the private sector and processed
in social sector enterprises; and
(c)  wine from grapes produced and processed in the private sector
sold through the trade channels of the social sector.
The importance of these categories varies widely between the Republics.
While in the project regions almost all wine sold on organized markets is
processed in wineries of the social sector, the share amounts to only 40%
in Serbia and Croatia.

Croatia                                 41
About 70-75% of the grapes that are processed in the wineries of the social
sector are produced in the private sector, the portion varying between years
and regions.

In Montenegro the social sector is practically the sole producer of grapes.
The soil and climatic conditions of the individual sector are not suitable
for wine growing and other crops are more competitive.
31.       Organized market demand grew at a rate of 7-7.5% per year since
1970, while production increased steadily between 1965 and 1974 with average
annual growth rates of 8-9%. The low grape harvest in 1975 (30% below the
peak production in 1973 and 10% below the already subnormal production in
1974) caused a sharp drop of the total wine production, which probably has
interrupted the upward trend of market production. However, available pre-
liminary figures do not permit a definite statement.

32.       Exports.  The surplus of the organized market production was absorbed
by increased exports. About 42% of the total market production was exported
in 1974. Since 1970 exports increased by 218% equivalent to an average annual
growth rate of 22%. The low 1975 production and the surplus conditions on the
West European markets caused a decline of Yugoslavia's exports by 23%, from
830,000 hl to 640,000 hl, the level of exports in 1973. Imports of wine in-
creased from 6,000 hl in 1970 to more than 200,000 hl in 1973 and about
160,000 hl in 1975. Imports are mainly low quality wines from Morocco and
Algeria used largely for blending and processing.
33.       Bottled Versus Bulk Exports.  About 87% of the wine was exported in
barrels. Exports of quality wine in bottles gained importance during recent
years but amounted only to 13% of exports in 1974.

The structure of exports is more determined by the market organization in the
receiving countries than by an active Yugoslav marketing policy. The export
of wine in bottles is of major importance only in Eastern countries which lack
the necessary storage and bottling capacities for the import of wine in bulk.
Also the USA and Canada import largely bottled wine as small trading firms
without bottling facilities handle most of the imports. Countries like the
Federal Republic of Germany, where about 80% of the total imports is handled
by one large firm, prefer to use their own storage and bottling facilities to
enlarge their profit margin.
34.       Regional Export Structure.  About 54% of the total exports in 1974
went to the EEC countries, one third to the Comecon and about 6% to Japan,
which has become the most important customer outside the EEC and the Comecon.
Japan increased its imports from Yugoslavia from 4,000 hl in 1970 to 50,000
hl in 1974. The major part of the large increase in exports between 1970
and 1974 was, however, absorbed by EEC countries, especially by the Federal
Republic of Germany, who increased imports of Yugoslav wine by 2.45 million
hl or more than 300%, thereby absorbing 54% of the total increase in exports
between 1970 and 1974. Comecon countries increased their exports by only
97,000 hl accounting for 21% of the total increase of exports between 1970
and 1974.

35.       Prices.  Export and domestic prices increased continuously since
1970 indicating the stable market conditions Yugoslav producers have enjoyed
so far.

Within individual years prices varied considerably between countries and, on
the domestic market, between regions, indicating in both cases mainly quality
differences (see Table 14). Quality wines achieved from 20% to 40% higher
prices in general. Market differentiation according to quality, particularly
creating a separate market for high quality wines, is in the initial stage.
Montenegro is leading in these efforts as it produces relatively high quality
wines.

Prospects
36.       General.  Basic trends of production and consumption on the domestic
markets, as discussed above, will continue in the next years. However, growth
rates are likely to change and endanger the stable development of the past.
Projections of Yugoslav Wine Fund imply the following growth rates:

Projected Annual Growth Rates 1975 - 1985
Area under vineyards                                0.5
Yields                                              4-5
Production of grapes                                4-5
Total wine production                               4-5
Organized market production                          9
Demand on organized markets                         3-4
These projections show that a tendency towards surplus production is built
into the present development, unless the rapid increase of exports continues.
37.       Exports.  The prospects for Yugoslav wine exports depend on the de-
velopment of the wine markets in the following countries or country groups:
(a) the EEC
(b) the Comecon
(c) Japan
(d) United States and Canada
38.       The EEC is the most important market for Yugoslav-exports absorbing
more than half of the total wine exports and two-thirds of the increase of
exports between 1970-1974. The short-term outlook for imports into the EEC
has improved slightly with the "normal" EEC harvest in 1975/76, after several
surplus years caused by the good harvests in 1973/74 and 1974/75.

Medium and long-term outlooks are less favorable. Direct wine consumption
stagnated practically since 1968/69. The increase of total consumption
was mainly due to increased use of wine for processing to alcohol, partly
supported by Government subsidies.

39.       Per capita consumption in the EEC varied between 48 and 51 kg since
1970, varying from 2 kg per capita in Ireland to more than 100 kg in Italy and
France. Differences are explained by consumption preferences rather than
by differences in per capita incomes. This suggests that future consumption
is likely to stagnate or to increase only modestly. The stagnating direct
consumption is likely to continue with small variation between countries.
Additional expenses for wine are likely to be spent mostly for higher quality.
Production is likely to continue to increase as replanting of old vineyards,
especially in Italy and France, will increase yields. There is also an
increase in the area under vineyards expected.
40.       The new regulations for the wine market in the EEC implemented
in May 1976 try to tackle the surplus problem by preventing new planting of
vineyards until 1978 (except vineyards for the production of quality wine in
certain regions) and by granting premiums to farmers who give up the produc-
tion of low quality wines without establishing new vineyards within the next
six years. It is, however, doubtful that these measures will achieve their
intended objective, since the EEC has at the same time raised the guaranteed
minimum price for low quality wine, thus providing a strong production in-
centive. Therefore, the tendency of supply to grow faster than demand is
likely to continue.
41.       Yugoslavia shares only 4% of the total wine imports of the EEC and
has so far succeeded in defending and even increasing its market share. Recent
changes in the foreign trade policy of the EEC have worsened the competitive
position of Yugoslav wine producers considerably:
(a)  by granting duty free import quotas of yearly 550,000 hl
(about 10% of present total imports) to the Magreb States;
(b)  by increasing the degree of protection for domestic pro-
ducers and by determining a minimum import price for im-
ported wine (reference price) which is enforced by a
variable duty, if necessary.
The pressure from third countries to receive preferred access to the Common
European Market will continue. Greece, Portugal and Spain are probably the



ANNEX 2
Page 16
next candidates. Granting preference to these countries would have a major
impact on Yugoslavia's market position, particularly in West Germany and the
United Kingdom. The EEC's concession to the Magreb States would affect
Yugoslavia only indirectly since most of the Magreb wine is imported to
France, to where Yugoslavia is not exporting.
42.       Yugoslavia is likely to be able to defend its present position suc-
cessfully since the major part of its imports to the United Kingdom and to
West Germany is in the hands of a very few effective and powerful importers.
Nevertheless, expansion of exports will become increasingly difficult; ex-
ports are likely to stagnate or at best may increase by 1 - 2% annually.
Moreover, the possibility that the Common Market will impose a ban on wine
imports from non-preference countries in years of great surplus cannot be
excluded entirely in the light of past experience on other markets.
43.       Export prospects for high quality wines (appellation controlee) are
more favorable. The market for well-established, high-quality wine, of which
only limited quantities are available, has hardly been affected by the general
surplus situation in the EEC. The prices remained high. On the other hand
less known quality wines experienced a considerable price decrease close to
the price level of ordinary wines. The conclusion is that wines of selected
qualiity will have good chances, regardless of whether they are produced
inside or outside the Common Market area. However, to exploit these chances
by introducing wines unknown to consumers, such as the Vranac wine to be pro-
duced under the project, requires not only high-quality production but also
skillful marketing efforts. Yugoslavia and particularly the Cemovsko Polje
plain have the potential for producing excellent wine.
44.       Limited information exists about the market of the Comecon Member
Counties. Yugoslav exports increased moderately with annual growth rates
of 3 - 4% during the last years. Considering the present level of wine con-
sumption in Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany and the USSR and their prospects
for general economic development, one can expect a continuation of the in-
crease of exports to these countries with similar orders of magnitude as in
the past.
45.       The rapid increase of wine exports to Japan has induced ambitious
hopes in Yugoslavia. An increase of exports from 50,000 hl in 1974 to more
than 150,000 hl is planned for 1976. Japan is a new-comer on the interna-
tional wine market; it increased its imports from 13,710 hl in 1969 to almost
400,000 hl in 1974, of which Yugoslavia imported 13%. Sharp competition is
likely to develop among wine exporting countries and the increase of consump-
tion in Japan has to be projected with great caution, since the general public
has not yet developed a wine-drinking habit. Yugoslavia's export prospects
should not be overestimated therefore. The growth rates of its exports since
1970 are not likely to continue.



ANNEX 2
Page 17
Conclusion
46.       Wine Exports.  The growth rate of Yugoslavia's wine exports since
1970 will decrease considerably. Exports are likely to increase at growth
rates around 3% and possible somewhat faster if Yugoslavia succeeds in using
its potential of producing high quality wine.
47.       Domestic market.  The main market for Vranac wine will remain the
domestic market. The projections of the Wine Fund for domestic markets (see
para 35) may be slightly too pessimistic, especially if prices in real terms
were to fall under the pressure of increased supply, demand on the organized
market is likely to increase faster, and one might expect growth rates of
5 - 7% assuming an income elasticity of demand of 0.7 and a price elasticity
of demand around 1.0.
48.       Vranac is a high quality red wine produced mainly in Montenegro and
Macedonia, which resembles famous French wines like Chateauneuf-du-Pape or
Paul Masons Pinot Noire from California. So far it is used for direct con-
sumption almost only in Montenegro and Macedonia. Outside the project regions
it is mainly used fore blending because of its dark red color and its special
flavor. In 1975 it was sold in Mlontenegro at 13.75 Din/I in bulk and at 18 -
22 Din/i in bottles. These prices are considerably above the average (see
para 34) indicating that the demand for Vranac wines is high.
49.       The increasing pressure of supply in Yugoslavia may lead to a more
distinct separation of the markets of high-quality and ordinary wines, similar
to the development in Western Europe. Experiences there shc-w that fluctua-
tions of prices and quantities in the former markets are considerably smaller
than on the ordinary wine markets. To create a stable long-term market for
Vranac, efforts need to be continued to establish Vranac as a high quality
well-known wine outside Montenegro. A promising start has been made. In
early 1976 the wine received the appellation controlee label from the Yugoslav
Wine Fund in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Office Inter-
national du Vin, of which Yugoslavia is a member.

Financial and Institutional Aspects
A. The Banks' Legal Framework and Accounting System 1/
I. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
1.        The basic legal framework under which Yugoslav banks operate is
provided by the Federal Banking Law of December 1971 and each bank's statutes.
Major provisions of this law and of the statutes of the proposed IBRD bor-
rowers - SBS and IBT - are the following:
(a) A bank cannot be founded by fewer than 25 founders; the
minimum conditions of joining and withdrawals of founders
are prescribed by the statutes.
(b) A bank must have a minimum of Din 50 million as founders
fund (capital). Prior to 1975, a founder could have up to
10% of the total voting rights depending on his share in the
founders fund, but now each founder has one vote.
(c) The founders of a bank have an unlimited liability in respect
of the bank.
(d) The bank's statutes prescribe the powers of the various managing
organs. The bank Assembly consisting of representatives of the
founders is the highest governing body of the bank.
(e) The Assembly appoints the bank's chief executive and members
of the Executive Board and Credit Board.
(f) The Assembly approves the bank's annual business policy and
the policy on interest rates and decides on the allocation.
(g) Banks are required to make a yearly appropriation to a Reserve
Fund out of income, of at least 0.5% of loans outstanding at
the year-end. This fund can be used only for writing-off bad

vening period up to the time of this Appraisal.

debts and, temporarily, for meeting the bank's obligations in
case of tight liquidity. The resources of this fund have to
be generally maintained in liquid or semi-liquid funds.
(h) Banks are required to write-off bad debt first against income.
Write-offs against the Reserve Fund are only possible to the
extent that there is insufficient income.
(i)  A bank will be liquidated if it is unable to meet its obligations
for more than six months.
(j) In case of liquidation, the deposits of individuals with the
bank have priority over all other creditors of the bank. (In
addition, such deposits of individuals are also guaranteed by
the Federal Government under a separate law).
2.        In addition to the Banking Law, the banks have to comply with
various regulations and directives issued by the National Bank of Yugoslavia
and the Federal Government. The main directives which have a direct implica-
tion on the banks' financial operations are:
(a) Liquidity Requirements. The banks have to maintain a certain
proportion of their demand deposits (currently ranging from 2%
of domestic savings accounts to 24% of enterprises' giro
deposits) as deposits with the National Bank. The primary
purpose is to ensure adequate liquidity of banks but the
measure is also used as a tool for implementing monetary policy.
(b) Foreign Exchange Regime. Only authorized banks can undertake
foreign exchange transactions under supervision of the National
Bank. SBS and IBT are so authorized. When making a foreign
exchange loan to an enterprise, a bank has to ensure that the
borrower will be in a position to generate sufficient foreign
exchange funds (through retention quotas against depreciation
and exports, and special quotas) to repay the loan. The banks
are also authorized to buy and sell foreign exchange at the
Belgrade foreign exchange market. All foreign borrowings are
regulated by the National Bank and have to be registered with
it prior to and after the borrowing is contracted.
(c) Limitations Regarding Banks' Overall Commitments. Under a
Federal Law, passed in the second half of 1975, a bank is
required to keep the level of commitments of guarantees and
investment loans within the limits of its liquid investment
potential. Under the law, the Federal Executive Council shall
specify which resources shall constitute a bank's liquid in-
vestment potential and the conditions under which guarantees
can be made. It is intended that banks shall report periodic-
ally to SDK the status of their liquid investment potential



ANNEX 3
Page 3
and obligations incurred, while SDK, in turn, shall inform the
Federal Executive Council. The law seeks to tighten the
financial management of investments and affects, aside from
banks, enterprises, socio-political organizations, communities
of common interest, agricultural cooperatives, etc.
II. ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
3.        The accounting systems in Yugoslavia are substantially different
from the systems of western countries. In preparing periodic balance sheets,
statements of income and expenditures, and other financial reports, the two
banks do not adhere strictly to generally accepted accounting principles.
The major differences in the system and the difficulties in reconciling these
differences are summarized below:
(a) The branches of the banks being autonomous units in themselves,
prepare their own balance sheets and income statements. In
consolidating statements for a bank as a whole, the individual
balance sheet items of its branches are often added up without
eliminating inter-branch entries.
(b) The banks' accounts of resources and operations include funds
managed by them on behalf of local authorities (socio-political
organizations) at no risk to the banks. Such operations on
commission basis have to be eliminated from the main body of
the banks' balance sheets.
(c) Short-term loans have maturities of up to two years and data
on loans with less than one year maturity (current assets) is
not kept separately. It is therefore not possible to separate
current and long-term positions strictly according to normal
accounting definitions.
(d) Accounts are maintained for each loan made by a bank differ-
entiated by purpose and/or source of funds (e.g. loan for fixed
assets or for working capital and loan from Federal funds,
Republic funds, etc.). A borrower may have as many as 100 such
loans outstanding, maintained in the branches or the head office
of the bank. No routine record is presently kept of total ex-
posure to any one bororwer and, because of the large number of
accounts involved, compilation of such information is a
formidable job.
(e) The banks, operating as commercial and investment banks to their
clients, observe strict confidentiality as regards financial
information received from their clients. They cannot disclose
the annual income and balance sheets of the clients to any
outsider (including the IBRD) without the consent of the
clients themselves.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
(f) The banks do not attempt generally to make a periodic assessment
of potential losses within their loan portfolios. Annual appro-
priations to the Reserve Fund can be considered as provisions
against losses but are not the result of a case-by-case review
of their loans outstanding (para 1 (g)).
(g) The appropriation for reserves is not treated as an expense
item in determining a bank's net income. The banks, however,
are required by law to write-off, against income, 25% (current
rate) of their total uncollected interest overdue by 45 days
or more at the end of a year.
III. AUDITS
4.        The Social Accounting Service (SDK) is responsible for the audit of
all enterprises, including the Banks, in terms of Yugoslav law. The audit
is mostly in the form of a certification that the banks' and enterprises'
operations are within the various legal requirements, that the statements are
in agreement with the records kept by the banks and correct charges of in-
terest, allocation of net income, etc. have been made. There is no verifica-
tion of the existence of the various assets and liabilities to the banks and
no opinion on whether they are fairly treated. In addition to the SDK, the
banks are subject to inspections by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, which
ensures, from time to time, that the banks comply with the regulations on
foreign-exchange transactions and special deposit requirements.
5.        Normal audit by the SDK does not meet the standards usually re-
quired by the Bank, but arrangements have been made for proper audits of
the Bank Group projects in Yugoslavia, including audits of the proposed
borrowing banks under the Project. SDK has implemented a training program
for its staff, with the Bank's support, to undertake such audits. As per
the audit program envisaged under the First and Second Industrial line of
credit full audit of the SBS and IBT was done by SDK for the year 1974.
Interim audits of the 1975 accounts of SBS and IBT are being done. These
audit arrangements are considered satisfactory.

B. The Banks 1/
I. GENERAL
6.        The Bank loan is proposed to be made to the Investiciona Banka
Titograd (IBT) in Montenegro and Stopanska Banka Skopje (SBS) in Macedonia.
Both banks are the leading bank in their respective republics and have been
associated with the Bank financed First Agricultural Credit Project, and
First and Second Industrial Credit Projects. SBS was the borrower under the
Macedonia Agroindustries Project. IBT was founded in 1964 and SBS was formed
in 1973 by merging three banks: Stopanska Banka, Commercial and Investment
Bank, Skopje, and Commercial and Investment Bank, Bitola. The ownership,
organization and operations of each bank, as well as the functions and powers
of its main management organs and branches are governed by its statutes and
the self-management agreements.
II. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Ownership
7.        Both banks are owned and controlled by the large enrerprises
(founders) of their respective Republics. The founders are akin to share-
holders and the founders fund is the equivalent of share-capital. As of
December 31, 1975 the number of founders was 131 in IBT and 342 in SBS.
The founders fund was 362 and 1,822 million Dinars for IBT and SBS respec-
tively.
Organization Structure
8.        The organization charts of both banks are placed at Appendices 1
(WB 15722 R) and 2 (WB 15721 R). The Banks are organized as follows:
(a) Founders Assembly is the highest governing body of a bank,
in which every founder has the right to one vote. The Assembly
approves the bank's policies, appoints the chief executive and
elects the members of the Executive Board and Credit Board.
It also decides on the distribution of the bank's income to
employees and founders as well as appropriations to the
bank's reserves.
1/   Both the SBS and IBT, as borrowers under the Second Industrial Credit
Project (Loan No. 1277-YU) are described in more detail in the Report,
Appraisal of Second Industrial Credit Project, No. 1058-YU.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
(b) Executive Board is the chief management body of the banks re-
sponsible for executing their policies approved by the Founders'
Assembly and other statutory functions, including approval of
loans exceeding authority of credit boards (above 5 million Din
in case of IBT and 30 million Din in case of SBS). Members of
the executive board (19 for IBT and 35 in SBS) are elected
from among the founders.
(c) Credit Board consists of members elected from among the
founders. Its function is loan approval.
(d) Internal Control Committee is elected by the Founders' Assembly
from among the founders. It ensures that the provisions of the
law and of the statutes of the bank are correctly enforced, that
funds are not misused and that the functions are adequately
performed.
(e) Workers' Council consists of members elected from and by em-
ployees and represents the employees in the administration and
operations of the bank. In consultation with bank's management
it decides on individual salaries and fringe benefits for
workers within the aggregate amounts approved by the founders.
(f) Head Office of each bank is organized along functional activi-
ties (sectors), such as Domestic Resources Sector, Sector for
Investment, Foreign Business Sector and Legal and Administration
Sector. Accounting activity is attached to the sector for Domestic
Resources in case of IBT and to the Legal and Administrative
Sector in the case of SBS. The Investment Sector is subdivided
into departments for Agriculture, Basic Industries, Processing
and other sectors, and Disbursement and Collection in the case
of SBS. In IBT the Investment sector comprises Basic Industries,
Processing Industries, other sectors, short-term loans and
Engineering and Technical Departments. The Engineering group
provides common services to other departments. The organization
structure of the head office is satisfactory.
(g)  Branches, SBS has 22 branches and IBT has 8 branches.  Each
branch has its own Founders Assembly, Credit Board and
Executive Board. They have substantial autonomy in allocat-
ing funds mobilized by them and in day to day operations.
However, the statutes of the banks limit the maximum amount
of loan which the branch may approve.
Management and Staff
9.        The General Manager of the bank is the Chief Executive.  He is
appointed for a four-year term by the bank's Assembly on the basis of recom-
mendations of a selection committee. The General Manager is assisted by
Assistant General Managers who in turn supervise two or three Department
Directors. Junior Managers are typically university graduates with many



ANNEX 3
Page 7
years of experience. Changes in top managers are infrequent, and profes-
sional competence is the main criterion for selection and appointment at all
levels. The total staff of the banks is 477 in IBT and 1,565 in SBS. About
35% of the staff in IBT and 22% in SBS are in the head office. The propor-
tion of professional staff in IBT is about 25% and 26% in SBS. The pro-
fessional staff consists mostly of economists, accountants, engineers and
lawyers.
Agricultural Staff in IBT
10.       Agricultural staff in IBT forms part of the Engineering and Technical
Group. IBT has one Agroindustries Engineer and an expert in Agronomy/Forestry.
IBT also has several economists experienced in economic analysis and appraisal
of agricultural projects. IBT has no separate agricultural department, as its
loans to the agricultural sector form only a small portion of the total loan
portfolio. At present there is an IBRD operations unit, consisting of 5
experienced economists as staff members, which is handling all work relating
to lending and IBRD financed projects. For the Agricultural Credit project,
the Unit is assisted in its work by the two agricultural experts, mentioned
above, and hires consultants if needed. In view of the Unit's involvement
in agricultural lending and the additional work load expected under this
Project, it will be necessary to expand the Unit.
Agricultural Staff in SBS
11.       Agricultural staff in SBS is part of the Agricultural Operations
Department. The Department has a total of 29 staff members, encompassing
expertise in agriculture, livestock, agro-processing, marketing, irrigations
and economic and financial analysis areas. Experience with the Department's
work under the Macedonia Agroindustries Project indicates two areas of weak-
ness, (a) agroindustries expertise, and (b) marketing analysis. Structurally,
there is a weakness in coordination of the work done in different departments
of SBS and IBRD financed projects.
III. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE
12.       The analysis of financial statements of the banks has been res-
tricted to 1974 and 1975 as these have been reclassified by SDK from the
Yugoslav system to a format generally acceptable to the Bank (paras 3 to 5).
Certain adjustments in the accounts have been made to remove inter-branch
accounts and separate the commission business (managed funds) from other
businesses of the banks. The reclassified and adjusted statements are
not strictly comparable to financial statements of the banks prior to 1974.
Resource Position
13.       Most short-term resources consist of deposits and borrowings from
the National Bank through rediscount facilities. As a general policy the



ANNEX 3
Page 8
short-term resources are used almost exclusively for short-term investments
and long-term resources for long-term investments. National bank may allow
prudent usage of short-term resources for long-term resources. The long-term
commitments of both SBS and IBT exceed the long-term resources. This situa-
tion is customary for these banks as they plan their operations on a disburse-
ment basis rather than on a commitment basis. Each bank limits its over-com-
mitments to the amount of resources it is fairly certain to receive from the
Federal Fund during the period in which it has to meet these commitments.
The resources position is therefore satisfactory.
Financial Performance (Table 2)
14.       It is the stated policy of each bank that its income should cover
all expenses with an adequate amount of transfer to: (a) the Reserve Fund
(substitute for provision against losses), and (b) the "funds of the bank
as a working community", which are used to acquire and maintain working
facilities and to provide some fringe benefits to the workers. Profitability
is not considered an essential measure of the bank's efficiency and financial
performance. Income surpluses, if any, are returned to the enterprises as
dividends or transferred to the founders' fund of the bank. Income state-
ments of the SBS and IBT reflect the break-even nature of operations: gross
income, less direct financial expenses in 1975, was 1.6% and 2.0% of average
total assets for IBT and SBS respectively. These are low and reflect both
the mixed nature and the non-profit orientation of the banks. The Adminis-
trative expenses in 1975 were also on the low side, about 0.5% of the average
total assets for both IBT and SBS, showing strict control over the adminis-
trative budget.
Financial Position (Table 1)
15.       The total assets of IB, and SBS, as of December 31, 1975, were 10.4
and 34.5 billion Dinars respectively, representing a growth of 21.5% and 22.4%
over the previous year. The long-term loan portfolio accounted for 63.3%
(IBT) and 55.8% (SBS) of the total assets. Each bank also manages, at no risk
to itself, substantial funds on behalf of Federal and Republic Governments
and socio-political organizations. The current ratios of the banks are near
1.1:1 and are satisfactory. The long term debt/equity ratios are high; 13.7:1
and 6.7:1 respectively for IBT ard SBS. The high debt/equity ratios do not
pose a danger to the banks' solvency as most of the long-term debts are loans
from federal or republic authorities, repayments of which are more or less
tied to the corresponding repayments by the enterprises to the bank.
Lending Operations (Table 3)
16.       The short-term loan commitments amounted to Din 3.2 billion in
IBT and Din 18.4 billion in SBS in 1975, representing an increase of 9.1%
and 14.3% respectively over the previous years. Short-term loan disburse-
ments are substantially the same as commitments. The percentage of short-
term loans to agriculture was 7.1% in IBT and 12.4% in SBS (Table 3).



ANNEX 3
Page 9
17.       The long-term loans commitments by both banks in 1975 increased
significantly by 128% and 46% over 1974. Sector-wise the increase was
mainly in Industry and Agriculture sectors in IBT and in Industry sector
in SBS (Table 4). Increase in Industrial Sector was due in part to a few
large energy projects as well as to a significant rise in project costs due
to international and domestic inflation.
Lending to Agricultural Sector
18.       The percentage of short-term loans to agriculture was 7.1% in
IBT and 12.4% in SBS. The corresponding percentages for the long-term
loans to agriculture were 3% and 8.5% for IBT and SBS respectively. The
lending to agriculture sector by IBT doubled in 1975 compared to 1974,
reflecting an increased emphasis on agriculture in the republic's plan
and expansion of IBT's lending to financing of the private sector agricul-
ture. Nearly 30% of the IBT long-term loans for agriculture went to the
private sector, benefitting 700 private sector farm families, and helped
finance 221 tractors, 7,000 m2 of plastic houses, 23 ha vineyards, 1 ha
citrus plantation, 40 pumpsets, 80 animal feed mills, 180 ha olive planta-
tions, 100 cows and 30 sheep.
19.      Agricultural lending has been relatively more prominent in SBS loan
portfolio (14.6%) compared to IBT (3%). The average size of agricultural
loans in both banks is small compared to the other two important sectors in
lending, i.e. industry and transport, and public utilities.
Quality of the Loan Portfolio
20.       Analysis of loan arrears in IBT as of December 31, 1975 and in SBS
as of June 30, 1975, given in Tables 5 and 6, shows that the loans affected
by arrears related to the total amounts outstanding were 6.5% in IBT and 6.1%
in SBS. Most of the arrears was aged less than six months. The most frequent
causes for arrears were the depressed markets at home and abroad and, in new
projects, delays in project implementation, often resulting from difficulties
in securing resources to finance cost over-runs. The arrears position both
in amount and age deteriorated in the SBS in 1975 compared to 1974 and will
need to be watched carefully. However, the overall situation is manageable
considering (a) the actual arrears of principal and interest as percentages
of the banks' portfolios are small, 1% and 1.9% for IBT and SBS respectively;
(b) each bank's provisions (Reserve Fund) against bad debts exceeded arrears
of over 3 months; (c) loans of the banks are adequately secured by acceptance
orders from borrowers. These acceptance orders can be exercised through
intervention of SDK, which handles all receipts and payments of enterprises.
Through this legal instrument a bank can halt an enterprise's flow of payments
until its obligations towards the bank have been met. Such a drastic step
is taken only as a last resort and with due consideration for the implications
of such action.
21.       The number of loans granted is fairly evenly distributed in enter-
prises in all sectors of the economy indicative of a reasonably diversified
loan portfolio (Table 4). However, the wide disparity of loan amounts per



ANNEX 3
Page 10
borrower in different sectors resulted in an uneven distribution of loan
amounts between sectors. However, an assessment of the extent of the bank's
records do not show aggregate loans to an enterprise. This is not a problem
for SBS and IBT since they have access to the borrower's financial statement
and the list of its debt everytime a request for granting or renewing a loan
is made. However, this information is required by the Bank to evaluate the
SBS and IBT's loan portfolio. Until the full audit reports including an
analysis of the banks' portfolios are available, the assessment of quality
of the loan portfolio is incomplete.
Creditworthiness
22.       In the Yugoslav banking system and financial environment the banks
are in a unique position, which makes it possible to consider both IBT and
SBS creditworthy even though neither the full audit of the banks is available
nor detailed records are kept of banks' exposure to a single borrower. This
assessment of creditworthiness is based on the same arguments that were
accepted for Industrial Credits I and II and Agricultural Credit I, which
are the following:
(a)  The Founders have unlimited liability towards the bank's
obligations. Creditors of the bank thus have legal recourse
to all assets of founders, many of which are large industrial
enterprises with substantial assets.
(b)  The Banks are closely integrated with the economy of the
Republics and their liquidation in case of financial crisis
is inconceivable.
(c)  The banks have qualified and experienced management and staff.
Experience shows that both SBS and IBT's financial management
has been adequate with no significant losses, arrears have
been manageable, ancl obligations have been met satisfactorily.
Forecasts
23.       At present investment planning in SBS and IBT is limited to one
year within the framework of their annual business policy. Both banks pre-
pared five-year projections of their operations and resources based pri-
marily on the Plan (1976-80) for their regions. These projections are given
in Tables 8 and 9 and are tentative with high margins of error. Medium-term
planning is being attempted by both banks under the Second Industrial Credit
Project and the quality of forecasts will improve as the banks acquire more
experience. For the plan period of 1976-80, resource gaps projected for each
bank, pertaining to domestic and foreign borrowings are high, in absolute
terms (Din 5.0 billion for IBT and Din 14.8 billion for SBS) and as a portion
of each bank's total long-term resource requirements (30X for IBT and 35% for
SBS). The gaps are expected to be filled largely with foreign borrowings by
own efforts or through the National Bank. The proposed loan is small in rela-
tion to the bank's total resource needs. No difficulty is anticipated in



ANNEX 3
Page 11
both banks being able to discharge their financial obligations under the
Project, as the amounts of funds needed will come mainly from Federal funds
and are assured, as also the amounts involved are small relative to overall
operations of the bank.
24.       The projected income statements and balance sheets of the banks for
1976-80 are given in Tables 10 through 13. The break-even orientation of the
banks is expected to continue; satisfactory debt service coverage through
1980 is indicated and the current ratios are projected to remain at a little
above 1:1. The financial strength of the banks will depend not on the extent
of equity but on the financial strength of its founders and the continuation
of the past practice of transferring resources from time to time from the
bank's accounts of federal and republic funds to managed funds or to enter-
prises which would have the effect of keeping debt/equity ratio low.   Under
these premises both banks are expected to remain creditworthy in future years.
IV. LENDING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Business and Financial Policy
25.       Both SBS and IBT have a Business Policy which specifies the bank's
main objectives, magnitude of operations and interest rate policies for cus-
tomer deposits and lending operations for a year. The IBT has a policy of
limiting its financial exposure in a single enterprise to a maximum of 10%
of its portfolio (exceptions can be approved by its Assembly). SBS is
limited by the Banking Law in its lending to a single client to 30% of its
total investment portfolio. Both banks generally match the maturities of
their loans and their resources. A wide distribution of loans amongst the
founders ensured by the large number of founders (each with one vote in the
Assembly) thus almost eliminating the risk of excessive lending. (This in-
formal financial policy arrangement has worked satisfactorily in the past).
Project Appraisals
26.       In both banks the projects financed entirely out of the resources
of the branch are appraised and approved at the branch. However, since most
of the bank's resources, incuding federal and republic funds and foreign ex-
change funds, are channelled through the head office, most projects are ap-
praised and approved at the Head Office. The credit application consists of
an investment program supported by technical, marketing and financial data.
Appraisal reports are prepared by the appropriate department with the help of
advisors/consultants in the case of complex projects. Under IBRD financed
projects both banks have considerably improved their appraisal methods; how-
ever, the following weaknesses still exist:
(a) insufficient critical technical appraisal of the technical data
and specifications provided by the borrower;



ANNEX 3
Page 12
(b) no comparative evaluation of labor versus capital intensive
alternatives;
(c) inadequate marketing analysis of future sales;
(d) the evidence supporting availability of raw materials is
neither questioned ncr verified;
(e) inadequate financial and economic analysis; and
(f) scanty attention to contingency allowances.
Strengthening of the technical appraisal capability of both banks for agro-
industrial lending would be an important institution building objective under
the Project. Further strengthening and application of financial and eco-
nomic analysis in the project appraisals will continue to be one of the
institution building objectives of the IBRD loan.
Supervision of Projects
27.       Systematic supervision is directed by both banks only to projects
under construction or to problem projects. Although the banks maintain
close contact with their clients' operations and financial position in con-
nection with short-term lending yet the operating projects of borrowers who
repay their loans on schedules are not normally supervised. The supervision
responsibility is mostly delegated to the branches of the banks. Both banks
used to supervise projects more regularly during construction and after they
become operations, to monitor and analyze the actual results against ap-
praisal estimates and to take appropriate action where needed. The super-
vision work needs to be centrally coordinated at the head office to cover
various facets of the borrower's dealings with the bank, and for effective
feedback to investment and other operational departments. Supervision sys-
tems for projects will need to De streamlined and strengthened.
Procurement and Disbursement
28.       The banks ensure that their clients observe the laws and regula-
tions on procurement (advertising, bid opening, awards, etc.). When the total
value of equipment for an investment is over Din 500,000 (about US$28,000),
the selection of supplier has to be based on a minimum of three bids obtained
through public tender published in the official Gazette of Yugoslavia. Ex-
ceptions are allowed for specific cases where this procedure would not be
suitable. Disbursements are made on contractor notes, bills and other satis-
factory evidence of serivces rendered or goods supplied. Overall disburse-
ment methods appear to be sound,



ANNEX 3
Page 13
V. INTEREST RATES AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION
29.       Interest rates on loans and deposits are fixed each year by the
Founders Assembly. The present interest rate structure in the two republic
is as follows:
IBT           SBS
Deposits (depending on maturity)            3   - 10%       4 - 10%
Short-term Loans                           10.5 - 11%       8 - 11.5%
Long-term Loans
from own resources                      up to 11%        up to 11.5%
from Federal Funds                          5%             5.5%
30.       The banking structure, where the borrowers are at the same time
the bank's major founders (shareholders), has led to relatively low interest
rates, Furthermore, Federal, Republic and communal funds are provided to
the banks at low cost with predescribed margins for on-lending or are used
to subsidize interest rates. While the Yugoslavs consider low interest rates
on in.restment credits important for encouraging investments and use subsi-
dized rates to channel resources into priority areas, low interest rates,
inter alia, may have contributed to excess demand for investments with in the
past inflationary effects, to the choice of highly capital-intensive produc-
tion techniques, and to overdesign of investment projects. They may have also
negatively influenced resource mobilization. These issues are addressed in an
Interest Rate Study recently completed by Vojvodjanska Banka under the First
Agricultural Credit Project (1129-YU). The Study will be the basis for a dis-
cussion with the Yugoslav Authorities on the impact of the existing interest
rate regime on resource allocation and mobilization in the agricultural sector
and oa, appropriate measures to improve resource allocation and mobilization of
the sector.
31.       Interest rates for long-term loans to agriculture in the two
Republics vary from 5%-5.5% on loans made out of Federal funds up to 11.5% on
loans from the banks' own resources, with most of the lending done at 7%-8%.
Interest rates for investments in priority subsectors may be subsidized to
even lower levels such as 3% for irrigation in Macedonia. These interest
rates are received and could be revised every year. The present interest
rates imply negative real rates given the high rate of inflation (25% in
1974, 18% in 1975 and 11%-12% estimated for 1976).

B. "13 July" Agrokombinat
General
32.       The "13 July" Agrokombinat (AK) was created in 1963 by amalgamation
of small agricultural and processing units, for development of general agri-
cultural production in Montenegro. It is governed under the self-management
system. Like all kombinats it is an autonomous body with the status of a
legal person and freedom to contract for capital, raw materials and workers.
Its assets are social property, but it has mortgage and sale rights.
Organization and Management
33.       The organization and structure of the AK in presented in WB Chart
No. 16334. The Workers' Council is the apex body which decides the basic pol-
icy for AK. The members of the Workers' Council are elected for a two-year
term from amongst the employees, who are also the collective owners of the AK.
Half the Council members are replaced each year. The Workers' Council elects
three executive boards to deal with different aspects of policy making. The
General Manager is the chief executive of AK and is assisted by a Deputy
General Manager and an Assistant General Manager. All the senior management
is appointed by the Workers' Council. The General Manager is responsible for
day-to-day operations and implements the policies laid down by the Workers'
Council and executive boards. The General Manager is assisted in his work by
a Committee of Managers, composed of Managers of each basic unit of AK. The
General Manager is elected for four years with the possibility of reelection.
34.       The operations of the AK are carried out by 26 economic units called
"Basic Units of Associated Labor" (BOAL). Each BOAL is responsible for a spe-
cific activity, such as plantations, processing, etc. Each BOAL elects repre-
sentatives to the Workers' Council and appoints the Manager for the BOAL. In
addition to the 26 BOALS (see WB Chart 16334), there are three common services
groups serving all the BOALS and the General Manager: Personnel Services,
Administrative Services and Financial Services.
35.       The total number of employees of the AK was 2,792 as at the end of
January, 1976. In terms of qualifications, the distribution was as follows:
Qualification                        Number            % of total
University graduates                    180                 6
Technicians and secondary school        578                 21
Skilled workers                      1,232                 44
Semi-skilled workers                   421                 15
Non-skilled workers                     381                 14
Total                           2,792                100
The number of employees has increased 60% in 1975 as a result of the mills
and bakeries economic units moving into the AK during the year. The AK also
employs seasonal workers for the picking of grapes and fruits.

Operations
36.       The AK is engaged in a broad spectrum of activities covering primary
agricultural production (crop production, milk and livestock production, and
plantations), agro-processing industries (slaughterhouses, bakeries, fisheries,
flour mills, winery and animal feed unit), and marketing services (coopera-
tive marketing, supermarkets, retail and wholesale sales centers). AK also
has an Agro-Economic Institute which is planning the new developments of the
AK. Besides the Cemovsko Polje sub-project, the AK also plans the following
investments: expansion of existing dairy farm by 400 cows; ham production
factory (1,500 tons per year); carp ponds (140 ha); grapes and fruit nursery
(40 ha); poultry farm (80,000 chickens), and apple orchards (60 ha).
Financial Structure and Performance
37.       The aggregate balance sheet (Table 14) of AK amounted to Din 892.5
million in 1975 up from Din 461.9 million in 1973. The near double increase
was mainly due to new investments and to amalgamation of wheat and corn pro-
cessing units, and flour mills and bakeries, into the AK. Total equity funds
of the AK amounted to Din 329.6 million in 1975 as against Din 110.5 million
in 1972. The fixed assets existing, as well as in progress, increased from
Din 261.47 million in 1973 to Din 490.2 million in 1975. The increase in
fixed assets was financed mainly from long-term loans from banks and the
increase in business funds for the working capital needs depended heavily on
suppliers' credit, and supplemented them with short-term loans from banks.
However, the current assets of the AK exceeded its current liabilities. The
current ratio was 1.1:1.0 in 1975. The equity funds of AK exceed the long-
term borrowings. The long-term debt/equity ratio was 0.7:1.0 in 1975. Both
ratios were satisfactory. AK's financial position although small is sound and
no difficulty is anticipated in meeting its share of 5.4% in project costs.
38.       The financial performance of the AK should be viewed in the context
of the self management system prevailing in Yugoslavia in which the financial
objective of the investor is to maximize the average surplus per worker.
The Net Surplus is arrived at after subtracting from gross earnings: the
operating expenses (minus the salaries), depreciation, legal and contractual
obligations. This Net Surplus is then allocated to pay salaries and to busi-
ness, reserve and housing funds. The Net Surplus of AK increased from Din 45
million in 1973 to Din 119 million in 1975 (Table 15). The average surplus
per worker was Din 39,291 in 1974 and increased to Din 42,651 in 1975. 1975
was an exceptional year since the bakery and flour mill, economic units, were
merged into the AK affecting the financial results of the year. The net
surplus as a percentage of equity was 41% in 1973, rose to 58% in 1974 but
declined to 36% in 1975. The financial performance of AK has been satisfactory.

/1  These balance sheets have been prepared by SDK following, to the extent possible,
accounting practices of Western countries which differ from the normal accounting
practices in Yugoslavia. Short-term loans refer to laons with a maturity of up
to two years and the items 'other assests' and 'other liabilities' shown together
with accruals, include some short-term assets and liabilities, respectively.
Separation of these items into current and long-term assets/liabilities was not
possible for this exercise but would be attempted by SDK in future. It should
also be noted that the 'Reserve fund', shown in conformity with Yugoslav
practice under equity, has the character of provisions against bad loans.

APPRAISAL OF
AGRICULTURE AND AGRO-INDUSTRIES II PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
MONTENEGRO-CEMOVSKO POLJE PROJECT
Project Description
A. THE PROJECT AREA
General Features
1.        Cemovsko Polje is the largest flat area (19,000 ha approx.) within
the Republic of Montenegro (Map No. IBRD 12346). The plain, bordered by hilly
and mountainous limestone formations slopes gently from Titograd toward Lake
Skadar in north-south direction. The Moraca river flows southward along the
western boundaries of the area and its tributary, the Cijevna river traverses
the upper part of the plain. The main railway from Titograd to Bar runs
along the western edge of the area and Titograd airport is located in the
plain.
2.        The Cemovsko Polje is divided into three zones:
(a) Zone A (10,000 ha), the lower part of the plain, extends
over the area periodically flooded by Lake Skadar. At
present Zone A is mainly used for seasonal grazing;
(b) Zone B (4,500 ha) covers the middle part of the plain.
This zone is owned by small holders practising mixed
agriculture on fragmented plots.
(c) Zone C (4,200 ha) lies on the upper part of the plain and is
at present not farmed; recently land rights over about 3,000
ha were transferred from the Titograd municipality to the 13
July Agrokombinat. The proposed project area falls into this
zone.
TOPOGRAPHY, SOILS AND DRAINAGE
3.        Zone C is a flat area with little micro relief and only small
undulations, degrading from the eastern foothills of Cemovsko Polje toward
the central part of the plain with an average slope of about 0.7%. The River
Cijevna crosses Zone C in the direction of maximum slope and cuts the area
into two unequal parts. The area is covered by a gravelly fluvio-glacial
layer. Gravels, which consist of dolomite and limestone, are assorted in
size up to a maximum of 12-15 cm in general.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        Two types of soils are mostly represented in the project area:
(i) The higher Cijevna terrace soils, covering about 72% of
the area, are gravelly brown loams. At about 20 cm, the
gravel content rises to 50-80%. Drainage is good to
excessive.
(ii)  Lower Cijevna soils, covering about 28% of the area, are
similar to the higher terrace soils but their gravel con-
tent is more variable lecreasing with distance from the
river.
5.        The carbon percentages of the top soil vary from 1-2%.  The organic
matter content is not given, but on the basis of the carbon content it appears
to range between 2-3%. The phosphoric acid content has a range from 130 to
460 parts per million and suggests that the level of available phosphorus is
reasonable. Exchangeable potassium in the top soil varies generally from 80
to 160 p.p.m. The total potassiim content is also low and does not exceed
0.240%, indicating that potassiun rich minerals, which may act as a reserve
for replenishing available potas3ium, are absent. The salt content is neg-
ligible.
6.        Based on a soil survey the land has been classified as follows:
Class      Soil description                                           Area in %
I      Limitations seriously -:estricting choice of crops
and requiring measures for improvement                        34.0
II      Very serious limitatioAis severely restricting
choice of crops and reqluiring special cultural
practices                                                     12.0
III      Similar to II but more extreme                                54.0
Total                                            100.0
7.        There are several adverse factors and limitations which make the
project area soils unsuitable for- diversified cropping.  However, based on
the following considerations it :,s concluded that the proposed fruit orchards
and vineyards can be successfull- planted:
(i) Drainage is satisfactory and therefore no problems are
likely to arise in estciblishing deciduous orchards,
vineyards, and peach trees.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(ii) The areas with cemented subsoil, developed directly on
fluvio-glacial deposits, could be substantially improved
by deep ploughing in order to loosen the cemented layer.
(iii) High gravel content, which severely interfers with annual
crop growing, is not a limiting factor for fruit trees and
vines which have a deep root system.
(iv) The reduced water holding capacity, due to the high skeletal
percentage in the soil, could be overcome by more frequent
irrigation water applications.
(v) The good drainage conditions favor the establishment of
vines and peach trees.
(vi) The low level of available phosphorus and probably avail-
able potassium could be corrected by means of fertilizers
which also contain nitrogen.
(vii) Possible deficiencies of micro-elements such as zinc and
manganese could be easily amended by foliar applications.
8.        Suitability of Zone C for the proposed plantations is amply sub-
stantiated by the results obtained by the Agrokombinat over the last 5 to 6
years in its trial plot (30 ha) representing the average conditions within
the project area.
CLIMATE
9.        The climate in general may be described as Mediterranean with a
strong continental influence as shown by the marked variation between summer
and winter temperatures. The records of Titograd meteorological station,
which cover a period of 35 years, indicate the following (for details see
Annex 4, Tables 3, 4, and 5):
(i: The combined influence of high temperatures, strong
winds and low relative humidity results in high evapo-
transpiration in summer making irrigation essential.
(ii) In order to protect the crop, especially the fruit trees,
from the strong dry winds during summer and to reduce
evapotranspiration and ensure efficient sprinkler opera-
tion, adequate protection should be provided by wind-
breaks.
(iii) Winter frosts present no risk to the deciduous fruit
trees and vines since they flower and come into leaf
well after the middle of March when the frost hazard
is negligible.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
(iv) Hail, causing heavy damage to the production, is frequent.
Therefore crops should be insured against this.
WATER RESOURCES
10.       Surface Water is available from three sources.  First, river Cijevna
which does not ensure enough water for the whole project area. Second, the
river Moraca which has more than adequate discharge for total project purposes.
Third, Lake Skadar has nearly limitless water; its nearest point to the proj-
ect area is about 4 km. The water of both river Moraca and Lake Skadar is
equally suitable for irrigation. The use of either source of water for irri-
gation presents no salinity or alkali hazards. The use of lake water rather
than river water in early summer may prove more beneficial to crops because of
its higher temperature.
11.       Groundwater.  The hydrogeological studies carried out in the past 1/
identified in the Cemovsko Polje two aquifers: (i) an upper aquifer corres-
ponding to the alluvial quaternary fan of the River Cijevna and flowing toward
Lake Skadar with a gradient of I m - 2 m per km; (ii) a lower aquifer in the
underlying bedrock which consists of mesozoic limestone and dolomites highly
karstified and fractured.  This aquifer also flows toward Lake Skadar.  The
aquifer in the quaternary alluvium is recharged mostly by the flow of River
Cijevna, while the water circulating in the mesozoic formation originates
mainly in the mountain area bordering the Cemovsko plain. However, water
interchanges between the two aquifers seem very probable.
12.       The watertable is widespread under the whole plain at a depth
ranging from 40 m to 20 m below the ground level in the upper parts of Zone C,
and from 2 m to 3 m in the lower areas of Zone B where water is drawn by farm-
ers from shallow open wells. The level variation from winter to summer is
about 3 m. Several tube-wells have been drilled into the aquifer, both for
water supply (Titograd and minor towns) and irrigation (Agrokombinat trial
plot and new vineyard plantations): the well discharge varies from 80 to
166 1/sec for drawdown less than 1.50 m.
13.       The available results of laboratory analyses confirm the good water
quality for all uses. The referred hydrogeological studies assessed the safe
yield from the upper aquifer nearly 80 million m3 per year. These figures
are probably on the low side, but the only way to ascertain the actual
potential would be to carry out test and observation for several years.

tion a partir des eaux souterraines - Tome II. Les Resources Naturelles,

ANNEX 4
Page 5
14.       Should the whole 2,000 ha project area be irrigated by groundwater,
a peak flow of 1.460 m3/sec would have to be abstracted, i.e. about 90% of the
overall groundwater potential assessed so far. This could imply a substantial
lowering of the watertable in Zone B and raise problems with the present water
users, making difficult the further irrigation development by small land
holders in the area. Therefore the proposed limit the use of groundwater
for irrigation in the project area at about 0.600 m3/sec, in order to leave a
sufficient safety margin against possible conflicts with the existing water
uses.
15.       Water requirements.  The water requirements have been calculated by
means of the Blaney-Criddle methods as modified in the FAO Irrigation and
Drainage Paper No. 24 "Crop Water Requirements," and are shown in Table 1.
Based on the analysis of crop water requirements, irrigation would be
necessary in general from June to August. However, it must be expected that
in particularly dry years water applications would start in May. The peak
requirement occurs in July with a demand of 0.61 1/sec x ha. However, since
the system would operate 20 hours per day, it should be sized for a capacity
of 0.73 1/sec x ha.
16.       Total Water Demand and Supply.  According to the gross crop water
requirements shown in Table 1 at full development the average annual water
demand in a year of average distribution of precipitations would be 4230
m3/ha. The overall supply of water from the project works at full develop-
ment would be 2.961 million m3 per year from wells and 5.499 million m3 per
year from Lake Skader.
B. CEMOVSKO POLJE PROJECT - DETAILED FEATURES
17.       The project would provide for:
(i) Irrigation System
A fixed irrigation system (buried asbestos-cement pipes)
would provide water down to 6 ha plots, which would be
served by movable equipment. Ilater for 1,300 ha at an
elevation of 87 m and less would be pumped from the Lake
Skadar into an adjacent reservoir basin of 110 m elevation
from where it would serve the irrigation system by gravity.
The remaining 700 ha of higher than 87 m altitude would be
served by groundwater. Portable equipment would consist of
aluminum pipes,and sprinklers.
(ii) Pumping Equipment and Power Supply
The pumping station at the Lake Skadar would consist of 5
units with a total installed capacity of 950 1/sec. Six wells



ANNEX 4
Page 6
with average discharge of 85 I/sec each would serve an
average area of 116 ha each. Power would be supplied by
installing a 110/10 kv substation and 16.5 km of 10 kv
pnm,cr 1 ines.
(iii) Vineyards and Fruit Trees Establishment
The project would include agricultural equipment for deep
ploughing to a depth of 80 cm and for land preparation and
plantation establishment. The typical layout of the planta-
tions would be a series of rectangular blocks of 200 m x 300 m
(6 ha). Vines would be planted in rows, spaced 2.60 m, with
individual plants 80 cm apart; they would be trained in cordons.
Vines would be of the Richter 99 variety (for wine grapes) and
Cardinal (for table grapes), both grafted on American rootstocks.
Peach trees would be spaced 5 m x 5 m; early varieties that are
currently grown in the Cemovsko Polje plain would be planted.
Fertilizer and manure applications would be adopted to the soil
conditions, requiring high dressings of phosphoric acid and potash
during the establishment period. About eight sprayings against
insect pests and diseases would be necessary. The plantation
establishment would be coordinated with the construction of the
irrigation facilities and would require five years. The annual
schedule is given in Annex 5, Table 14. Windbreaks would be neces-
sary to protect the plantations and to ensure uniformity of water
distribution.
(iv) Infrastructure and Research
Three farm centers for storing equipment and inputs and pro-
viding facilities for field staff would be constructed. About
14 km unpaved service roads alongside the plantation blocks and
a bridge across the Cijevna river would secure easy transportation
and communication. A program of experiments on new fruit tree
varieties as well as on fertilizer application, water require-
ments and pest protection would be implemented.
(v)  Winery
A new winery would be built in Titograd for an annual crushing
capacity of about 15,000 tons of wine grapes and a wine holding
capacity of about 10 million liters. All fermentation, ripening,
blending and storage vats would be of stainless steel. The winery
would include the thermo vinification process and a complete
stabilization plant and bottling facilities for 60% of the produc-
tion. A distillation unit would also be included for producing
brandy from "second press" wine.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
(vi) Fruit and Vegetable Cold Store and Packing Line
A new cold store of a capacity of 3,000 tons would be
built near Titograd. It would be designed to hold chilled
produce such as peaches and table grapes and frozen products,
mostly sour cherries, paprika and carrots. The facility would
include a complete washing, grading and packing line in an ad-
jacent building as well as a blast freezer. The facility would
be built to a modular design for ready expansion. All refri-
gerated storage chambers would be at yard level to facilitate
operating lift-trucks, included in the project.
(vii) Collecting Center
The Agrokombinat, under ooperation arrangements with private
farmers, would collect and pack fresh vegetables from farmers in
Zone B for direct marketing in urban centers through the Agrokom-
binat's existing facilities and for processing. Prices for fresh
vegetables paid to farmers are determined on the basis of the
achieved retail prices; prices for vegetables to be processed
are guaranteed. The collecting center would also store and sup-
ply farm inputs to private farmers, such as fertilizers, pesti-
cides, seeds and animal feed.
The following paragraphs describe the different components of the project.
The detailed investment costs, operation and maintenance costs and financial
projections are presented in Annex 5.
PLANTATION ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION
18.       General.  Zone C is divided as follows:
(a) 215 ha on which in the recent years a 30 ha trial plot
has been set up and 150 ha of vineyards established.
(b) 3,117 ha initially intended for plantation development
over 3,000 ha net; this area consists of 7 blocks of
uncultivated land.
The project would establish 2,000 ha net (2,220 ha gross) of vineyards, and
peach and cherry orchards covering the whole blocks named A, B, C and D, and
part of the block named E.
19.       Features of plantations are as follows:
(i) Vineyards
Wine grapes varieties both for "high quality wine" (mostly
Varnac) and for blending wine would cover 1,300 ha altogether.



ANNEX 4
Page 8
The table variety Cardinal would be planted on further 200 ha.
This is an early variety for which there is good demand.
The varieties would be grafted on American rootstocks as a
protection against phylloxera. The vines would be trained
in cordons, with trellises at 15 m intervals to be installed
in the second year of plantation.
(ii)  Peaches.  Early and very early varieties which are currently
grown in the Cemovsko Polje would be planted on 200 ha.
(iii)  Sour cherries covering 300 ha for processing.
(iv)  Windbreaks are advisable to increase the uniformity of
distribution in sprinkler irrigation, reduce evapotranspi-
ration and protect against winds. In addition they would
ensure some protection against frost due to cold northerly
winds. Windbreaks would consist of a double row of cypress
trees. Since the windbreaks are expected to moderate the wind
influence on an area up to a width 10 times the height of the
trees, this protection would be consistent with the typical
layout of plantations.
20.       Plantation materials.  Rooted and grafted vine cuttings, peach and
cherry seedlings as well as young cypress plants would be supplied by local
nurseries out of the project area.
21.       Animal manure.  Provision is made for the application of 20-25 tons
of animal manure per hectare, to be mixed with the soil in the planting holes.
In addition to the organic matter, animal manure would provide 100-125 kg of
nitrogen per hectare, thus reducing the dressing of nitrogen fertilizers
during the initial period.
22.       Green manure and intercropping.  Controlled trials would be carried
out in order to establish the benefit, if any, derived from green manuring.
The cost of green manure would not exceed Din 1,200 per annum. This item has
been included in the estimates of operational costs. The soils in the project
area are not suitable for intercropping and the plantations will be clean
cultivated.
23.       Fertilizers.  The initial and annual dressings of fertilizers for
the various plantations is shown in Table 2. The high dressings of phosphoric
acid and potash during the first two years are necessary. The nitrogen dres-
sings for grape production, although slightly on the low side, are reasonable
in view of the adverse effegct of very high dressings of this nutrient on the
quality of wine. It is probable that the proposed dressings will have to be
further reduced for vineyards intended for the production of "high quality"
wine. There is no evidence of minor amount deficiencies. Fertilizer expe-
riments would be conducted with a view to determining the optimum fertilizer
dressings.



ANNEX 4
Page 9
24.       Deep ploughing and levelling.  Before planting, deep ploughing or
subsoiling to a depth of 70-80 cm is necessary for most of the area in order
to loosen the soft, cemented horizon occurring at various depths in the profile.
Levelling is not needed for sprinkler irrigation but some smoothing may be
necessary to facilitate the use of machinery and farm operations in general
and for the establishment of unpaved service roads.
25.       The vineyards would receive regular treatments against mites and
fungus diseases (mildew, oidium). Pesticides would be applied mechanically.
Picking of grapes would be done by hand. Intensive treatment (up to 8 spray-
ings) would be carried out against fungus diseases and insect pests for fruit
orchards also. Fruit would be picked by hand.
26.       Plantation schedule.  The project plantations would be implemented
in 4 years, according to the following time schedule:
Project year                 1      2      3       4      Total
ha
Wine grapes                200    300    400    400        1,300

Windbreaks (3%)               6     15      21     18         60
27.       Yields.  The average yields at full production would be:
Wine grapes         14 m ton/ha (in the 7th year)
Table grapes        16 m ton/ha (in the 6th year)
Peaches             16 m ton/ha (in the 6th year)
Sour cherries       13 m ton/ha (in the 7th year)
IRRIGATION FACILITIES
28.       Design Background.  To date several preliminary designs have been
outlined for the irrigation of the Zone C 1/. These studies examined alter-
native irrigation schemes supplied either from the River Moraca or from Lake
Skadar, and also combined solutions with the area partially served by ground-
water. The main conclusions may be summarized as follows:
1/   Namely:
- Avant-projet d'irrigation de la Plaine de Cemovsko,
March 1971, by SATEC-AGRAR & HYDROTECHNIK (OECD Project)
- Investment and Technical Documentation for the Construction
of the Irrigation System "Cemovsko Polje", January 1975, by
Hidrozavod Novi Sad, Volumes I, II and III
- Revised solution of the above, January 1976, Volume IV



ANNEX 4
Page 10
(a) Sprinkler irrigation is the only method suitable for
the local soil conditions.
(b) Irrigation systems using groundwater are considerably
cheaper than those served by surface waters; nevertheless,
the present incertitudes on the actual potential of the
aquifer prevent the whole reclamation area of Zone C from
being served by this source, as the water table in Zone B
could drop, thus creating problems with the present users
and making further irrigation development in the zone dif-
ficult.
(c) Schemes using water diverted from the River Moraca are some-
what more economical than those taking water from Lake Skadar;
preference, however, should be given to the latter source be-
cause of the higher temperature of the water and the risk that
the River Moraca might be polluted in the future.
29.       The proposed general layout of the irrigation scheme over 2,000 ha
net would consist of two separate systems taking water from wells and from
Lake Skadar. The proposed irrigation system, would be comprised of:
(i) The Groundwater Sub-System for 700 ha (i.e. the area to be
planted in the first two years) in the upper parts of the
project area on both banks of the River Cijevna since this
zone is the most prom:ising one for aquifer exploitation.
Water would be drawn from 6 wells.
(ii) The Lake Skadar Sub-System for 1,300 ha net (corresponding
to the area to be planted in years 3 and 4) on the lower
parts of the project area, mostly south of the River Cijevna.
Water would be pumped and lifted from Lake Skadar by means
of a 750 m steel pipe up to a basin located on a saddle of the
eastern hill range which separates the Cemovsko plain from the
lake shore.
(iii) A main pressure line to convey the water from the basin by
gravity flow to the command area and then deliver it to the
distribution networks. The distribution networks layout would
basically remain the same as in the HIDROZAVOD design. The
movable irrigation equipment would consist of conventional
aluminum pipes and sprinklers.



ANNEX 4
Page 11
DESCRIPTION OF THE IRRIGATION WORKS
30.       The irrigation system is designed to supply the average water
requirement of 4,230 m3 per net hectare 1/, including a peak demand of 0.73
1/sec x ha for a daily operation of 20 hrs (para 16). The system flexibility,
however, would allow for a water delivery 20% higher, by operating the irriga-
tion system 24 hours a day.
31.       Wells and pumping equipment.  The groundwater system would supply
511 1/sec of water per 20 hours per day by 6 wells, each supplying an average
discharge of about 85 1/sec 2/. The wells would be 600 mm in diameter and
drilled to an average depth of 60 m below the ground level. The casing
diameter would be 450 mm and screens would be protected by a gravel-packed
filter. A submersible multistage electric pump with automatic control would
be installed in each well and a small pumphouse would be constructed to
accommodate the electrical and hydraulic auxiliary equpment, including air
tanks.
32.       By assuming the dynamic water level 35 m below the groundlevel, 12 m
of head friction losses in the irrigation network, and 40 m of residual pres-
sure at the hydrants, the total head of the pumps would be an average of 87 m,
thus requiring about 100 kW of power which would be supplied by an outdoor
10,000/380 V transformer situated near the pumphouse.
33.       Each well would serve a 116 ha independent block, by means of two
main lines branched off from the pumphouse. These main lines would consist
of Class C asbestos-cement buried pipes, 200-250 mm in diameter. Their total
length would be about 5.025 m or 7.2 m per net hectare served. At the final
design stage, possible interconnections between the networks of contiguous
irrigation sectors should be studied to give the systems more flexibility and
a balanced supply of water under unexpected circumstances.
34.       Lake Skadar Pumping Station.  The intake works would be located at
the bottom of an indentation of the lake, a few hundred meters away from the
Titograd to Albania road. The total capacity of the pumps would be 950 I/sec,
with a total head of 111 m. The pumping station would have the following main
features:
(i) Five multistage electrically driven pump units would be
installed, each having a capacity of 190 1/sec. As the
compensating tank would store the flow during the 4 hours
break of daily irrigation, only 4 pump units out of five
would operate 24 hrs a day in the period of peak water
demand, so that normally there would be one stand-by unit.
1/ For 75% overall efficiency.
2/ Experience of the wells operating in the area shows that, in general, one
well could safely supply 100 1/sec with 0.50 m drawdown.



ANNEX 4
Page 12
(ii) Provision would be made for the auxiliary hydro-mechanical
equipment (grills, suction end pressure pipes, gate valves,
non-return valves, air tanks, etc.), transformers, electric
control devices, etc. The required power would be about
1,550 kW.
(iii) A steel lifting pipe, 900 mm diameter and 750 m long, would
connect the pumping station with the compensation tank. The
pipe would be laid over the ground on concrete saddles at
regular intervals. Civil works would also include the align-
ment levelling and concrete anchorage blocks.
(iv) Compensation tank would consist of a geometrically shaped pool,
formed by an earthfill or rockfill embankment with 3 m crest
width. The internal slopes and bottom of the tank would be
concrete lined. The. net capacity would be about 13,700 m3.
Appurtenance structures would include intake works and bottom
outlet with gates, spillway, fencing, electrical lighting and
access road from the pumping station.
35.       Main pressure line by gravity flow would convey an initial discharge
of 950 1/sec from the compensation tank to the irrigation area and then con-
tinue across the area to the farthest sector on the northern bank of River
Cijevna, by progressively feeding all the distribution networks of the system.
The main line would consist of several stretches formed by Class C asbestos-
cement buried pipes, decreasing in diameter from 900 mm to 200 mm. The total
length would be 15,300 m including two secondary branches, i.e. about 11.8 m
per served hectare. The pipeline design capacity would be sized for each
stretch at the rate of 0.73 1/sec per served hectare, but secondary branches
and terminal sections would convey a multiple of the discharge of the typical
sprinkler fly-line (15 1/sec approx.). Besides the construction of the
pipeline, civil works would include chambers, anchorage blocks and crossing
structures. The River Cijevna would be overpassed with a steel pipe sur-
ported by the planned new road bridge. Hydraulic equipment would include
gate valves, air valves and outlets.
36.       Distribution networks.  The layout of distribution networks would
be the same for both the groundwater and Lake Skadar system. They would con-
sist of parallel pipelines branching off at right angles from the mains. Dis-
tribution lines would run straight alongside alternate north-south service
roads, i.e. at 416 m intervals, each line thus serving two rows of plantation
units. The distribution networks would be formed by Class C asbestos-cement
buried pipes ranging from 250 mm to 150 mm diameter. The design capacity of
the various stretches would be about 15 1/sec every 21 ha net, according to
the typical layout of the sprinkler irrigation equipment.
I/    9501,000   x 4 hrs x 3,600 = 13,680 m3



ANNEX 4
Page 13
37.       There would be about 7,200 m of lines in the 2,000 ha irrigation
area, corresponding to an average of 36 m per net hectare. The hydraulic
equipment would include gate valves, air valves, outlets and 100 mm diameter
hydrants at 100 m intervals. There would be about 525 hydrants, each serving
an average of 3.80 ha net area.
38.       Movable equipment and manpower requirements.  Included in the
project would be conventional sprinkler irrigation equipment which might
gradually be replaced in the future with more advanced and labor saving
devices once experience has been gained to make a decision.
39.       The typical set for vineyards consists of 228 m of 100 mm diameter
aluminum pipes (in lengths of 6 m), including the connection line to the
hy drant, No. 11 double nozzle sprinklers with risers 1.50 m high, hydrant
el bow with handle and manometer, fittings, etc. One length of pipe out
of three would be equipped with stabilizing shoe and quick coupling for
the sprinkler riser. Sprinklers would be spaced 18 m along the line, which
would be placed parallel to the cordons. The interval between two adjacent
settings would be 9 row interspacings, i.e. 25 m approximately.
40.       The following operation features would apply:
-    discharge of one double nozzle sprinkler
5 mm + 7 mm at the working pressure of
3.5 kg/cm2                                         1.41 1/sec
-    total discharge of 11 sprinklers                  15.50 1/sec
-    volume delivered in 1 hour                        55.75 m3/hr
-    area covered by one setting                       5,000 m2
-    precipitation rate                                11.15 mm/hr
-    setting time for an application of 53 mm           4.75 hrs
-    No. of settings in 10 days with 20 hours
operation per day                                    42
-    area covered by one set in the 19 day rotation    24 ha
The same typical set would be adopted in the peach and cherry orchards, where
the diversity of layouts and crops might require some adjustment (height of
risers, spacing and interval of sprinklers, diameter of nozzles, etc.).
41.       For the whole 2,000 ha irrigation area 95 typical sets would be
necessary. Taking into account the time required for displacing the equip-
ment to the next sitting and a reasonable operation flexibility, 2 stand-by
sets for every 5 would be provided. The total number of sets would therefore
be 133.



ANNEX 4
Page 14
42.       At full water development there would be up to 8 water applications
per year for the average of crops. Each shift of the typical set requiring
6 men/hr, the manpower requirement would be:
6 men/hr x 2 settings/ha x 8 water applications = 96 men/hr
The labor need could be somewhat reduced by using pipe trailers towed by
small tractors.
43.       Power lines and annual electricity consumption.  A 10 kV overhead
network 3 x 50 mm2 would be erected to supply electric power to the 6 well
pumping stations. The network length would be about 5.5 km. Another 10 kV
overhead power line 3 x 95 mm2 and 11.0 km long would supply the Lake Skadar
pumping station.  Both power lines would be derived from the existing 100
kV line bordering the northeastern edge of the project area, through a
100/10 kV substation to be erected by the Titograd Electricity Board near
the road bridge on the River Cijevna.
44.       The energy consumption for pressure water delivered by the distri-
bution networks would be as follows:
Groundwater system (700 ha)                            0.35 kWh/m3
Lake Skadar system (1,300 ha)                           0.44 kWh/m3
Weighted average (2,000 ha)                            0.41 kWh/m3
Based on the expected water development schedule the annual energy consump-
tion at full development would be 3,468,600 kWh.
INFRASTRUCTURE
45.       Farm Centers.  Three farm centers would be constructed in the
plantation area for storing equipment and inputs and providing facilities
for the field staff and workers. The four centers would consist of:
Area m2
-    Garages and workshop                                 600
-    Stores for spare parts and offices                   300
-    Canteen, first aid, lavatories, etc.                 300
-    Fences, yards, water and electricity supply
-    3 sheds (galvanized steel structure)              3,000
46.       Roads.  In addition to the unpaved service roads alongside the
plantation units, 1/ a main road network would be constructed to provide
1/   The establishment of these tracks would be carried out in connection
with the land levelling.



ANNEX 4
Page 15
access to the farm centers and make possible easy communications and trans-
ports within the plantation area. The communication system would consist of
14 kms of macadam roads and a bridge on the River Cijevna (400 m2).
47.       Infrastructure implementation would be sub-contracted in the same
context as the construction works of the irrigation scheme. A first set of
buildings and access roads would have to be ready for operation in the 3rd
year, in connection with the first wine grape harvest. The remaining works
would be completed within the 4th year.
AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT
48.       The establishment and exploitation of the plantations would be
mechanized except the fruit picking which would be done by hand. The
machinery to be provided under the project would include heavy, medium and
small tractors, trailers and a wide range of implements and minor equipment
and spare parts as well. A part of the small tractors and trailers would
be used to displace the sprinkler irrigation equipment. Medium and small
tractors also would be used for road maintenance. The proposed equipment
would not include standby tractors and implements needed in case of break-
down. These would have to be supplied from the pool already possessed by
the Agrokombinat. The 2 heavy tractors are needed for the heavy initial
operations of land preparation (deep ploughing and levelling of 2,000 ha,
plus 60 ha of windbreaks). The heavy wear on equipment in deep ploughing
and subsoiling has been taken into account in the estimated operating,
maintenance and replacement costs.
49.       The project would also need plastic boxes for transport of table
grapes and fruits to the packing or processing facilities. The number of
boxes needed is 60 per hectare; 24,000 boxes would be required, therefore,
for the 700 ha of table grapes, peaches and cherries under harvest at the
same time.
C. AGRO-INDUSTRIAL SUB-PROJECTS
Titograd-Winery
50.       To process the wine grape production from the 1,300 ha planted
under the project in the Zone C of the Cemovsko Polje plain, the project,
would finance a new winery of a total capacity of about 10 million liters.
The new facility would be located near Titograd and would be owned and
operated by the 13 July Agroindustrial Kombinat. This Kombinat already owns
a small winery (Vinarski Podrum) of 2.6 million liters for processing the
Kombinat's production of grapes from about 400 ha of its presently owned
vineyards.
51.       The 1,300 ha of Zone C will only come into full production of wine-
grapes in year 10, however, to avoid the expense of idle capacity for several
years, the new winery financed under the project, would be designed to absorb



ANNEX 4
Page 16
the winegrape production corresponding to year 7 or about 80% of the total at
full development. By year 9 the winery would have to be expanded or alterna-
tively, the surplus winegrape production would have to be sold fresh. The new
plant would include thermo-vinification to obtain an optimum color of the wine
with a minimum of tanning residues, a biological stabilizing plant and bottling
facilities for about 60% of the production, and a distillery for producing
brandy from the wine obtained after second pressing. Production of other by-
products would not be economically justified for a winery of this capacity.
All tanks would be made of stainless steel.
52.       About 10% of the wine would be sold for export in 0.7 lt bottles
under the category "Appelation Controllee", 50%, also in bottles, would be
sold locally and the remaining 40% of the volume would be sold in bulk to
other wineries, mostly located in the Republic of Serbia, for blending. See
Annex 2 for further details on the marketing of the wine to be produced under
the project. After integrating all investments and income and operating costs
from all the three components involved in this sub-project, namely: (a) the
irrigation and infrastructure corresponding to the 1,300 ha; (b) the planting
and development of the 1,300 ha of vineyards; (c) the winery the overall
combined financial rate of return of winegrape growing and processing is
estimated to be 13%. The winery would offer employment on a permanent basis
to 71 persons and on a seasonal basis to 100 persons.
Titograd - Cold Store and Packing Plant
53.       The Project would finance the construction of a new cold store of
3,000 tons capacity. It would include fruit and vegetable washing, grading
and packing facilities placed in a separate building. The cold store would
include a blast freezer. The plant would be owned and operated by the 13
July Agro-Industrial Kombinat and would be located near the city of Titograd,
adjacent to an existing cold-store, of 2,000 tons capacity, also owned by
the Kombinat, but used mostly for storing meat, butter and fresh fruits. The
new facilities would be provided essentially to serve the incremental pro-
duction of peaches, tablegrapes and sour cherries from the new plantations
in Zone C of the Cemovsko Polje field, financed under the project. However
increased production of vegetables such as paprika and carrots, from the
existing private farms in Zone B of the Cemovsko Polje field, would also be
channelled through the new complex.
54.       Obviously, only part of the incremental production would be kept
in cold store and be graded and packed, as a large share is expected to be
sold fresh directly at the markets. Peaches decay promptly and would only
be kept in storage for a maximum 2 weeks, tablegrapes about 3 to 4 months
and sour cherries, paprika and carrots would be frozen and carried in freezer
store for about 2 to 4 months. The income and operating cost projections
indicate the estimated proportions of produce that would be sold fresh and
that would pass through the cold or freezer store and be sold graded and



ANNEX 4
Page 17
packed. Also in this case the investment projections shown in Annex 5, Table
1 as well as the income and operating cost table, integrate the three compo-
nents involved in this sub-project, namely:
(a) the irrigation and infrastructure corresponding to 200 ha
of peaches, 300 ha of tablegrapes and 200 ha of sour cher-
ries;
(b) the planting and development of these total 700 ha;
(c) the cold store, blast freezer and grading and packing plant.
A collecting center of about 500 m2 for the increase production of vegetables
from Zone B (private sector), has also been included. The resulting combined
financial rate of return for the production and cold storing and packing of
the aforementioned produce would be about 17.65%. The size of the new cold
store has been determined taking into account two factors: (i) lessen the
cost of idle capacity during the development years when production is still
comparatively low, and (ii) the demand in the domestic market for the more
expensive cold stored and packed produce is not very well known and must be
tested cautiously.
55.       Trade in frozen vegetables in Montenegro as well as the rest of
Yugoslavia is limited by inadequate storage and transport facilities. Shop
storage is also lacking. The export market fQr the frozen cherries, however,
would appear to be promising as can be seen in the following table:

Switzerland                        3.4      6.1       6.3      7.0
95% of West Germany's imports are frozen fruits without sugar which includes
frozen sour cherries.  Prospects for Yugoslavian export of frozen vegetables
have been reviewed in Annex 2.  The cold store would be built following a
modular pattern so it could be readily expanded if and when required. The
cost of any such expansion has not been included and would not be financed
under the project. The new facility would give permanent employment to about
68 persons and seasonal employment to an additional 80 persons.

D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
56.       A Project Unit, organized as a Basic Organization of Associated
Labor (BOAL), would be created within the 13 July Kombinat for the imple-
mentation of the project in Montenegro. The Unit would have the following
responsibilities:
(a) Preparation of final designs and tender documents for all
engineering works to be subcontracted (irrigation systems,
infrastructure and processing facilities).
(b) Preparation of list and specifications of all equipment
to be procured through ICB (pumps and electro-mechanical
equipment, movable equipment for sprinkler irrigation,
agricultural equipment, processing plant equipment, etc.)
or through local tenders (seedlings, fertilizers, etc.).
(c) Award of subcontracts and procurement contracts.
(d) Management, supervision and administration of the project
implementation, and operation during the first 6 years.
57.       The Project Unit will have four Division:  Engineering, Plantations,
Processing Plants and General. Under the overall control of the General
Manager of the AK, there will be a Project Director heading the Project Unit
and each of the Divisions will be headed by a Manager who will be responsible
to the Project Director. The Manager (Engineering Division) would be respon-
sible for implementation, operation and maintenance of all irrigation and
infrastructure works. The Manager (Plantations) would be in charge of im-
plementation, operation and maintenance of the vineyard and fruit plantations
and farm machinery and agricultural equipment. The Processing Plants Division
will carry out the erection of winery and cold and packing plant and will
operate these facilities. The General Division will provide the accounting,
administrative, and specialist services for procurement. The staff of the
Unit would include qualified irrigation and agricultural machinery engineers,
agronomists and horticulturists, economists, administrative staff and procure-
ment specialists. Final designs of engineering works would be prepared by
Yugoslav consultants, assisted by outside experts. Also, part-time consul-
tants would assist the permanent technical staff of the operational units for
the supervision of special works and supplies.
58.       The Unit would have an Executive Board consisting of:  General
Manager of the Agrokombinat, who will also be the President of the executive
board; Director and Division Chiefs of the Project Unit; Director of the
Internal Bank of the Agrokombinat; Representative of the Secretary of Agricul-
ture; a representative of IBT; and the Director of the Agro-Economic Institute



ANNEX 4
Page 19
of the Agrokombinat. The executive board would approve the Unit's operating
policies and procedures and supervise the project implementation. It would
also play a coordinating role between the Agrokombinat, the Secretariat of
Agriculture, IBT and IBRD. After the Project's implementation, the facili-
ties would be transferred to the Agrokombinat's respective operating units.
These units are adequately organized and staffed, and follow satisfactory
policies to warrant efficient operation of the Project facilities.

APPRAISAL OF
AN AGRICULTURE AND AGRO-INDUSTRIES II PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
MACEDONIA PROJECT
Project Description
A. Project Components
Social Sector
(i) Dairy Plant
A new milk processing plant of a capacity of 40,000 liters/
day would be built in Prilep in replacement of an existing
obsolete plant of 10,000 liters/day. The facility would
produce cream and butter and pasteurized milk from cows.
The milk would be packed in one liter plastic bags. Equip-
ment would also be provided to produce yoghurt and cheese,
mostly from sheep milk. Milk collection would be organized
and chilling centers and insulated tanker-trucks would be
provided under the project. The lack of organized milk col-
lection is the main disincentive to increased milk production
in the Prilep valley.
(ii) Slaughtering Plant
A new slaughtering plant for an annual capacity of 300,000
lamb and sheep, and 12,000 cattle would be built in Gostivar
in replacement of an existing obsolete abattoir. The new
plant would represent an increase in capacity of about 30%
over the existing facility which cannot provide the required
standard of hygiene for slaughtering and chilling of the ap-
proximately 80,000 lambs exported annually. The new plant
would also include chillrooms and facilities for processing
edible and inedible by-products. It would be designed to
allow slaughtering according to Moslem regulations.
(iii) Potato Cold Store
A new potato cold store of a capacity of 5,000 tons would be
built in Delcevo. The facility would be built above ground,
of the "door-per-bin" design, and would includeltemperature
and humidity controls, and ventilation. An adjacent building
with basic facilities for washing, grading, sizing and bagging
the potatoes would also be provided. Included would be trucks
for harvesting and marketing distribution, pilers for storing
and scoop-trucks for transferring from storage to packing.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(iv) Fruit and Vegetable Processing Plant
The project would finance major improvements and expansion
of the existing fruit and vegetable processing plant in
Gevgelija. Present processing operations would be upgraded
by reconditioning buildings to stricter sanitary standards
and replacing obsolete and insanitary processing equipment.
The present annual capacity of about 12,000 m tons would be
expanded to a total 20,000 m tons. This expansion would
involve the construction of a new building with a new line
for processing tomatoes, and also increasing the capacity of
the existing lines for processing fruits.
(v) Dehydrated Vegetable Plant
The project would finance a new plant for producing tomato
paste and dehydrating such vegetables as onions, peppers,
carrots, leeks and parsley. The capacity of the plant would
be about 50,000 m tons of vegetables annually, of which 30,000 m
tons would be tomatoes. The other vegetables would be processed
on conventional lines; including vegetable preparation, conveyorized
drying tunnels, packing and storage. The tomato processing facili-
ties would allow for the installation at a later date of a tomato
spray drying cone to produce tomato powder.
(vi) Apple Processing Plant
A new processing plant for apples of an annual capacity of
10,000 m tons would be built near Resen. The plant would have
the necessary facilities to process reject grade apples into such
products as apple juice concentrate, pure nectar, concentrated
aroma and distilled alcohol. No cold store facilities are en-
visaged as a new unit of 6,000 m ton capacity would be available
to the plant for storing raw material.
Private Sector
(vii) Fruit Production
Subloans would be provided to about 220 private farmers for
on-farm development of about 1 ha each of orchards and vineyards.
Included would be such fruits for which the domestic or export
demand is strong, e.g. peaches, apples, apricots and sour cherries.
Investments would include land preparation, planting materials,
fertilizer and labor.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
(viii) Vegetable Production
About 20 farmers would receive subloans for the construc-
tion of plastic greenhouses to develop labor intensive,
early vegetable production, mainly tomatoes, peppers and
cucumbers. Investments would include tubing, plastic for
covering and other construction items. Increased production
would predominantly supply the domestic market.
(ix) On-Farm Mechanization
About 120 subloans would be made to private farmers to fi-
nance tractors and implements such as trailors, ploughs,
tillers, rollers and harrows, as illustrated in the
mechanization model, Annex 7, Table 29. Farmers are ex-
pected to cultivate, apart from their own land, neighboring
farms against service charges. Mechanization combined with
increased use of fertilizer and protective agents are one of
the most effective measure to improve productivity in the
private sector.
(x) Livestock Production
The project would provide for the purchase of about 300 in-
calf heifers and dairy cows, primarily Simmenthal, Montafon
and Friesian breeds, and about 20,000 ewes of Zcabatsha,
Pcowidizka and Merino breeds. The private farmer subborrowers
would purchase the animals from social sector enterprises.
Investments would also include construction of winter housing,
feeding facilities and pasture improvement to increase fodder
production.
(xi) Tobacco Drying Facilities
Credit would be provided for the construction of four tobacco
drying sheds of 200 m ton drying capacity each of Virginia to-
bacco. The single story building would be divided into a
receiving area, drying chambers and humidifying room. Hot air
would be forced through sub-floor ducts from the furnaces to the
drying chambers. Investments would be phased over two years.
Market Center Feasibility Study
The marketing study undertaken under the First Agroindustries
Project-Macedonia (894-YU) recommended the establishment of a wholesale
market center for agricultural products. The Government of Macedonia has
accepted the proposal and intends to build a marketing center in or near
Skopje. The center would collect from various parts of Macedonia mostly
fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products, process the produce and market

it in Yugoslavia and abroad. Under the project US$100,000 would be provided
to finance the foreign exchange cost of the feasibility study for the con-
struction and operation of the market center.
B. Detailed Description of Agroindustries Sub-Projects
Prilep - Dairy Plant
1.        With some fluctuations, milk production, in Yugoslavia and Macedonia,
has been increasing gradually as can be seen in the following table:
Milk Production (lts '000)
Yugoslavia        Macedonia
1960                                 2,434                 91
1965                                 2,400                 75
1970                                 2,655                 95
1971                                 2,650                 93
1972                                 2,879                 97
1973                                   -                  105
1974                                                      112
Source: Statistical Yearbooks of Yugoslavia and Macedonia,
1975.
The share of sheep milk has dropped from about 8% in 1960 to 5% in 1972 for
all of Yugoslavia, however for Macedonia it remains high although it has also
dropped from 43% in 1960 to 39% in 1972.
2.        The Macedonian social sector operates dairy farms mostly with ex-
otic breed (Holstein) yielding 2,100/3,900 lts/lactation and therefore ac-
count for over 30% of the production. The private farmers own mostly cows of
indigenous breed (busha) yielding only about 1,000/1,200 Its per lactation.
Yugoslavia is a net importer of fresh milk, which is acquired mostly from
Bulgaria. Macedonia is also a deficit milk producer, situation which has
been aggravated by a growing demand of milk and dairy products. In fact the
demand is projected to increase from 75 lts annually per capita in 1970 to
110 in 1980. Milk prices in Macedonia are comparatively high (Din 3.50/lt
equivalent to US$0.19/lt) by world standards and allow the farmer to buy feed
and concentrate which is available at about Din 2.4/kg. Artificial insemina-
tion is generally available through the extension services of the Ministry of
Agriculture, however the main constraints to increased milk production are the
low yielding cows in the private sector and the lack of organized collection
of the milk from the numerous small producers in this sector.



ANNEX 6

3.        In the valley of the city of Prilep in Macedonia, there are about
12,000 cows and 120,000 ewes. The total average daily milk production can
be estimated at about 35/40,000 lts. At present, the Prilep Agro-Industrial
Kombinat operates only one small dairy plant of a capacity of about 8,000
lts a day. This plant is obsolete and unhygienic and too small to be ex-
panded effectively. In view of the foregoing, the project would finance the
construction of a new dairy plant to be operated and owned by the Prilep
Kombinat. The plant would have a capacity of 40,000 lts a day and facilities
to produce pasteurized milk, butter, cream, yoghurt and cheese. The financial
rate of return would be about 17%. The new plant would give permanent employ-
ment to about 57 persons. The existing plant would be closed down.
Gostivar - Cattle and Sheep Slaughtering Plant
4.        Yugoslavia's and Macedonia's cattle population declined in the late
sixties. However since 1971 there has been a gradual increase in this sector
which is over 90% in private hands.

5.        The offtake is high:  25%, and close to 50% of the stock slaughtered
are males up to six months of age. Nearly 40% of the cattle are of the Sim-
menthal breed, the balance is a mixture of indigenous breeds, with predo-
minance of the Bosnian "Busha" type. Yugoslavia and Macedonia, both show a
trend toward increasing the proportion of dairy cattle (dual purpose) at the
expense of strictly beef cattle. Lack of feed has been the main constraint to
livestock growth in general. However, with funds being channelled into irriga-
tion and to the private sector, more fodder is expected to be made available
for breeding dairy cows and fattening males. The financial incentives for
this are expected to come from increased demand of milk, dairy products, and
meat, mainly in the local market of Macedonia. Consumption of beef and veal,
in Yugoslavia, increased from 6.7 kg/capita in 1960 to 8.5 kg/ capita in 1972.
Macedonia has no surplus cattle for export, either on-the-hoof or as beef, and
does not share in Yugoslavia's beef and veal exports which in 1972 amounted to
90,000 tons or 37% of the total production. Yugoslavia is also an important
exporter of live cattle, however exports, mostly to the EEC countries, have
declined during the recent years.

6.        The sheep population in Yugoslavia has declined slightly, however,
in Macedonia it has remained stationary with some fluctuation over the years
as can be seen from the following statistics:

The main constraint to increased production has been the decreasing areas
available for grazing. With increased areas under irrigation, flocks have
to move further up on the mountain slopes and trek longer distances to graze.
Increased demand with escalating prices have been strong incentives for the
private sector to keep up production. The private farmers account for over
90% of the total flock. Mutton and lamb retail prices increased from Din
15.40/kg in 1970 to Din 30/kg in 1973, and are currently up to Din 45/kg.

7.        Most exports from Macedonia are in the form of frozen spring lambs
slaughtered at the plant owned and operated by the GORNI POLOG Agro-Industrial
Kombinat in the city of Gostivar. The plant at Gostovar is obsolete and un-
hygienic by modern sanitary standards. In fact under the present unhygienic
working conditions it risks loosing its export markets. The main markets for
mutton and lamb in the world are as follows:

From this table it may be concluded that the present markets for the
Macedonian lamb will probably remain open.
8.        In view of the foregoing, the project would finance the construc-
tion of a new cattle and sheep slaughtering plant with a moderate increase
in capacity by means of an extended second shift, to slaughter annually up
to 12,000 head of cattle and 300,000 sheep and lamb. This would allow to
continue yearly exports valued at about US$1.7 million and retain employment
of about 138 persons. The financial rate of return is estimated to be 17%.
Dolcevo - Potato Cold Store and Packing Plant
9.        Dolcevo is in the extreme eastern part of Macedonia near the
Bulgarian border. It is linked with the rest of Macedonia by a paved road,
however, the region has no significant industries and job opportunities
are scarce. Comparatively it is one of the least developed regions in the
Republic. The region has good potential for growing potato, however, lack
of storage and marketing facilities have been a strong disincentive. Most
farmers grow, therefore, wheat as best alternative crop. With a yield of
5 tons/ha and at Din 2,300/ton the gross income from wheat is about Din 1,500/
ha, whereas for potato if would be Din 26,000/ha, on the basis of a yield
of 20 ton/ha at a price of Din 1,300/ton.
10.       The Ovce Pole Kombinat which has a branch in Delcevo has also 300
ha under wheat which would be switched to potato, on a normal 4 year rotation
basis, if the marketing facilities were available. The whole region has
about 14,000 ha of arable land and currently only 250 ha are under potato.
Yugoslavia's production of potatoes has dropped over the last decade: with
Macedonia's share slowly growing to over 3%.

In Yugoslavia, 90% of the potato production is retained by the producers and
used as follows: for the producers own consumption: 50%; for cattle feed:
20%; and to be used as seed: 20%. Only about 10% reaches the market.
Yugoslavia has basically been self sufficient in potato production.  Imports
have been negligible but in 1970 exports reached 70,000 tons and 33,200 tons
in 1972. Exports are expected to reach 50,000 tons in 1980, mostly to
Czechoslovakia, Greece and Italy.
11.       By providing a 6,000 ton potato cold store at Delcevo with a potato
washing, grading and bagging line and trucks to deliver the produce to the
Macedonian markets on a year-round basis, an additional 350/400 ha could be
grown under potato which could benefit about 700/800 farmers. Assuming that
each farmer would grow an average 1/2 ha on a 4 year rotational basis. The
plant itself would employ about 85 persons including seasonal and permanent
staff. The cold store would be of conventional design, so other produce
could also be stored. Movable pilers and scoop trucks, for transferring
potato from storage to packing, would be included. The cold store would be
equipped with temperature and humidity controls and ventilation. As a com-
merical enterprise the cold store would be owned and operated by the Agro-
Industrial Kombinat Ovce Pole. The financial rate of return would be about
13%.
Gevgelija - Expansion of Fruit and Vegetable Processing Plant
12.       With increased areas under irrigation, and other incentives, pro-
duction of vegetables increased considerably during the last years, as has
been indicated in Annex 2. Increased production of vegetables also warrants
increased capacity for processing. There are only eight fruit and vegetable
processing plants in Macedonia and most of them process only fruit. One of
these plants is owned and operated by the Agroindustrial Kombinat Interpirex
Gora and is located in the city oE Gevgelija. Gevgelija is located in the
south eastern part of Macedonia and is a rich fruit and vegetable producing
area, particularly of melons, tomatoes, paprika, onions and carrots. The
total current production is estimated at about 65,000 tons annually. The
plant in Gevgelija has a capacity for processing annually up to 12,000 tons
of fruits and vegetables. Tomato concentrate accounts for more than 50% of
the production and the balance are mostly preserved and frozen vegetables
and processed fruits.



ANNEX 6
Page 9
13.       The plant is 20 years old and shows evident signs of neglected
maintenance. In fact unless some major repairs are carried out to both
buildings and equipment, production would suffer. On the other hand the do-
mestic and export market for processed fruits and vegetables appear promising
for Macedonia. The natural export market for Yugoslavia are the industrial
countries of Western Europe with the German Federal Republic as the foremost
importer of most types of processed and frozen fruits and vegetables. Follow-
ing is a brief analysis of the imports of the Western European nations during
the recent years and the forecast up to 1980.
14.       Processed vegetables:  In spite of strong competition from frozen
and dehydrated products, the consumption of canned and bottled vegetables
has tended to increase and is expected to grow in the forseeable future.

In 1972, processed tomato represented 34% of all imports followed by beans:
15% and peas: 10%, vinegar-pickled vegetables in cans and jars represented
8.5% or a total 91,000 tons.
15.       West European imports of brine-pickled vegetables have also grown
from 15,900 tons in 1960 to 33,000 tons in 1972 and are expected to continue
such a trend. The main importing countries are listed below:

Pickled vegetables are mostly cucumbers and onions but include also other
vegetables.
16.       Frozen vegetables:  trade in frozen vegetables in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia is limited by inadequate storage and transport facilities. Shop
storage in particular is lacking, and retail sales are almost entirely res-
tricted to self-service food stores. Frozen vegetable consumption is there-
fore very low in Yugoslavia, it is estimated at between 1,000 and 2,000 tons/
year.  However by 1980 this could well reach about 5,000 tons/year.  Exports
markets offer great potential however.

The European trade in frozen vegetables has been increasing at a fast rate.
Total annual imports doubled between 1965 to 1970. Most of the industrial
nations in Western Europe are expected to offer market potential for exports

of Macedonian frozen vegetables. The frozen vegetables consumed in Western
Europe are mostly peas, spinach, beans, brussel sprouts, however other types
such as carrots, leeks, paprika, sweetcorn, mushroom and asparagus are becom-
ing increasingly popular, particularly in the German Federal Republic.
17.       In view of the foregoing, the project would finance the expansion
of the fruit and vegetable plant in Gevgelija to an annual capacity of 20,000
tons of raw fruits and vegetable, including major repairs to the buildings
and equipment of the existing plant. The construction of a new plant is not
considered justified. The financial rate of return would be about 17%. The
expansion of the plant would give employment to 65 persons on a permanent
basis and 20 seasonally.
Sveti Nikole - Vegetable Drying Plant
18.       The Agro-Industrial Kombinat Ovce Pole owns 28,000 ha near the city
of Sveti Nikole in Central Macedonia. About 18,000 ha are arable land of
which 10,000 ha are under irrigation mostly for production of such vegetable
as tomato, onion, leek, paprika, carrot, and parseley. Other crops are peas,
late sunflower, barley and corn for silage. The potential for vegetable pro-
duction is considerable. The objective of this sub-project is to process
annually about 40,000 tons of vegetables into tomato paste and produce dehy-
drated onion, leek, paprika, carrot and parsley, all strongly oriented to the
export market.
19.       Although there is strong competition for the market of tomato con-
centrate, the demand by the main importing countries is expected to increase
substantially as shown in the following table, which would assure a market
for Macedconia's production of tomato concentrate:

70*       In the last few years there has been a growing demand for dehydrated
Teq ctables, mainly from the institutional trade and the soup and ready made
meal industries.  As stated the Macedonian production would be oriented mainly
to the export market and here also the industriai--Mountries of Western Europe
would offer the best marketing prospects. Following are the past and pro-
jected demand of dehydrated vegetables of the main importing nations:

In 1972, the main product was dehydrated onion which accounted for 40% of all
imports.
21.       In view of the foregoing, the project would finance the construction
of a new plant for producing tomato concentrate and dehydrated vegetables with
a total annual capacity of 45,000 tons of raw material. The layout would
allow installation of spray drying facilities for production of tomato powder
in the future. The plant would be located near the city of Sveti Nikole and
would be owned and operated by the Agro-Industrial Kombinat Ovce Pole. The
permanent staff would be about 201 persons and the seasonally employed, ap-
proximately 60 persons. The financial rate of return would be about 17%.
Resen - Apple Processing Plant
22.       Production of apples has been increasing in Yugoslavia and also
in Macedonia according to the following statistics:

Total production is predicted to reach 450,000 tons in 1980. Exports of fresh
apples have been insignificant reaching only 9,500 tons in 1972, however the
market for processed apples and apple products is good with the German Federal
Republic appearing as the main potential importer. Relevant statistics are as
follows:
GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC
Total Imports of Unconcentrated Apple and Pear Juice (Tons)
1970                        8,600
1971                       11,300
1972                       14,100

1971                       16,500
1972                       17,600

23.       The south western area of Macedonia is the main apple producing
region of the Republic. There are a total 3,000 ha under apples in the re-
gion including 600 ha of the Prespansko Jabolko Agro-Industrial Kombinat
(social Sector). The yield in the social sector averages 30 tons/ha and in
the private sector 15 tons/ha, the overall annual production can therefore be
estimated around 54,000 tons. The Kombinat owns a 9,000 ton cold store and
has just completed an additional unit of 6,000 tons. There are also four more
refrigerated depots in the nearby cities of Struga, Ohrid, Bitola and Kicev
with a total capacity of 17,000 tons. The region has however no facilities
for processing the industrial grade of apples that come off the packing lines
of the cold stores and constitutes about 20/25% of the volume. These apples
are generally sold in bulk and command a low price due to lack of a market.
In fact the nearest important apple processing plant is located in Serbia
and this plant is well supplied for apples within that Republic and seldom
requires to pay for the extra freight in procuring raw material all the way
from Resen.
24.       In view of the foregoing, the project would finance the construction
of a new apple processing plant to be built near the city of Resen owned and
operated by the Prespansko Jabolko Kombinat and located near their existing
cold stores. The plant would have a capacity to process 12,000 tons annually
into apple sauce, juice and concentrate, obtaining also alcohol and aromatic
concentrate as by products. The production would be predominantly for export
to the German Federal Republic which is a growing market for processed fruits
and vegetables in general. The financial rate of return would be about 14%.
The plant is expected to employ 71 persons permanently and 60 in a seasonal
basis.

Projected Investments, Operating and Financial Results
A. Summary of Financial Results
The projected investment, income and cash-flow statements for six social
sector investment models and seven representative investment models in private
sector areshown in detail in Tables 1 to 43. The financial rates of return
including those from sensitivity tests are summarized in the following Table.
All prices, yields and other technical coefficients used in the models are based
on information received at the time of appraisal (June 1976). A physical contin-
gency of 5% has been included in the investment costs. All rate of return calcu-
lations are based on projections in real terms. Particular assumptions made
for each model are listed in the footnotes of the respective Tables.
All cash-flow projections have-been made on the basis of 11% on IBRD funds
and 7.25% on local funds. Interest during construction is financed under the loan
loans and the loans are amortizied by annuities.

APPRAISAL OF
AGRICULTURE AND AGROINDUSTRIES II PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
Economic Rate of Return of the Project
1.        The economic rates of return for the Macedonian and Montenegrin
projects were calculated on the basis of quantifiable economic costs and bene-
fits generated. Costs and benefits are based on the representative investment
models as described in Annexes 5 and 7, and were evaluated at shadow prices as
discussed below and shown in Table 1 of this Annex. Training and administra-
tive expenses were also included. Results derived from the analysis are con-
sidered conservative since some benefits attributable to the project, such as
improved resource allocation in the agricultural and agroindustries sector and
the health benefits to consumers of hygienically processed food, were deemed
non-quantifiable and, therefore, were excluded from the economic rate of re-
turn determination.
2.        The economic rate of return calculations are based on the follow-
ing assumptions:
(a) Output Prices. For wheat and maize the Bank's commodity
world price projections (in constant 1976 prices) were
used as basic data, thus eliminating the subsidy on wheat
in Yugoslavia. The price of milk was reduced by the sub-
sidy of Din. 0.5 per kg. The remaining products were ad-
justed in accordance with the consumption conversion fac-
tor (see Table I of this Annex).
(b) Input Prices. Investment items were priced at constant
1976 prices. Import duties levied on imported components
were deducted. Other equipment items were adjusted in
accordance with the conversion factor for investments.
The prevailing subsidy for fertilizer was added. Other
input prices were converted at the conversion factor for
intermediates (Table 1 of this Annex).
(c) Labor. Hired labor has been valued at the shadow wage
rate for skilled and unskilled labor respectively (Table I
of this Annex).



ANNEX 11
Page 2
(d) Processing Investments. Benefits were calculated on the
basis of value added through processing, adjusted with the
consumption conversion factor. Benefits due to reduced
losses were added.
(e)  Administrative and Training Costs.  Salaries and other
costs incurred by the borrowing banks and implementing
kombinats were added, valued at shadow wage rates.
3.        Based on the assumptions enumerated above, the economic rates of
return were calculated for the respective components (see Table 2 of this
Annex). The Montenegrin project would generate a 17.3% rate of return; and
the Macedonian project 25.6%. These rates of return do not take account
of the non-quantifiable benefits resulting from the contribution of the
project to improved resource allocation in the agricultural and agroindustries
sectors through training and institution building. Sensitivity tests were
conducted to assess the stability of the respective rates of return to varia-
tion in project cost and benefit streams. The variations are not expected to
exceed 10% of the base estimate. The results are:
Montenegrin Component Macedonian Component
Investment Costs    +10%                  16.0%                     23.2%
Operating  Costs    +10%                  15.9%                     19.8%
Benefits             -10%                 14.4%                     17.0%
Both projects' rates of return are most sensitive to variations of benefits.
However, even under a pessimistic assumption of 10% lower benefits, the rates
of return remain satisfactory.

APPRAISAL OF
AGRICULTURE AND AGRO-INDUSTRIES II PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
Statement of Operations and Policies for the Project
and the Sub-Project Appraisal Criteria
1.        The IBT and the SBS would follow the following policies, procedures,
terms and conditions in appraising and granting the sub-loans.
2         Montenegrin Project.  Before receiving long-term loans the Agro-
kombinat would up-date the appraisal estimates and submit the loan applica-
tion to IBT. IBT would review the loan application to take account of pos-
sible changes in the economic and market environment and to evaluate the
financial viability of the subproject and satisfy itself of the continued
credit-worthiness of the Agrokombinat.
3.        Macedonian Project.  For long-term loans to social sector enter-
prises, SBS would appraise each sub-project to ensure that: (a) sub-projects
provide satisfactory financial and economic rates of return on the basis
of detailed and realistic estimates of costs and benefits, and would generate
sufficient cash flow to cover debt service, legal claims, compulsory alloca-
tions to the enterprise's funds and reinvestment needs. Special justification
will be required if the financial rate of return is below 12%; (b) sub-projects
are technically feasible based on a critical review of technical data and
specifications provided by the sub-borrowers; (c) the market facilities for
the incremental production are available, and the supply of raw materials
is assured; (d) the sub-borrowers are credit-worthy, have the necessary
managerial competence to implement the sub-project and maintain a satisfactory
financial structure. As a guideline, the long-term financial structure, debt/
equity ratio should not exceed 3:1. Exceptions may be allowed (based on the
financial and economic merit of the sub-project) provided that the enterprise
enters into an agreement with a bank to increase its equity over a suitable
period of time to not less than 25% of its total capitalization; (e) adequate
physical and price "contingency" allowances are made. The "contingency"
allowance should take into account, inter alia, escalation clauses which may
be included in contracts. The appraisal report for each sub-project should
indicate the date to which base cost estimates refer and should discuss the
"contingency" allowances made; (f) appropriate consideration is given and
explicitly recorded in the appraisal report to the need for introduction of
capital-intensive automated technology as opposed to more labor-intensive
methods and to the consequences of such a choice on the investment and operat-
ing costs of the sub-projects.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
4.        Sub-projects in the private sector in Macedonia would normally be
submitted to the SBS by social sector enterprises which, having aggregated
investment proposals of several private farmers, would borrow on their behalf.
However, private farmers may also submit directly investment proposals to
SBS. In appraising sub-projects in the private sector, the SBS would satisfy
itself that:
(a) sub-projects are technically feasible, financially viable,
commercially sound and economically justified, and markets
and processing facilities for their incremental production
are available;
(b) sub-projects would generate sufficient cash flow to cover
debt service, legal claims and needs for reinvestment;
(c) adequate and continuing technical asistance, and suitable
market outlets at fair and reasonable prices are available to
the private farmers;
(d) in the case of lending through social sector organizations,
the cooperation agreements are adequate.
Financing Plan for Sub-projects
5.        The sub-borrowers wou:Ld provide a minimum of 20% of investment
costs. The banks would provide loans up to 80% of the sub-projects costs.
The Bank funds would finance 100% of the estimated foreign exchange part of
the project cost. Prior to disbursing the Bank loan the banks would assure
the availability of their own ftnds and sub-borrowers' contribution for each
specific sub-project.
Repayment Period of Sub-loans
6.        The term of sub-loans would be determined in  accordance with the
cash-flow projections of the investments, after careful estimates of the re-
payment capacity of the sub-borrower have been made. However, the grace and
repayment period on IBRD funds will not exceed the following:
Maximum Grace Period   Maximum Total Term
