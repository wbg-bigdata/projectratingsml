INDIA - MAHARASHTRA PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI, the Government) has requested a
Bank loan for the Maharashtra Petrochemical Project (the Project), to be
owned and operated by the Indian Petrochemical Corporation Limited (IPCL),
a well established petrochemicals manufacturing company. The Project will
be India's first petrochemical complex based on natural gas--the most
economical feedstock. The feedstock ethane/propane fraction will be
separated out of the gas from the West Coast offshore oil and gas fields
near Bombay.  The Project will have an initial capacity of 300,000 tons per
year (tpy) of ethylene and 63,000 tpy of propylene. About 50,000 tpy of
ethylene will be sold to private sector petrochemical producers in the
Bombay area.  The remainder will be processed within the Project to produce
80,000 tpy of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), 135,000 tpy of linear low-
density polyethylene (LLDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and
60,000 tpy of polypropylene (PP), as well as 5,000 tpy of ethylene oxide
(EO) and 50,000 tpy of ethylene glycol (EG). These intermediate products
will be sold to the polymer conversion industry, entirely in the private
sector and to the synthetic fiber industry mostly in the private sector.
1.02      The Project is an important part of India's plans to develop and
diversify the use of its gas resources, and is in line with the Govern-
ment's strategy for producing petrochemical products in world economic
sized plants at competitive costs to substitute scarce, costly and often
imported traditional materials, and to support expansion of the labor-
intensive, largely private downstream processing industry. The economic
value of the products from the Project, entirely to be marketed domestical-
ly, is estimated at US$430 million per year at full capacity (in 1984 US
dollar terms). The total Project financing, including contingencies, work-
ing capital and interest during construction, but excluding preproduction
imports of plastics for market development, is estimated at US$1,697
million, with US$651 million in foreign exchange. In addition about US$450
million equivalent of foreign exchange will be required to import plastics
for domestic market development commencing 1985-86 through 1988-89, and
will be recovered in equivalent rupees through sales of such imports. The
proposed Bank loan of US$300 million includes US$210 million to finance
about 32% of the Project foreign exchange requirements, as well as TJS$90
million to finance pre-production polyolefins imports needed for market
development.
1.03      Based on discussions of a Bank Identification/Preparation mission
in September 1980, with the GOI on possible alternative product slates and
technology, the Project was prepared and presented to the Bank in September
1982 (Feasibility Study Project File, Reference A). Additional information
on the Project, provided by the Government, is given in Project File,
Reference B. The Project was appraised in November 1982 by Messrs. J-F.
Rischard, S. K. Agarwal, H. Aomatsu and N.C. Krishnamurthy of the Industry
Department, and Mr. J. Ramesh (consultant). It was post-appraised in
August 1984, by Messrs. H. Aomatsu, S. El Daher and N. C. Krishnamurthy of
the Industry Department, and Mr. K. Phan of the Country Programs
Department.

II. THE PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
A. General Background on Petrochemicals
2.01      Prior to 1945, chemicals production in the world was based
predominantly on coal, calcium carbide, ethyl alcohol and waste streams
from petroleum refinery operations. Since then, availability of low cost
oil and gas and technological developments have triggered a major switch to
petroleum as the main raw material. The term 'petrochemicals' covers a
spectrum of petroleum-based synthetic materials which include polymers,
detergents and synthetic fibers, generally cheaper and often superior
substitutes for traditional materials. In general, the value added to a
barrel of crude, or its equivalent in gas, is several times larger when
used as a petrochemical feedstock than as a fuel product.
2.02      The major petrochemical building blocks consist of three olefins
(ethylene, propylene and butadiene) and three aromatics (benzene, toluene
and xylenes). Ethylene is the most important of them and is now used to
produce about one third of all petrochemicals. Olefins are generally
produced through cracking of naphtha, gas oil or natural gas.   Aromatics
are derived from light liquid petroleum fractions usually as part of
refinery operations. Both are transformed into second generation products
such as polymers, synthetic rubber, intermediates for synthetic fibers, and
other organic chemicals. Polymers are the main ethylene derivatives. The
five major polymers are low-density polyethylene (LDPE)/linear low-density
polyethylene (LLDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). LDPE/LLDPE, HDPE and PP
are classified as polyolefins.
2.03      Polymers, in the form of granules, are transformed by the
plastics conversion industry into end-use products for clothing, shelter,
water supply, transportation, industry, packaging, storage and
conservation. Production up to the second generation products is
vertically integrated and capital-intensive, while the conversion industry
is decentralized and provides opportunities for small-scale operations. In
their range of applications, polymers substitute for traditional materials
including: (i) metals, in home construction, appliances, mass transit
equipment, and components for machinery and furniture; (ii) timber, natural
rubber, cork, paper and other wood derivatives, in home construction,
low-temperature and electrical insulation, packaging of bulk commodities
(fertilizers, cement) and foodstuffs; (iii) glass, in a variety of
packaging and containers applications; and (iv) leather and fabrics, in
upholstery, footwear, furniture and luggage. Polymers have also found new
applications in agriculture (mulching and seedling nursery bags) and water
management (storage ponds, canal lining, and piping and trickle irrigation
systems).
2.04      Plastics substitution has been favored by better performance
characteristics and lower economic costs compared with traditional
materials. In particular, plastic products require significantly less
energy than competing products as shown in Annex 2--l. For example,
when polypropylene substitutes for cellulose, the plastic use results in
energy saving of 29%; polyethylene substitutes for paper with energy saving



-3-
of 33%, and for galvanized steel with energy saving of 76%; and PVC
substitutes for glass with energy saving of 58%, and for cast iron with
energy saving of 82%. In addition, when a significant percentage of used
plastic products are reprocessed and recycled, as in some countries like
India, use of plastics is even more energy efficient and economical.
B. Feedstock Characteristics and Ethylene Production Costs
2.05      The US, with about 36% of world ethylene capacity in 1980, uses
abundantly available low cost refinery gas and natural gas fractions as the
predominant feedstocks. In contrast, Japan and West Europe, which are
deficient in natural gas resources, use almost exclusively more costly
naphtha and gas oil, which results in the production of a wide range of
co-products, frequently in excess of market requirements and requiring
complex and expensive separation and purification facilities. Since the
oil price increases of 1973 and 1979, the use of refinery liquid products
has become even less economical compared to that of natural gas fractions.
While naphtha is currently priced at around US$240/ton or US$5.5/million
BTU, gas prices range from US$5.4/million BTU in West Europe to
US$2.5/million BTU in the US, and US$1-1.5/million BTU in the Middle East.
The combination of higher capital cost and increased feedstock prices has
made naphtha-based ethylene costlier than natural-gas based ethylene by
about 33% in West Europe,- and 50% in Canada and in some low gas price
developing countries. Ethylene capacity by feedstock type in various
regions is shown in table TI-1.

2.06      The industry is characterised by significant economies of scale.
Production cost per unit of ethylene declines by about 15% when capacity
increases by 50%; but beyond 300,000 tpy capacity there is no significant
advantage with larger capacities. In developing countries, higher project
and infrastructure investment costs and possible lower production levels
could raise ethylene production costs by 10-15% relative to developed
country locations.

C.   The World Polyolefins Market
1.  Historical and Projected World Consumption of Polyolefins
2.07      Over the past decade, consumption of petrochemicals in general
enjoyed a reasonable growth in spite of large energy price increases,
highlighting the general health of the demand for the products and
reflecting the benefits compared to traditional materials. World
consumption of polyolefins (LDPE/LLDPE, HDPE and PP) increased at a fast
pace from 8.5 million tons in 1970 to 25.3 million tons in 1983, at an
average rate of 8.8% p.a. The energy price increases of 1973 and 1979,
resulted in a consumption slump during 1974-75 and further stagnation
during 1979-81. Yet, during the relatively normal periods 1970-73, 1976-79
and 1982-83, polyolefins consumption grew at 16.7%, 13.0% and 12.8% p.a.
respectively. LDPE, which has been longer in use, accounted for about 65%
of total polyolefins consumption in 1970. However, consumption of HDPE and
PP has grown faster than LDPE, owing to newer applications in bulk
packaging, industrial components, consumer durables and pipes. As a
result, the shares of LDPE, HDPE/LLDPE and PP in 1983 total polyolefins
consumption were 44%, 31% and 25%, respectively. World polyolefins
consumption and growth rates by resin type from 1970) to 1983 are given in
Annex 2-2. Regional consumptions and shares of world consumption are given
in Annex 2-3. Average consumption growth rates in selected periods for
developing and developed regions are given below.

Over the past 10 years (1974-83), consumption grew aLt a higher rate in
developing (13.9% p.a.) than in developed (4.7% p.a..) regions, because of
the lower initial base in the former. The share of the developed regions
in world consumption has thus declined, but was still about 69% in the 1983
world total, with the US (27.8%), West Europe (28.7%) and Japan (9.9%)
having large shares.
2.08      In order to make realistic projections of future world demand and
supply for individual polyolefins, the Bank commissioned three major
consulting firms, Stanford Research Institute (US), Chem System (UK), and
SEMA (France), to study and assess country-by-country projections of
polyolefins demand/supply situation (Project File, Reference C). These
projections were complemented by private industry studies and by regression
studies carried out by the Bank. The Bank's projections of future world
demand for polyolefins are shown in table II-2.

With the world economic recovery from the recent recession, plastics
consumption is expected to resume growth, although at a lower rate than in
the past. World demand for polyolefins is projected to grow from 25.3
million tons in 1983 to 34.8 million tons in 1990 and 40.2 million tons in
1995, at an expected average growth rate of 4.7% p.a. during 1983-90, and
2.9% p.a. during 1990-95. These are relatively conservative estimates
compared to the 6.8% p.a. rate in world consumption experienced in the last
decade. Growth in developed regions is estimated at 3.4% p.a. up to 1990
and 1.8% p.a. thereafter. For developing countries, consumption growth is
estimated at 7.2% up to 1990 and 4.7% thereafter. Among the developed
regions, the growth rate in the US is expected to be higher than in West
Europe and Japan because of greater development efforts in new areas of
substitution as well as in industrial applications. Demand growth is
expected to be higher than world average in East Europe and developing
regions where present consumption levels are low. Demand for RDPE/LLDPE
and PP will continue to grow faster than for LDPE, increasing their share
from 55.4% in 1983 to 67.3% in 1990 and 71.7% in 1995.

2.   Historical and Projected World Capacity of Polyolefins
(a) Historical World Capacity of Polyolefins
2.09      World nameplate capacity of total polyolefins has grown from 12.4
million tons in 1970 to 31.7 million tons in 1983, at a rate of 7.5% p.a.
on average. Developed regions accounted for 90% and 79% of total world
capacities in 1970 and 1983, respectively. As demand grew, the industry
expanded at an over-optimistic pace, with world capacity more than doubling
between 1970 and 1977. Between 1978 and 1983, net capacity additions were
relatively small as very little additional capacity came on stream and
there were capacity closures as part of industry restructuring programs in
the US, Japan and West Europe. In 1983, of the total world capacity of
31.7 million tons, West Europe accounted for 34%, the US for 30%, Japan for
12%, East Europe for 9%, Latin America for 4%, Canada for 3% and the Middle
East for 1%. Annex 2-4 shows the capacities by region of individual
polyolefins for the period 1970-1983.
2.10      Capacity Utilization.  Available  capacity utilization informa-
tion tends to be unreliable because of lack of consistency, differences
between design grade-mix and actual production grade-mix, number of opera-
tion days per year and the effect of capacity buildup in new facilities.
After correcting for these inconsistencies, the estimated historical
average capacity utilization rates by product and region is shown in Annex
2-5. Capacity additions and market constraints have kept average capacity
utilization at about 74% during 1970-83. In 1983, the last year for which
data is available, capacity utilization reached 83%. The higher capacity
utilization during relatively normal years (1974, 1979 and 1983), indicates
that the facilities can potentially operate at 80-85% of their nameplate
capacities. Since several plants will be closed in the next few years and
existing facilities will be debottlenecked, the industry average capacity
utilization is expected to reach 90% by the late 1980s.
2.11      Restructuring of the World Polyolefins Industry.  Currently, the
extent of overcapacity in the industry is not excessive, as the 1983
polyolefins production of 25.3 million tons represents 83% of nameplate
capacity, compared to the 1970-83 average of 74% and a potential of 90%.
The early 1980s witnessed rationalization and consolidation of plants,
particularly in Japan and West Europe, when large, export-oriented
polyolefins capacities were planned and set up in Canada and Saudi Arabia
based on low-priced natural gas. In addition, the sLowdown of demand in
the developed regions because of market saturation in several application
areas, led many manufacturers to move away from bulk chemicals into more
profitable specialty products. The restructuring of the early 1980s
included closures of older, small, uneconomic plants, and ownership
rearrangements, often promoted by governments. Natural gas price
deregulation in the US may increase feedstock prices and induce additional
plant closures. Given the current market situation, new petrochemicals
production could only be economic in countries with such advantages as
large domestic markets and abundant gas resources.
(b) Projected World Capacity of Polyolefins

The projections, based on data from consulting firms (SRI, SEMA and Chem
Systems), include capacities under implementation and those firmly
announced, and take into account firmly slated capacity closures. Given
the current severe under-utilization of capacity, no significant additions
are expected beyond those firmly announced until the projected 1990
installed capacity is fully utilized. On the above basis, the world
polyolefins nameplate capacity is expected to increase from 31.7 million
tons in 1983 to 37.6 million tons in 1990. Additions to capacities that
will come into operation after 1990, are expected to be more carefully and
selectively planned in the context of the industry's recent experience of
overcapacity and impact on prices. Such additions most likely would take
into account domestic, and internatinal supply/demand situations, and would
be predominantly for production of LLDPE/HDPE, and PP, while LDPE will be
confined to existing capacity. In estimating the evolution of future
demand/supply balances, and prices it is assumed that once the current



-8-
rationalization is completed, future capacity additions would maintain a
reasonable balance between demand and supply with optimum capacity
utilization.
3. Historical and Projected World Supply-Demand Balance
of Polyolefins
2.13      Historical and projected demand and supply for LDPE/LLDPE/HDPE
and PP are given in charts II-A and II-B on the following page. For
purposes of estimating future supply gaps, product availability has been
estimated based on capacity utilization rates higher than the historical
average--85% in 1985, with further increase to 90% for developed regions by
1990. The above scenario indicates that demand for LLDPE/LDPE/HDPE will
outstrip supply by 1990. PP's estimated demand will exceed supply by 1986.
2.14      The demand and supply analysis groups the polyethylene polymers
(LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE) together because of their intersubstitutability in
several applications. LLDPE, which is a newer product, has increasingly
proved to be a versatile polyolefin with application areas many of which
bridge those of conventional LDPE and HDPE. The largest area of
application for LDPE has been in films for packaging followed by injection-
moulding applications, whereas for HDPE it has been iLn blow-moulding
followed by injection moulding applications and piping. Because of better
stretch properties, LLDPE competes with LDPE in the film applications and
has better performance to cost ratios. Similarly, LLDPE competes favorably
with HDPE in sheets, tubulars and injection moulding applications.
Injection moulding and film applications areas also provide considerable
potential for inter-product substitution of LDPE and HDPE. The potential
market for LLDPE, including demand for applications where it can substitute
LDPE and HDPE, is significantly higher than the likely availability of
LLDPE from the 1990 worldwide capacity. It is, therefore, appropriate to
group the three products for purposes of evaluating the supply and demand
balance. With regard to PP, its applications and those of HDPE overlap in
the areas of the blow moulding, consumer durables, engineering parts and
piping. PP is, however, preferred over HDPE in several applications, and
has in addition unique applications in fiber and electroplatable consumer
durables.

2.16      The current surplus of polyolefins in the U.S. is expected to
turn to substantial deficit by 1990 because of only limited further
capacity additions. Japan is expected to become a net importer of
polyolefins in the 1990s. West Europe will continue to have surplus,
meeting the increasing consumption with better util:Lzation of already
available capacity. Canada and the Middle East wil:L emerge as significant
exporters after 1985 owing to new capacity installations. Deficits in
remaining regions of the world, particularly Latin America and other
Asia/Oceania regions are expected to increase substantially since little
additional capacity is foreseen. The surplus capac:Lty in West Europe could
result in further closures of old plants, and the equilibrium year for
LDPE/HDPE/LLDPE could correspondingly occur sooner than is shown in chart
II-A. The large aggregate deficits expected by 1990 will have to be *et
with annual production capacities to be planned in 'Late 1980's and coming
into production by early 1990s, as new facilities w:Lll require 3 to 4 years
in a developed country and 4 to 6 years in a developing country between
investment decisions and production.
D.   Prices of Major Polyolefins
2.17      Polyolefin prices have shown considerable short-term fluctuations
in the past, mainly as a result of market conditions. Reflecting the
stagnation in demand for petrochemicals in 1979-82 following the recent
world economic recession and the substantial capacity additions during the
1970s, prices of polyolefins, especially LDPE, have declined in the last
few years and continue to remain depressed. The 1973 energy price
increases along with short-term speculative demand resulted in unusually

high price increase in 1974, with polyolefin prices reaching near US$1,300
per ton (in 1984 prices). Thereafter, prices declined to about USS600 per
ton in 1975-78 coinciding with large capacity additions and, as a result,
excess supply. Following the energy price increases of 1979, polyolefin
prices rose again in 1979 and 1980, but declined again in 1981-1982, when
large capacities came on stream principally in East Europe, the UJSA and
Latin America, in the midst the economic recession. The US export prices
of LDPE and HDPE resins have recovered by late 1983 - early 1984 to US$892
and US$794 per ton respectively. Prices of LLDPE - a relatively new
product, enjoys a 5-7% premium over LDPE. Historically PP has enjoyed a
10-15% premium over HDPE due to its unique applications as reflected by the
current (first quarter of 1984) US price of US$905 per ton. The historical
evolution of polymer prices is given in Annex 2-6.
2.18       Polvolefin prices are projected to increase gradually as demand
catches up with available capacity. Because of the substantial
inter-product substitutability among the polyethylenes (para 2.14), until
supply and demand reaches equilibrium, the prices of the different
polyethylenes will become interdependent and will be set predominantly by
the aggregate polyethylene supply and demand balance as shown in Chart
II-C. Until demand and supply balance is reached around 1990, some of the
application areas of LLDPE/HDPE will be met by LDPE, given the latter's
continued oversupply. It is anticipated that up to 1990, HDPE prices will
remain closer to the present LDPE prices. By 1990, the product prices are
expected to rise and reach the respective long-term equilibrium levels
discussed in the paragraph below. While the demand and supply balance of
PP is projected to be reached before 1990, PP prices may reach its
equilibrium level only by 1990 as a result of inter-product
substitutability with HDPE.



- 12 -
2.19      Long-term equilibrium prices are forecast on the basis of
long-term marginal cost of efficient suppliers. The basic proposition is
that by 1990, when polyolefins world demand exceeds supply capacity, new
investments will need to be induced into the industry. For these new
investments to come into the market, polyolefin prices will need to reach a
level that will enable the most efficient marginal suppliers to cover their
cost and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. If prices
were not to reach these realization price levels, and efficient suppliers
were not to come into the market, then demand will continue to exceed
supply and polyolefin prices will rise very sharply. Long-term marginal
cost of efficient suppliers (i.e. realization prices), therefore may be
expected to be the floor prices that will exist when the current excess
supply vanishes. Based on consultant studies (SRI and SEMA) and the Bank
estimates on the production economics of new efficient polyolefin plants in
the various regions of the world (Middle East, West Europe, USA and
Canada), the 1990 realization prices of individual p)roducts are estimated
in constant 1984 US dollars at US$1,100/ton for LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE, and
at US$1,250/ton for PP (Annex 2-7). The equilibrium prices for 1990 so
derived, in constant terms, represent annual increases of 4.6% over the
prices of LLDPE/LDPE/ HDPE prevailing in 1984, and 5.5% p.a. increases over
the 1984 price of PP. In view of present depressed prices, these increases
are reasonable and achievable. The sensitivity and economic analysis
carried out in Chapter XI-shows that even if product prices were to remain
at 1984 levels, the proposed Project will still be economically viable with
an ERR of 10%.
III. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY IN -[NDIA
A.   Historical Developments
3.01       India has a diversified industrial structure for consumer and
capital goods manufacturing. The manufacturing sector accounted for 16.3%
of GOP in 1982/83. On the eve of independence (1947), traditional light
industries accounted for about one-half of manufacturing output.   Since
then, however, structural transformation has taken place with production of
basic industrial inputs such as steel, cement, fertilizers and machinery
growing at a significantly higher rate than industry as a whole. Between
1970 and 1982, industrial output of basic and capital goods industries
increased at a real rate of 5.8% p.a., compared with 3.4% p.a. for
intermediate goods industries, and only 3.7% p.a. for non-durable consumer
goods. Within the intermediate goods subsector, the chemical industry has
grown at a much faster rate of 6.7% p.a., increasing its share of
manufacturing output from 13.4% in 1970, to 17.9% in 1982.
3.02      Production of basic petrochemicals began :Ln 1966 with the
establishment of a small 20,000 tpy naphtha-based ethylene cracker,
followed in 1968 by a 60,000 tpy naphtha cracker, both in the Bombay area.
These plants are in the private sector with foreign equity holding. Prior
to 1966, small quantities of LDPE, PVC and organic chemical intermediates
were produced on the basis of fermentation alcohol, coal tar intermediates
and calcium carbide. In the late 1960s, small faci:Lities for production of
synthetic fibers based on imported raw materials were also established.



- 13 -
Recognizing the importance of petrochemicals in national development, the
GOI moved in the late 1960s toward larger scale manufacture. A major
addition to the production of primary petrochemicals was made in 1973 when
an aromatics plant began production in Gujarat State, and which was owned
and operated by the public sector Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd
(IPCL). This was followed in 1978 by an integrated naphtha-based olefins
complex with an ethylene capacity of 130,000 tpy and including a number of
downstream plants, also owned and operated by IPCL. Present petrochemical
production capacity and new capacity under implementation are summarized in
table III-1.

B.   Strategy for the Future Development of the Indian Petrochemical Sector
1.   Subsector Priority
3.03      The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980-85) put increased emphasis on
promotion of the petrochemicals industry. With the availability of
associated and free gas from the Bombay High and South Bassein fields,
India now has a preferred feedstock for the manufacture of ethylene-based
petrochemicals in plants of international size. Utilization of gas for
petrochemicals is among GOI's highest priorities though the major portion
of planned gas production will go for fertilizer production. The GOI is
also planning to establish facilities for recovery of aromatics. The
Government recognizes the merit of promoting plastics in light of: (i)
their lower energy content vis-a-vis competing products; (ii) their role
in providing widespread low-cost shelter, storage, footwear and housewares;
(iii) the relative scarcity and higher economic cost of competing raw
materials like steel, cement, wood and glass, often imported at the margin;
(iv) the potential development of a labor-intensive small-scale downstream
processing industry in the private sector; and (v) the added economic
advantages of reprocessed and recycled plastics usage, which is common in
India.



- 14 -
2.   Private and Public Sector Roles
3.04       Government policy in the sector encourages both private and
public sector ownership in all phases of petrochemicals manufacture. The
proposed Project will be established in the public sector, but will require
substantial private sector investment for the related downstream plants and
for plastic conversion facilities. In addition to the US$1,697 million to
be invested in the Project itself, about US$100 million will be invested by
existing private sector manufacturers for plants expansion to convert
50,000 tpy ethylene supplied from the Project, and about US$300 million in
the private, small and medium scale sector for plastics conversion. The
decision on Project ownership was based both on the need for speedy
establishment to achieve optimum utilization of the country's natural gas
resources, and the restricted availability of private sector resources in
the context of India's capital market. Also relevant was the institutional
capacity of IPCL as efficient petrochemical manufacturing company with
considerable experience in project implementation, operation and
marketing. The above decision thus reflects pragmatic considerations in
the context of developing the subsector in which both the public and
private sectors play complementary roles, and is justified. In planning
for future petrochemical investments, the Government intends to keep in
view enlarged private sector participation both exclusively and in joint
ownership in the core and second generation plants.
IV. THE PETROCHEMICAL MARKET IN INDIA
A.   Historical and Projected Petrochemical Demand in India
1.   Past Consumption
4.01      Imports of polymers in India over the past five years
(1980-1984) have averaged 103,000 tpy, representing about one-third of
domestic consumption, but an insignificant portion of the world trade of
polymers. Consumption of polymers has grown at a quick pace of 14%
annually during 1966-1984, in spite of high domestic prices, limited
domestic production and restrictions in allocation of foreign exchange for
imports. These factors are reflected in an uneven year-to-vear consumption
growth. When product availability was restricted, consumption has
slackened, as between 1974 and 1977. The energy price increases of 1973
and 1979, which led to a sharp rise in international polymer prices, caused
a reduction in consumption in the following years. Conversely, when new
domestic capacity came on stream, as in 1966 and 1978 for LDPE, in 1968 for
HDPE and in 1978 for PP, or when imports were relaxed as in 1977,
consumption recovered considerably. The average annual growth rate for
polymers consumption during 1977-1982 was correspondingly higher, at 17%.
Among the factors that contributed to the increase in demand were
reductions in prices especially for LDPE with large additions in domestic
capacity, increased marketing efforts by producers, and the rationalization
of excise taxes on polymers (now comparable with materials like paper,
steel and glass, which plastics will partly substitute). Per capita
consumption of polymers in India remains nonetheless among the lowest in
the world, although it doubled to about 0.45 kg from 0.22 kg in 1973/74,



- 15 -
(e.g. Brazil 7.7 kg, Korea 19.2 kg, Portugal 17.4 kg all in 1979).  Annex
4-1 provides historical data from 1965 to 1983 on the Indian market for the
five major polymers (LDPE, HDPE, PP, PVC and PS) and EG, as regards
production/consumption.
2.   Future Demand
4.02      The base case demand forecast used in the present analysis has
been prepared following the review of the Government/IPCL estimates.  These
have been prepared based on a product-by-product analysis of the end-use
markets and their growth prospects, economic comparisons between plastics
and traditional materials, and assessment of the reprocessing of used
plastics, as well as field interviews with plastics producers and
convertors (Project File, Reference D). The demand forecast is based on
the present relative prices of polymers and traditional materials and the
choice of polymer primarily based on performance characteristics. Such
relative financial prices are consistent with the economic cost of the
relevant products. The Government subsector development strategy aims at
improving or at least maintaining the competitive position of plastics
through appropriate pricing policies and adjustment of relative fiscal
levies. Any drop in plastics prices in absolute terms or relative to other
materials, will lead to faster demand growth. The base case demand
forecasts are detailed in Annex 4-2, and summarized in table IV-1.

- 16 -
The base case annual demand growth rate for the five major polymers is
estimated at 11% p.a. during 1983/84-1992/93 against 15% as projected by
the Indian authorities and IPCL, and is regarded as conservative.
Moreover, a "worst case" forecast (7% p.a. growth in consumption during
1983/84-1992/93) was developed based on pessimistic assumptions regarding
penetration levels of polymers in end-use markets and availability of
plastics during the intervening period through end-1989. Even under the
"worst case" scenario, the timing of the proposed Project remains
acceptable, as highlighted in the supply/demand balance (para 4.06).
4.03       With regard to individual polymers, PP conSumption is expected to
have the highest growth because of superior performance characteristics,
with 25% p.a. growth, against only 5% p.a. for HDPE. Most increase in HDPE
consumption will be for water pipes, packaging films and household
products. LDPE and LLDPE combined will be the second fastest growing
polymer (11% p.a.) mostly for use in irrigation and agriculture, storage,
packaging and cables. LLDPE, new to the Indian market, will initially be
mostly blended with LDPE (particularly in films) to achieve downgauging
through its superior performance. PVC will grow at 9% p.a. through
1992/93, and will be increasingly used in pipes for rural water
supply/irrigation, construction, containers, cables and footwear.
Consumption of EG has increased in the past years (1973/74-1983/84) at 8%
p.a. in line with the production of synthetic fibers, its main use.
Polyester synthetic fibers production is being encouraged in a limited way
from the early 1970s in view of the declining per capita availability of
cotton. Based on present and projected capacity of synthetic fibers, EG
demand is expected to grow at 19% p.a.
B.   Historical and Projected End-Use Pattern
4.04       Packaging applications (fertilizer, chemicals, food, milk,
textiles and general purpose packaging) accounted for the largest share
(38%) of recent (1981/82) thermoplastics consumption and these applications
are expected to maintain their share in 1988/89. The direct use of virgin
plastics, however, does not fully reflect the growth in packaging
applications, as a unique feature of the Indian marke!t is the reprocessing
or recycling of used plastics. About 30% of the plastics is reprocessed
given the present price levels and availability of virgin plastics, and the
efficiency of collection of plastic scrap material. Actual total
application of plastics in packing, therefore, will be somewhat larger than
the 38% share based on virgin plastics.
4.05       In the future, plastics consumption is expected to develop
rapidly (15% annually) for vital applications in agriculture, irrigation
and water management - increasing the share in total plastics consumption
from 18% in 1981/82 to 23% in 1988/89. Somewhat below average growth is
forecast for applications in wires and cables insulation, industrial parts
(textiles, electrical and automotive uses) and household applications
(housewares, appliances and luggage). The share of PP in total plastics
consumption is forecast to increase from 8% in 1984/82 to 17% in 1988/89,
and that of LDPE from 30% to 33%.  On the otner hand, the shares of other
plastics -- HDPE, PVC and PS--are expected to decline.



- 17 -
C.   Projected Petrochemical Demand and Supply Balance
4.06      The projected demand/supply situation in India for each polymer
and EG takes into account (i) the production of existing facilities
operating at 90% capacity for polyolefins and EG, and at 60% for
PVC; (ii) planned expansions operating at 90% capacity; and (iii) the
production build-up from the proposed Project reaching 95% capacity as of
1992/93. The results are summarized in table IV-2, based on the two
assumption regarding future demand growth indicated in paragraph 4.02,
i.e. (i) base case with demand growth at 11% p.a. and (ii) worst case
scenario with demand growing at 7% p.a. Details are provided in Annex 4-3.

Under the base case forecast, demand exceeds supply for the Project
products (LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE, PP and EG). However, in the "worst case"
scenario, small surpluses of LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE would emerge in the
first four years. This temporary very marginal surplus, which would
disappear after 1992/93, is unlikely to pose difficulties for the Project.
For EG and PP, even under the "worst case" scenario, no surplus would
develop.,
D.   The Plastics Conversion Industry
4.07       It is necessary for the plastics conversion industry (which
converts raw polyolefins into final consumption products) to develop in
line with the projected polyolefin production capacity and consumption
levels. In early 1982, there were about 7,250 processing units (with a
capacity of 1 million tpy) against only 1,400 units in 1970. The capacity
is predominantly (about 95%) in small-scale privately owned establishments
owing to the low investment requirements and liberal and simple
registration procedures for setting up new units. The industry at present
employs about 100,000 people, an average of about 14 employees per unit.
About 0.75 million tpy of additional nominal processing capacity will be
needed by 1990, to process the Project's output, after allowing for
improvements in the efficiency of existing units and in machinery quality.
This expansion would promote about US$300 million of private investment.
Since the subsector is fairly well-established and is profitable, this size
of expansion is considered feasible. The Project and the conversion
industry expansion would result in creation of about 60,000 new jobs, a



- 18 -
part of it by displacement of the jobs in those sectors whose products will
be substituted by the products from the Project.
4.08      India's conversion machine building industry, which is mainly in
the private sector, has demonstrated entrepreneurship and capability to
evolve designs of plastic conversion equipment suited for local conditions
at well below international prices. More recently, it has also become
increasingly conscious of quality needs, and expects to improve the local
designs further. This effort will be supported by the present liberal
policies which encourage imports of prototype machines and post-extrusion
system components, when needed to achieve quality requirements.
4.09      Organization support to provide technical assistance to the
plastic processing industry is available through institutions such as the
Central Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technology (CIPET), the
Plastics and Rubber Institute, the National Small Scale Industries
Corporation (NSSIC), the Small Industries Service Institute, the Indian
Institute of Packaging and various industrial training institutes, as well
as the plastics manufacturers themselves. CIPET is establishing an
extension center in in Ahmedabad (Gujarat), while NSSIC intends to set up
shortly a center for prototypes development and training. In recognition
of the need for national coordination in developing the skilled manpower
for plastics processing through disseminating technical literature and
resources among the States, training institutes and the processing
industry, the Government has agreed to set up a training and technical
assistance unit by April 1, 1986 which will review cnd update the curricula
for training methods of tool making and conversion machinery operatives, as
well as develop methods and channels for providing technical assistance to
the conversion machinery industry.
V. MARKETING
A.   Pricing in the Petrochemical Sector
5.01      At present, each petrochemicals plant in India sets its own
ex-factory prices for its own production. Prices of major polymers
increased sharply in 1980 following major increases in petroleum prices in
1979. Since then, ex-factory prices are showing a downward trend owing to
the commissioning and efficient operation of IPCL's production facilities
completed in late 1978. For example, ex-factory prices of LDPE, HDPE, and
PP, in constant 1984 prices, declined from US$2,000, 1,850, and 1,700 per
ton in 1980 to US$1,200, 1,400, and 1,450 per ton in 1984. While the
current ex-factory prices are still higher than CIF prices by 20% for LDPE,
60% for HDPE, and 50% for PP, the ratios of ex-factory to CIF prices are
expected to move toward 1, as the current international prices will recover
to equilibrium levels (para 2.19) and as the ex-factory prices could be
further reduced by IPCL's efficient operation particularly after this
energy-efficient Project comes on stream.
5.02      On ex-factory prices, excise taxes are levied which now range
between 16% and 37% depending on the types of polymers involved (compared
with a uniform rate of 56% in 1974). Ex-factory prices and excise taxes
then form the prices that plastic convertors actually pay. The level of



- 19 -
tax liability is in line with those charged on competing products (10% to
50% for glass, paper, wood, aluminum and steel). Thermoplastics imports
are subject to import duties generally set at levels which would make
landed prices of imports equal to ex-factory prices plus excise taxes.
However, in view of the recent highly fluctuating international prices,
tariffs have remained high to protect local producers against dumping. As
international and domestic prices reach equilibrium levels by early 1990's,
the tariff level can be expected to decline and match excise taxes on
domestic production.
5.03      The Project is a major effort by the Government to produce
petrochemicals--especially thermoplastics--and to use them to substitute
the more energy intensive and scarce traditional materials. To facilitate
such substitution in an efficient manner, it is necessary that pricing and
fiscal policies reflect the relative economics of the alternatives. The
Government has asked the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices (BICP) to
conduct a study on the pricing, fiscal, and trade policies for
petrochemicals with emphasis on the enhanced development of domestic
petrochemichals market in the context of the Project. The Study will, in
particular: (i) estimate the impact of relative prices on demand for
thermoplastics; (ii) assess the impact of technology, and product
development on final demand of downstream.derived products; (iii) examine
the tariff, and pricing policy requirements relating to the absorption of
downstream products in the economy; (iv) assess the methods to integrate
the pricing, and tariff policy analyses with India's Plan objectives,
relating to the Project, the petrochemicals sector, and inter-related
sectors; and (v) to highlight any non-tariff, and non-pricing policies
which are critical to the achievement of the above-mentioned aspects. The
BICP study is expected to be completed by March 1986. The Bank can provide
its views to GOB while the study is underway. GOI is committed to
ensuring that, prior to the commissioning of the Project, the domestic
polyolefins industry is efficient and competitive and, to this end, will
consider the Study findings and implement appropriate recommendations in an
adequate time-frame, and the Bank can provide its views on the details to
be considered while the study is underway. This approach is acceptable to
the Bank.
B.   Market Development Prior to Project Commissioning
5.04     The Project's output will approximately double domestic
availability of polymers. Even the conservative consumption forecast (para
4.02) levels used in the base case, can be realized only with active market
promotion to develop end-use applications supported by adequate
availability of polymers until the commissioning of the Project. In view
of the limited domestic polymers production, such market development
efforts will require significant imports to provide assured long-term raw
material availability and to reasonably ensure that the required conversion
and machinery capacities are developed in time. The annual imports of
polymers through Project commissioning needed for this purpose are
estimated to be about 40,000 tons in 1985/86, 70,000 tons in 1986/87,
110,000 tons in 1987/88, and 150,000 tons in 1988/89, representing total
imports of about US$350 million in constant 1984 prices, or US$450 million
in current terms. These estimated levels of imports will be reviewed
annually between GOI, IPCL, and the Bank in the light of market response,



- 20 -
and performance of the conversion industry. Disbursements out of the US$90
million Bank Loan component will cover an agreed portion of the annual
requirements jointly specified under the import plan.
5.05      At present, only the actual users--plastics convertors--are
permitted to directly import the polymers. While this system will
continue, GOI has agreed to give import clearances to permit IPCL to import
LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE and PP, starting in 1985/86, in such quantities (para
5.04) as are necessary for gradual market expansion. The US$90 million
component will be able to cover up to about 75% of the total LLDPE import
requirements, or up to about 20% of the total incrermental imports of
LDPE/LLDPE, HDPE and PP required.
5.06      The Bank has obtained assurances that GOI will refrain from
taking any action that would unduly inhibit the marlcet growth in plastics
from developing to a level consistent with the need for production under
the Project to market locally all of its output prornptly after
commissioning the Project.
C.   Marketing Strategy
5.07      IPCL already has an effective nationwide rmarketing network of 48
distribution points developed during the past five years (para 6.04). The
organization of the Marketing Department of IPCL is given in Annex 5.
IPCL's marketing efforts are supported by its Product Applications Center
(PAC) at Baroda, a very large facility providing after sale technical
services to the processing industry and thus contributing to its growth.
For example, during 1977/78-1979/80 PAC's efforts led to the establishment
of 300 new units for processing PP - a new polymer at that time in India.
5.08      IPCL's programs for marketing the outputs of the Project and
of IPCL's other expansion schemes include proposals for: (i) establishing
new distribution points; (ii) expanding PAC's activities in setting up a
product design unit to identify new applications ancd preparing prototype
machinery designs; (iii) training its own marketing staff and that of the
processors; and (iv) creating a new product applications center under the
proposed Project. This program is satisfactory and would particularly
emphasize the use of plastics in agriculture and water management according
to the findings of a high level national committee which has been recently
set up. Based on a detailed review, the arrangements proposed for market
development and marketing of the Project outputs are considered
satisfactory.
D. Merchant Sales of Excess Ethylene
5.09      The Project will offer as merchant sales about 50,000 tpy of
ethylene to existing and some new private sector petrochemicals producers
in the Bombay area, primarily for expansion of their facilities, a measure
which will promote private investment to improve the economics of present
operations. Six private firms have already offered to purchase a total of
about 62,000 tpy of merchant ethylene to manufacture products including
HDPE, PVC and styrene. GOI expects to give necessary licenses to the
private sector investors in a timely manner so that such new facilities are
completed well before the Project is commissioned.



- 21 -
E.   Export Potential for Final Plastics Products
5.10       India's exports of manufactured plastic products for consumer and
industrial uses, have so far been modest (US$27 million in 1976/77
increasing to US$61 million in 1980/81). Products exported in recent years
included spectacle frames, molded and extruded goods, records and video
cassettes, electrical accessories and pipes. The USSR is India's major
market (with one-fourth of the export sales) followed by Saudi Arabia, Hong
Kong, the UK, the UAE, Nigeria, Kuwait and Bangladesh. The export
performance has been only modest so far mainly due to inadequate
institutional support to the processing industry, which is largely in the
unorganized small-scale sector. While exporters have access to incentives
such as the cash compensatory support for reimbursement of indirect taxes
and duty drawback system for excise and customs duties on plastics used,
these are often received by them only after considerable delays.
5.11       India has a comparative advantage in converted product exports
especially where value added is high, owing to low labor costs, favorable
geographical location and availability of technical skills. To capture the
increased potential for export of converted products, GOI has agreed to
carry out by December 31, 1985, a study of the export market potential for
selected finished products under the terms of reference agreed upon between
the Bank and GOI, and to consult with the Bank on the implementation of the
findings under the Study.
VI.   THE PROJECT SPONSOR
A.   Establishment, Ownership and Objectives
6.01      The proposed Maharashtra Complex will be owned and operated by
the Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited (IPCL). IPCL is a corporate
entity registered under the Indian Companies Act and fully owned by the
Government of India. The Company already owns and operates a large
integrated petrochemical complex near Baroda in Gujarat State.
B.   Board of Directors and Management
6.02      The Company's Board of Directors has adequate Dowers to provide
policy directions to the Company executives including authorization of
operating and capital budgets and guidance on employment and compensation
policies. Approval of the GOI is required only in case IPCL needs to
borrow for capital requirements. The Company's day-to-day operations are
managed by a Managing Director--Chief Executive Officer who is the Chairman
of the Board. The twelve Board members include five (the Managing
Director, and the Finance, Marketing, Operations and Administration/
Personnel managers) professional Senior full-time managers of the Company.
The present IPCL Chairman/Managing Director joined the company in 1982
after holding important positions in the Indian private sector chemical
industry.



- 22 -
C.   Organization
6.03      IPCL is a well managed company organized along functional lines
into six departments--Projects, Operations, Finance, Administration/
Personnel, Research and Development (R&D) and Marketing. The departments
are headed by full-time functional directors. The Projects Department is
responsible for IPCL's new projects and a major program of plant revamping
and modernization is underway (para 6.06). The Department is responsible
for project planning (feasibility study and selection of technologies) and
implementation (selection of contractors, works supervision and training of
personnel) and has been responsible for planning the Project. The
Operations Department (entrusted with plant production and maintenance),
the Finance, and Administration/Personnel Departments discharge the
standard functions pertaining to their fields. IPCL's Research and
Development (R&D) Department with about forty scientists, undertakes
applied research to improve process parameters and economics, and develop
processes for by-product utilization. The Company's financial and
operations planning are well organized and adequately monitored through an
Executive Committee of senior managers, following techniques which include
standard costing and variance analysis.
6.04      The Marketing Department carries out its product promotion and
sales responsibilities through a network of regional offices in Baroda,
Bombay, Bangalore, New Delhi and Calcutta. Actual sales to IPCL's 7,000
customers are conducted through 48 distributors who are located within 100
km radius from the consumers.  The products are sold at all distribution
points at uniform price. The Department's Product Application Center (PAC)
is responsible for customer training, product testing and new applications,
and communications.
D.   Staff and Training
6.05      IPCL's total staff as of July 31, 1984 numbered 6,550 including
1,820 professionals and qualified technicians. Because of its high
professional reputation, and competitive compensation package, IPCL has
been able to attract competent staff at all levels, and retain them. IPCL
has extensive in-house training facilities which plan and run programs for
training technical and other staff often with the assistance of specialized
consulting firms. Project and operating staff are generally trained before
starting up of plants entailing new technologies. IPCL therefore has a
fully trained work force competent to operate and maintain large
petrochemical facilities.
E.   Operations and Growth
6.06      IPCL's first petrochemical plant--an aromatic complex--started
commercial production in 1973. Several units have since come on stream in
the Baroda complex which now includes eleven operating plants for
aromatics, olefins, ethylene oxide/glycol, LAB, LUPE, PP, PBR, ACN, acrylic
fiber, acrylics and PVC. Capacity utilization has steadily increased to
80-100% in 1982/83. Besides the proposed Project, IPCL plans to expand
VC/PVC, DMT, acrylic fiber, xylene, and LAB units as well as install a
captive power plant and implement energy-saving schemes. The detail of
IPCL's on-going investment program, which totals Rs 7,180 million, is given



- 23 -
in Annex 6-1. These other projects have met all GOI's investment criteria,
and the projects for expansion are basically market-pulled with relatively
certain market prospects. IPCL is India's major petrochemical producer
engaged in the production of a wide range of products involving different
technologies. It holds a share of about 71% of LDPE, 63% of ethylene
glycol, and 35% of PVC total production capacity in India. IPCL's
financial statements for 1979/80-1982/83 are provided in Annex 6-2 and
summarized in table VI-1. A description of IPCL's organization and
structure is available in the Project File, Reference E.
6.07      Table VI-i shows that IPCL has enjoyed a healthy financial
situation in the past years. During 1979/80 and 1982/83, total assets grew
from Rs 3.9 billion to Rs 4.8 billion, while revenues increased from RS 1.8
billion to Rs 4.5 billion, and profit before tax from Rs 46 million to Rs
513 million. Equity increased from Rs 2.1 billion to Rs 3.5 billion with a
debt/equity ratio of 15/85 in 1982/83. The liquidity position also has
been satisfactory with the minimum current ratio of 1.9 in 1980/81.

VII. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objective and Bank Group Role
7.01      The Maharashtra Petrochemical Project, the first in India to be
based on domestic natural gas, the most economic feedstock, will contribute
to the optimal use of India's gas resources. The output from the Project
will be marketed entirely in India. Though doubling present domestic
capacity, the Project will add only insignificantly - about 1%, to world
capacity. The Project is based on internationally competitive-size plant
and will therefore substitute economically the scarce more energy intensive
traditional materials of which India is a net importer. At full capacity
the economic value of the products will be about US$430 million per year.
A part of the Project's ethylene output would be marketed to existing



- 24 -
private sector petrochemical plants in the Bombay area enabling them to
expand and improve their operations. The Project has an attractive
economic rate of return and will lead to transfer of modern technology and
know-how to India.
7.02      The Bank Group has already been involved in the development of
India's gas resources and in the use of natural gas for fertilizer
production. The Project will be the Bank's first involvement in the
petrochemical sector which would contribute further to optimal gas use.
The current Project scope reflects the Bank's suggestions for the inclusion
of LLDPE in the Product slate, and for diversion of a part of the ethylene
production for expansion of private sector petrochemicals manufacturing
units in the Bombay area. Through this project, the Bank will work with
GOI to define an improved sector development strategy in terms of: (a)
faster market growth through increased polymers imports; (b) evolution of a
more rational product pricing system and fiscal policies; (c) promotion of
exports of plastic products; and (d) creation of an organized system for
technical assistance to, and training in, the conversion industry. The
Bank's participation will also contribute to efficient and coordinated
implementation of the project.
B. Project Scope
7.03      The Project will produce, as marketable products, low-density
polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene/high density
polyethylene (LLDPE/HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), which are polyolefin
plastics to be sold to the conversion industry ; ethvlene glycol/ethylene
oxide (EG/EO), which are intermediates for synthetic fiber and synthetic
detergent industries; a small amount of acetylene black, which will be sold
to the existing tire manufacturing, and printing and ink industries. A
portion of ethylene produced from its core cracker unit will be sold to
existing and new petrochemicals downstream conversion industries in the
area. Specific project facilities are described in Annex 7-1. The Project
will utilize ethane/propane (C2/C3) fraction, separated from B-H offshore
gases as the primary feedstock, supplemented by propane/propylene separated
from the offgases from the two refineries in the Bombay area. The linkages
between the core unit, second generation downstream conversion units, and
the tertiary plastics conversion sector outside the Project is shown in
chart VII-A.
C. Project Location
7.04      The Project will be located at a site about 2 km from the
Nagothane village in Raigarh district (Maharashtra State), about 120 km
south of Bombay city. The site, about 50 km from the Uran gas processing
terminal, was selected after investigation of six alternative sites and
presents the advantages of: (i) reasonable proximity to the main raw
materials sources; (ii) relatively sparsely populated area involving
minimum adverse social, environmental and safety impact on existing
villages; (iii) conformity with MSG's plans to promote industrial
development in the backward areas of the State; and (iv) availability of
utilities and infrastructure. In view of the nature of the terrain, the
site will need extensive grading and development. The Project's land
requirement of about 567 ha is being purchased from a region notified as

energy. The Bank has assisted in the development of the B-H resources
(Loans 1473-IN of 1977, and 1925-IN of 1980) and in the production of the
S-B offshore free gas (Credit 2241-IN of 1983).
7.06      Feedstock gas for the Project will be obtained principally from
the offshore B-H associated gases after separation from crude oil at the
production platforms, as well as free gas piped through an existing marine
pipeline to ONGC's existing gas treatment and LPG separation station at
Uran on the Bombay coast. ONGC will set up additional facilities at the
Uran site before the completion of the Project, to separate from the gas,
the ethane/propane (C2C3) fraction--the main feedstock for the Project. A,
50-km pipeline will be built by ONGC at the cost of the Project, to
transport the gas from Uran to the Project site.
7.07      Recoverable quantities of gases from reserves consist of:
(i) solution gas from the two currently producing crude oil zones (L-II and
L-III horizons); and (ii) free gas in S-1 horizon, lying between the L-II
and L-III horizons. These reserves total about 139 billion cubic
meters--102 billion m3 from L-11 and L-III, and 37 billion m3 from the yet
to be developed S-1 horizon. About 30 billion m3 of associated gas from
L-III has already been recovered since the start of production of crude oil
from this horizon. Allowing for further depletion of L-II and L-III gas
reserve during the next 5 years of project implementation, there would
still be adequate gas for over 22 years of project operation at its full
capacity. In addition to the above proven reserves., associated and cap gas
will also be available from Panna and other smaller fields now being
developed. Basal sands of the L-III horizon are also expected to contain
significant gas reserves but their recoverable quantities have not yet been
determined. The proven and potential reserves are therefore more than
adequate to meet the gas needs of the project for its economic operating
life.
7.08      ONGC at present intends to supply about 8 million m3 Per day of
raw gases to the Uran terminal, matching the estimated lean gas
requirements in the Bombay area. As crude oil production declines in the
coming years, the reduced associated gas supply wil:L be supplemented as
necessary by free gas from the S-1 horizon. AccordiLng to present
estimates, S-1 gas production will need to commence by 1992-93. Cap gas
Droduction from L-III is expected to commence by 2003 when crude oil
production from this horizon would have ended. Because of the lower C2/C3
content of S-1 gas relative to L-III associated and cap gas, it will be
necessary to produce increasingly larger quantities of the S-1 gas,
commencing 1995/96 reaching up to 1.5 million m3 per day by 2002, when
L-III cap gas will become available. Annex 7-2 shows the current ONGC gas
production and supply plan, as well as the Bank's estimates of additional
S-1 gas, or gas from other satellite fields, required as supplements to
ensure adequate feedstock to the Project. To ensure that the physical
arrangements required to produce the gas and deliver it to the Project are
planned and implemented in time, assurances have been obtained from GOI
that it will take adequate measures to ensure that the offshore gas
development plans are carried out in a time-frame consistent with the
requirements of associated and free gas to the Project and that physical
facilities for feedstock separation and supply to the Project shall be
established. From IPCL, assurances have been obtained that it will enter



- 27-
into a long-term agreement with ONGC for feedstock gas, and fuel gas supply
by June 1988.
E. Utilities and Infrastructure Facilities
1.   Water
7.09       Water supply to the Project, estimated at 15 million gallons per
day, will be drawn from the existing water-intake headworks situated about
4 km south of the site on the Amba river and transported by a pipeline to
the site. The new facilities including a pipeline from the headworks to
the site and additional pumps at the existing headworks will be built at
the cost of the Project by MIDC. The flow in the Amba river will be
augmented by diversion through a link canal (a State Government project)
from the Kundalika river, which derives its primary flow from the tail-race
of the Bhira hydroelectric plant. This diversion will ensure reliable and
sustained water supply to industrial users in the area including the
Project. The Project water supply arrangements are satisfactory.
2.   Power
7.10       At full capacity, the Project will require about 64 MW of power.
The Project includes captive power supply arrangements entailing 73 MW of
thermal generation (based on lean gas) through the installation of three
(including a standby) gas turbinie generators of 20 MW each, and a 13 MW
steam turbine driven generator. In addition, the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board (MSEB), has agreed to supply 20 MW of power, through the
Kondalgaon station, to meet the emergency requirements and to ensure
uninterrupted power supply even if for any reason two out of the four
generators are under maintenance. Availability of adequate quantities of
dependable power is crucial to the uninterrupted and safe operation of the
Project. The arrangements for practical self-sufficiency in power supply,
with back-up from the State grid are most appropriate, and will eliminate
risks.
3. Roads and Railways
7.11       The Bombay-Goa highway passes about 4 km east of the Project site
on the right bank of the Amba river. A new road from the site to the
highway including a bridge across the Amba river will be constructed.
Small roads in the Project area will be widened and new roads will be
constructed to provide an alternate approach to the highway and to Bombay
city. A broad-gauge line to be completed in end-1984 will pass through
Nagothane village providing a railway link to Bombav. A spur line (about 3
km long) will connect the Project site to the Nagothane railway station to
transport equipment and materials to, and products from, the Project or in
the alternative, the existing Nagothane railway station will be enlarged to
include a marshalling yard eliminating the need for the spur line. A
deep-water jetty was constructed in early 1983, about 50 km from the
Project site, for use by the projects in the area to receive heavy
consignments. MSG will upgrade the road link from the jetty to the site to
enable the transport of heavy loads. With the completion of these
transport links, the Project will be well connected to its markets in the
rest of the country.

VIII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. General Arrangements
8.01      The Project, to be owned by Indian Petrochemicals Corporation
Limited (IPCL), will be implemented and operated by a separate division of
IPCL. IPCL will implement the Project with Engineers India Limited (EIL)--
a large Indian engineering company-- as its general contractor responsible
for basic engineering of non-licensed sections, detailed engineering,
procurement services, construction contractors selection, and construction
supervision for all project components. IPCL will obtain from
international license and engineering firms and provide EIL with the
proprietary knowhow, process license and basic engineering for the three
polyolefins, and EO/EG and acetylene black technologies. The technology
licensing agreements will provide for licensor specialists to review EIL's
detailed engineering, to supervise construction and plants start-up. IPCL
will be assisted (i) by the Maharashtra State Government (MSG) in the
acquisition of the Project site as well as for right-of-way for the
pipelines; (ii) through MSG's executive development agencies-- Maharashtra
Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), and State Industrial Investment
Corporation of Maharashtra (SICOM)--in the implementation on behalf of
IPCL, of the water supply arrangements (headworks and pipeline), and
approach roads; and (iii) through Maharashtra State Electricity Board
(MSEB), in constructing the power transmission line, and for long-term
supply of standby electric power from the State Gridl. IPCL, as mentioned
before (para 7.08), will enter into a long-term agreement with ONGC for
feedstock gas and fuel gas supply. ONGC will also construct the C2/C3
separation facilities at Uran at its own cost, and the gas transmission
lines from Uran terminal to the site on behalf of and to the cost of IPCL.
IPCL will enter into a long-term supply contract with Bombay refineries for
supply of propane/propylene refinery offgas to the Project. The Indian
Railways will lay the railway spur lines from Nagothane railway station to
the site, or enlarge Nagothane railway station facilities at the cost of
the Project. As part of their ongoing industrial promotion activities in
the State. MIDC and SICOM will promote establishment of industrial estates
for small-scale private industries for development of plastics conversion
industry, and ancillary industries for providing inputs to the Project. A
Project Coordination Committee consisting of representatives of IPCL and
the agencies with responsibility for implemen;ing the various infrastruc-
ture facilities, has been formed to monitor progress, provide coordination
and ensure timely availability of all the facilities. IPCL will make
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank with appropriate agencies and
authorities for provision of adequate and timely supply of water and power
and adequate transport infrastructure facilities for the Project. The
arrangements for provision of infrastructure facilities in a timely manner
are satisfactory.
B. Project Management
1. IPCL Organization
8.02      The Project will be headed by an Executive Director (Project)
[ED(P)] who will be a member of IPCL Board and will coordinate with the



- 29 -
Chairman and Managing Director of IPCL. He will be assisted by a General
Manager (Project) and a Chief Financial Controller (Project) and all three
will be delegated adequate decision making and financial authority to
minimize delays. The Project team of about 75 persons at the peak of
construction activities, will manage all activities up to commissioning and
will be grouped into project implementation groups each headed by a project
coordinator and responsible for specific areas of the facilities. IPCL's
current organization structure including the indication for the future
extension, particularly for the Project implementation period, is given in
Annex 8-1. The overall organizational set-up for the Project execution is
satisfactory. The ED(P) and General Manager (Project) have been
appointed. The appointment of the Chief Financial Controller is under
way. Should a vacancy occur during project implementation in any of these
positions, IPCL will furnish to the Bank the details of qualifications and
experience of the proposed nominees.
2. General Contractor's (EIL) Organization
8.03      Engineers India Ltd. (EIL), a public sector engineering company
with capabilities and proven experience in implementing petrochemical and
refinery projects, will be the General Contractor. EIL has acquired over
the last 20 years an intimate knowledge of project implementation
conditions and procedures in India, and has considerable experience in
engineering, procurement, and general project management of large
refineries, fertilizer plants, gas processing and chemicals manufacturing
plants both in India and the Middle East. EIL will implement its
responsibilities through a full-time project task team headed by an
experienced Senior Project Manager. The task team will include area
project managers and services coordinators. The project managers and
services coordinators will liaise with EIL's corporate departments for
specialist services. A resident Construction Manager reporting to the
Senior Project Manager will head the site construction team supervising and
managing construction subcontracts.  The project management arrangements
are similar to those successfully used by IPCL in its Baroda complex and by
Indian refineries in implementing and commissioning large projects using
EIL as the general contractor, and the proposed arrangements are therefore
satisfactory.
3. Selection of Technologies
8.04      The technologies for the cracker and the various process units
have been selected after appropriate evaluation of internationally
well-known alternative available proven processes.  The procedures adopted
consist of: (a) preparing a list of internationally known process
technology licensors for each unit; (b) inviting techno-commercial
assistance during detailed engineering, construction and start-up, and
training of personnel; (c) evaluating the techno-commercial bids in respect
of the required product range, characteristics and technology provenness,
supplemented wherever required by visits to plants using such technologies;
(d) discussing with the short-listed licensors, the technical and
commercial terms of their offers (excluding prices) to bring bids to a
comparable basis; and (e) opening all price bids for each technology on a
fixed date, and evaluating the offers for selection. A brief description
of selection procedures for each plant unit is contained in Annex 8-2 and



- 30 -
the details are in Project File, Reference F. Technologies selected for
the gas cracker, LDPE, PP, EO/EG have already been approved. The selected
LLDPE technology is expected to be given approval in March 1985.
Technology selection for acetylene black still in progress will not
adversely affect the overall project schedule. Appropriate technologies
for the various process units have been obtained internationally following
the procedures, criteria and methodologies in conformity with the Bank's
guidelines.
C. Staffing and Training
8.05      Under full operation, the Project will directly employ about
3,000 persons including 1,025 supervisory staff. During commercial
operations, the organizations will be headed by a Managing Director/
Director-in-charge assisted by three General Managers in charge of
operations, engineering services and Personnel, and two other Senior
Managers--Chief Financial Controller and Chief Technical Manager. Key
managerial and supervisory staff will primarily come from IPCL's existing
pool of experienced personnel and further trained as required in production
management areas. Operations and semi-skilled personnel will be recruited
generally from the Indian hydrocarbon processing industry, and trained in
IPCL training center, its production plants, as well as at other
hydrocarbon processing units nearby. Unskilled labor will be recruited
mainly from areas near the Project, including persons from displaced
villages.
D. Environmental Considerations
8.06      The Project facilities will treat contaminants in the effluents
to applicable stringent standards for disposal at a safe point in the sea
and control air pollution levels to minimize any adverse impact on
environment. Liquid effluents will be primary-treated within the unit
battery limits to partially neutralize and remove some of the chemical
contaminants. The effluents will then be sent to a central secondary waste
water treatment facility designed according to licensors' data on effluents
quantities and pollutant levels for process units, and the applicable
rigorous State standards (Annex 8-3). Physical treated effluents will
conform to standards applicable for discharge into inland waters. Sludge
from the biological treatment unit and other solid wastes from process
units will be used as land fill. The treated liquid effluents will be
finally transported in a 41 km long pipeline and discharged into the sea in
a manner to be determined in due course after a survey taking into account
the dilution levels required and tidal effects. Control of ambient air
quality will follow the standards prescribed by GOI's Central Board for
Prevention and Control of Water Pollution under the Air Prevention and
Pollution Act 1981. For Industrial and Mixed UJse areas, as in the case of
the Project, the ground-level concentration of suspended particulate
matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides shall not
exceed respectively 100, 30, 1,000 and 30 micrograms per cubic meters of
air, monitored at least once a week over 8 continuous hours. The Project
will use primarily gaseous fuels, and coupled with 90-100 meter-high stacks
in the high-heat release furnace and flare, will ensure complete
conformance to the air quality standards. IPCL will monitor, during
Project implementation, the meteorological data colliection and the model



- 31 -
studies on site-specific weather conditions, and ensure that appropriate
modifications to air pollution control systems are incorporated. The
Project will be built and operated to effluent and air quality standards
mentioned above which are acceptable to the Bank.
E. Safety Considerations
8.07      Plant and personnel safety is proposed to be ensured in the
Project through measures to be adopted during (a) project design and
construction and (b) during plant operation--especially in handling
potential hazards from toxic, explosive, carcinogenic and noisy work
environment. The facilities will be designed, constructed and operated in
conformity with applicable local legislative requirements or internation-
ally accepted codes and standards. The process licensors who are providing
the major technologies for the Project have considerable experience with
similar facilities in other countries, and will provide overall safety
guidelines and review the engineering from safety considerations. The
design and engineering will also be reviewed by the EIL and IPCL Safety
Specialists who have experience with petrochemical facilities engineered,
constructed and operated in India.
8.08      The Project includes facilities for the production of
polyolefins,. ethylene oxide/glycol and acetylene black, and the safety
hazards will arise primarily through risks of explosion. In addition, the
relatively small tonnages of processing chemicals with carcinogenic
potential will need to be stored and handled in accordance with
internationally accepted practices. Potentially hazardous areas will be
isolated and fugitive emissions reduced and controlled.
8.09      Both during construction and its later operation, the Project
will have an adequate safety department staffed with competent and
experienced professionals mainly drawn from the present operating IPCL
facilities in Baroda. This department will review and set safety norms and
practices in consultation with the process licensors and in conformity with
local legislative requirements and internationally accepted practices. The
Safety Department will train the operating and maintenance personnel to
maintain their awareness of potential hazards, safety practices and
emergency procedures. To ensure high level recognition of the safety
needs, the Safety Department will report and work directly under the Works
Manager. The elements of the safety aspects, and the manner in which these
aspects will be taken into account are summarized in Annex 8-4. The
Project is located in a sparsely populated area and the few hamlets in the
immediate vicinity of the Project site will be relocated to maintain an
adequate unpopulated Safety belt around the Project site. Assurances have
been obtained that IPCL will carry out a detailed safety audit by qualified
consultants prior to commissioning of the Project to assess the impact of
the risks of the Project area, and to the surrounding community. IPCL and
the Bank will exchange views on the TOR for the study and in the
implementation of the findings of the study.
F. Project Execution Schedule
8.10      The major technology selection process has been completed and
discussions with the main process licensors will be completed by end



- 32 -
December 1984. The basic engineering work for the major process
units--especially the time critical gas cracker unit--will start in January
1985. The land acquisition for the Project is in progress and access to
the land for initial site surveys and later for construction will be
available in time. The Project will take about 58 months from zero date to
mechanical completion, followed by 2 months for precommissioning systems
testing. The project completion date, corresponding to feedstock cut-in,
is therefore expected to be December 1989. Basic engineering work is
expected to be substantially completed by October 1985 for the cracker, and
January 1988 for downstream units. Major ordering for equipment and
materials will commence by December 1985, and construction activities by
November 1985 for civil works in the offsite area and by September 1986 for
the process units. Major equipment will start arriving at the site by
January 1987 and will be fully delivered by about December 1988. Other
Project components will be scheduled for completion matching the completion
of the gas cracker, except for the utilities systems which will be ready
about 3-6 months earlier to facilitate pre-testing and commissioning. The
Project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 8-5 in the form of a bar
chart. The Project scheduling has been prepared in adequate detail and
reflects realistic time and resource allocations for all the important
activities.
IX. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A.   Project Capital Cost
9.01      The total financing required for the Project, including physical
and price contingencies, working capital, and interest during construction,
is estimated at US$1,697 million equivalent, of which US$651 million
equivalent will be in foreign exchange. In addition, US$90 million of the
Bank loan to GOI will be used for financing part of preproduction imports
of polyolefins. The capital cost breakdown by project component is given
in Annex 9-1 and summarized in Table IX-1 on the following page.
9.02      The project cost estimates are derived from the Project
feasibility study which has been extensively discussed by the Bank with
IPCL and EIL and appropriately adjusted. The base cost estimate (BCE), in
constant 1984 prices, is derived: (i) for process plants, from suppliers'
quotations for key equipment, and EIL's data and licensors' information;
(ii) for utilities, offsites and infrastructure, from suppliers' quotations
and EIL's data; and (ii) for piping, electricals, instrumentation, erection
and civil works, from appropriate parameters as a proportion of equipment
and materials costs, based on data from IPCL and licensors. The cost
estimates include provisions that would enable expansion of the naphtha
cracker from its initial nominal capacity of 300,000 tpy to a future
capacity of 400,000 tpy through addition of furnaces. Physical
contingencies are calculated at 10% of BCE and are appropriate in the light
of the cost estimating basis adopted. Price contingencies are based on
annual escalation rates of 3.5% in 1984/85, 8.0% in ]L985/86, 9.0% in
1986/87, 9% in 1987/88, 9.0% in 1988/89 and 7.5% in 1989/90 appropriate for
industrial projects in India.

9.04      In addition to the proposed Bank loan, a total of US$641.8
million equivalent in debt financing for both local and foreign
expenditures will be provided through (i) Government: loans supplemented as
necessary by loans from domestic financial institutions; and (ii) foreign
loans from official development agencies. The balance would come through
supplier's credit, for which arrangements would be finalized during the
procurement cycle. The debt financing will thus amount to US$852 million
equivalent or 50% of the total IPCL financing requirements excluding
preproduction imports. The equity financing, equivalent to US$845 million
or 50% of total financing requirements excluding preproduction imports,
will be provided by the GOI (US$500 million), IPCL (US$200 million) and the
Project's internal cash generation (US$145 million). The GOI's equity
contribution of US$500 million will come from its development budget
(US$252 million), duties on equipment for the Project (US$208 million) and
interest during construction (US$40 million). IPCL's equity contribution
of US$200 million will come from the cash balance generated in its existing



- 35 -
operations after meeting its financial commitments including funding
requirements for on-going projects (para 10.08). The Project's normal
working capital requirement of US$149.5 million will be reached by the
fourth year of operation and will be mainly financed by the Project's
internal cash generation (profit after tax, plus depreciation) of US$145
million during the same period.
9.05      The Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent will be made to the
Government and will: (i) cover, under the US$210 million component, 12% of
total Project costs, or 32% of foreign exchange costs; and (ii) provide
US$90 million equivalent for pre-production imports of plastics for market
development. The Bank loan will be made to the GOI at the Bank's standard
interest terms for 20 years including 5 years of grace. The GOI will
onlend the US$210.0 million component to IPCL at an interest rate of not
less than 13.25% (a positive real rate given projections for domestic
inflation, and in line with the present lending rates to public sector
enterprises) with a repayment period of 15 years including 6 years of
grace. The repayment term including 6 years of grace is justified on
grounds of (i) the long-gestation period of the Project, with disbursements
under the loan extending over 5-1/2 years; and (ii) the Project's cash
position and debt servicing capacity in the first year of operation
(1989/90). Anounts disbursed out of the US$90 million component for
preproduction of imports will be purchased by IPCL from GOI against payment
in Rupees at the prevailing exchange rates. The foreign exchange risk on
the Bank loan, including the US$ 90 million import component, will be borne
by the GOI.  Ratification of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the GOI
and IPCL on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for the
on-lending of the US$210 million component will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
9.06      Equipment and materials financed by the Bank loan will be
procured through international competitive bidding (ICB), except for
equipment proprietary to the process design, items the supply of which is
critical to efficient and timely project execution, and small packages
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 each, which may be procured through
limited international tendering from at least three qualified suppliers
from Bank member countries, according to lists of goods agreed upon with
the Bank. IPCL will need sufficient flexibility for efficient and quick
procurement during project implementation as the number of purchase orders
would range between 350 and 400. Aggregate contracts for the procurement
of proprietary, critical and small items under the Bank loan will not
exceed US$31.5 million equivalent. For purposes of bid evaluation under
ICB, qualified local suppliers will enjoy a margin of preference of 15% or
the applicable duty, whichever is lower. The likely allocation of
procurement categories to be followed during project execution is given in
Table IX-3 on the following page.

volatility. The disbursements of the loan for pre-production imports will
be phased over the period up to September 1989. The Bank loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by September 1990, as per disbursement schedule given
in Annex 9-2, which is consistent with the disbursement profile of
Bank-financed chemical industry projects including those in India. Funds
from co-financing sources will be utilized to finance parts of the
equipment and foreign engineering costs in accordance with their respective
procurement procedures. IPCL's equity and GOI's loan will finance the
balance of the equipment, engineering, civil works and erection services,
which will be procured under competitive bidding procedures normally
adopted for such projects in India and acceptable to the Bank. The
proposed allocation of funds from the Bank loan is summarized in Table

X. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Revenues and Operating Costs
10.01      The financial projections are carried out in current rupees, on
a fiscal year (April-March) basis. The financial rate of return is however
calculated on constant 1984 price basis. Key assumptions used in the
financial analysis are given in Annex 10-1. It is assumed that the Project
will start commercial production in January 1990, 58 months after the
commencement of the basic engineering. The Project would reach 65%
capacity utilization rate in the first twelve month operating period, 80%
in the second period and 95% thereafter, an achievable rate with the
project configuration involved, the performance of IPCL and the
availability within the Project of captive power supply (power shortage
from the national grid being a major impediment in India). A project life
of 15 years is assumed, with no residual value except for working capital
recovery.



- 38 -
10.02     In light of the expected efficiency of the gas-based complex,
using up-to-date technology on an economic scale, it is assumed that the
Project will be able to charge prices close to equilibrium international
price levels, which are, in real terms, 20% below India's present
ex-factory prices. Ex-factory prices of LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE, PP and merchant
ethylene, which together account for 85% of total revenues of the Project
are given in table X-1. Detailed product prices and revenues data for the
Project are shown in Annex 10-2.

a/  First year of full capacity utilization.
b/ Ethylene as such is not traded in the international market. The price
of US$767/ton is ex-factory, Western Europe, from a 450,000 tpy
ethylene plant.
c/ LLDPE price is assumed to be the same as of LDPE.
10.03     The production cost structure of the Project is summarized in
Table X-2 in the following page.
10.04     The ethane/propane feedstock represents 35% of total production
costs. Ethane/propane, in constant 1984 terms, is estimated at US$206/ton
(Rs 2,466/ton), equivalent to 65% of the naphtha price, in 1992/93, the
first year of full capacity operation; and at US$177/ton (Rs 2,120/ton) in
1984, close to the fuel oil equivalent value of US$189/ton. These
assumptions are in line with the GOI's system for pricing petrochemical
feedstock. Depreciation, computed on a 12-year straight line method,
accounts for a sizeable share (28%) of total production costs, which
reflects the capital intensity of the Project.
B. Financial Projections
10.05     Projected income statement, balance sheet, and funds flow
statement are given in Annex 10-3 for the Project, and in Annex 10-4 for
IPCL, without and with the Project.

10.07      Sales would increase from Rs 5,251 million in 1990/91 to Rs 8,151
million in 1992/93, when 95% capacity utilization would be reached. During
the period, as operating profit increases from Rs 985 million to Rs 2,598
million, the initial loss of Rs 312 million in 1990/91 would turn into
profit in the next year and reach Rs 1,594 millions in 1992/93. The
Project will benefit from unabsorbed depreciation carry-over allowance
based on the declining balance depreciation method (used only for the
calculation of taxable income) and investment credits. As a result, tax
liabilities would be postponed until 1994/95. The resulting large amounts
of initial internal cash generation will cover most of the incremental
working capital requirements during the capacity build-up. The break-even
point will improve in 1994/95 to 49% for profit (income before tax), and to
42% for cash. The debt service coverage ratio would remain above 1.7 and
the current ratio above 1.3, while the debt/equity ratio would decrease to
28/72 in 1994/95.  The Project would thus maintain a satisfactory financial

structure and liquidity position through its life and should be able to pay
substantial dividends.
2. IPCL Financial Projections
10.08      Tables X-4 and X-5 summarize key financial indicators of IPCL,
with and without the Project. In addition to the proposed Project, IPCL's
investment program through 1989/90, includes expansion schemes for VC/PVC,
DMT, acrylic fiber, xylene, and LAB, the installation of a captive power
plant and energy saving projects (para 6.06). These other projects are all
approved by GOI, having met all economic and financial criteria set by
GOI. Capital expenditures of the projects are spread over the coming
years, and the Project will be completed in different years before
1990/91. Thus, the projects will lead to a steady increase in IPCL's
revenues and assets base. Between 1984/85 and 1989/90, IPCL's estimated
internal cash generation of Rs 8,926 million would exceed the capital
expenditure requirements of Rs 6,411 million under these other projects.
IPCL should have no difficulty in providing up to the balance of Rs 2,400
million (US$200 million equivalent) for the Maharashtra Project.

10.09       IPCL's consolidated financial projections indicate that at full
capacity, Project's sales would represent 27% of IPCL's revenues. IPCL's
equity and debt bases will be significantly expanded, while IPCL capital
structure (maximum debt/equity ratio of 49/51 in 1988/89) and liquidity
position (minimum current ratio of 1.5 in 1987/88 and 1988/89) will remain
sound during the Project implementation period as well as through its
operating life.
10.10       The impact of the Project on the Government's budget is expected
to be satisfactory (Annex 10-5), as the Government's equity investment will
be fully recovered by 1995/96. The 1984 present value of net resource
flows to the Government during the Project's economic life, at a 12%
discount rate, will be about Rs 5.2 billion.

a/   Switching values of ex-factory prices, gas prices, and capital costs
with respect to different FRRs were derived independent of each other,
and are not additive for each FRR.
10.12     The Project's financial rate of return in constant 1984 terms,
and before tax is estimated at 11.4%. Sensitivity tests show that the FRR
is most sensitive to changes in capacity utilization rates and capital
costs, and relatively less sensitive to gas prices. The relatively low
FRR, which as indicated by the switching value analysis would break below



- 44 -
10%, were ex-factory prices to decline by 5% relative to the Base Case, is
to a large extent, attributable to the heavy penalty imposed upon the
investment of the Project by duties and taxes amounting to US$ 200 million
or 20% of the Project base cost estimate. Should the constraint of duties
and taxes be relaxed, the FRR would markedly improve as evidenced by the
value of the economic rate of return (17.9%) where the duties distortion is
removed (para 11.04). The likelihood of low capacity utilization of the
Project through its operating life is not high in light of IPCL's excellent
capacity utilization performance (e.g. 98% of ethylene, 104% for LDPE, and
94% for PP in recent months), as well as the favorable market prospects.
D. Financial Covenants and Reporting Requirements
10.13     Agreements have been obtained that GOI wiLl provide IPCL with
adequate financing for timely completion of the Project covering also, if
need be, shortfalls from cofinancing sources and/or cost overruns. GOI
has provided assurances that no action would be taken or allowed to be
taken which would prevent IPCL from covering its costs under the Project,
servicing its debt and earning a reasonable return on investment from the
Project, under efficient operations. Agreements has been obtained from
IPCL that it will follow prudent financial practices, and will: (i)
maintain at all times a long-term debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60/40;
(ii) after completion of the Project, maintain at all times a current ratio
of at least 1.3; (iii) not incur additional debt over the level necessary
for the Project and other projects approved by GOI before August 1984, if
by so doing, the projected debt service coverage ratio would fall below
1.3; and (iv) not prepay debt, if it would result in the current ratio
falling below 1.5. IPCL will submit its annual audited financial reports,
including separate statements for the Project, within six months from the
end of its fiscal year in a form satisfactory to the Bank. In addition,
IPCL will: (i) submit quarterly construction progress reports during the
first 18 months of Project construction and monthly thereafter through
commissioning; and (ii) submit, not later than 30 days after the end of
each quarter, quarterly financial statements for the Project (statements of
income, expenses, cash flow, and projections). Finally, IPCL will prepare
and submit to the Bank within four months after the start of commercial
operation of the Project, a completion report on the Project, dealing with
its experience during implementation and initial operation, and the
expected costs and benefits of the Project.
E. Major Risks
10.14     The Project is not expected to face any critical technical risks
as the technologies used are commercially proven and supplied by
internationally known firms. The risk of delays in the commercial start-up
of the plant is also reduced given IPCL's experience in the erection and
start-up of similar projects, in particular, the Baroda naphtha-based
plant.
10.15     Timely availability of adequate gas supply by ONGC to the Project
from Bombay-High and other gas fields, represents a potential risk to the
Project. While the gas production estimates based on ONGC's latest
development plans are adequate, it is necessary that ONGC's plans and
facilities are implemented in a timely manner. This risk is, however,



- 45 -
reduced given the arrangements that IPCL and ONGC will conclude concerning
gas supply including development of production, transport and separation
facilities, as well as finalization of a long-term gas supply-offtake
contract.
10.16     IPCL's investments between 1984/85 and 1989/90, other than for
the proposed Project account for 28% of the company's total capital
expenditures, against 72% for the Project.  Significant cost overrun or
delay of start-up in these projects, though unlikely given IPCL's project
execution capabilities, might cause funding problems, since IPCL's fund
provision to the Project (Rs 2,400 million) partly depends on the
successful implementation and operation of these other projects. However,
IPCL's debt capacity is sufficiently high as indicated by its low
(favorable) debt/equity ratio-- from 15/85 in 1983/84 to 49/51 on a
consolidated basis (including the Project) in 1988/89. Even if projected
capital expenditures for these other projects were doubled every year and
were financed by long-term borrowings, IPCL's consolidated debt/equity
ratio still would not exceed a 55/45 level. Thus, the funding risk of the
Project will remain manageable.
10.17     Finally, the market risk of the Project is limited given the
large growth potential for plastics use in India and assurances obtained
from GOI with respect to market development and pricing policies. Since
the projection for domestic demand growth is based on present high price
levels in India, any reduction in future prices, which is projected at 20%
once the Project comes on stream, will lead to faster growth of domestic
plastics market. This risk is further reduced because of IPCL's
well-established marketing network and planned marketing expansion
schemes. The marketing risks are therefore acceptable.
XI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
11.01     Economic costs and benefits for tradeable items have been valued
at international border prices. For non-tradeable items, appropriate
domestic prices have been used. All prices are in constant 1984 US dollar
terms. The detail of assumptions used is given in Annex 11-1. The
economic capital cost of the Project was derived by deducting from the
financial cost import duties and taxes on equipment and licenses fees. For
local currency costs, a standard conversion factor of 0.8 was used, with a
25% premium (for US dollar) applied for the shadow exchange rate.
Infrastructure (township, power, pipelines, roadlink to main highway) and
the investment in the Uran gas separation facilities have also been
included in the economic capital cost of the Project.
11.02     Revenues were derived from the long-term equilibrium  prices
based on the demand/supply analysis as described in paras 2.16-2.23. Since
the Project's products will substitute for imports, border prices (CIF
'Bombay) were obtained by adding insurance, freight and handling



- 46 -
charges--US$70/ton for polyolefins, and US$40/ton for EO and EG, to the FOB
equilibrium prices.
11.03     The opportunity cost of ethane/propane feedstock is deemed to be
its fuel oil equivalent value based on calorific content. It results in a
price of US$246/ton in 1989 (US$5.7/MBTU) and US$254/ton in 1990, subse-
quently increasing at a real rate of 4% p.a. through 1995, and remaining
constant thereafter in line with fuel oil price projections. The price of
lean gas (methane) at US$262/ton (US$6.1/MBTU) in 1989 is also calculated
at fuel oil equivalent value, as is the price of propane-rich off-gas from
the Bombay refineries (at US$243/ton).
B.   Economic Rate of Return
11.04     The base case economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated
at 17.9%. The cash flows for the economic rate of return are given in
Annex 11-2. Results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table
XI-1 on the following page.
11.05     While the economic rate of return is not very sensitive to energy
cost, capacity utilization rate and delay of operation start-up, it is most
sensitive to international polyolefin prices. In the Base Case analysis,
it is assumed that the demand and supply of LPDE, LLDPE, HDPE, and PP would
be in balance around 1990, when equilibrium prices of respective products
would start to prevail. The sensitivity test shows that if the balance of
demand and supply were achieved 5 years later, in 1995, the ERR would
decline from the Base Case value of 17.9% to 13.0%, which is still
adequate. The switching value analysis also indicates that even if the
current below-equilibrium prices of polyolefins in the range of
US$800-900/ton (para 2.17) were to prevail during the life of the Project,
the EER would still remain at about 10%. The ERR is estimated at 11.8% if
two events occur simultaneously, namely, the delayed materialization of
equilibrium prices of the polyolefins and the increase by 10% in energy
costs. The ERR will fall to 10.6% if, in addition, the capital cost were
to increase by 10%. Even if the combination of such unfavorable events
were to happen, the downside economic risk remains within a bearable range.
C.   Other Benefits and Sectoral Policy Contribution
11.06     Besides the general economic and social desirability of the
Project -- satisfactory utilization of indigenous feedstock resources,
energy conservation through substitution by polymers of more
energy-intensive and scarce traditional materials, high benefit/cost ratios
of plastics use in many applications, particularly in agriculture and
irrigation, -- the Project during its life will save foreign exchange in an
amount estimated at US$3.5 billion in 1984 dollars.
11.07     The local engineering firms involved in project implementation
will gain valuable know-how and experience through arrangements for
techno-logy transfer. Direct employment created by the Project will be
3,000 permanent jobs. At the peak of construction activities, the Project
will employ about 6,000 persons. Furthermore, the employment associated

the small- and medium-scale private conversion industry. The Project will
also have backward linkages with the domestic industry, as part of the
equipment for the Project is expected to be supplied. by local
manufacturers, thus creating additional employment a[nd investments.
Finally, the Project will lead to investments of abcut US$400 million, by
the private petrochemical producers in the Bombay area using excess
merchant ethylene from the Project and by the plastics conversion industry.
XII.  AGREEMENTS
12.01     The following assurances and agreements have been obtained from
GOI and IPCL during negotiations:
A.        From the Government that it will:
(a)  Establish, by April 1986, and thereafter maintain, a
training and technical assistance unit for the purpose of
disseminating information on technical developments, and
training and technical assistance to meet the needs of
skilled personnel in the plastics processing industry in
India (para 4.09);
(b)  carry out, by March 1986, a study of the future alternatives
for pricing, and trade policies for the Project products
under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. GOI will
accept Bank's views on the details during the study period.
The Government has confirmed its commitment to ensuring
that, prior to commissioning of the Project, the domestic
industry is efficient and competitive and to this end will
consider the study findings and implement appropriate
recommendations in an adequate time-frame (para 5.03);
(c)  give necessary clearances to permit IPCL to import LDPE,
LLDPE, HDPE and PP, commencing 1985/86 for quantities that
will be jointly reviewed and decided between GOT, IPCL and
the Bank, each year up to 1988-89 (para 5.05);
(d)  refrain from taking any action that would unduly inhibit the
plastics market from developing to a level consistent with

qualifications and experience of proposed nominees to
the positions of Executive Director (Project), General
Manager (Project) and Chief Financial Controller (Project)
(para 8.02);
(e) build and operate the Project in accordance with environ-
ment standards satisfactory to the Bank (para 8.06);

12.02     On the basis of the above assurances and agreements reached with
GOI and IPCL, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$300 million to
the OI at the Bank's standard terms, entailing a 20-year maturity
including 5 years of grace. The Government will onlend US$210 million out
of the loan proceeds to IPCL with an interest rate of not less than 13.25%
p.a. and a repayment period of 15 years, including 6 years of grace. For
amounts disbursed out of US$90 million for financing of imports of plastics
for market development, IPCL will pay in rupees to the GOI in the
equivalent amounts, immediately upon such disbursements. The signing of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOI and the IPCL under terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of Bank loan effective-
ness (para 9.05).

a/  Ethylene prices (for LDPE, HDPE, and LLDPE) assumed are US$550/ton for the West European, US, and Canadian
markets, and US$330/ton for the Middle East market.  Propylene price (for PP) is assumed to be 80% of
ethylene price.
b/  15 year straight line.
c/  LLDPE is assumed to require more marketing and R&D expenses owing to its mewness in the market.
d/  Return in total investment.  A higher ROI is assumed for LLDPE and PP because of market preference for
both products as well as the nature of new product introduction for LLDPE which requires a higher
rate than for the established products.
e/  Although the equilibirum price assumed for LLDPE is slightly higher than the estimated FOB export price,
the latter price will be actually higher than shown here as the capacity utilization will be less than
100%.

a/  Most recent forecast made by IPCL.  More details on this forecast can be found in reference E of the Project File.
b/ Demand forecast based on Bank consultant's review (Project File, Reference D).
c/  LLDPE is a new thermoplastic in India, to be produced by the Project.  IPCL's forecast is for equivalent amount of LDPE.
d/  Since no projections were made by IPCL for PS, the Bank's most likely scenario has been used.  This is considered conservative as the estimated demand for 1983/84 by IPCL is higher.
e/  There is a break in the demand build-up for LDPE in year 1989/90 because of the introduction of LLDPE from the Project.  LLDPE has better properties including higher strength and it can therefore be
downgauged significantly; for film applications, which account for about 70Z of the LDPE use in India, one ton of LDPE and LLOPE mix (0.8 ton of LDPE and 0.2 ton of LLOPE) is conservatively
equivalent to about 1.2 ton of LDPE, because of downgauging.
f/  IPCL's demand forecasts are only up to 1992/93.
/   The Bank's field review covers the period 1981/82 to 1989/90 and projections for 1995/96 assume the continuation of the growth rate projected for that period.  However, after commissioning of the
Project in 1988/89, average prices of plastics would drop as local production replaces penalized imports and also because the Project would be the most efficient plastics producing plant in IndIa; as
a result, demand is expected to grow faster than in the preceding period.

a/   LLUPE is a nev thermoplastic in India, to be pToduced by the Project beginning amd-1988.
h/   There is a break in the demand build up for LDPE in year 1988/89 because of the Introduction of LLDPE from the Project.  LLDPE has better properties including higher strength and it can therefore he
downgauged signiflcantly; for fils applications.,  hich account for about 702 of the LOPE use in India, one ton of LDPE and LLOPE mix (0.8 ton of LDPE and 0.2 ton of LLOPE) is conservatively
equivalent to about 1.2 tons of LDPE, because of doungauging.
c/   Based on a product mix of 70,000 tons of LLDPE and 65,000 tons of HDPE from the 135,000 tons LLDPE plant of the Project.

TECHNOLOGY SELECTION
1.        Bid invitation for the gas cracker was issued in September 1981
to 7 firms (two each from the US and FRG, and one each from the UK, France
and Japan). Five firms submitted initial proposals in November 1981 and
revised final offers in April 1982 following discussions on technical
matters with the Project Task Force (PTF). Price bids were opened in April
1982 and, following further discussions in May/June 1982, the PTF submited
its recommendations to the Government in mid-August 1982. Bid invitations
for ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol (EO/EG) technology were issued in
September 1981 to 4 firms (One each from Japan, the US; the UK and Italy).
Initial proposals were received from all four firms, out of which 2
licensors were shortlisted. One additional bidder from the US, who had
expressed his interest in submitting an offer, was invited to do so in
early June 1982, and price bids of the 3 bidders were opened in mid-June
1982. Further discussions on commercial and price bids were held in
June/July 1982, followed by plant visits in July. Recommendations were
submitted to GOI in August 1982. Bid invitations for polypropylene (PP)
technology and low density polyethylene/linear low density polyethylene
(LDPE/LLDPE) technologies were issued in November 1981 to 16 firms a/ and
14 firms D/, respectively. For LDPE/LLDPE, prospective bidders were given
the option of quoting for LDPE or LLDPE or both technologies. Six firms
submitted offers for PP, 6 for LDPE, 3 for LLDPE and I for both LDPE and
LLDPE. Considering the rapid developments in polymer technologies,
especially for LLDPE, a team drawn from the PTF, IP'CL, EIL, and National
Chemical Laboratory visited several petrochemical plants based on the
bidders' technologies, in April/May 1982, to verify the merits of
technologies offered and to obtain additional techno-commercial data. On
the basis of these plant visits and discussions wit'h bidders in April/May
1982, a short list for each technology was prepared and approved by GOI.
Price bids were opened in June 1982 followed by further discussions with
short-listed licensors in July/August 1982. Recommendations for polymer
plants technology selection were submitted to GOI in August 1982.
2.        Since the technology bids validities expired before the GOI's
basic investment approvals were given, the PTF asked the technology bidders
in March 1983 to update their bids, submitted again in two
parts--technocommerical and price parts. The bids iwere evaluated and final
recommendations for technologies were approved by GOI in early October
1984.

INDIA - MAHARASHTRA PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT
SAFETY MEASURES OF THE PROJECT
The aspects of prevention and management of safety hazards are
taken into account in design, construction and operations of the plants
through measures, the elements of which are summarized below.
Process Design Stage
- Analysis of potential safety risk factors inherent in the
process and technology;
- Evolution of plant design philosophy to eliminate or contain
risks which have a relatively higher probability of
occurrence;
- Ensure that the design philosophy is fully reflected in the
basic engineering of individual equipment, and component
systems through appropriate sizing, orientation, choice of
materials of construction, measurement and control systems,
back-up or fail-safe systems as required in the event of
abnormal situations, and emergency warning systems;
- Ensure that the design philosophy is fully reflected in
operations, and maintenance manuals to be used for personnel
training;
- Review of safety considerations included in the process design
and basic engineering among licensor, engineer, and owner to
ensure conformance to legislated or internationally recognized
standards governing work place, environment and worker safety.
Detailed Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Stages
- Selection and adoption of appropriate internationally
recognized engineering codes and standards for equipment and
materials and systems designs;
- Ensure that the layout of the physical facilities is in
conformance to local and internationally recognized standards
and codes for safe distances, as well as isolation and
containment of potentially hazardous areas;
- Inspection of equipment and materials dLuring fabrication by
authorized inspection agencies;

ANNEX 8-4
Page 2 of 2
- Prequalification of construction workmen engaged in critical
activities like welding, and periodic testing;
- Supervision of all construction works to ensure conformance to
construction standards, safe work practices, especially with
reference to technological requirements;
- Testing of installed systems to ensure mechanical integrity in
conformance to applicable codes and standards;
- Incorporation of appropriate systems communication within the
plants, and with authorities, medical facilities, and
communities outside the plant.
Operations Stage
- Training of operational, maintenance, and supervisory
personnel through the relevant manuals, operations simulators,
and seminars on safety risks, methods of prevention, and
management in the event of abnormal occurrences before
commencement of operations;
- Retraining of personnel periodically on safety risks, systems
provided, safe work and maintenance practices, and the do's
and dont's, at all times;
- Carry out a continuing safety awareness campaign in the work
place, through simple, prominent safety posters and slogans as
well as through non-material recognition of safety
achievements by workers;
- Institute systems for periodic medical checkup to detect and
treat occupational health impacts on plant personnel, as well
as on personnel in the communities nearby;
- Evolve, and institute systems for early warning and for
management of catastrophic occurrences, through evaluation and
treatment of affected personnel, in cooperation with civic,
and medical authorities in the surrounding community.

INDIA - MAHARASHTRA PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT
Assumptions Used in the Financial Analysis of the Project
1.        The financial projections of the Project, are provided in current
rupees, and are presented according to the fiscal year from April 1 - March
31. The financial rate of return assumes a project operating life of 15
years, and is calculated in constant 1984 rupees.   Domestic and
international inflation rates, both projected by the Bank at the same
level, are given below:
Domestic and International
Year                                      Inflation Rates
1984/85                                          3.5
1985/86                                          8.0
1986/87                                          9.0
1987/88                                          9.0
1988/89                                          9.0
1989/90                                          7.5
1990/91 and thereafter                           6.0
a. Financing Plan and Debt Service
2.        The financing plan of the Project is detailed in Chapter VIII of
the Report. The following assumptions have been used to compute the debt
service: (i) part of the Bank loan for the Project (US$210.0 million) will
be on-lent by the Government to IPCL at 13.25% per annum with a repayment
period of 15 years, including 6 years of grace; and (ii) the total
GOI/cofinancing loans of US$642 million will be lent through the GOI to
IPCL also at 13.25% per annum with a repayment period of 15 years,
including 6 years of grace.
b. Capacity Build-up
3.        It is assumed that the Project will start commercial production
in August 1989, 58 months after start-up of basic engineering for the gas
cracker.  The Project would reach 65% capacity utilization in the first
year of operation, 80% in the second year and 95% thereafter.
c.   Revenues
4.        Projected product prices, production volume, and revenues are
shown in Annex 9-2. All revenues are valued at ex-factory prices. As
explained in the main text of this Report (para 9.02 and 9.16), and
pending the review of the country's petrochemical pricing policy, it is
assumed that the Project ex-factory prices would be in line with the



- 76 -
ANNEX 10-1
Page 2 of 3
equilibrium prices, which is equivalent to 80% of the 1984 petrochemicals
ex-factory prices in India. The prices are escalated by the domestic
inflation rates. The ex-factory product prices in l992/93, the first year
of full operation, in 1984 rupees are summarized below:
Financial Product Prices in 1992/93
(in 1984 rupees/ton)
Product                              Price
Ethylene                              7,705
LDPE                                 12,236
LLDPEa/                             13,985
HDPE                                 13,815
EG                                   12,143
EO                                   15,079
PP-Homopolymer                      14,824
PP-Copolymer                        16,288
Acetylene Black                     26,798
a/  Price of LLDPE for financial analysis is assumed to be
the same as for HDPE because of its performance
properties which are superior t:o those of LDPE and
close to those of HDPE.
d.   Operating Costs and Working Capital
5.        Operating costs are calculated in 1984 priLces, then escalated by
the inflation rates. Where appropriate, they were also corrected by the
expected real-term increase in energy prices. The price of feedstock,
ethane/propane gases, at Rs 2,120/ton in 1984 prices, is equivalent to 65%
of naphtha price, in line with the Government's pricing policy for the gas
supplied by ONGC as petrochemical feedstock.  The price of lean gas or
methane for fuel is assumed to be 85% of ethane/propane price. LPG price
is derived from the prevailing market price, which was Rs 3,010/ton in
1984. The prices of other inputs, i.e., butene-1, vinyl acetate, catalysts
and chemicals were based on their cif prices, plus applicable import
duties. While the Project's depreciation has been calculated by the
12-year straight line method, the declining-balance depreciation method
with an average depreciation rate of 27% was used for computing taxable
income in accordance with the practice in India. Labor and supervision
costs, as well as taxes and insurance costs for the facilities are based on
data provided by the Project Task Force. Maintenance and repair costs are
assumed to be 3% of the total gross value of plants and equipment, civil
works and land, and 2% of the gross value of the township. Selling and
administrative costs, including transportation and wharehousing, have been



- -77 -                          ANNEX 10-1
Page 3 of 3
estimated at 4% of sales revenues. Working capital requirements are
calculated as follows:
Amounts Receivable:                     45 days of sales
Inventory Levels:
Raw Materials
Ethane/propane                      7 days
LPG                                 7 days
Methane                             7 days
Butene-I                           90 days
Vinyl Acetate                      90 days
Catalysts and Chemicals                 90 days
Work-in-Process                          10 days
Finished Products                       30 days
Operating Cash:                         60 days of wages and salaries
Accounts Payable:                       30 days of all variable production
costs except for ethane/propane (for
which no credit is available from
ONGC).
e.   Taxes and Dividends
6.        The Project will benefit from (i) the unabsorbed depreciation
carryover allowance (the loss in initial years being carried forward as tax
credit); (ii) the use of the declining balance depreciation method for
taxable income calculation (as taxable income and thus income tax will be
lower in initial than later years); and (iii) the investment credit (25% of
plant and machinery, civil works, and engineering costs) which is applied
after the unabsorbed depreciation carryover has been fully used. Income
tax rate is 57.75%.

INDIA - MAHARASHTRA PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT
Assumptions Used in the Economic Analysis of the Project
a. Capital Cost Estimates
1.        The economic capital cost of the Project is' derived from the
financial capital cost as follows:
In Constant 1984 Prices
(1) Local Currency Components
of Financial Capital Costs
Including Physical Contingencies          US$  676.3 million
(2)  Minus Duties and Taxes                         (-) 208.0
468.3
(3) Multiplied by a standard factor
of 0.8                                     (x)   0.8
374.6
(4) Plus Foreign Components of Financial
Capital Cost Including Physical
Contingencies                               (+) 337.8
712.4
(5) Plus Economic Capital Cost for
Gas Separation Facilities                   (+)  93.0
Economic Capital Cost      US$ 805.4 million
b. Working Capital
2.        The economic working capital requirements are based on the raw
materials and work-in-process inventories only. Finished products
inventory has been omitted, since in the case of import substitution, the
inventory of products produced by the Project substitutes for that of
imported products and does not increase the country's total inventory.
Accounts receivable and payable have also been omitted as they do not
represent costs incurred by the economy, but merely instruments of
"transfer of obligations."
c. Operating Costs
3.        Ethane/propane for feedstock, methane for fuel, and the
propane-rich refinery off-gases (equivalent to LPG inl contents) are costed
at their fuel oil equivalent value based on calorific value, as these gases
are not traded in the international market. The following is a summary of
the projected economic prices of fuel oil and gases:

Economic Prices

Average Annual
Growth Rates (x)
1984   1985   1990   1995   1985-90   1990-95
Fuel Oil (CIF, Bombay)        189    194    224    269        2.9       3.7
Ethane/Propane                213    219    253    303        2.9       3.7
Methane                       227    233    269    323        2.9       3.7
LPG                           210    216    249    299        2.9       3.7
Other raw materials, chemicals and catalysts are costed at cif prices.
Economic selling and administration costs are assumed to be 1% of sales
revenues. Economic fixed costs are calculated by subtracting taxes and
duties from the financial fixed costs.
d. Revenues
4.        Economic prices of ptoducts from the Project are based on:  (i)
the detailed analysis of the global demand and supply balance as well as
production economics of leading plants in the world, fot major products,
(LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE, and PP) as described in paras 2.15 - 2.19 of this
Report; and (ii) Bank estimates for EG, EO, and acetylene black. Since
ethylene is not generally traded in the international market, the economic
price of merchant ethylene from the Project is conservatively assumed to be
the production cost plus a reasonable return on investment at a
representative plant in Western Europe based on naphtha feedstock. The
merchant ethylene from the Project will be used by private petrochemical
producers in Bombay areas for expansion of existing plants. The economic
product prices used are presented on the following page.
