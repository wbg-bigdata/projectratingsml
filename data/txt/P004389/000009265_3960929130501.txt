MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FOR AN ORO SMALLHOLDER OIL rAIX DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for US$27 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
5 yearp' grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would
assist the Government of Papua New Guinea to increase PNG's agricultural
production and exports and to raise rural incomes and employment.
2.          Agicultre. Agriculture accounted for about 27 percent of GDP in
1991 and 71 percent of non-mineral exports (13 percent of total exports).
With about 85 percent of the population, encompassing the poorest segment of
society, depending on agriculture for their livelihood, and the limited
potential for mining to provide employment opportunities, most people will
remain dependent upon the sector well into the next century. During the
1980s, the sector grew by less than 2 percent per annum - below the population
growth rate - giving rise for great concern. The single most important cause
of agriculture's poor performance is the sharp decline in world market prices
for export crops, which has not been fully offset by the impact of economic
adjustments on the agricultural sector. Other key constraints are high costs
of production and low physical productivity of smallholders.
3.          Smallholders constitute 95 percent of the agricultural population
and account for virtually all the domestically produced food, which adequately
meets the needs of the majority of the population. Tree crops account for
almost all agricultural exports, the most important being coffee, palm oil,
cocoa, and coconut products, and will continue to be the primary source of
cash incomes for most of the rural population. Continued slow growth in
agriculture would seriously impact on the welfare and living standards of the
vast majority of the population. Effective policy action and investments
will, therefore, be required to revitalize the sector so that it is able to
provide broad-based income and employment and sustained development. Among
the tree crops, oil palm has grown most rapidly in recent years. Introduced
only 20 years ago, production grew rapidly under good prices and PNG's
favorable climate, estate yields being among the highest in the world. Price
declines since the mid-1980s have seriously eroded the profitability of the
industry. Nevertheless, for smallholders, although yields are lower than
those of estates, oil palm offers much higher income and returns to labor than
any other major crop in PNG.
4.          Goverment Strategy. The Government recognizes that restoring
profitability to the agriculture sector is an essential and pressing
development priority. At the macro level, the Government responded promptly
to the steep fall in the terms of trade, and the drop in export income caused
by closure of the large Bougainville copper mine and isolation of the North
Solomons province. Measures taken include a 10 percent devaluation in 1990,
exempting rural wage payments from minimum wage requirements, waiving export
taxes, and a moratorium on interest payments on existing agricultural loans.



Prices paid to tree crop smallholders have been maintained to some extent
through the operation of the well managed commodity price stabilization funds,
with the assistance of STABEB-backed loans to the funds, and through an
adjustment to the formula for sharing palm oil export income between
smallholders and estates. For the future, cost recovery targets for
Government investments are to be modified to ensure adequate returns to
farmers, and achieve recovery at levels comparable to other countries. The
Government has also taken measures to increase smallholder productivity by
creating autonomous corporations to provide more effective research and
extension services for the major tree crops.
5.          Lessons Learned. The Bank's experience worldwide indicates that
oil palm in a nucleus estate setting is well suited to smallholders, and if
the fruit is marketed througlh the nucleus estate, provides an ideal
opportunity for cost recovery. The Bank Group has supported three projects
for oil palm development in PNG: the New Britain Smallbolder Development
Project in 1969 (Credits 137 and 175-PNG), the Popondetta Smallbolder Oil Palm
Development Project in 1976 (Ln. 1333-PNG), and the Nucleus Estate and
Smallholder (Milne Bay) Project in 1985 (Ln. 2608-PNG). The three projects
have had a marked development impact on the regions where they are located.
An Impact Evaluation Report (No. 3070, 1980), and a Project Performance Audit
Report (No. 7001, 1987) considered the first two projects successful. The
ongoing Milne Bay Project has been successful in its physical oil palm and
infrastructure development, but with the depressed international prices, the
nucleus estate company is seeking a revision of its financial structure and
debts. PNG smallholders have demonstrated their competence with oil palm and
have received very good income and returns to labor while prices were high.
Until recently credit recovery has been excellent, and oil palm smallholders
contimue to enjoy better financial returns than other tree crop farmers during
the current time of low prices.
6.          Ongoing agricultural sector work, including a review of all Bank-
financed agricultural projects in PNG, provides additional major lessons: (a)
that maintaining an appropriate macro-economic policy environment and
incentives framework will be essential for the sustainable development of tree
crops and other tradeables; (b) that institutional (including land tenure),
infrastructure and human resource constraints are the three most critical
impediments to sector development; and (c) that ensuring entrepreneurial and
commercially oriented management would be fundamental to developing couuercial
production systems. These points are recognized in the Bank's strategy for
the agriculture sector. The design of the project has benefitted from these
lessons.
7.          Bank Strategy and Rationale for Involvement.  The Bank maintains a
close macro-economic dialogue with the Government. The recent Country
gconomic Report (PNG: Competitiveness, Growth and Structural Adjustment;
Report No. 10319-PNG, March 31, 1992) notes that the recent structural
adjustment program represents a substantial achievement given the magnitude of
the problem. The report warns, however, that overcoming the pervasive lack of
international competitiveness in the non-mining sectors will require concerted
policy actions. The Bank is (a) assisting the Government in formulating
meaaures to address sector constraints, through sector and economic work;



- 3 -
(b) providing funds to finance discrete investments in selected areas of
agriculture or related to agriculture; and (c) supporting conditions for long
term growth in the economy through balanced Interventions in other sectors,
particularly education, health and infrastructure. The proposed project fits
well with this strategy.
8.         Ptolect gblectives.  The projoet would increase PNG's agricultural
production and exports, provide employment opportunities, generate incomes for
poor farmers in Oro Province, and protect the habitat of the world's largest
butterfly, which is an endangered species.
9.           ggjQect DescrL2tion.  The proposed six-year project would be an
expansion of the ongoing Popondetta oil palm NES scheme, and include the
following components: (a) Smallholder Oil Palm Develonment: (i) planting
about 6,500 ha of oil palm in two areas of Oro Province, Popondetta and
Kokoda; (ii) strengthening extension services; and (iii) building and
maintaining agricultural roads (450 km) and social infrastructure; (b) Main
Road ImxgMRve=sen: upgrading and maintaining sections of the national road
from Popondetta to Xokoda (59 km); (c) nvirormental Protection: protecting
an endangered butterfly species and its associated ecosystem; (d)Ijsti = ional
Strengibanung: strengthening (i) the capacity of the Department of Agriculture
and Livestock (DAL) for policy formulation and project preparation in the tree
crop subsector; (ii) the management of the Oil Palm Industry Corporation
(OPIC); and (iii) oil palm research; (e) Technical Assistance to OPIC; and (f)
stiudies in the tree crop subsector. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$36.8 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$18.0 million (49%). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and -he
status of Bank Group operations in Papua New Guinea are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
8955-PNG dated Kay 7. 1992, is being distributed separately.
10.         Project Iplementation. OPIC would be responsible for implementing
smallholder oil palm development and overall project coordination, assisted by
national and provincial project coordination committees. The Government would
lend funds to smallholders through Higaturu Transport Pty Ltd (HTPL), the
state-owned company which is responsible for the purchase and transport of
smallholder crop, and which would administer smallholder loan accounts on
behalf of the Government. The Departments of Environment and Conservation,
and of Works would be responsible for environmental protection and
infrastructure, respectively. Higaturu Oil Palms Pty Ltd (HOPPL), the nucleus
estate company, would be responsible for producing planting materials,
processing smallholder crop, and marketing oil palm products; and the Papua
New Guinea Oil Pals Research Association (PNGOPRA) would be responsible for
oil palm research.
11.         Prolect Sustainability.  From the experience in PNG, an assessment
of the institutional needs of the tree crop sub-sector, and taking into
account the effects of the current recession in agriculture, the following
points have been incorporated in the design of the proposed project to ensure
its sustainability: (a) continued strong extension for the new project



- 4 -
participants and the Popondetts mature phase smallholders, to ensure that
satisfactory yields are achieved and maintained; (b) provision of credit
accompanied by grant support for the poor farmer target group; and (c)
s;rengthening of institutional capacity for sub-sector planning and
m.magement,
12.         Agreed Actions.  buring negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Government regarding: (1) the monitoring by DAL of the application of
the smallholder oil Vali pricing formula; (ii) the upgrading of HOPPL's
effluent treatment facilities and solid waste disposal; and (iii) the staffing
of key project management positions in OPIC and for butterfly conservation.
gnQitioi7 of loan effectiveness would be: (i) the signature of the Financial
Managemeni Agreement between the Government and HTPL, satisfactory to the
Bank, regarding smallbolder credit arrangements; (ii) the signature of the
Subsidiary Agreement between the Government and OPIC, satisfactory to the
Bank, regarding OPIC's funding; (iii) the appointment of OPIC's General
Secretary, Project Accountant and Field Project Manager; and (iv) the
establishment of the National Oro Project Management Committee and the
Provincial Oro Project Coordination Committee. Conditions of loan
disbursement would be: (i) for the butterfly conservation component, that the
Department of Environment and Conservation has employed a conservation project
manager and a principal research officer; and (ii) for the research support
component, (a) pignature of the Subsidiary Agreement, satisfactory to the
Bank, between Government and PNGOPRA; and (b) that HOPPL is current with
payments of research cesses to PNGOPRA.
13.         EnvirXnmental  Asgec&s.  The proposed project is expected to have
an overall positive environmental impact. Water pollution levels would be
reduced in the densely populated area around Popondetta through the upgrading
of the effluent treatment plant of the HOPPL palm oil factory. The
endangered, Queen Alexandra Birdwing butterfly would be protected from
possible extinction through the promotion of conservation areas. Tree cover
would be provided through the establishment of oil palm over large, degraded
grassland areas, formerly covered with forest, and would prevent burning,
restore soil fertility and control erosion. The clearing of degraded bushland
and secondary forest would be done using chain saws to minimize soil
disturbance and prevent soil erosion. Finally, herbicides would be used in
small quantities in the grassland areas by trained personnel and would have no
significant adverse environmental effects.
14.         PoyerJt Alleviation.  The proposed project would directly benefit
about 3,250 poor smallholder families.
15.         Role of Wmen.  Women are involved in oil palm cultivation as an
integral part of the family unit, and are responsible for food crop production
in Oro Province. gomen in the project area generally have some control on how
the family income is spent, and therefore would benefit from the increased
family income brought by additional oil palm. After consultations with women
in the project area during preparation, specific provisions were made under
the project for: (i) ensuring that land would remain available and readily
accessible for food production; (ii) improved rural health and education



facliLtles; and (liL) under the conservation program, staff and facilities to
identify and develop further economic opportunities for women.
16.         Prgjst Benefita.  The proposed project would benefit about 3,250
smallholier families. Economic benefits would be derived from increased
agricultural production and exports of about 30,000 tons of palm oil and
kernels. Environmentai benefits are expected under the Project from the
protection of the world's largest b-itterfly species and its habitat, upgrading
effluent treatment, and the rehabilitation of degraded grassland areas. The
economic rate of return is estimated to be 12% on 76% of total project costs.
17.         Ri8ka. The proposed project has been designed to build on
*        existing infrastructure and services and no special agricultural risks have
been identified. Effluent treatment would use an established technology and
would be regularly monitored by the Department of Environment and
Conservation. The primary financial risk is that declines in international
coumodicy prices below projected levels would result in poor financial returns
to smallholders, inhibiting harvesting, and to the estate compary,
jeoDardizing its ability to process the crop profitably. Related to the
financial risk, is possible slippage of offsetting macro policy
implementation. Such slippage is a significant possibility as regards wage
policy and competitiveness, especially during the coming years of rapid
development of the country's mineral wealth. However, PNG has asseibled a
solid track record of macroeconomic stability since Independence, reinforced
by its adjustment performance since 1989. Other potential risks would be:
(a) poor field maintenance, low yields and even abandonment by the non-
traditional oil palm farmers. This risk would be minimized by selection of
village farmers, technical assistance and supervision by an oil palm extension
team supported under the project; (b) the farmers would continue to practice
shifting cultivation on forest land identified as important for the
conservation of the endangered species of butterfly and its associated
ecosystem. This would be addressed by promoting permanent conservation areas
that would remain under traditional land ownership, but be subject to a ban on
forest clearance; and (c) project implementation may suffer from political
difficulties and civil unrest, which affect various regions of the country
from time to time. This risk would be mitigated by having the provincial
authorities represented on the project's Provincial Coordination Committee,
and by the inclusion of a significant social infrastructure component,
designed after consultations with the farme;s during project preparation.
18.         &Uommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
