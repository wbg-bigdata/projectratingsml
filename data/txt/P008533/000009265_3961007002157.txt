MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE P
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTIUCTION AND DNVELO                      T
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LATVIA
FOR THE LIEPAJA ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Latvia for the equivalent of US $4.00 million to help finan  a project for the
environment. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen
years, Including five years of gce.
2.         This proposed project would be financed in association with a loan of US $2.00 million
equivalent by the Nordic Evironmn  Finance Corporation (NEFCO) and grant financing by the
Governments of Sweden and Finland of a total amount of US $8.50 million equivalent. Additional grant
financing would be provided by other donors for a total amount of US $1.42 million equivalent. The
Govemment contribution would be US $3.50 mllion equivalent and ta of the Municipality of Liepaja
US $1.75 million equivalent.
3.        Co-unSc  Bakod. Latvia is a country covering 65,600 km2 with a population of
2.6 million people located on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea. During the Soviet period, Latvia had a
strong economy based on specialized industries and agricuture which was filly integrated ito the larger
Soviet system. Since the restoration of LiaIn independence in 1991, the country has undertaken a major
program of political and economic reforms, which has brought it from a centally planned economy to
a  sitional market economy. In this process, it has eqperienced adjustment shocks common to many
economies in transition, characterized by a significant decline in economic productivity and high inflation
rates, with the gross domestic product (GDP) declining sharply as a result of the collapse of trng
relations with Russia and other former Soviet Repubics.
4.         The Govemment of Latvia (GOL) has been purug economic reform and stabilization,
including price and trade liberalization. A formal macroeconomic program was launched in July 1992,
supported by an Intemational Monetary Fund stanby arrangement. Since then, LIvia has been successful
in containing monetary expansion and fiscal deficits. It also has successfilly introduced its new currency,
the Lats, in 1993. Inflation has been reduced from an amnu  rate of over 1,000 percent in 1992 to an
expected rate of about 30 percent in 1994. The esfimated per capita income level was US $2,030 in 1993.
The Latvian economy is expected to recover from its current economic recession with a GDP growth rate
of about 4 percent per year between 1995 and 1997 and 5 percent per year thereafter.
5.         The Bank's overall strategy in Latvia is to support the country's efforts to accelerate
strutumral reforms leading to a filly transition to a market-based economy and, at the same tine, to
support efficient investments in bigh priority sectors to facilitate return to economic growth. To date the
Bank has provided the GOL witI a Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3525-LV) of US $45 million in October
1992, which is being successfully implemented, and an Agricultural Development Loan (No. 3645-LV)
of US $25 million in January 1994.
6.        Infrstructure rehabilitation and development is considered one of the Bank's priorities in
Latvia. The recently completed Public Expeditu  Review, joindy prepared by the GOL and the Bank,
highlighted the need to support priority inve s in energy, transport and enviromental services,
including improved water supply and wastewater teatment. The priority given to investments for
environmental services was justified by the need to Improve the quality and reliability of drinking water



-2--
and to addess the water quality problems and health risks created by the discharge of partialy treated
and untreated wastewater to water courses and the marine environment. The proposed Project would
supportthe improvement of water and wastewater services in the important port city of Liepaja and
demonstrate the application of a variety of management methods to support envirownentally sound
development in the coastal area surrounding Liepaja.
7.         The Baltic coast of Latvia is characteized by a smooth coastline of almost 500 km,
dominated by beabhes and backed by sand dum, sandstone cliffs, forests and coastal wetlands. There
are two coastal cities, Ventspils to the north (49,000 inhabitants), a major transshipment port for
hydrocarbon and cheical exports from Russia, and Liepaja to the south (105,000 inhabitants). Liepaja
together with its surrounding area was a closed high security zone during the Soviet period. It is the site
of a former Soviet naval base, a commercial port, fishing barbor and a mix of industries. The city is
surrounded by recreational beaches and large undeveloped areas of high ecological value. About forty
percent of Liepaja's wastewater is discharged into the Baltic Sea directly or through Lake Liepaja and
the City Channel without treatment; another forty percent is biologically treated and the remaining twenty
percent receives mechanical treatment only. These wastewater discharges contribute to the pollution of
northern Lake Liepaja, Liepaja port and the Baltic Sea and significantly endanger the sustainable use of
the existing local enviromnental resources in Liepaja and its adjacent areas.
8.         In response to increasing concern for the enviromnent in and around the Baltic Sea, a
regional progam, the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme, was adopted
at a Diplomatic Conference of Ministers of Environment in April 1992. The objective of the Programme
is to restore the ecological balance of the Baltic Sea. In the context of the Helsinki Convention on
Evomental Protection of the Baltic Sea, which Latvia has signed and ratified, the Programme has
identified a number of pollution "hot-spots' around the Baltic Sea, including Liepaja.
9.         The proposed Project would be the first internationally supported investment project for
improvement of envirnmel quality undertaken by the GOL. This Project is considered the highest
priority in terms of domestic environmental investments by the GOL and in the context of Latvian legal
obligations to protect the Baltic Sea. It supports the GOL"s objectives: to promote the decentraliztion
of responsibility for environmental services to municipal governments; to reduce the state's role in the
economy by strengthe  local authorities; and to restructure and modernize the water and wastewater
sector.
10.       Lessons Leaned from Previous Bank Operations. This would be the first enviromnental
project supported by the Bank in the country. The Project would reflect previous Bank water and
wastewater sector experience, in paricular: (a) the need to develop managerially and financially
autonomous and decentralized water and wastewater utilities; and (b) the benefits of taking an integmted
approach to addressing improvement in water and wastewater services. Given previous regional
experience with enviromental projects, especially in Poland, project implementation would include the
participation of a prcment specialist to evaluate procurement issues and train Borrower personnel.
11.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The support of the Bank for the proposed Project would
provide an opportunity to support Latvian efforts to improve national enviromnental quality and to protect
the Baltic Sea, consistent with the Helsinki Convention. In the absence of Bank involvement, it is most
unlilely that the country would be able to mobilize the technical assistance and financial resources
required to implement an environmental managemet project for this environmentaHy and economically
important area of the country. In addition, the Project would provide a mechanism for the Bank to test



-3-
-the feasibility of the rapid preparation and implem on of small projects for priority environment
investment activities in the former Soviet Union. It would also provide impornt design lesons for the
inegration of complementay natural resources man ement components into water and wastewater
improvement projects and would serve as a demostration project for similar initiatives in other areas in
Latvia and other Baltic cuni. This Project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as
discussed by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the Latvia Enterpdse Finance Sector
Project (R94-181) on September 20, 1994.
12.          0i  O. The Project's main objectives are: (a) to reduce discharge of partially
treated and untreated wastewater to the Baltic Sea; (b) to restore and enhance the water quality in Liepaja,
the City Channel, the northern porion of Lake Liepaja and adjacentrecreational beaches on the Baltic
Sea; (c) to improve water supply and sanitation services in Liepaja, (d) to improve the operational
efficiency and mnawgement systems of the Liepaja Water and Wastewater Enterprise (LWWE); and (e)
to promote environmnlly sustnable management and development of the coastal zone and protected
areas in and around Liepaja and in the Ventspils and Talsi Districts, including management of tourism
development.
13.        Project Description. The Project would be implemented over five years as an environmental
management project for the Baltic coast of Latvia. It would consist of a Water and Wastewater
Imrovement Component (WWIC) and an Environmea Management Component (EMC). The WWIC
consists of: (a) rehabilitation and expansion of the Liepaja water and wastewater system, including
equipment and works, along with  gineerig services; and (b) training and other institutional
strengthenng (e.g., twinning arnge       to assist in establishing an autonomous and financially
independet water and wastewater utility in Liepaja. This would include assistance for tariff
rstructurgtariff planning and financial operations. The EMC would consist of: (a) technical and
fndancial support for the development and implementation of a comprehensive management plan for
adjacent coastal and protected areas; (b) support for the implementation of selected elements of the
management plan by coordinating and providing funding for identified investmn such as access roads,
parking lots, saniay facilities, information boards, observation towers, etc.; and (c) support in the
development of recreational and nature-based tourism in the Liepaja, Ventspils and Talsi regions. The
Project includes an advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF).
14.        ProJect lWnplementation. The proposed Project would be implemented under the general
supervision of the Ministry of Environment and Regional Development (MOE). A Project Steerig
Committee, chired by the MOE, would be established to provide overall guidance for the proposed
Project and to facilitate national and local government coordination issues. Management of the proposed
Project would be the responsibility of a Project Coordinator from the MOE Projects Department who
would be appointed by the Minister. The implemention of the WWIC of the Project would be delegated
to the LWWE. To implement this compont, a Project Imlementation Unit (PMI) would be established
within the LWWE. The EMC would be undertaken by a diversity of specialists from the Ministry of
Environmen, concerned local governmts and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Project
implemenation would receive freqen suervision, includig support by Bank staff from the Regional
Office for the Baltic Countries in Riga.
15.        Projet Financine. The project cost is estimated at US $21.17 million wuivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US $14.22 million equivalent (68%), excluding taxes and duties estimated
at about 0.5-1.0%. The Bank would finance US $4.0 million equivalent (23% of the foreign excange
and 19% of the total). Parallel grant cofinancing by the Govrmen  of Sweden (US $6.5 miflion



-4-
equivalent) and Finlnd (US $2.0 million equivalen) Sn the European Union (US $120,000 equivatent)
comprses about 44% of the WWCI. The EMC would be financed mainly through grans, the IBRD loan
financing US $200, of the component. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. An advance of US $300,000 fhom the PPF would be used to support establishment of the
PIU, prepare bidding documents and conduct a tariff study. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key ptoject
processing eves and the 8stat  of Bank Group operations in Latvia are given in Schedules C and D,
espectively. A map is also attached (No. 26165). The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13429-LV, dated
October 24, 1994, is being distributed separately.
16.    -                . Prior to negotations, the following conditions were fulfilled: (a) the MOE,
MOL and LWWE had nominaed personnel for carrying out both conponents of the Project; and
(b) Action Plans to be included in an implemention schedule with performance indicators were prepared
for both components. During negotiations it was agreed with the Borrower and the LWWE that the water
and sewerage tariffs would be adjusted and maintained at an level, acceptable to the Bank. Conditions
for effeciveness of the proposed loan include: (a) submission of satisfactory evidence tha all conditions
precedet to effectiveness of the loan from NEFCO and grants from cofinancers have been fulfilled; (b)
execution of subsidiay loan agreements between the GOL and the project agency; and (c) appointment
of staff for the P1U and staff for the implementation of the EMC.
17.          vionental Asects. Implementtion of the proposed Project would have positive
environmenal benefits through: (a) reduced pollution of the Baltic Sea, the City Chanmel, the northem
portion of Lake Liepaja and adjacent beaches; (b) amelioration of water quality and supply in the town
of Liepaja; and (c) protection of the coast  and protected areas through effective management. The
proposed Project has been placed in environmental screening category "B". An environmental review
has been prepared for the WVWIC consistent with the provisions of the World Bak's Operational
Direcdve 4.01, "bnvironmental Assessment" and the applicable env l procedu   of the GOL.
Supplemental environmeal reviews would be prepared as part of the detailed plnning process for
activities supported under the EMC.
18.        Participatorv AXroach. The preparation of the water and wastewater component of the
proposed Project has been carried out In close cooperation with the MOE, the MOL and LWWE. The
work of the consultants was supervised by a steering group which included repretives of Latvian
authorities, the Swedish Ministry of Environment and the Bank. This process included regular
consultation with represenives of the locally elected City Council. The Bank has cooperated with the
MOE in preparion of draft terms of reference for Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Eco-
Tourism Development Plamnig activities. WWF, with input from the MOE, local authorities, local
nongovernmental organizations and the Bank, has prepared draft tums of reference for demonstration
activities at LAke Pape and Jurkalne. The World Bank is also working with-the local office of the WWF
in the preparation of a case study for Lake Pape as part of its analysis of the economics of protected
areas.
19.           P       .  The benefits of the WWIC would be derived from: (a) improved water
quality thrwough reduction of leakage of wastewater into the groundwater and reductions in discarges of
untreated and partally treated wastewater, thereby mprovg the status of the City Channel, Lake Liepaja
and tile Baltic Sea; (b) reductions in operating costs and  antenanc  reqirements in the water and
wastewater systems; and (c) improvement In the quality and reliability of the services Stough
estabishent of an autonomous water and wastewater utility. The benefits of the EMC would be derived



- 5 -
from: (a) environmentally souid developmnent of coastal and recreational areas in the Liepaja, Ventpils
and Talsi regions, (b) enhanced management and improved public access for protected areas; and (c)
demonstration of planning and implementation methods for regional coastal zone and tourism development
programs.
20.                           Important elments in assurWg sustainabiaity of the WWIC of the
Project include: (a) tinely implementation by LWWE of the agreed implementation program to promote
the establishment of an autonomous and efficient utility; and (b) development and maintenance of a
realistic tariff structure for municipal and industrial users of the water and wastewater system. The
sustainability of the EMC will be determined by: (a) the level of coordination between the MOE, district
and parish governments and WWF; (b) the level of local -participation in design and implenentation of
activities; and (c) the development of a solid implementation structure for long-term management and
development of the coastal zone and protected areas.
21.        Risks. The main risks are: (a) the political commitment of the Liepaja City Council to
support an independently managed water and wastewater utility; (b) political or macroeconomic factors
which may interfere with the commitment of the Liepaja City Council to raise tariffs sufficiently to
adequately fund the costs of the utility, including the repayment of the Bank and NEFCO loans; (c) a
longer implementation period due to limited implementation capacity; (d) continued difficulties in the
effective collection of water bills; and (e) possible resistance from local governments and private
landowners to land use controls recommended under coastal zone, protected areas and tourism
management plans. These risks would be red iced by: (a) implementation of a time-bound schedule for
corporatization of the LWWE; (b) carefully monitoring the requirements for tariff increases and providing
significant institutional development support to the utility to improve its financial management, billing
and collection practices; (c) ensuring appropriate project management arrangements are in place in a
tmely manner; (d) providing procurement assistance; and (e) incorporating an active local participation
process into the development and implementation of the proposed land use management systems.
22.        RemaIon. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and reconmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
