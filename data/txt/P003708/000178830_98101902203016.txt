INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPYRNT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
PROPOSING AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT TO INDONESIA
FOR THE PUSRI FERTILIZER 3XPANSION PROJECT
(CREDIT NO. 193-IND, DATED JUNE 1521970)
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation proposing an
increase in the IDA credit to Indonesia for the PUSRI Fertilizer Prcject
from   $30 million to $35.0 million to help finance cost increases due
to currency realignments. There would be no change in thie repayment
period.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.      The latest Bank report on the Indonesian economy, Development
Issues for Indonesia (dated Decem*ber 1, 1972; R73-6/1) dealt principally
with longer-term issues but also contained a discussion of recent
economic developments. Supplementary economic information is contained
in the most recent President's Report (dated January 22, 1973; IDA/R73-3).
Country Data are given in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
3.      Bank Group operations are also discussed in the President's Report
referred to under (2) above. An updated summary statement of IDA credits
and IFC investments is given in Annex II.
PART III - THE PROJECT
4.      In June 1970 the Association made a credit (No.193-IND) of $30
million to Indonesia to help finance the foreign exchange cost of the
PUSRI Fertilizer Project. This credit constitutes part of a joint
financing operation, in which the Asian Development Bank (ADB, $10 million),
the United States Agency for International Development (AID, $20 million)
and the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF, Yen 2880 million,
equivalent to $8 million at the then prevailing rate of 3S60 to the dollar)
participated in financing the estimated foreign exchange cost of $68 million.
The project consists of a urea fertilizer plant with an annual capacity of
380,000 metric tons, and a gas conservation and transmission system to supply
natural gas from the gas fields of P.N. Pertambangan Minjak Dan Gas Bumi
Nasional(Pertamina)at Prabhamulih to the fertilizer plant as fuel and feed
stock, and to Pertamina's refinery at Pladju as fuel to replace fuel oil
hitherto used. The fertilizer plant is to be constructed, owned and operated
by PT Pupuk Sriwijaya (PUSRI), a government-owned limited liability company
established under the commercial code and operating successfully a



100,000 tons a year urea plant. The gas conservation and transmission
system is to be owned and operated by Pertamina (the National Oil and
Gas Company). The Credit became effective on January 15, 1971. A full
description of the project and its importance to the Indonesian econony
were given in the President's Report and Recommendation for the PUSRI
Fertilizer Expansion Project (P-803 dated April 30, 1970; DA/R70-21).
An updated credit and project sumrary is attached as Annex III; a copy
of Part III - The Project - of the original President's Report is
contained in Annex IV.
5.      After a 7 ate start, the fertilizer part of the project is now
making good progress, and mechanical completion is expected in June
1974, two months ahead of the revised construction schedule agreed
upon in 1972. The gas system, partly on account of its redesign (para-
graph 7 and Annex V) has also experienced delay in execution. However,
the contracts for the compressor and for pipe, both critical for timely
completion, have been placed, bids for the construction contract have
been evaluated and the first gas is now expected to be available in
February 1974., when needed ty the fertilizer plant for testing. $5.8
million of the Credit were clisbursed as of March 31, 1973.
6.      The total project cost is now estimnted at $113.3 million
eouivalent, up $22.5 million froom the original estimate, as shown below:

h'it not shown separately.



7.      The cost increase, the causes for which are described in more
detail in Annex V, iS due in roughly equal parts to currency realignme:ats
and to a redesign of the gas system to take account of the findings of
a review of Pertamina's gas reserves and the specific design finally
determined for the PUSRI plant. With increased pipeline and compressor
capacity, gas system capacity will be more than doubled and the average
gas price to PUSRI reduced from US cents 19 to US cents 17.2 per million
BTU.
8.      The Government will finance the additional local currency
requirements of $2 million equivalent for the fertilizer plant and
$0.3 million equivalent for the gas element of the project. It has, however,
approached the original lenders for supplementary finance to help cover
the $20.2 million additional foreign exchange requirement. Part of this
financial gap is covered by an increase of $3 million in the dollar
equivalent of the Japanese credit. In addition AID has agreed to provide
a supplementary loan of $4 million for the fertilizer plant, and negotiations
have reached an advanced stage between the Government of indonesia and
Japan for a further loan of $h.5 million equivalent on concessional terma
for the gas element of the project. The Asian Development Bank will not make a
further contribution since its concessionary funds are fully comitted. A
shortfall in foreign exchange financing of $8.7 million thus still remains.
9.      In these circumstances I consider it appropriate for IDA to make
additional financing available for the project by contributing, in thce same
proportion as its original share, to that part of the increase in foreign.
exchange costs of the project that is attributable to the currency realign-
ments in 1971 and February 1973. IDA's share in the original financing (44
percent), if applied to the cost overrun attributable to the currency
realignments ($11 million), is equivalent to about $5 ai.llion. With s3pple-
mentary financing of this amount, IDA's share in the external financirig of
the revised project would be slightly less than 40 percent. The Govenament of
Indonesia will provide the balance of $3.7 million foreign exchange required.

10.     Despite an increase in capital cost the project has become more
remunerative. This is due mainly to two reasons. The market grew faster
than anticipated in the appraisal report so that the full output of the
plant can be sold as it becomes available. The appraisal report also
assumed a long range downward trend in the price of urea; recent price
developments and long-term forecasts    for urea suggest  substantially
higher price levels. In calculating the economic rate of return capital
and operating costs of the gas system have been taken into account only to the
extent that they can be attributed to PUSRI's gas consumption. The
economic rate of return on the part of the gas system attributable to other
consumers has, in the absence of data,been disregarded but is bound to be
quite satisfactory,given the international market value of the oil replaced
by gas in the two refineries and two power plants relative to the economic
cost of gas.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
11.     The draft Amending Development Credit Agreement between Indonesia
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed increase in the amount of the credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
12.     I am satisfied that the increase in the amount of the credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PA;ST V - RECOMMENDATION
13.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
amendment to Development Credit No. 193-IND.

C.          PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Or. No. 127 Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$5.0 Million Credit of September 6,
1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
This US$5, -7 million credit was the first for irrigation rehabilitation
in Indonesia. It cov2is 201,000 haa. The project includes the supply of earth-
moving equipment and machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on
three irrigation systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South
Sumatra). Provision of consultant services is also included. All the equipment
supplieC. under the Credit is being well utilized and disbursements are 98 percent
of appraisal timetable. The bulk of the cost of the project is being borne by
GOI. Final completion of the project is expected to be delayed by about two years
in order to complete much needed drainage work, which was not included in the
original schedule. The economic rate of return (ERR), which was calculated as
50 percent at appraisal, has been re-worked to allow for actual schedule and costs;
it i5 25 percent.
Cr. No. 135 Technic,,! Assistance; US$2.0 Million Credit of December 27, 1968,
Closing Sates  January 31, 197l.
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing
satisfactorily and the credit is nearly fully committed. In order to complete
disbursements for ongoing studies; we have recently agreed to postpone tihe closing
date    for one year, to January 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 154 Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1973.
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and a specific
highway rehabilitation program. Initial delays in project execution arose from
the unfamiliarity o.f the Indonesian officials with Bank procurement procedures
and adrmnistrative i-nmJ.i.'f7iciencies in disbursement of local funds.  The project
is now progressing sat`sfactorily.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates US$a6 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
ClosiDg Date: June 30, 19T7h .
This project is about one year behind its original schedule due to
delay 7'- appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors. The project
also sulfers from weak management and inadequate Government control of the estates
involved. The Government is reviewing the findings of a. management survey report
(financed under Credit No. 216) covering all Goverrment agricultural estates,
and as a first step, is introducing improved systems of management control and
cost accounting on t3ie estates. The Government is discussing with the Association
further steps necess.-yj to improve the management of the estates.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.



ANNEX II,

Cr. No. 165 Electricity Distribution; US$15 Million Credit of October 29, '969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 194 Agricultural Estates II; US$17 Million Credit of June 15, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Comments on the progress of this project are the same as Credit No. 155
above. The managerial problems are, however, not so acute.
Cr. No. 195 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; Us$18.5 Million Credit of June 15, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976.
This US$18.5 credit is the second irrigation rehabilitation project
in Indonesia. It includes rehabilitation and drainage works over 186,000 ha. It
provides consultant services both for its execution and for a future extension.
After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of tender documents and
difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is now proceeding somewhat better.
Although problems of quality and progress still exist, if good contractors b-ld
and win the awards on the last two (and biggest) contracts foeL which bids will be
opened in April 1973, the project could still be completed on schedule. There
are no serious cost overruns in the overall project. Disbursements are picking
up, but are still slow, being only 43 percent of the appraisal timetable at
December 31, 1972.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications Expansion; US$12.8 Million Credit of July 13,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project is
now progressing satisfactorily. Orders for all equipment, except the tropospheric
scatter system, have been placed. The management consultants retained to study
the telecommunications authority and recommend remedial measures have completed
their work and have also been retained to implement the recommendations.
Cr. No. 211 Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
This project is about 18 months behind the original implementation
schedule and disbursements are low. The principal cause for the delay has
been the unsatisfactory management and engineering assistance. Arrangements
with new engineering consultants have been concluded and proposals for improved
management assistance to the project are being considered by the Government.
Prospects for successful project implementation remain good.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II; US$4.0 Million Credit of September 15,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.



ANNEX II
Page h of 6 pages
Cr. No. 219  Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project fell a year behind schedule due to
dedays in the Government's evaluation of consultants and to uncertainties regarding
the liability of foreign contractors and consultants for Indonesian income tax.
A contract with consultants was signed in June 1972, and the project is now
progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation III; US$14.5 Million Credit of November 6,
1970- CiVsing Date:  December 31, 1975,.
This UT";; 2.45 million credit is the third irrigation rehabilitation
project in Indones-ia.  It covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
re-introduction of an O&M organization in three irrigation systems, two in Java
and one in South Sulawesi. Provision is made for equipment for both construction
and O&M and for consultants and management assistance. Construction is presently
behind schedule due to problems with preparation of contract documents, to a
slow start in civil works contracts and the over-extension of the few experienced
local contractors due to the large volume of construction work in Indonesia.
Some improvements in the rate of execution are expected but it is still estimated
that the project's completion date will be between twc and three years behind
that anticipated at appraisal.  Overall project cost estimates have increased
by 15 percent. GOT has made arrangements to meet this cost overrun. Disburse-
ments are 50 pere:lt below the level estimated at appraisal, but are now picking up.
Sensitivity test ru:c. at the tine of appraisal showed that with a two-year delay
in the project and a 15 percent overall cost overrum the economic rate of return
(ERR) would drop from 25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No, 2h6 Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30 T    .
Progress of this project has been hampered by delays in the provision
of funds by the Government and by slow procurement of equipment. Remedial action
has been taken by the Government, and the project is now expected to progress
satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 259  Tea. _Utl5.0 Million Credit of June 2h, 1.971; Closing Date:
1975.
This project is progressing satisfactorily-, though overall strergthening
of estate management is required for the reasons set cut under Credit 194 above.
Cr. No. 260 Highwas II; US$34.0 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Closing Date:

rehabilitation in West Java, surface water storage on the Cimanuk River (to benefit
Rentang irrigation system being rehabilitated under Cr. 127-IND), and ground water
investigations in Madiun-Solo valleys in East Java. The consultants for the

Cost Overrun and its
Financing:                 Total project cost has increased by US$22.5 million
of which US$20.2 million is in foreign exchange.    The
Government would finance the cost overrun in local
currency as well as $3.7 million in foreign exchange.
In addition to the proposed increase of the IDA Credit
by US$5.0 million, (i) US$3.0 million is covered by the
increase in the dollar equivalent of the original
Japanese loan, (ii) AID has agreed to provide uS$4h.0
million in supplementary financing and (iii) negotiations
are in an advanced stage between Indonesia and Japan
about a second credit equivalent to about US$4.5 million.

Arrangements:              Goods and services required for the Project have
so far been procured through international compe-
titive bidding with the exception of the services
of a general contractor and the urea unit sub-
constractors which have been allocated to USAID
and OECF financing, respectively.   Procurement under
the supplementary AID loan of $4.0 million would be
tied.   Procurement financed from the IDA Credit
would continue to be under international competitive
bidding.   The normal margin of preference would be
accorded to local manufacturers.

Part III - The Project contained in the Presi,Jent's Report No. P-803
dated April 304 1970, is reproduced below.
A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of the PUSRI Fertilizer Plant Expansion
aas Conservation and Transmission Project - Indonesia" (PI-3a), dated April 20,
1970. Since the completion of the Appraisal Report, which was prepared
jointly with the ADB, the Government of Indonesia adopted an exchange reformr
oDn April 17 under which the two former exchange rates, the BE rate (Rp 326
to US$1) and the DP rate (ranging between Rp 375 and Rp 382 to US$1) were
merged into one, at Rp 378 per US$1. As explained in more detail in a speci-.
note to the Appraisal Report, it is not expected that this change in the ex-
change rate will substantially affect either the financial or the economiz
rates of return of the project.
PUSRI s existing plant is now the only manufactu-;r of nitrogenouls
fertilizer in Indonesia.  It was originally established in 1359 and began cot:--
riercial operation in 1964. Apart from some start-up help, PUSRI has been
operated since l965 largely without outside assistance in an efficient and
productive manner. The plant is, however, small by present day standards,
capable of a production of 100,000 metric tons of urea per annum. It also
uses outdated design concepts, and is therefore a high cost producer comp'--d
to large modern plants. Large quantities of fertilizer are being irMort.td
to make up for deficicncies sj -s5;ply. ; Lrlother smnill nitrogenr- .>tilizer
l!ant fs expected to begin production later in 1970; further, if g?. i'o--
serves prove sufficient and maricet conditions warrant, and subject to priur
consultation by the Indonesian Government with the PUSRI lenders, a plant
comparable in size to that presently boing proposed may be built later at
Tjirebon in West Java.
The project consists of two major parts.
PART I comprises the detailed engineering, construction and start-up
of a fertilizer plant at Palembang (Sumatra), to manufacture about
380,000 metric tons of urea annually. It includes the following
facilities: a single train ammonia unit; a urea unit; supporting
off-site and auxiliary facilities; and related technical services.
PART II consists of the detailed engineering and construction of a
gas conservation and transmission system, and related technical services.
The total project cost would amount to approximately
$84.4 million, comprising $68.0 million in foreign exchange costs, and
$16.4 million in local costs. The foreign exchange costs would be made
available as follows:  $30 million from the Association; $10 million
from ADB; $23 million from USAID; and $8 million (appro;dmately)
from the Japanese Government to cover the cost of the urea plant
packa,ge.    Local currency costs equivalent to $10.3 million ¶.!ould
be provided by the Indonesian Government, with the balance to be met
from cash generated by PUSRIts existing operations.  The Govermnent would
also be responsible for any cost overruns in foreign or local currencies
that might occur.

So as to utilize most economically and effectively the
various funds available  (a part of which iculd be on a '"tied" basis)
while at the sam.e time reconciling, to the extent possible, the various
requirements of the lenders involved, a plan of project execution and
procurement has been devised and adopted by all the parties concerned.  A
more detailed outline of this plan appears in the attached Appraisal
Report (Pages 18-2i).
(a)              For Part I of the project, a qualified consulting firm
(the "Technical Adviser") experienced in both ammonia and urea plant
technology, would assist PUH,RI in the inplementation of the project,
acting, in ef>.-t, as an extension of PUSRI's own technical staff and
representing T-.'SRPI's interests. The Technical Adv-ser, the cost
f F Ihlose colt-^t is included in the proposed financing, would be
appointed following the Association's usual procedures for the selection
and appointment of consultants, subject to the concurrence of the other
lenders. He, in turn, would be generally responsible for assisting in the
selection of the contractors who would bid on the basis outlined below.
(.b)             A General Contractor would have overall responsibility
for Part I of the project, as well as specific responsibility for
the design and procurement of the amnonia plant and all utilities and off-
site facilities, and for all site erection and construction work, includin,
that on the urea portion of the project. The General Contractor's servico
would be finarnced out of the Tmroceeds of the USAID loar and bidilw'J wnuF   be
restricted to A:e-ourl_f'ed American firms on the basis of competitive
bi:dding within the United States, and in accordance with USAID rules and
regulations.  The contract would be drawn up on a cost-plus-fixed fee
basis.
(c)       A Urea Plant Contractor would be responsible for supplying the
comnon.ents of the urea plant on a package basis. The Urea Plant Contractor
would be ermrloyed from armong pre-quali'ied Japanese firms on the basis of
coompetitive bidding in Japan. The contract would be awarded on a lump-surn
basis, designed so as to make payments thereunder e:ligible for financing
b-y the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and if needed by ADB from the
JaDanese contribution to its Special Funds.  If the low lump-sum bid seems
too h4-h, the cmnt-ractor's fee may be placed on a fixed-fee basis with the
ec- pment subj4r-, to competit;ive bidding within Japan.
(d)       All other foreign exchange expenditures for equipment and ser-
vices would be financed either by the Association, by ADB under contracts
a;warded to suppliers in count;ries which have contributed to its Special
.2unnds, or out of the remaining funds provided by the AID loan. The latter
will riot be used to finance procurement for Part II of the Project.  In
cases where it was considered that a more economic pattern of procurement
would result, specific items could be put up for national competitive
bidding under bilateral financing, w;ith IDA and ADB funds being held avail-
able to be used in case bids received under such procedures were unreasonatl.-b
high. Uhile ADB funds are usable only in countries which have contributed
to its Special Furds, no difficulty is anticipated in utilizing the ADB
loan funds for .-tracts awarded on the basis of international competition,



ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 4
(e)       Part II of the project would be implemented by separate technical
advisers and construction firms. Procurement would be financed out of IDA
and ADB funds and would be conducted according to the Association's guide-
lines, administered in consultation with ADB.
(f)       IDA, in consultation with ADD, would ensure co-ordination of the
implementation of the Project as set forth in the Memorandum of Agreement
regarding Project Execution, Procurement and Use of Loan Funds distributed
with the Loan Documents.
Disbursement is expected to begin in the fall of 1970, after the
major service contracts are awarded, and should reach its poak in the first
half of 1972, when the major part of the equipment should be on order. As
the project is scheduled to be completed by June 1973, disbursements shouli
be largely completed by the end of that year, except for guarantee and
retention monies which should be disbursed by the end of 1974.
In M.arch 1970 PUSRI's status was changed from a state-owned eiiter-
prise governed under special regulations to that of a state-o0wned limited
liability company governed by the Commercial Code. RPSRI's new; charter
has been designed so as to ensure that the company will have more autonomy
to conduct its affairs along commercial lines, and that, should shares
be sold in the future, they will be attractive to private
investors. Further revisions of the Charter to that end are expected
to be mide, subject to the approval of the Association, after the revision
of the Commercial Code, now under way, is completed.  The company is rur.
by a Board of Management (Direksi) headed by a President Director, assisted
by three Directors. The present President Director, appointed in May 1966.
is General H. Hasan Kasim, a retired military officer. The Board of
Management oversees an organization of some nine departments, staffed
by over 1,500 employees; some 800 of the latter are engaged in production.
About 50 members of the staff have been trained abroad. The existing op-
eraticn of i'USRI is considered to be well .managed.  'Tith the assistance in
management, marketing, and technical matters provlded in the project plan,
FUSRI management should be able to carry out the expansior projeCt in a
uatisfactory manner.
PUSRI's Management is in turn subject to review by a Super,:.isory Board
(Dewan Komisaris), composed of a chairman and four members.  This Board
will be appointed, in consultation with the Association, before this
project is considered by the Executive Directors.
PERTAMINA, the state-owned petroleum corporation, operates
under the supervision of the Directorate-General of Oil and Gas in the
Ministry of Mines. The company is involved in exploration, production,
refining, sea transportation, local marketing, and exporting. PERTAMINA
operates in all major areas of the country, and runs the former instal-
lations of Shell which were taken over by purchase in 1965. The company's
six refineries provide all of Indonesia's refined output. In 1968
PERTANINA's output of crude oil amounted to some 15% of Indonesia's
total production, and provided 10% of gross oil exports.  PERTAMINA also
acts as the intermediary between the Government and foreign oil companiec,
working under profit/or cost-sharing arrangements with over thirty such
firms.



ANNaxI

PERTAMINA would supply gas to PUSRI in accordance with
a take-or-pay contract drawn up in consultation with the lenders. The gas
conservation and transmis.-ion sc%ene vzould be financed -wnolly by the Govern.
mern'i-loen, and the price of gas vould be set at a level so as to cover the
loan service as ulell as fT21 operating costs. Al:L acconts rielevant to the
gas c onservation e-nd transmission scheme would bd segregated frcri the

The Indonesian Government attaches high priority to
a program to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains, particularly rice,
by 1973/74. An ample supply of rice is an important factor in the
Government's price stabilization effort, and an expansion of rice
production lies at the core of the Governmentts development program
in the agricultural sector. Agriculture currently occupies about 80
percent of the population, and accounts for almost half of Indonesia's
national income. The proposed expansion of PUSRI's present facilities,
prc-riding for increased supplies of fertilizer, would play a strategic
role in agricult,ural development,
Domesti.c demawnd Th: urea fertilizer is currently rising at a slow rate,
due to the absenoc. of adequate incentives.  However, a rice price support
policy has already been promulgated to provide farmers with the incentive
to increase their usage of fertilizer considerably, and further measures
to promote the efficient distribution and application of fertilizer will
be the subject of an extensive nation-wide fertilizer study scheduled to
begin shortly. Pending completion of that study, which will be financed
under Credit 135-IND, the Government is taking steps to promote sales of
urea fertilizer and to improve the relevant distribution, marketing and
credit facilities. It seems reasonable to assume that the full output
of the urea plant can be marketed in Indonesia by the fourth year of opera-
tion, i.e. 1976D
It iS -'S-e .n-tention of the Government that PUSRI should sell
its products at p.ices competitive with imports (which are duty-free), in
accordance with sound commercial practices. Imports are now being made
at an average price of around $80 per ton but for purposes of the finan-
cial forecasts it has been assumed that by the time the new plant comes
into production, imports will be available at the price at which PUSRI
h^ ,     selling its present production, namely the equivalent of $67.50
per ton. As set forth more fully in the Appraisal. Report, assuming full
prcduction, and a selling price of $67.50 per ton, debt service coverage
on the Company"s senior debt would rise to 108 times in the mid-1970's,
thereafter declining to 1.3 times by the end of the period of amortiza-
tion of the senior Government loan, Pre-tax earnings, as a percentage
of equity would yary from a low of 10.6,J in 1979 to more than 50% in the
last year of debt ser7ice. On the assumptions stated above, the eccnoomic
rate of return on the comb:ined investment in the gas and fertilizer parts
of the project would be about 14%.

Notes on Cost Increases in Foreign Exchange Component of the Fertilizer Plant
a)  The start of project implementation was delayed by about 13 months
because the time needed to agree on suitable consultants, to negotiate a gas
purchase agreement between PUSRI and Pertamina and for the colenders to clear
the tender specifications, was longer than expected. These delays caused an
estimated increase in the foreign exchange cost of the project of $3.0 million.
b) The project incluided studies of the gas field and of the marketing
and distribution system the results of which were to be taken into account in
the detailed design of the project. The gas study indicated a need for addi-
tional desulphurization equipment and -he distribution study recommended
extensive changes in the distribution system originally proposed. The addi-
tional cost of these items is estimated at $1.7 million.
c) Engineering costs and consulting services show an estimated
overrun of $1.6 million.
d) The cost increases for the fertilizer plant due to the various
currency realignments in late summer and fall of 1971 have been estimated at
$5.5 million equivalent. This increase represents the reduction in the
purchasing power of the US dollar vis-a-vis the currencies in which contracts
had been, would have been, or were expected to be placed. It is estimated th.at
the February 1973 currency realignments would cause a similar further cost
increase of $3.5 million, making the estimated total $9.0 million.
e) The original cost estimates provided for separate contingencies
of $8.8 million for the fertilizer plant.   Since mechanical cc..1eiLon
of the plant is still about 15 months away it is considered p:^uc6ent to
include a contingency allowance of $2.h million in the revised estimates.
The difference of $6.4 million provides an offset against the above
increases in cost.
Notes on Cost Increases in Foreign Exchange Component, of the Gas System
a) The start of implementation of the gas part of the project was
delayed by about 18 months, for reasons similar to those that delayed the
fertiJ 1.7,;r plant. The cost inLcrease caused by this delay is estimated at
$1.0 million.
b) Engineering costs and consulting services show an estimated
overrun of $1.9 million.
c) and d) The cost estimates given in the appraisal report assumed
that all the gas would come from Pertamina's gas fields around Prabhamulih and
supply PUSRI, Pertaminals refinery at Pladju and other customers (power and
industry) with 56 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of gas and that a 12-inch
pipeline and 13,000 hp compressor capacity would be sufficient to meet these



ANNEX V
Page 3 of 3
requirements. However, PUSRI's gas requirements have now been more precisely
determined on the basis of the gas study referred to above ald also taking into
account the specific process route adopted by the process vendor. It has also
been decided, on technical grounds, to recover the higher fractions of hydro-
carbons in the fertilizer plant rather than in the field. As a consequence
PUSRI's gas requirements have increased by about 8 M?cfd and system capacity
requirements to 64 MMcfd. To meet this additional requirement it was decided
to install a 14-inch pipeline and to add 2,000 hp of compressor capacity.
These changes, costing an additional $2.2 million, will increase system capacity
to about 114 MMefd, thus providing some surplus capacity.
e) The cost estimates in the appraisal report assumed that work-
over, recompletion and drilling of gas wells estimated to cost $5.5 million
in foreign exchange would only be required in 1976, and, since they would be
paid from current income, made no provision in that regard. The gas reservoir
slurvey subsequently found that this work would have to start in 1973 to be
completed before the start up of the fertilizer plant in August 1974 if an
excessive use of valuable high pressure reserves was to be avoided. The scope
of work, however, has been reduced and the foreign exchange cost is now esti-
mated at $3.5 million equivalent, since additional supplies from fields operated
by Stamvac will be available.
f) Although procurement for most of the imported equipment and
services has not yet reached a stage that would permit a detailed analysis
of the effect of currency realignments in 1971 and 1973, the foreign exchange
cost increase for the gas part of the project on account of currency realign-
ments in 1971 and 1973 has been conservatively estimated at $2.0 million.
g) Because of the extension and redesign of the gas part of the
project, a separate contingency of $0.7 million for this parc has been provided.
