MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED RE.?UBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A PORT MODERNIZATION PROJECT II
1.         I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for SDR 28.9 million (US$37.0
million equivalent) for approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity. and would assist in financing the
development and modernization of the port of Dar es Salaam, a major regional
port on the eastern coast of Africa.  The total project cost is US$122.3
million and will be parallel financed by Finland (US$17.9 million
equivalent), Denmark (US$4.2 million equivalent), Norway (US$11.5 million
equivalent), Netherlands (US$5.4 million equivalent), and Sweden (US$17.5
million equivalent).   The proposed IDA credit would be passed on to the
Tanzania Harbours Authority (THA) at an interest rate of ill per annum
(p.a.), repayable over 20 years, including five years grace. THA will bear
the foreign exchange risk as well as finance certain foreign exchange costs
and the full local costs of the project (US$28.8 million).
2.         Background and Strategy.    The  Government  of  Tanzania  with
assistance from IDA, launched a systematic process of policy reforms in 1986
which has yielded positive economic responses, including a steady growth of
GDP of between 4 and 5Z p.a. over the last three years. However, further
recovery  is  very  much  constrained  by  the  deteriorated  transport
infrastructure and the poor operating performance of transport parastatals.
The road infrastructure, because of insufficient funding and a virtual lack
of maintenance, has deteriorated to a point where over 70Z of the network is
either impassable during the rainy season or unmaintainable; the two railway
systems, despite their strategic network offering the least cost for long
distance haulage, are unable to carry much of the traffic demanded due to
operational inefficiency and deteriorated infrastructure; and the ports, the
gateway for the major portion of the irport/export traffic, are becoming
congested due to a lack of physical capacity, and weaknesses in the port
operations and customs administration. The direct cost to the economy of the
poorly functioning transport system has been estimated at nearly US$200
million p.a., equivalent to over one-third of the export earnings of the
country. Given the critical state of the transport sector, the Government
convened a Transport Sector Donors' Conference in December 1987 in Arusha to
present a document prepared with the assistance of IDA entitled "Programme
for Transport Sector Recovery'.  The Programme outlined the basic policy,
institutional changes and rehabilitation requirements of the sector in order
to rehabilitate the transport infrastructure and services to cater to the
requirements  of the economy.    This  project,  along with  the proposed
Integrated Roads Project (FY90) and Railways Restructuring Project (FY91),
totaling nearly US$1,230 million over the next eight to ten years, forms an
integral part of the comprehensive program discussed and agreed at the
Conference.
3.         The port of Dar es Salaam is the main port for Tanzania's overseas
trade and is a key regional port for the neighboring landlocked countries
(Zambia, Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, eastern Zaire and Malawi), The efficiency
and cost effectiveness of port operations, therefore, is of paramount



a 2 .
importance to the Tanzanian economy and its neighbors.   A program to
modernize the port, enabling it to handle the growing container traffic, was
begun in early 1965 under the Tanzania Port Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1536-
TA) co-financed by six donors (DANIDA, NORAD, FINNt4DA, the Netherlands,
Italy, and the UK). The physical facilities were satisfactorily completed
and handad over to THA ln March 1989. In May 1988, THA, IDA and the donors
carried out a Port Mid-Term Review to evaluate the port operations and the
effectiveness of the on-going program. The review concluded that although
port productivity and profitability of operations have improved as a result
of the on-going assistance, there are still significant problems in the areas
of physical facilities, human resource and institutional development. The
key problems/lssues includes Ci) the containerized traffic has increased at
nearly 20S p.a. over the last five years and the demand is forecast to exceed
the capacity of the newly constructed container terminal by 19921 (ii)
inefficient customs procedures and weak administration have increased the
container dwell time to an unacceptably high level, leading to excessive
congestion and reduction in the effective terminal capecityl (iii) the
efficiency of cargo handling needs to increase at a more rapid pace if THA
is to avoid further congestion at the ports (iv) given the overall traffic
growth of 7S p.a. over the past five years and the continuing good
performance of the economy, overall projected demand will exceed total port
capacity by the late 1990s, and a long term port development study is
required to determine further port expansion requirements; (v) the on-going
technical assistance program has not achieved its full objective due to THA's
inability to coordinate and monitor the effectiveness of the various donor-
funded assistance and to provide suitable counterparts; (vi) the financial
management policy of TBA needs to be more commercially oriented; And (vii)
coordination should be stepped up to channel available funds to the most
urgent requirements of TEA. Based on the results of the Mid-Term Review, a
port subsector donors' meeting was convened in February 1989, and it was
agreed that IDA should take the lead in assisting the Government to formulate
a project which would address these issues and improve the port facilities
to enable TEA to meet the expected demand in the early 1990s.
4.         Since the February meeting, THA and the Government have taken the
following actions: (i) reduced the container dwell time by over 20Z through
(a) various operational changes taken by the Container Dwell Time Working
Group (consisting of port users including Customs) and (b) Customs increasing
the number of auctions of containers unclaimed for more than 21 days from
four times a year to four times a month;  (ii) requested UNCTAD to assist
Customs on streamlining customs procedures; (iii) carried out a thorough
review of the technical assistance program and agreed with each donor on
specific changes to the T.A. program; (iv) began a process of engaging a
technical assistance coordinator; (v) filled majority of counterpart
positions; and (vi) prepared and ratified the new Corporate Financial
Strategy (approved by the THA Board and the Government) which would, inter
alia, commit THA to repay to the Government the principal and interest owed
on all debts relating to both donor grants and loans incurred since the
formation of the Authority in 1977, and also to institute a productivity
based incentive scheme for its workers.
5.         Prolect Obiective and Rationale for IDA Involvement.   The main
objectives of the project are to expand the physical, managerial and
operational capabilities of THA to meet the traffic volume expected in the



-3-
19909, to provide a more reliable and cost effective transport link with the
neighboring landlocked countries, and to improve the profitability and
commercial discipline of port operations. The rational for IDA involvement
is based on: (i) the importance of the port sector to the economic recovery
program; (ii) IDA's leading role in formulating the port modernization
program; and (iii) requests by THA and donors that IDA coordinate assistance
to THA in the port subsector, particularly in the areas of operational
improvements and institutional development.
6.         Project Description.  The project would consist of:  (i) civil
works to expand the port container terminal by 200?, complete the Ubungo and
Kurasini inland container depots, pave the lighterage wharf for container
storage, construct a port access road, complete the second phase of general
cargo terminal rehabilitation and repair concrete piles and fenders; (ii)
rehabilitation of the port central workshop and provision of technical
assistance for training of mechanics; (iii) procurement of container and
general cargo handling equipment; (iv) management assistance and training for
middle and upper management of THA; (v) technical assistance to Customs to
introduce a simplified documentation process, computerize customs processing
and train customs officers; (vi) addition of a technical assistance and
training coordinator to the Project Coordination Unit; (vii) a development
study to review the options for future port capacity expansion, including a
study of the possible privatization of certain port activities; and (viii)
consulting services for supervision of civil works and detailed engineering.
7.         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$122.3 million,
of which about US$100.5 million (82Z) is in foreign exrhange. Details of the
project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement
methods, amounts involved, and the disbursement schedule are given in
Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing events and Bank Group
operations in Tanzania are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
of the port of Dar es Salaam, noting the various locations of civil works
under the project, is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8149-TA is
being distributed with this Memorandum.
S.         Actions ARreed on. The following main actions were discussed with
the Government and THA at appraisal and were agreed upon during negotiations.
As conditions of effectiveness: (i) THA to carry out a thorough census of
its vorkforce; (ii) THA to submit to the Association the report and
recommendations of its study on the operational guidelines for the incentive
scheme; and (iii) execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and THA.  Other agreements are as follows:   (i) the incentive
scheme to be instituted by October 1, 1990; (ii) all investments outside the
proposed project larger than US$2 million equivalent for civil works and
US$500,000 equivalent for equipment to be undertaken only after agreement
with IDA, (iii) THA's annual budget and financing plans to be reviewed by IDA
March 31 of each year, before being effected; (iv) no material change to take
place in TEA's Corporate Financial Strategy, including the commitment to
repay all debts (principal and interest) to the Government according to the
agreed schedule; (v) THA to attain annual productivity, equipment
availability and container dwell time targets as set and agreed with IDA
(details are in Annex 2-6 of the Staff Appraisal Report); (vi) the port
development study, whose terms of reference were agreed at negotiations, to
be completed and the recommended development plan to be submitted for IDA



review by June 30, 1992; and (vii) TSA's debt-to-equity ratio to be kept
below 60.40.
9.         3gefit.s The project will benefit the entire economy of Tanzania
and its landi`ckedneighbors, through lower freight costs on a wide variety
of imported and exported products through faster and more efficient cargo
handling at the port.   Additionally, the introduction of the Corporate
Financial Strategy would enable THA tot (i; increase its contribution to the
Government's general revenues through debt service payments, taxes and
dividends from the current level of 22 to about 8S of Government's current
revenues by 1996197; (ii) increase its annual foreigp exchange earnings from
the present 82 to about 142 of the country's export earnings by 1996/971 and
(iii) Improve its staff morale and productivity through an incentive scheme.
10.        Risks.  Possible risks includes  Mi) lower than expecte4 traffic
growth; and (ii) higher than targeted dwell time for containers. The first
risk is minimal. Conservative assumptions have been used for the traffic
forecasts, and growth at one-half of the projected rate would still justify
the investment. If the targets for container dwell time reduction are not
met, the port will, again, experience severe congestion by the mid-1990s.
Sowever, THA has already begun coordination of port users to pursue actively
policies which aim at reducing dwell time.   These activities will be
supported by the project, ln particular by providing technical expertise and
training for Customs to speed uo document processing and improve its
operating practices. Regular revi- ;s and advice on corrective measures will
be carried out by IDA, and TRA will submit the latest status and actions
taken in their quarterly report to IDA and the donors.
11.        Recoendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the International Dfvelopment Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it
