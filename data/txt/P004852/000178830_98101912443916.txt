WESTERN SAMOA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - APPRAISAL
1. AGRICULTURAL BACKGROITNI)
General
1.01      Population, and Infrastructure.  The population of about 153,000
live in the country's two main islands - Upolu (110,000 people, in 430 sq
miles) and Savai'i (43,000 people in 700 sq miles).
1.02      The road system of about 500 miles is adequate for the area
covered, but parts of the road network require improvement. Roads mainly
serve the coastal areas, which have the heaviest population concentratioln;
and there is a well-developed system of public transportation. The main
harbor is in Apia (see Map 13742), the capital city and the only major urban
area, which is located on Upolu Island. The harbor at Asau on Savai'i Island
is partly developed and is being used to export timnber. Apart from Faleolo
international airport, the country has three small airstrips.
1.03      Climate, Topography, Soils and Land Use.  Climatic factors such as
rainfall (from 80 to 120 in p.a.), temperature (750F to 900F) and humidity do
not impose restrictions on crop production. However, the occasional strong
winds do cause some damage, especially to banana crops grown in exposed
areas.
1.04      Both Savaii and Upolu are characterized by central mountain ranges
that give way to rolling and flat plains towards the sea. The soils are
volcanic in origin ancd are characterized by widespread surface deposits of
stones and boulders. Soil classifications show that of the total area of
700,000 ac about 150,000 ac or 20% are of high to moderate fertility,
110,000 ac or 16% of moderate to low fertility and 440,000 ac or 64% comprise
soils of low fertility. The areas with agricultural potential lie between
the coast and about 1,000' elevation.
1.05      About 80% of the land area (560,000 ac) is held in accordance with
Samoan tradition as customary land; the Government and the country's land
development agency, the Western Samoa Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC)
control 11% or 77,000 ac and 5% or 35,000 ac, respectively. Freehold lands
amount to 26,000 ac or 4%. A large proportion of the customary land in
production is under old coconuts, with the balance cleared and farmed to taro
(a root crop) and bananas, while pigs and poultry are maintained as scavengers.
About 17,000 ac of WSTEC lands are under coconuts, coffee, cocoa, bananas and
pastures. In all, the productive lands, including the WSTEC properties,
total about 150,000 ac (about 20% of the total area), scattered over the two
main islands.  The uncultivated lanlds are covered by forest or secondary
scrub, with the most valuable timber resource being in the range of 1,000 to
1,500 ft. above sea level.



2. -
Sectoral Context and Issues
1.06      The agricultural sector represents the country's only viable
development possibility. The sector accounts for more than one half of GDP
and employs about two thirds of the economically active population. However,
most of agricultural and livestock production, which originates in village
areas, is for subsistence, and yields are uniformly low. While in the past
production increases were brought about by expansion of the cultivated area,
there is strong evidence that good agricultural land, e.g. with moderate
to high fertility and suitable topography, is becoming progressively scarce
and this, combined with a natural population growth rate of about 2.8% p.a.
(the impact of which has substantially increased in the last few years due to
reductions in the number of Western Samoans allowed to settle in New Zealand)
has worsened the long term prospects for maintaining, let alone improving,
living standards along traditional lines. This is further complicated by the
fact that there is little incentive for villagers to invest money or labor on
land improvement because of communal (rather than individual) ownership
rights and because villagers are doubtful of the benefits of such investments
in the absence of proof of successful intensive development anywhere in the
country.
1.07      Short-term prospects are also critical.  Imports of goods and
services have increased substantially in the last decade while exports
(practically all agricultural) have largely stagnated. In the past, remit-
tances by Western Samoans living abroad mitigated the trade imbalance to a
significant extent, but this cannot be expected in future because of the
immigration restrictions mentioned above. As a result, the substantial
resource gap of 25% of GNP has had to be financed through a large (in relation
to GNP) and growing reliance on foreign grants and soft loans. Clearly this
situation must be redressed urgently with a strategy incorporating rapid
development through increased productivity while allowing for moderate and
continuous change of the traditional structure of society in response to
opportunities and incentives clearly perceived by villagers.
1.08      Government has taken steps to improve conditions in the agricultural
sector. The country's land development agency, WSTEC, under a new and dynamic
general manager, is substantially expanding operations, and is now taking the
lead in new land development, marketing operations, and agro-industrial
enterprises. A declining timber company was purchased by Government and in
less than a year exports have been profitably expanded. Efforts to increase the
fish catch and fish refrigeration and canning capacity are proving successful.
Lastly, the continued growth of the country's financial system is opening up
new credit sources for short- and medium-term investments. These several
promising starts are forming the nucleus of a strong development thrust. At
the same time Government has taken the first steps to improve living conditions
in many villages (where 70% of the population live) by providing them with
access roads, drinking water, health and education facilities and electricity.



-3-
1.09      All of the above measures, though commendable in themselves, have
not addressed the urgent need to substantially increase productivity. produc-
tion and exports of traditional crops, e.g. coconuts, cocoa and co-ffee to
close the resource gap and to improve living conditions of subsistence farmners
in the absence of viable large-scale alternatives. Government has recently
agreed with this view and has begun reorienting its development objectives
accordingly from general infrastructure expansion to directly productive
agricultural investments aimed at raising productivity in new and traditional
agricultural areas. These objectives are being pursued with the long-term
objective of improving living standards of subsistence farmers taking into
account: (a) the urgent need to increase productivity, production and
exports; and (b) the severe short-term constraints affecting the traditional
village subsector.
1.10      Government's new development strategy is, therefore, adapted to the
above needs and limitations and consists of: (a) maximum use of WSTEC, which
is the only entity capable of bringing about rapid agricultural development;
(b) concentration of efforts in traditional, well proven crops; (c) emphasiz-
ing the development of the island of Savaii, the largest in the country,
which offers the greatest development potential and is the least integrated
into the market economy; (d) establishing the technical/financial basis for
future development of traditional rural areas; and (e) coordinating effec-
tively domestic and foreign resources to support a comprehensive, long-term
development effort.
Bank Group Participation
1.11      Western Samoa became a Bank Group member country in June 1974.  In
order to embark on an active program of economic development, the country
needed a rapid expansion and improvement of its basic infrastructure. To
this end IDA helped finance the reconstruction and enlargement of the east
coast and central cross island roads in Upolu (Credit 535-WSO), which is the
only Bank Group project so far and which has been successfully completed.
1.12      More recently, in line with Government's new objectives IDA
helped prepare and appraised the proposed project which would be the first
practical application of the Government's development strategy and which, if
successful, could ultimately lead to a much wider and long-range program of
integrated rural development.
2. SOCIOLOGICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
Villages
2.01      About 110,000 people or 70% of the population live in about 350
villages along the coasts, with village lands stretching inland along mountain
slopes.



-4-
2.02      A unique feature of Western Samoa is the traditional structure of
its society. Villages consist of 20 to 30 extended families (each with an
average 3 nuclear families of 6 people each) called aiga. An aiga typically
controls 15 to 20 acres of plantings. These add up to a total of 400/500
people controlling 300/400 planted acres per village. Each aiga elects its
leader or matai. The matai control and manage the distribution of land and
its uses, as well as of labor among family members, and all decisions at the
village level are taken by the fono, which is a council of matai. About 80%
of the land surface of Western Samoa is customary land, belonging to the
aiga, and most of the country's agricultural production is under the jurisdic-
tion of the matai. In addition, the governing body of the country, the
Parliament, is elected by and from among the matai. The matai system has
been a strong and central force in the social, political and economic system
of the country, but it is under severe stress at present.
2.03      The situation is very complex.  In the past there was little
incentive for villagers to work harder given plentiful land which was easy to
develop and very few needs to satisfy in addition to their subsistence require-
ments. More recently the increasing population pressure on the land has become
a main element of change. Another factor is the rapidly increasing cash
consciousness of youth (originating in the socioeconomic transformation
experienced by and through migrants, most of whom retain close links with
their extended families back home), combined with the ready availability of
foreign goods and exposure to foreign customs in the country. As a result of
these old communal traditions and respect for matai authority are weakening,
and a new sense of individualism based on material (as opposed to ceremonial
or prestige) incentives is fast emerging in the more mobile sections of the
population, e.g. young people in and around Apia, where the population
concentration is heaviest. On the other hand, the agricultural economy
remains basically stagnant and at subsistence level, and land use continues
to be based on customary laws, which preclude individual (as opposed to
extended family) rights and stable occupancy (land allocations among family
mé -oers are reviewed annually by the matais).  These factors limit the scope of
action of the most enterprising elements of village communities.
2.04      Some changes are already taking place in more "progressive" vil-
lages where matais are giving ipso facto permanent usufruct rights to nuclear
families and changing their own roles from those of chiefs to those of
managers. In most of the villages, however, changes are taking place much
more slowly because of their direct impact on matai powers and authority.
In summary, development based on villages involves sensitive issues and the
approach adopted should avoid unwarranted upheavals of the socioeconomic
fabric of the society.
2.05      Under the recently started Village Development Program (VDP)
Government is trying to improve villagers' living standards with villagers'
support within the established socioeconomic structure. By the end of
calendar 1978 about 300 or more than 80% of all villages had been visited by



- 5 -
teams of experts from the Department of Agriculture, (DOA) the Western Samoa
Development Bank (WSDB), and the Rural Development Division (RDD) of the
Prime Minister's Office. The teams make brief analyses of warranted develop-
ment needs and RDD organizes input deliveries. Investments are financed by a
5% village contribution, a 30% mixture of village contribution and/or a WSDB
loan, and the balance of 65% by a Government grant, the latter being deemed
necessary to induce villages to participate in the VDP given their general
reluctance to depend on the Central Government and to incur debt.
2.06      Although the VDP's goals and energetic activities are commendable
in principle, the program has a number of weaknesses, such as:  (a) invest-
ments have been largely oriented to consumption, electricity, churches, and
improved housing, which do not generate self-sustaining wealth; (b) because of
the lack of an adequate and tested technical package no suitable productive
investments can be recommended at present; (c) villages are not prepared to
engage in integrated productive investments requiring a major commitment of
labor and/or money because many of them cannot yet visualize either the need
for, or the benefits from, such investments; and (d) there is a lack of
adequate supervision, which results in poor implementation. As a result the
VDP needs a major policy reorientation and improvement. Villagers' losses
are likely to engender resentment at what will be perceived as "Government"
projects wlhich would be compounded when loan repayments by villagers become
due. This would make it much harder for outsiders to enlist tlhe cooperation
of villagers for legitimate rural development subsequently. In summary, the
VDP is largely confined to providing social investments and services for lack
of a suitable package of productive investments.  The poor implementation of
the VDP, together with the need for villagers to repay part of the invest-
ments being made is bound to have adverse consequences for future lending to
villagers.
2.07      In view of the above and of the substantial resource gap which must
be urgently remedied clearly the existing development approach must be
modified to allow for:  (a) the rapid introduction on a large scale of an
up-to-date agricultural technical/managerial package as the only way to
increase productivity, production and incomes in the absence of development
potential outside of agriculture and given the increasing land scarcity; and
(b) a slower, better planned, production-oriented, and progressive incorporation
of villages to development based on the above technical package as villagers
perceive the changing conditions requiring a larger effort on their part to
improve their living standards. The proposed project is based on the above
development approach.
Agricultural Supporting Services
2.08      Research.  The modest amount of agricultural research in Western
Samoa has been conducted at Alafua (in the vicinity of Apia) by the Agricul-
tural College which recently became the South Pacific Regional College of
Tropical Agriculture (RCTA) in the absence of any research activities at DOA



- 6 -
because of the latter's substantial policy and management weaknesses which
also affect extension (para. 2.09) and which will be addressed under recently
concluded bilateral and UNDP/government agreements. Research has been geared
to annual crops, such as taro, maize and soybeans, and pasture trials. What
is required now is applied research and experimentation on coconuts, cocoa,
coffee and bananas, the mainstays of the economy. However, research is
limited at Alafua by the expanded teaching requirements which make heavy
demands on the staff, the need to satisfy other member countries' research
priorities and the lack of suitable lands. On the other hand, WSTEC is
engaging in some research of its own without coordination with RCTA or DOA.
These indicate that applied research at least in the short run should be made
the joint responsibility of WSTEC, RCTA and DOA.
2.09      Extension.  Extension is the responsibility of DOA's Extension
Division.  The Division has 12 district extension centers each staffed by a
district officer and one or more assistants.  However, a major reorientation
and strengthening of the Division would need to be carried out in the next
few years if it is to fulfill its responsibilities. For example, there are
no medium-term plans based on single crops or inter-cropping, no coordination
with WSTEC or RCTA and no staff training or promotion opportunities, e.g. a
large proportion of the staff are not technically up to date and civil
service regulations and practices hinder their replacement. More basically,
there is very little adaptive research (para. 2.08) on which to base recom-
mendations to farmers on improved cropping and livestock practices. Adaptive
research followed by field plantings with improved stock is, therefore,
the prerequisite for improved agricultural productivity which could then be
expanded to village areas with the support of a strong group of extensionists
closely associated with the research and field plantings. DOA will not be in
a position to do these for a few years until strong measures are taken to
reorient its policies toward practical implementation of a research/extension
effort in close support of development priorities, coupled with larger
budgets, improved and expanded staffing and procedures aimed at maintaining
staff motivation.
2.10      Training.  RCTA, with important bilateral assistance, has traditionally
offered a three-year course leading to a diploma and in 1977 it began offering
a degree course in agriculture. Teachers are recruited from all over the
Pacific area and their performance is generally good, although their usefulness
is limited by their very short assignments. At present RCTA graduates about
30 diploma and degree holders each year, of whom about 50% are Western Samoans.
Demand for graduates by WSTEC, WSDB and the DOA is adequate to employ all
available graduates.  RCTA could accommodate up to 50 students per class if
required with its present facilities and given the relatively high number of
candidates there should not be a shortfall of graduates based on the expected
pace of development in the next decade. Although academic training is
adequate, suitable on-the-job training (which could be provided by WSTEC in
an initial phase and by RDD and DOA subsequently) would greatly enhance the
usefulness of graduates.

2.11      Credit.  WSDB was set up in 1974 and is the only development
lending institution in the country. It is a fully Government-owned bank run
by a ten-member Board of Directors with seven operational divisions and is
headquartered in Apia, offering limited services at Salelologa in Savaii.
WSDB's paid up capital at September 30, 1978 was WS$1.2 million and loans
(less than 10% short-term) amounted to almost WS$5 million at that date, of
which 50% were to agriculture.  Guarantees can be either personal, group or
real estate. Interest rates vary from 8 to 10% for agriculture and from 9 to
12% for industrial loans. Arrears represent about 10% of the volume of loans
outstanding, which is satisfactory given WSDB's lack of experience and the
impact of recent droughts on agricultural production. WSDB is participating
in the VDP by providing the 30% credit component of village investments but
it is still too early to assess its performance under the program. WSDB
appears to be well managed and is presently emphasizing short-term agricultural
lending for annual crops to improve its liquidity position and to bring about
more rapid improvement to rural areas. An important factor affecting the
success of this policy will be the linkage of credit with effective marketing
of surplus production abroad. The policy regarding production and exports
recently adopted by Government and the role to be played by WSDB need to be
spelled out by Government to enhance WSDB's contribution to development in
coordination with other agriculture-related agencies.
2.12      Input Supplies.  The Government-owned Agricultural Store (which is
operated as a non-profit organization) is in charge of importing and retailing
agricultural inputs. The Store is managed by a committee chaired by the
Minister of Agriculture. Its main facilities are in Apia and facilities at
Salelologa in Savaii are being substantially expanded. Sales amounted to
WS$0.7 million (about US$1 million) in 1977. The Store is handicapped by
inefficient management and irregular shipping schedules. The latter should
benefit from plans now being developed (see para. 2.14 below) and closer
coordination with WSTEC and DOA will be required for the Agricultural Store
to serve the growing needs of the economy.
2.13      Marketing.  Marketing of copra, cocoa and bananas is handled by
specialized boards managed by interministerial committees and marketing for
the rest of agricultural crops (most importantly for taro) is handled by the
Produce Marketing Division of the Department of Economic Development. The
copra and cocoa boards regulate prices paid to farmers, processors and other
intermediaries based on present and forecast prices, and keep stabilization
funds (WS$1 million and WS$0.5 million respectively at December 31, 1977).
Both boards seem to be working satisfactorily, but without any coordination
with other agencies which would make their activity much more useful to the
country. WSTEC is bound to have an important marketing role in the near
future (para. 2.25). Taro marketing is on an adhoc basis and could be
improved substantially through more vigorous sales efforts among Samoans
living abroad.



-8-
2.14      The inefficiency and high cost of transportation affect the supply
of inputs, and marketing. The demand for efficient transportation will
increase in response to increased agricultural exports. A most important
recent development has been the establishment and initial operations of the
Pacific Forum Lines (PFL) a shipping concern owned by the governments of New
Zealand, Western Samoa and other Pacific Islands. PFL will have two ships
in operation transporting produce among member countries by mid-1979. This
will substantially expand transport capacity, improve transport schedules and
lower transportation costs by introducing more competitive rates, and is bound
to be an essential element in lWestern Samoa's agricultural development
plans.
2.15      Road Infrastructure.  Roads are built and improved by the Special
Projects Development Corporation (SPDC) and maintained by the Public Works
Department (PWD). SPDC is an autonomous public entity established in 1974 to
handle all road building and improvements more efficiently in line with
profit-making objectives and is not restricted by civil service regulations.
SPDC has performed well since its inception under dynamic management. PWD's
road maintenance, however, is not satisfactory and a major effort is required
at this time to set goals, plan, organize and fund a road maintenance program.
PWD has started receiving technical and financial aid from bilateral sources
and this should help it improve its performance.
2.16      Land Surveys.  Land areas controlled by villages along the coast
have well known topography, land use, and boundaries based on customary use
rights. However, with the expansion of the traditional agricultural areas
inland much more needs to be known on these as a basis for proper land
allocation and use. The Lands and Surveys Department (LSD) is charged with
this responsibility, but it needs to be substantially strengthened to under-
take any major work and this would take a very long time. In its absence any
Major surveys now required would have to be contracted to outside firms.
2.17      In summary, up to the present there has been a lack of general
agricultural policy which has seriously affected agriculture-related institu-
tions. The result is that agencies have had no specific objectives, and there
has been little if any coordination among agencies. DOA is the weakest agency
in the agricultural sector and requires improvements in its general organiza-
tion and specifically in its research and extension activities which are
substantial and which would take a few years to be introduced. Bilateral and
UN assistance will be provided on these. Another area which requires immediate
attention is road maintenance. Credit, marketing and input supplies have
developed to some extent, but vigorous action is now required to strengthen
and reorient these activities in the framework of the recently adopted
agricultural development policy and strategy (para. 1.10).
WSTEC
2.18      General.  WSTEC was established in 1950 to take over the administra-
tion of the New Zealand Reparation Estates and its statutes date back to
1957.  In 1961 WSTEC's property and control were transferred to Government,
an. WSTEC was made a public corporation with responsibility for agricultural
an- agioindustrial enterprises. WSTEC carries out land development and
ma   2ment in its estates on behalf of Government following private commercial
pm.- ~ces.



-9-
2.19      Organization, Management and Staffing.  WSTEC's organization is
given in Chart 1. WSTEC operates semi-autonomonously under a Board of six
directors appointed by the Head of State and chaired by the Prime Minister.
The Board sets operating policy and handles overall supervision. WSTEC's
chief executive officer is the General M4anager. The present General Manager
has been on the job for about two years and is capable and experienced,
having occupied important positions in the public and private sectors. Under
his management WSTEC has embarked on a vigorous improvement and expansion
program.
2.20      The General Mlanager has three assistants (AGM):  one for primary
production (agriculture and livestock), one for stores, marketing and manu-
facturing and the third for general administration. A development coordinator
helps the General Manager in new projects involving more than one ACM. Below
the AGMs are the headquarters and enterprise coordinators, support services
and the estate, store and factory managers. Permanent staff numbered 1,960
at December 31, 1978, of whom 385 or about one fifth were at headquarters.
WSTEC also contracted 3,500 casual labor in 1978, mostly for land clearing
and harvesting. The large majority of WSTEC's managerial staff at higher
levels are not professionally qualified. This results in weak accounting and
record keeping, as well as in poor estate field management. Another weakness
is lack of transport and other facilities at estate level. Technical assistance
by an expert is being provided to WSTEC for veterinary services and pasture
management under a UNDP/FAO program and under a recent Asian Development Bank
loan to WSTEC there is provision for two man-years of technical assistance
for agricultural planning and for a man-year in management/ bookkeeping.
However, much more crop-specific field assistance and staff recruitment and
training are required if WSTEC is to expand and improve the quality of its
agriculture and livestock activities.
2.21      Policies and Procedures.  Until the recent change in management
WSTEC had a lackluster performance and followed a policy of non-involvement
with village agriculture. Under new Government plans and management WSTEC's
role has expanded considerably as the pioneer for agricultural development in
the country. As such it is increasing production, and initiating diversifi-
cation efforts along private enterprise lines. However, given its poor
initial condition and Government's ambitious plans for WSTEC a basic policy
reorientation and major improvements are now required.
2.22      The most pressing policy changes (agreed by Government) are:
(a) for WSTEC to switch from extensive to intensive production by increasing
substantially productivity in its estates (as opposed to simply bringing more
land under traditional cultivation); and (b) for WSTEC's direct involvement
with the needs, potential and development goals of the village sub-sector,
which would greatly benefit from WSTEC's improved farming practices, planting
material sources, training, harvesting, transportation, processing and
marketing services.

2.23      WSTEC's Enterprises.  WSTEC's agricultural estates constitute its
most important assets and economic activities. They number 13 in Upolu
(totalling 20,000 ac) and 5 in Savai (10,000 ac), the latter having been
recently transferred to WSTEC by Government. About 12,000 ac are under
coconuts, (of which about 9,000 ac are undergrazed and 3,000 ac underplanted
with cocoa); 17,000 ac are under grass and primary forest; 400 ac each under
coffee and bananas; and 300 ac under macadamia trees.
2.24      In 1977 WSTEC's copra production was close to 3,000 tons for an
average yield of about 550 lb per ac and cocoa production was 300 tons yiel-
ding 220 lb/ac. The low yields are a result of old stands, poor planting
material, lack of fertilizer and inadequate husbandry. Also in 1977 about
1,100 fattened steers were sold to the local market out of a total herd of
about 12,000 head which constitute 60% of the national herd. More recently
WSTEC started a piggery unit.
2.25      WSTEC markets its agricultural produce through the respective crop
marketing boards with the exception of cocoa (which it sells through brokers).
Meat is distributed through WSTEC's retail outlets mainly in Apia.  In future,
WSTEC will market its own coconut production in the form of oil with the
beginning of operations of its coconut oil mill by mid-1979.
2.26      Under US$3 million ADB loan approved in 1978, WSTEC is:  (a) rehabi-
litating 6 of its 13 estates; (b) establishing an agricultural research
station; and (c) providing for copra and cocoa processing facilities, machinery
for road improvement and maintenance and storage facilities. All of these
are in the island of Upolu. These are useful steps in enlarging WSTEC's
activities and should improve WSTEC's earnings.
2.27      WSTEC's nonagricultural enterprises include a timber business,
a feedmill, a soap factory, a general retail store, a service station and a
vehicle and equipment repair shop, which together represent about one fourth
of WSTEC's volume of business and profits. These enterprises seem to be run
efficiently, but serious management constraints have begun to develop.
Government and WSTEC's management are exploring the expansion of existing
enterprises and new WSTEC ventures related, among others, to housing and saw
milling. As a result, WSTEC may find itself overextended in the near
future.
2.28      Financial Condition.  Summary financial statements for 1973 through
1977 are given in Tables 1 and 2. The tables show that WSTEC has made
profits in each year during the period with fluctuations due mainly to copra
and cocoa price movements. Average return on capital was 7% through 1976 and
increased to 20% in 1977.

The increase in total assets from WS$ 3.0 million to WS$ 5.3 million was
financed mainly through retained earnings. WSTEC's only long-term debt
(contracted in 1978) is to the ADB (US$3 million) and was obtained on very
satisfactory terms (20 years repayment period including 5 years grace for
capital repayment with interest rate at 3% in the first 10 years and 8.3% in
the last 10 years.) WSTEC's financial condition, however, is substantially
dependent on copra and cocoa world market prices and, therefore, susceptible
to major changes. Its low operating costs are mainly due to low levels of
inputs and not to adequate management. WSTEC's major task ahead is to
improve its management efficiency, and export earnings to consolidate its
financial position.
Accounts and Audit
2.29      WSTEC's accounting system is weak.  The chief accountant and other
accounting staff need further training. There is a need to introduce adequate
enterprise and estate record keeping as part of an overall reorganization of
accounts. Improvements on these are contemplated under the ADB loan, coupled
with linkage of WSTEC's record keeping to a recently introduced Government
computer system.
WSTEC's Overall Performance
2.30      WSTEC's overall performance has substantially improved in the last
two years under new and dynamic management. Required policy reorientation,
staffing and training related to WSTEC's agricultural activities, would be at
the core of the proposed project (Section IV) and (in the latter case) will
also be carried out under the recently approved ADB loan.  WSTEC's financial
condition is good but highly dependent on variable world market prices for
copra and cocoa. WSTEC will have to plan carefully before it commits itself
to major expansion of its enterprises or to new ventures beyond the proposed
project. In summary, WSTEC can handle its present responsibilities well, but
it needs major improvements in line with Government's development plans and
cr.eful analysis of its absorptive capacity additional to what is required
for the proposed project before it expands further in future.
3. THE PROJECT
Origin
3.01      The proposed project was identified by Government and an identifica-
tion report was prepared by Government in late 1977 with the help of a
consultant. An IDA preparation mission visited Western Samoa in May 1978 and
field appraisal was made in October/November 1978.



- 15 -
Objectives
3.02      The main objectives of the proposed project, to be carried out in
Savaii, are: (a) rapid and substantial increase in productivity, production
and exports of copra, cocoa and coffee in four WSTEC estates to help close a
serious resource gap in the short and medium term; (b) improvement of the
technical knowhow and training of staff; and (c) initiating the transfer
of the above improved technology through plantings in village areas to
improve living standards of subsistence farmers in the medium and long term.
These objectives would be further fulfilled through the complementary project
goal of expanding taro exports through WSTEC.
3.03      The project has been formulated to pursue the secondary objectives
of land conservation and employment creation. An important overall objective
of the project is institution building: by using existing institutions (WSTEC
and secondarily DOA) for project implementation, these agencies would be
strengthened and could provide the institutional framework for future agricul-
tural development.
Brief Description
3.04      The project consists of investments in:  (a) isolated nurseries,
imported improved planting material and field development of about 2,400 ac
of coconuts, 2,130 ac of cocoa and 200 ac of coffee in four WSTEC estates and
of selected villages in Savaii; (b) technical assistance for the above crops
and for agricultural diversification in the WSTEC estates and selected villages;
(c) taro marketing by WSTEC on behalf of Savaii villages; (d) estate road
construction and improvement of the southern coastal road in Savaii (which
would largely benefit village development); (e) project administration
and (f) monitoring/evaluation, surveys, studies and preparation of a second
phase of development. Primary responsibility for project management would
rest with WSTEC. Total project cost (including contingencies) is estimated
at US$20.6 million over a five year period. Financing would be provided
through Government: (a) to WSTEC in the form of a subsidiary loan; and (b)
to other participating agencies in the form of direct payments for services
rendered (see Section IV below on project management).
Detailed Features
3.05      Nurseries and Improved Planting Material.  The old, unselected
coconut, cocoa and coffee stock is uniformly low-yielding and has become the
most important development bottleneck in view of recent constraints in
expanding the agricultural area. No substantive steps have been taken in the
past to improve yields.
3.06      Under the project improved planting material would be imported most-
probably from the Solomon Islands (coconuts and cocoa) and Malaysia (cocoa
and coffee). Preliminary agreement has been obtained for the importation
into Western Samoa of selected Rennel tall and hybrid coconut seed, which
would be taken directly to a 13 ac nursery to be established in a virgin
forest area on WSTEC's Vaia'ata estate (see Map). Approximately 60,000 nuts
would be imported annually for 4 to 5 years for 600 acres average of field
plantings per annum.



- 16 -
3.07      Improved cocoa (upper Amazon and Amelonado) and coffee (Robusta)
hybrid planting material would be obtained over a five-year period. A
two-acre nursery would be established in an isolated area on WSTEC's Falelima
(see Map) estate for multiplication prior to field plantings.
3.08      By law DOA is responsible for the importation, inspection and
treatment of improved planting material, but so far it has not carried out
this task. DOA will benefit from the support offered by UN and bilateral aid
sources.  In the meantime WSTEC would have responsibility for these for
project purposes and in agreement with DOA.
3.09      Field Plantings.  Land clearing would be contracted to villagers
living in Savaii. Land preparation and plantings would be made under the
technical direction of the project's  subject matter specialists.
3.10      Up to about 6,000 ac of the 10,000 ac total area in WSTEC's four
estates would be cleared and planted as follows: coconuts interplanted
over an initial two-year period with taro (1,200 ac each in Lata and Vaia'ata);
cocoa underplanted for one year with taro (1,000 ac Falelima, 500 ac each Asau
and Lata, 130 ac Vaia'ata); and coffee (200 ac Vaia'ata) from 1980 through
1984.  However, one of the project's objectives is the transfer of improved
agricultural technology to interested Savaii villages. Therefore, land would
be cleared and plantings made in villages (instead of in WSTEC estates)
depending on villagers' requests and agreement to follow the instructions of
the specialists. It is very difficult to forecast at this stage the size of
the project's village plantings given the uncertainty surrounding vilagers'
motivations and constraints (Section II above) but it is hoped that plantings
would be made in up to 500 ac beginning in project year three (to allow for
experience to be gained by WSTEC in its own plantings and through village
demonstration plots, especially regarding disease/pest control and fertilizer
use) which would permit development to take place in up to 30 ac or 10% of
the total planted area per village in 15 to 20 villages out of a total 120
v-llages in Savaii.
3.11      Technical Assistance.  There is a lack of up-to-date knowledge on
agricultural husbandry in Western Samoa. Under the project two experienced
subject matter specialists would be hired for three years each, one for
coconuts and one for cocoa and coffee, and would be responsible for the
technical aspects of nurseries, planting material and field plantings.



- 17 -
3.12      A third specialist would be appointed also for three years to
initiate and supervise crop diversification field trials, which would be of
main benefit to future village agriculture. Short-term consultants would be
recruited to deal with specific problems, such as plant material multiplication,
crop husbandry, processing and more crop-specific technical support. The
average total cost of consultants is estimated at US$6,125 per man-month.
Training abroad in estate management would be provided to twelve WSTEC staff
who would be subsequently appointed as managers and assistant managers in
WESTEC's estates. Lastly, semidetailed soil surveys and soil sampling would
be made in project areas, both in WSTEC estates and participating villages,
to determine land suitability and effective fertilizer use.
3.13      Taro Marketing.  To fulfill the project's objective of helping
villagers in Savaii as early as possible, WSTEC would not limit itself to
marketing its own project-induced taro production, but would also endeavour
to handle the transportation and sale of village-produced taro in Savaii
beginning in project year one. This would be arranged to ensure that up to
one third of incremental taro production for which markets were opened would
be allocated to village areas. Assurances on this were obtained during
negotiations. This marketing arrangement would additionally improve WSTEC's
links with villagers and their confidence in WSTEC.
3.14      Roads.  Access roads to the four WSTEC estates would be built under
the project. Practically all the villages in Savaii have adequate access
roads and, therefore, additional roads would not be needed for participating
villages. However, improvements would be made on the southern coastal road
in Savaii as follows: (a) sealing of a 72 km stretch from Salelologa to
Falelima; and (b) sealing and realignment of the 21.5 km road section from
Falelima to Asau (see Map). These improvements would result in user savings,
and would reduce road maintenance costs in the most important trunk road
sections serving the project area. Because existing road maintenance is
inadequate countrywide and it would be unwarranted to make major road improve-
ments in those circumstances, a program for the countrywide road maintenance
operations was prepared by the Government.
3.15      Monitoring and Evaluation, Studies, Surveys and Preparation of a
Second Development Phase. It is essential to provide effective project
monitoring and evaluation given the paucity of data and the importance of the
project as the first phase of a much larger integrated future rural development
program. Data would be collected on inputs, such as imported planting
material, nursery seedling production, area cleared and planted in estates
and villages, supplies, yields, and impact of wages and of increased project-
induced production on WSTEC and villagers' revenues. The monitoring and
evaluation system would be designed by a consultant hired by the Project
Steering Committee (para. 4.03) based on proposed TOR discussed at
negotiations and data would be gathered by field staff implementing the
project under the supervision of WSTEC's General Manager. Evaluation would
be carried out by a consultant also hired by the Steering Committee. Aero-



- 18 -
photographic mapping at a 1:20,000 scale would be made of the most important
agricultural lands in Savaii, which are those within four miles of the
coastline. This would be extremely beneficial for topographic and land-use
mapping required for further development of the Island. Additionally, funds
and staff time would be allowed for the preparation of a second development
phase which would hopefully concentrate almost exclusively on village develop-
ment mainly in Savaii but without excluding Upolu.
3.16      Because the second development phase would be largely based on
village area development and given the little information available and the
changes now taking place in villages (Section II) in-depth analyses would
be made of a minimum ten representative villages in Savaii and Upolu to
determine which are the factors affecting village incorporation into the
development process and ways of resolving obstacles to development with a
minimum of disruption of legitimate community values. These in-depth studies
would be undertaken by RDD with the help of consultants and with the partici-
pation and support of relevant agencies and the RCTA. An assurance was
obtained that terms of reference would be submitted to IDA for comments.
Cost
3.17      Total project cost is estimated at US$20.6 million, of which about
US$13.8 million or two thirds would represent foreign exchange requirements.
The base cost estimates are based on prices expected by the third quarter of
CY79. Physical contingencies of 11% of base costs have been included. The
price contingency amounts to 17.5% of total base cost plus physical contingency
and assumes the following rates of price increases: fertilizer and chemicals,
vehicles and equipment 6% (1980 to 1984); civil works and salaries, 7% (1980
to 1984). Project costs (which exclude taxes) are presented in Annex 1 and
are summarized below:

3.18      Government would contribute US$2.1 million, WSTEC US$1.7 million,
IDA US$8 million, the EEC Special Action Fund US$0.3 million, UNDP $1.7
million, the Australian government US$5.4 million, and the Japanese Government
$1.4 million. Government would be the borrower and would assume the foreign
exchange risk. IDA's contribution would finance about 40% of foreign
exchange requirements and would cover 74% of field development, 48% of road,
and almost all monitoring/evaluation costs. Project financing is summarized
below.

3.20      The Government entered into a subsidiary loan agreement with WSTEC
under which project funds (about US$5 million, of which US$3.7 million would
be from the IDA credit) would be transferred to WSTEC at 10% interest repayable
in 25 years including 10 years of grace for principal to cover the full costs
of field development. These terms are in line with (a) project-generated
revenues; (b) existing commercial lending rates in Western Samoa (para.
2.11); and (c) with past (10%) and expected (8%) inflation rates. Village
field development would not start until project year three. Before the end
of project year two Government would submit to IDA a self-financing plan for
tree crop development in village areas taking into account arrangements being
followed elsewhere. A definite financing arrangement should be in place
before the first village tree crop plantings are made.  Assurances were
obtained on this. Additional financing would be provided through the Treasury
to participating agencies in the form of direct payments for services rendered
or the expenditures incurred as follows: (a) to WSTEC for the import of
planting materials, nurseries and technical assistance; (b) to SPDC for road
building and improvements; (c) to RCTA and DOA for ad hoc technical services
rendered; (d) to LSD for the aerophotographic survey; and (e) to RDD for the
preparation of a second development phase. Village taro plantings and
WSTEC's marketing activities would be financed respectively by villagers and
through short-term credit supplied by WSDB as a complement to the project.
An assurance was obtained that WSDB would supply short-term funds for
Savaii taro plantings agreed by WSTEC under the project.
Procurement
3.21      Of the IDA-financed components land clearing would be contracted by
WSTEC following established procedures, which have worked well in the past
and which consist of hiring village labor to do the clearing manually and
with the help of chainsaws. Other field operations would be carried out by
WSTEC labor.   All of these amount to about US$2.6 million.  Purchases of
fertilizer and chemicals would be made following ICB procedures according to
IDA guidelines. Assurances were obtained that Government would seek IDA's
agreement prior to approving the terms of reference and appointing the
subject matter specialists.
3.22      Of the components to be financed from other sources:  (a) planting
material would be procured under contract with private firms and research
stations in the very few countries which are expected to have available
supplies of the desired varieties; (b) isolated nurseries would be established
by WSTEC in Savaii; (c) buildings would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally; and (d) the aerophotographic survey would be
contracted by LSD.
3.23      Road building and improvements (US$8.6 million) would be carried
out by SPDC on force account because SPDC: (a) already has the necessary
management and material capability in place to undertake the road works
planned under the project; and (b) is expected to do these for a lower cost
(using commercial costing) than any other contractor given that they have the
organization and the machinery in place (as opposed to potential foreign



- 22 -
,i IJlers, which do not), and in the absence of other Western Samoan private or
public road construction companies. Additionally, the total road investments
contemplated of about US$8.6 million would be spread over a three- to four-year
period making it unattractive for international competitive bidding. The
three- to four-year work program would enable SPDC to gain further experience,
strengthen its organization and management and improve and increase its
equipment and other facilities.
3.24       The terms of reference for the consultants for the monitoring/evalua-
tion, in-depth village analyses and preparation of a second development phase
would be agreed with IDA. Assurances were obtained on this.
3.25       Assurances on procurement procedures to be followed for IDA-financed
project components were also obtained at negotiations.
Disbursements
3.26       Disbursements would be made retroactively from EEC's Special Action
Account for 90% of initial road construction costs. Disbursements from the
IDA credit would be made against appropriate documents on the basis of:
(a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of fertilizer, chemicals, and equipment;
(b) 42% of the balance of cost of field development; (c) 70% of studies,
preparation of a second phase and monitoring/evaluation costs; and (d) 60% of
civil works for roads (after EEC credit has been fully disbursed). Disburse-
ments for land clearing could be made based on certificates of expenditures
only when it is considered essential for expediting disbursements, documentation
for which would be retained by WSTEC and made available for review by a
supervision mission. Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30,
1986. An estimated schedule of disbursements is summarized in Table 5
below.

Accounts and Audits
3.27      Government's and WSTEC's fiscal year is from January 1 to
December 31. External auditing would be carried out by the Government's Audit
Office which is performing well. Assurances were obtained that participating
agencies would maintain separate project accounts and that audited project
and agency accounts would be furnished to IDA within six months of the close
of each fiscal year.
4. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
4.01      Western Samoa's planning and implementation capabilities are limited
as is to be expected of a country which only recently embarked for the first
time on a vigorous development effort. As a result agricultural development
planning has largely consisted of a list of projects financed by bilateral
aid of a short-term nature bearing little relation to one another and imple-
mentation (for example, the VDP, para 2.06) is generally poor.
4.02      The proposed project has been conceived as a first stage of a
long-term development program which would establish the development priorities
and make more effective use of public entities' capabilities and domestic and
external sources of technical support and finance. The main mechanism for
doing these would be an inter-agency agricultural development committee (the
Steering Committee) which would be the highest project authority, and which
would also be made responsible for the effective coordination, review and
updating and improvement of the country's development objectives, strategy
and implementation.
Summary of Management Arrangements
4.03      Project management responsibilities would be as follows:  (a) a
Steering Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister and consisting of the
Directors of the Treasury, Departments of Agriculture and Economic Development,
Rural Development Division, Public Works Department, Marketing Boards, Lands
and Surveys Department and WSTEC's General Manager would be responsible for
setting policy, inter-agency coordination, budget approval, overall review
and supervision, contract monitoring and evaluation; (b) WSTEC's General
Manager would be responsible for overall day-to-day project management and
specifically for planting material, nurseries, field development and technical
assistance through a field operations coordinator. He would work closely
with RDD and PWD, which would be responsible for village area development and
for project-related roads, respectively; (c) DOA and RCTA would provide ad
hoc technical support to the project's research and technical assistance
activities; (d) the Marketing Boards and WSTEC would sell the project-induced
production; (e) LSD would contract and supervise the aerophotographic survey;
and (f) preparation of a second development phase would be jointly carried
out by the relevant agencies under RDD's direction. A project management
organization is given in Chart 2.



- 24 -
Institution Building
4.04      Agricultural Services.  The project aims at the strengthening of
WSTEC as the leading agency to bring about essential technology and management
improvements to Western Samoan agriculture and of DOA as the Government line
agency with responsibility for seed multiplication, research and extension.
WSTEC's estate management would be substantially improved through the training
abroad of 12 members of its staff. Additionally, WSTEC would develop the
technical capability to work with updated methods of agricultural husbandry
for both permanent tree, and annual crops. Given that WSTEC resources would
be substantially involved with the project assurances were obtained that:
(a) WSTEC would not, during the project period, enter any new activities or
substantially expand any of its present activities without prior consultation
with IDA; and (b) because of the important role of WSTC's General Manager,
the Government would consult IDA prior to the appointment of any new General
Manager. DOA will receive assistance from the UN and under bilateral aid to
help reorient DOA's objectives, policies and procedures, as well as to
strengthen DOA's management and technical capabilities.
4.05      These are major steps in the right direction.  However, it would be
time-consuming not only to agree on recommendations but to have these accepted
by Government and substantially implemented. In view of the above and given
the importance and urgency of carrying out the objectives of the project
a Government directive has been issued to enable WSTEC for up to five years to
import improved planting material, establish and operate nurseries and
provide research and extension services for the purpose of the project in
Savaii. To ensure that WSTEC will indeed relinquish these duties on time and
that DOA will be in a position to take them up, assurances were obtained
that: (a) Government would endeavor to improve DOA's performance in the
above fields in the interim making full use of the assistance to be provided;
and (b) research and extension staff and facilities developed under the
project would progressively be made available to DOA beginning with four
field technicians in project year three as warranted by the latter's improved
capabilities with specific transfers of duties to be decided by the project's
Steering Committee. The above should not exclude a continuing WSTEC contri-
bution to plant material multiplication, applied research and potential
support to villages given WSTEC's preeminent position and experience, as well
as contributions by RCTA. The coordination of efforts by WSTEC, RCTA and DOA
on these and related fields would be carried out by the Steering Committee.
Assurances were also obtained on these.

4.06      Roads.  The SPDC has developed over the last few years as an
efficient autonomous public entity and has performed adequately under the
IDA-supported road project in Upolu. Because of SPDC's obvious advantages
(para. 3.23) it would be awarded by PWD the road construction and improvement
subcomponents. This would be an important instance of the project's insti-
tution building goals. PWD is already being strengthened under bilateral aid
and, therefore, does not require additional support at this time.
4.07      Short-Term Credit.  WSDB has expanded its lending substantially in
the last three years, mostly for medium and long term purposes. Arrears (now
at 10% of total loan volume outstanding) have also begun to increase because
of WSDB's lack of familiarity with many first time clients. Under the
project WSDB would have an opportunity for expanding taro short term lending
in Savaii through its recently established branch in Salelologa. This would
help WSDB in a new area of operations and additionally tie the bank credit
with a WSTEC marketing operation which enhances the likelihood of useful
investments and loan collection.
4.08      Other.  LSD would gain useful experience by supervising the aeropho-
tographic survey of Savaii which would be useful for subsequent development
stages. Government would benefit substantially by carrying out the project's
monitoring and evaluation, the first such instance in the country. RDD would
strengthen its information base and analyses methodology by conducting the
village in-depth studies. The project organization at village level would be
determined based on the village in-depth studies to be conducted in project
years one and two.
4.09      Summary.  In summary, the project's institution building aspects
are of primary importance. They would include the main agricultural agencies
in the country and, if successful, would be very useful in this and subsequent
development phases.
5. INPUTS AND YIELDS
Inputs
5.01      Improved planting material would be imported in the absence of any
but low-yielding and disease-prone stock in the country. Fertilizer and
chemicals would be applied according to standards applicable elsewhere in the
Pacific and Southeast Asia for similar ecological conditions, but adjustments
would be made based on results of field trials to be conducted over the
project life. Land clearing and maintenance would be done with paid (WSTEC)
and family (villagers) manual labor, with only a minimum of machinery and
equipment in line with the project's soil conservation and employment creation
objectives.

Yields
5.02      Present yields are given in para. 2.24.  The yields expected for
WSTEC estates are given below. Yields projected for participating villages
(up to 500 ac beginning in year 3) would be about 75% (copra) and 65%
(cocoa) of yields obtained by WSTEC.
5.03      Copra yield estimates are as follows:

24-28                              1.33
5.04      Cocoa and coffee yield estimates are:

21-25                             1,200              900
5.05      The taro yield estimates are 7.25 MT/ac for the first year and
4.5 MT/ac for the second year based on past and present average yield levels
obtained in the country.
6.  MARKETING, PRICES, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND COST RECOVERY
Marketing
6.01      Practically all the incremental project production would be exported,
both from WSTEC estates and also from participating villages, since the latter
already meet their food needs from their existing production. The increased



- 28 -
tree crop exports would have no impact whatsoever on world market prices
given their very small relative size. Annual incremental tree crop production
at full development in year 10 would be as follows: Copra, 3,500 MT; cocoa,
1,400 MT and coffee, 120 MT. Maximum incremental taro production in year 4
would be about 11,000 MT all of it for exports. This would require a major
marketing effort by WSTEC which has already been started.
6.02      Transportation would be made over short distances by road and ferry
to Apia harbor. Coconuts would initially be marketed as copra until the WSTEC
coconut oil mill is fully tested and efficiently operating, at which time only
coconut oil would be exported. Cocoa and coffee would be processed in WSTEC
facilities. Exports would be handled by WSTEC in consultation with the
respective marketing boards. Taro would be packed and exported by WSTEC to
new market areas being developed in the West Coast of the United States and
in Hawaii, where large Samoan population groups exist.  Inputs would be
obtained by WSTEC from private sector sources abroad. Marketing margins
between 5% and 10% of farm-gate and cif prices for both inputs and output
appear reasonable given costs and risks involved. The improved coastal road
in Savaii should reduce transport costs and improve producers' income almost
to the full extent of savings since WSTEC would be supplying the service at
cost.
Prices
6.03      The Bank forecasts relatively stable copra prices at US$495/MT
through 1990 declining slowly thereafter. Cocoa prices are forecast as
steadily declining to US$0.58/lb through 1990 continuing a slow decline in the
1990s. The opposite trend is expected for robusta coffee, the price of which is
expected to improve slowly up to US$1.18/lb by 1990. Farm gate prices in 1990
are based on the above, and are estimated to be 85%, 90%, and 85% of fob
prices Apia for copra, cocoa and coffee respectively. These relatively high
farm gate prices are due to high quality WSTEC processing standards, short
transportation distances, the absence of middlemen and small port handling
cl-rges. The taro price is estimated at US$0.09/lb at farm-gate in line with
r--ent levels which are deemed representative.
Impact on WSTEC
6.04      WSTEC's project cash flow projections are given in Table 8e
The cash flow shows a cumulative deficit of WS$2.3 million (US$3.4 million)
by 1988 diminishing substantially thereafter until by 1994 net surpluses
begin accumulating rapidly. At December 31, 1977 WSTEC's reserves amounted
to WS$3.5 million (US$5.1 million). Given this and expected profits from
1978 onward, and assuming no new major self-financed capital investments (an
assurance to this effect was obtained), WSTEC should have no difficulties in
financing the project cash flow deficit through 1988. Any profits from taro
salas would increase WSTEC's net income above the cash flow projections.
Impact on Participating Villages
( 05      A typical 3 ac village family holding under coconuts would show
the financial results presented in Table 9. The cash flow shows substantial
i ^-remental operating income of more than WS$300 (US$450) p.a. above the

income to be derived from traditional coconut plantings in virgin lands (the
most likely alternative) at maturity due to copra yields which are five times
on average higher than those of traditional plantings. Assuming no changes
in home consumption (valued at US$1,300 per family p.a.) and off-farm income
(estimated at US$60 per family p.a.) the projected cash income increase would
raise the per capita income level of beneficiaries from all sources from
US$247 p.a. to about US$325 or somewhat above the US$290 poverty line after
repayment of loans by villagers.
Impact on Government Finances
6.06      Government's projected cash flow is given in Table 10.  The
cash flow shows that Government's total commitment of US$2.1 million by 1985
would be recovered six years later and would be followed by sustained increased
revenues even assuming no increases on present rates of taxes and duties.
Cost Recovery
6.07      All estate and on-farm investment costs including planting material,
field plantings, and incremental staffing, would be recovered from WSTEC as
loan repayments and from participating villages as short term loan repayments
(taro) and either through cess and export duties or through loan repayment
(permanent tree crops).
6.08      The costs of nurseries, technical assistance, coastal road improve-
ments, monitoring/evaluation, aerophotographic survey, village in-depth studies
and preparation of a second development phase would largely benefit village
smallholder development in the whole country in this and subsequent development
stages. Given the low income levels of villagers and the difficulties of
apportioning costs among villages, no attempt would be made by Government to
recover these costs directly, but they would be recovered at a compound 8% rate
of interest through export duties (Table 10).

7. BENEFITS, RISKS AND JUSTIFICATION
Benefits
7.01      Project benefits are manyfold, e.g. technological, management/
institution-building and economic. These benefits would accrue to Western
Samoa at a particularly critical juncture when traditional agriculture is no
longer able to sustain, let alone improve the standard of living of the vast
majority of the people, the subsistence farmers. Furthermore, the project
represents the first instance of a recently adopted Government strategy which
addresses the basic short and long term development needs of the country.
7.02      As noted in Section V the project at full development in year 10
would result in substantial increased production in WSTEC and village areas
in Savaii. The importance of this incremental production is more clearly
perceived when compared to 1977 export volumes as follows:

Since coffee production is consumed locally at present the incremental project
production of about 1,200 MT would open up exports for the first time in
Western Samoa. An additional project benefit would be the increased standar-
dization and quality control of copra, cocoa and coffee processing under
WSTEC management, which are likely to result in wider acceptance of these
products. Last, and most importantly, the project would lay the foundation
for future rural development in the country.
Project Beneficiaries
7.03      Project beneficiaries would be WSTEC, and the general economy and
the public sector through WSTEC, as well as 1,500 subsistence farm families.
The latter would benefit by marketing up to 11,000 MT of taro by the fifth
project year when village production would replace WSTEC production as the
agency phases out its taro intercropping.
7.04      Additionally, up to 20 villages comprising 150/200 subsistence
families would benefit from the planned village permanent tree crop plantings.
About 600 workers would be employed full time by WSTEC in land clearing and
field maintenance operations.

Economic Analysis
7.05      The estimated economic rates of return would be as follows:
coconut 13%, cocoa 13.5% and coffee 14.5%, and include the costs and benefits
of the taro interplantings. The overall project's economic rate of return is
estimated at 13.5% over a 25-year period (Annex 2, Tables 1 to 4).
7.06      The above estimates are based on the following assumptions:
(a) a shadow field manual labor wage at two thirds of market wages.
This is justified by the very high rate of village underemployment;
(b) an allocation to the project of only 70% of the technical assistance
costs based on the proportion of time to be spent by the experts on
the project per se as opposed to future village development;
(c) costs and benefits adjusted to take into account transfer payments,
such as export and import duties; and
(d) traded goods valued at border prices and a standard conversion
factor of 0.82 applied to non-traded items to account for exchange
rate distortions.
7.07      The two most probable and relevant variables affecting the project
are the amount of marketable taro and shipping costs. The impact of taro
marketing on the project is dealt with elsewhere (para. 7.09). With regard
to the present excessively high shipping costs (which represent from 40% to
110% of f.o.b. costs of fertilizer and chemicals) these should be reduced
significantly with PFL's start of operations (para. 2.14). These two variables,
other possible factors and their impact on the project, are summarized below.
Table 12: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Resulting economic
Variables and changes                                    rate of return
(%)
Taro production 50% lower                                             11.5
Input shipping costs 50% lower                                        17.5
Tree crop prices or production volume 10% lower                        9.5
The most realistic assumption is that possible changes will not take place in
isolation. Anticipated combinations of changes would keep the economic rate of
return between 11.5% and 15.5%, which is satisfactory, especially given the
pilot nature of the project.
Project Risks
7.0-9     The project presents substantial risks of an institutional/socio-
lc, -al nature as it is the first major, coordinated attempt at agricultural
development in Western Samoa. Project design has attempted to minimize these



- 35 -
by utilizing resources in stages taking into consideration the degree to which
they can effectively be used, e.g. WSTEC's primary role in introducing the
technology package progressively, giving way to villagers as they are able to
incorporate this technology. However, a substantial institutional risk
remains due to possible delays in obtaining the planting material by Government,
present managerial weaknesses in WSTEC and the degree of uncertainty regarding
changes affecting the traditional village structure and villagers' nlotivations.
The project provides flexibility in tackling these by making it possible to
carry out implementation with varying degrees of WSTFC and village participation
depending on their ability to respond to project requirements.
7.09      A second major category of risks concern the marketing of the
project's incremental taro production for export. This depends on WSTEC
efforts started in mid-1978 to open new taro consumption centers among the
40,000/60,000 Samoans living in Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States.
Indications are that these Samoans still retain their preference for taro as
their main source of bulk carbohydrate Fe(0d.
Environmental Impact
7.10      The areas to be developed under the project are presently under
primary or secondary forest in WSTEC estates and additionally under old
coconut trees in villages.  The project would prevent uncontrolled shifting
cultivation in highly erodable undulating terrain by replacing existing
forests, scrub and old trees with permanent tree crops and cover crops in a
stable, long lasting, agricultural system which will preserve soil and other
ecological conditions.
Role of Women
7.11      Women play important roles in the harvesting of taro and of permanent
tree crops. In its traiatiag a,id extension activities the project would
endeavor to assist women as much as men. This would be facilitated by WSTEC's
policy of providing equal opportunities to men and women for recruitment,
training and promotion.
8.  ASSTJRANCFS OBTAINED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Assurances were obtained from Government as follows:
(a) WSTEC would endeavour to find new markets for -incremental taro
production of Savaii villages and would ensure that about one third



- 36 -
of the total marketable incremental production would be allocated
to Savaii villages if supply from village sources were adequate
(para. 3.13);
(b) terms of reference for the in-depth village studies would be sub-
mitted to IDA for comments (para. 3.16);
(c) it would submit to IDA before the end of project year two a
proposal for self-financing of tree crop development in village
areas. A definitive financing arrangement should be in place
before the first village tree crop plantings are made under the
project (para. 3.20); and it would have WSDB supply short-term
funds for Savai'i taro plantings agreed by WSTEC under the project
(para. 3.20);
(d) Government would obtain IDA's agreement before approving the terms
of reference and appointing the subject matter specialists (para.
3.21) and the consultants (para. 3.24);
(e) procurement procedures for IDA-financed items would be agreed with
IDA (paras. 3.22 to 3.24);
(f) participating agencies would maintain separate project accounts
and these together with WSTEC's audited overall accounts would be
furnished to IDA within six months of the close of each fiscal year
(para. 3.27);
(g) during the project period, WSTEC would not start any new activities
or expand substantially any of its existing activities or change
the general manager without prior consultation with IDA (para.
4.04); and
(h) the Government would provide for the transfer of research and
extension responsibilities back to DOA beginning in project year
three at the discretion of the Steering Commitee. Government would
also take the necessary action to enable DOA to take over nurseries,
research and extension from WSTEC (para. 4.05). The Steering
Committee would coordinate seed multiplication, research and exten-
sion among DOA, WSTEC and RCTA (para. 4.05).
8.02      Given the above assurances, the project is suitable for an IDA
credit of US$8 million
