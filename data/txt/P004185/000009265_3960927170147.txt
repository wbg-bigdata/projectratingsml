MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC FOR
A NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Development
Credit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) of SDR 2.7 million
(US$3.5 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and would help finance
a National Polytechnic Institute Project. The project would be cofinanced by
the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) which would provide a grant of SwF
20.8 million (US$13.0 million equivalent).
2.       Background.  Lao PDR has expanded its education system since 1975
from a narrow base (25? enrollment or primary school age group and virtually
nonexistent secondary and higher education) to enrollment ratios in 1985 of
81? at tho primary, 13? at the secondary and 1.3Z at the higher levels.
Simultaneously, vocational and technical training have also been expanded with
bilateral assistance. These investments were necessary because one of the
critical constraints to the country's development has been an extreme shortage
of skilled manpower. However, although general educational coverage has been
broadened, the quality of the programs remains poor. Also, higher education
has received inadequate attention and needs further assistance to provide the
professional-level manpower required to meet the country's development objec-
tives. Until recently, higher education in Lao PDR was available only in the
fields of medicine, education and higher technician training, provided in
institutions attached to technical ministries. Engineers were trained
overseas at a high cost. The opening of the National Polytechnic Institute
(NPI) in temporary facilities in 1984 was a direct response to the need to
develop local capacity for the training of engineers to better respond to
national manpower needs. Critical shortages of engineers exist in the indus-
try, agriculture, transport, and electricity sectors and for the management of
the productive sectors. These shortages are a major constraint on the
efficiency of the Laotian economy.
3.       Government Strategy.  During the years 1980-85, the main objective of
the Government was to expand education participation to a level comparable to
that of neighboring countries. Primary and vocationalltechnical education
received the bulk of government support. Toward the end of this period,
emphasis was also given to secondary education. A large part of the financial
burden for primary and secondary expansion was covered by parents, with
limited financial support from the national and provincial administrations.
Vocationalltechnical education development was primarily supported by
government funds. For the Second Five-Year Development Plan, the Ministry of
Education, Culture and Sports (MOE) has prepared a Sector Development Strategy
(1988-95), the draft of which indicates that major education sector goals will
include: (a) enlargement of national training opportunities at the higher
level to alleviate the most acute manpower shortages in the productive
sectors- (b) improvement of the quality of vocational training by establishing



- 2 -
closer links with industry and government parastatals through the Introduction
of apprenticeship and management training programst (c) emph4sis on the
quality rather than quantity of general education, which requires more funds
to be directed towards learning materials, teacher upgrading and Increased
basic education coverage in the rural areas;il and ld) a more equitable
subsectoral distribution of resources by revision of the budgetary structure
of the MOE and identification of alternative sources of financing for the
sector. The above sector goals are well formulated and fit the needs and
potential of the country.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  This would be the first Bank Group
education operation in Lao PDR. Previously, the Government we reluctant to
borrow, even on IDA terms, for investment in the sector. To date, the
Government has reeeived little external assistance in higher education
although it is receiving assistance from UNICEF, UNESCO, the Swedish
International Development Agency and Eastern Bloc Countries in primary and
secondary education. However, because the Government accords high priority to
the expansion and improvement of the NPI, it has requested that IDA assist
with this project, in order to benefit from its project preparation and
implementation capabilities and its ability to mobilize substantial grant
assistance for education development. IDA involvement would assist in
alleviating major higher level manpower shortages, and would also provide an
opportunity for IDA to expand its knowledge and initiate policy dialogue on
education issues.
5.       Proiect Obiectives and Scope.  The proposed project would produce
about 850 trained engineers and 2,510 trained higher technicians by 1995 in
the basic disciplines required for development. This supply would help reduce
shortages of professional manpower in Lao PDR, particularly in the industry,
agriculture and transport sectors. Specifically, the project woulds
(a) Increase the supply of engineersl (b) Improve the planning, management and
quality of the existing engineer training programs now operating in temporary
facilities; (c) promote the integration and coordination of higher technical
education programs now provided by various ministries by creating a joint
NPI/Industry Council whose membership would include representatives of all
ministries and industrial enterprises employing NPI graduates; and
(d) initiate studies to assess how the quality, coverage and financing of
education could be further Improved.
6.       The project would, over a six-year period, provides  (a) general and
specialized facilities; (b) equipment; (c) furnitures (d) instructional
materials; (e) fellowshipst and (f) technical assistance for the RPI to teach
1/ At present primary level attendance is lOOZ in urban areas with schools
offering six years of education. Rural schools, on the other hand,
have a gross enrollment ratio of only 50-601 and almost 50S of the
schools offer caly two years of basic education, whereas four years is
universally recognized as necessary for literacy maintenance.



-3-
four specializations: electrical. mechanical, and civil engineering, and
economics/management. The project would replace inadequate existing
facilities and supply required workshops and laboratories, without which the
NPI engineering program cannot adequately provide training for the four
engineering specializations. Inadequate furniture would be replaced and
equipment would be provided. Instructional materials would be purchased
externally and produced locally. Fellowship training abroad would be provided
to upgrade a sufficient number of NPI staff (which now includes 32 qualified
engineers and 28 graduate teachers) to the required post-graduate level.
Staff training would also be provided at the Institute by project technical
assistance. To improve NPI's links with practicing engineers, upgrading and
in-service courses would be offered. To facilitate the training of existing
staff and improve the quality of NPI's management, technical assistance would
be supplied through a link university, where a high percentage of NPI staff
would study. Funds would be included for studies on education finance;
efficiency and quality issues in higher education, particularly in vocational
and technical areas; efficiency of secondary education as preparation for
admission t) higher education; the external efficiency of NPI programs; and
preparation of possible future investmeuts in education and human resource
development. The project would be administered by MOE and monitored by a
joint NPI/Industry Council comprising representatives from central and line
ministries and industry.
7.       Financing Plan.  Project costs total US$18.7 million equivalent
including US$3.4 million local and US$15.3 million foreign costs. The project
would be financed as follows: (a) the proposed IDA Credit of US$3.5 million
equivalent would cover 192 of total project costs, net of taxes; (b) the Swiss
Development Cooperation (SDC) would finance SwF20.8 million (US$13.0 million
equivalent) or 712 of total project costs, net of taxes, and (c) the
Government would finance the remaining costs of US$2.2 million equivalent (10?
of total net costs and all taxes estimated at US$0.5 million equivalent). The
Government would gradually assume financing of incremental recurrent costs
during the project period, to reach about two thirds of recurrent costs by
project completion; the remainder of such costs would be covered through
student payments for books and other services. To avoid delays in
implementation, provision has also been made for use of US$200,000 under the
Project Preparation Facility for the preparation of a master plan,
architectural designs, equipment specifications, and mobilization and initial
operation of the technical assistance team. Upon credit effectiveness, thee
funds would be repaid to IDA from the SDC grant on behalf of the Borrower. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. To
supplement the financing proposed under the project, the Goverment of France
is expected to provide up to US$4.0 million equivalent in technical
assistance, fellowships, equipment and educational materials that would
enhance the quality and relevance of training through professional application
programs mainly in laboratories and workshops.
8.       IDA would administer disbursement of SDC funds and provide project
monitoring and supervision in accordance with the cofinancing agreement
between Switzerland and IDA dated April 9, 1987. In order to ensure timely
availability of funds and to minimize delays in Credit and SDC disbursements,
two special accounts would be established with authorized allocations of



US$200,000 for IDA and 1.1 ml lion Swiss francs for SDC. Amounts and methods
of procurement and diebursements, and the disbursement schedule are show. in
Schedule S. A timetable of key project processing events and a list of Bank
Group operations in Lao PDR are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map of 'ao PDR is also attached, and the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 7426-LA)
is being distributed separately.
9.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government ont
(a) membership and functions of the NPI/Industry Council and its estab-
lishment by January 1, 1990;
(b)  inclusion of the English language in NPI training programst
(e) the number and types of overseas and local training programs, and the
trainee selection criteria to be used;
(d) the terms of reference and a timetable for consultant services and
overseas and local training, and criteria and procedures applicable
to staff selection for award of fellowships.
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it woulds
(e) review, within the framework of its salary adjustments, the
compensation of the NPI staff with a view to keeping such
compensation as competitive as possible with that of the Industrial
and parastatal engineers. This review would be undertaken at mid-
term and end of the project; and
(f) gradually assume the incremental recurrent costs of operating NPI in
accordance with a schedule agreed with IDA so as to reach about two
thirds of these costs by June 30, 1995 and thereafter.
10.      Benefits and Risks.  The principal benefits of the proposed project
would bes (a) lower-cost and more appropriate engineer trainingg (b) more
efficient use of NPI zaanpower and facilities; and (c) better control over the
placement and retention of graduates, resulting in more efficient implementa-
tion of national development programs, A major risk would be possible imple-
mentation delays due to the MOE's inexperience with IDA procedures. There-
fore, project design has been kept as simple as possible, and substantial
technical asbistance would be provided to strengthen the implementation capa-
bilities of the MDE. Another risk is that it might be time consuming, based
on past experience, to obtain Government approval for implementation of tech-
nical assistance and fellowship programs. To reduce the latter risk, a link
with a Swiss polytechnic institute has been proposed. The institute would be
responsible for the coordination of short- and long-term technical assistance
and the organization of overseas fellowships.



11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
