LAO PDR
NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:                 Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)
Beneficiary:              Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MOE)
Amount:                   SDR2.7 million (US$3.5 million equi\.ilent)
Terms:                    Standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity.
Cofinancing:              Swiss Development Cjoperation, SwF20.8 million
(US$13.0 million equivalent)
Project Obiectives:       The project would support the Government's objective
of reducing shortages of professional manpower in
Laos, by training engineers in the basic disciplines
required for development. The project would: (a)
increase capacity to supply the needed engineers; (b)
improve the planning, management and quality of the
present engineer training programs; (c) promote the
integration and coordination of higher technician
training programs; and (d) initiate analysis of
issues in the education sector.
Project Description:      The project would rehabilitate general facilities and
would provide specialized instructional facilities,
e;uipment, furniture, instructional materials,
fellowships and technical assistance, at the existing
site of *he National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
Four pr, essional specializations would be included:
electrica., mechanical, civil engineering, and
management/economic engineering. The project would
also improve the higher technician training programs
in these fields. NPI would be placed under one
administration and would have the capacity to train
about 700 engineers, under a six year program (1
preparatory year and five years of engineering) and
about 1,100 higher technicians under two to three
year programs. Students would be admitted on the
basis of an entrance examination, primarily in
mathematics and physics. For engineering, NPI now
employs about 100 teachers and administrators, of
whom 32 hold engineering degrees. As a priority,
staff training would be provided to upgrade
professional skills and train the teachers required.
Technical assistance would be provided for teaching,
adapting teaching materials and managing the project.



- vi -
Funds would be included for studies to assess how the
quality, coverage and financing of the education
system could be improved. The project would be
administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and
monitored by a joint NPI/Industry Council comprising
representatives from Planning, Finance, line
ministries and representatives from industry, to
ensure that its programs respond to the training
needs of the country.
Benefits and Risks:       The principal benefits of the proposed project would
be: (a) lower-cost and appropriate engineer
training; (b) more efficient use of NPI manpower and
facilities; and (c) better control over the placement
and retention of graduates, resulting in more
efficient implementation of national development
programs. A major risk is that imiplementation delays
could occur due to the MOE's inexperience with IDA
procedures. Therefore, project design has been kept
as simple as possible, and substantial technical
assistance would be provided to strengthen the
implementation capabilities of the MOE in particular.
Another risk is that, based on past experience, it
might be time consuming to obtain Government approval
for implementation of project technical assistance
and fellowship programs. To reduce the latter risk,
a link with a Swiss polytechnic institute has been
proposed. This institute would be responsible for
the coordination of both short- and long-term
technical assistance and the organization of overseas
fellowships, has been proposed.

LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE PROJECT
I. THE ECONOMY
1.1      A Country Economic Memorandum report (No. 7188-LA, dated
September 21, 1988) reviews recent economic developments in 1982-87 and
prospects for economic growth during the 1988-95 period.
Development Constraints
1.2      The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a landlocked
country with an area of 236,800 sq km. With an estimated per capita income of
approximately US$160 in 1986, it is one of the poorest countries in the world,
despite important resources of land, timber and minerals and its potential for
hydroelectric power. Most of the country's 3.6 million people live in small
ar-d scattered villages. The structure of production and employment is
dominated by agriculture, which accounts for about 651 of GDP and provides
about 80% of total employment. The predominant crop is rice, which takes up
more than 80X of the cultivated area. The industrial sector is small, contri-
buting about 10.12 of GDP, and it consists mainly of tin and gypsum mining,
electricity production, small enterprises processing local raw materials,
particularly food and wood, and consumer goods industries serving largely the
Vientiane area. The other productiva sectors--construction, transport and
trade--also provide each only a small share of GNP.
1.3      At such low levels of production, the Lao PDR generates few exports
and has very low national savings, with the result that it is almc.t totally
dependent upon external assistance to finance its development prog-ram. This
dependence is reflected in a current account deficit of about 222 of GDP in
1987 and an import bill of which only 301 is covered by exports. The deficit
has been financed by external assistance amounting to US$114 million p.a. on
average in 1985-87. About 9OZ of capital inflows originate from socialist
countries.
1.4      The development strategy of the Lao PDR was shaped by two major
constraints stemming from the landlocked geographical position of the country
and the restrictions affecting transit of goods to and from the Lao PDR. Due
to limited opportunities for international trade and high transport costs, the
prospective returns to investment in the industrial sector were generally low.
The Gcvernment's industrial policy was therefore to invest selectively in only
a few export-oriented subsectors slich as electricity, wood processing and
mining.
Recent Economic Developments
1.5      The record of economic growth has generally been encouraging but
uneven in a number of sectors. During the 1982-86 period, GDP increased at
6.42 p.a. in constant prices mainly because of rapid growth in agriculture and



industry. Agricultural growth (6.3X p.a.) reflecLed primarily an increase in
paddy yields. Industrial growth (11.4Z p.a.) was rapid but uneven. After
falling sharply in 1982-84, manufactur'ig output recovered in 1985-87 partly
because of increased availability of r. materials and partly because of the
impact of the new system of state enterprise management implemented since
1985. The Lao PDR's domestic market for industrial goods did not increase
much in the early eighties due to limited import substitution, and also
because linkages with other sectors did not expand. As a result, growth has
been rapid onl, in the export-oriented industrial subsectors such as mining or
electricity.
1.6      The construction subsector which accounts for about 3Z of GDP grew by
19Z p.a. in real terms in 1982-86. The rapid growth was associated with large
state investment in road construction. The transport sector increased at a
rate of 5.4% p.a. which waR below GDP growth. This unusual result reflected
the internal restrictions imposed until recently on the movement of goods,
particularly rice, among provinces.
1.7      In 1987, GDP is estimated to have slowed down to 2.2%, owing largely
to a severe drought which caused a serious shortfall in rice output and in the
production of electricity, the country's largest export earner. However, the
growth momentum wAs sustained and even increased in the other sectors. Manu-
facturing output continued to rise while transport, construction and commerce
activities increased at a faster rate, largely because of the comprehensive
reform of the management of the economy that was initiated in 1987.
1.8      Encouraged by the reportedly good results of the new management
system that had been introduced in a few state enterprises, the Government
decided irn 1987 to extend it to nearly all state enterprises. Under this new
policy, state enterprises are to become self-financing and able to determine
their own employment, wages, and investment, but would not receive any
government subsidies.  At the same time, increased financial incentives are
being provided to improve state enterprises' efficiency/profitab'lity. New
pricing policies stipulate that all prices should reflect market conditions,
and in particular that nearly all official prices would be aligned at the
level of parallel market prices. This policy--referred to as the one-price
policy--is also to apply to the exchange rate.
1.9      In addition to reforming the system of state enterprise management,
new economic and financial policies are being implemented. Concerning trade,
internal restrictions on the transport of goods were lifted and the scope for
private sector exports and imports was widened. Firms are allowed to retain
part of their foreign exchange earnings in order to import raw materials
needed for export, and a greater number of firms were authorized to export or
import directly. Concerning monetary policy, in 1988 Government introduced a
reform of the banking sector designed to strengthen the role of the State
Bank, establish several autonomous commercial banks and improve the private
sector's access to credit.

1.1.0    These developments were reflected in the goverrtment budget.  Since
1985, budgeta,v revenues increased from 24.52 of GDP to 31.2Z in 1987 because
of increased nonfiscal revenues (transfers from 3tate enterprises). In 1987,
however, a tax reform, takin- into account the new relationships between the
government budget and state enterprises, was introduced. Its objective is to
replace the previous system of the state enterprises' transfers to the budget
with fiscal revenues. This involves a reform of profit taxation, personal
Income taxation and indirect taxes.
1.11     Following a substantial increase in 1985 owing to large price and
wage adjustments, current expenditures remained stable at about 252 of GDP,
whereas development expenditures fell from 24.22 of GDP in 1985 to 17.82 of
GDP in 1987. As a result of these developments, the overall budgetary deficit
declined from 25.42 of GDP to 12.8Z over the 1985-87 period.
1.12     Inflation was high in the mid-1980s, and reached 1152 in 1985 due
mainly to the upward adjustment of official prices. But it abated to 352 in
1986 and to about 62 in 1987. The moderation in inflation was due largely to
improvements in the domestic supply situation, resulting from better
transportation facilities and increased imports of consumer goods. Although
external debt increased by about 702 in 1984-87, the debt service ratio fell
from 222 of exports of goods and services in 1985 to 132 in 1987, owing mainly
to a reduction in fund repurchases and debt rescheduling with some bilateral
donors.
Development Prospects
1.13     The Lao PDR has important economic potential because of its resource
base of land, timber, minerals and hydroelectric power. During the 1986-90
Development Plan period, there could be substantial further economic growth,
but it will require a difficult action program both in terms of development
strategy and socialist system management. In the short term, the most
pressing problems that need to be addressed are the lack of foreign exchange
and the low utilization levels, and thus low productivity, of existing
resources. The Government has initiated a program of structural reforms
directed att
(a) Increasing savings by state enterprises, individual farms and Central
Government. The principal measures to achieve this objective would
be improvement of agricultural taxation, implementatio!n of key
measures ccncerning the public enterprise management system and
adjustment of official producer and retail prices.
(b)  Increasing the efficiency of investment by greater decentralization
of investment and production decisions to the enterprise and
individual farm levels; greater emphasis on the maintenance and
selected rehabilitation of existing roads; diversification of crops;
improved economic evaluation of projects; and greater emphasis on
education and training.



(c) Promoting exports, particularly forestry, agricultural and mining
products over the 1986-90 period, and of electricity exports over the
medium- to long-run, provided large external financing could be
mobilized and export markets identified.
1.14     As the reforms take place, GDP could rise by about 52 p.a. in the
next five years. Therefore, the Bank Group strategy is threefold: (a) to
undertake a carefully focused program of economic work to lend support to
efforts to restructure the economy through our dialogue with Government;
(b) to ensure that existing IDA-supported projects are properly implemented
and that the benefits from these investments are realized as rapidly as
possible; and (c) to identify and prepare a suitable pipeline of projects in.
sectors that support the goals of the Government's five-year plan and
subsequent development programs to provide a vehicle through which sector
policy and institutional discussions can be held.
II.  HIGHER TECHNICAL MANPOWER SUBSECTOR
Employment Profile
2.1      According to the 1985 census, out of a population of 3.6 million, 1.7
million or 46X are of work age, i.e., 800,000 men between the ages of 16 and
60 and 900,000 women between the ages of 15 to 55. It is estimated that 802
of the employed are in the agricultural sector (about 1.4 million persons)
with a little more than 2? for the secondary productive sectors (13,600 in
industry and craft trades, 3,400 in mining and 20,400 distributed equally
between construction and public utilities). The tertiary sector accounted for
almost 182 of employment, mainly in general government (central, provincial
and municipal services), with 254,100 civil servants and government officials,
as compared to another 39,000 whose main occupation was commercial. Overall
employment is expected to increase at an average rate of 3? annually, to about
2.3 million persons in 1995 and about 2.6 million in the year 2000. It is
expected that the share of the agricultural sector will be slightly reduced
(78? and 77Z), and that of government services will stabilize (15.1? and
15.2Z). Sustained growth is expected in the secondary sectors (industry,
mining, construction, and public utilities) and tertiary associated sectors
(transport and commerce) namely 6.9? and 7.8?, respectively. Details
including the share of the formal 1/ sector are set out in Annex 1. In 1986,
with a total of 128,200 jobs, the formal sector represented 7.5? of total
employment. The structure of the formal sector employment is dominated by
public services with 61.5?, followed by industry (including mining and
utilities) at 19.7?, agriculture with only 8.6?, and the uther sectors
(construction, transport, commerce), with 9.7Z. The folloi*ng increases are
expected by 1995: the formal sector in agriculture should virtually triple

(1802 increase);2/ the secondary and trade sectors should double (10OZ
increase);3/ and government services should increase by about 40Z.4/
Skill Profile of the Labor Force
2.2      The 1985 census indicates that the proportion of university graduates
to total workers is 0.3Z. This level is well below other low-income Asian
countries, e.g., Bangladesh, 1.1? (1981); Pakistan, 1.7Z (1981); and Sri
Lanka, 0.82 (1981). It is more comparable to levels in Sub-Saharan Africa:
Botswana, 0.7Z (1971); Malawi, 0.3? (1976); and Rwanda, 0.3? (1978). The
principal causes for such a low ratio weret (a) the emigration of an
estimated 300,000 highly-educated Laotians after the 1975 change of regime;
and (b) a low higher-education enrollment ratJ.o due to she slow implementation
of training programs.
2.3      According to the 1985 census, the number of persons corresponding to
the classification 'higher training" tota'ls about 4,500 of which about 45Z, or
2000, are in the higher technical and engineering fields. Of that total,
about 500 can be classified as engineers. The figure of 2,000 gives a ratio
of 1.6? of the 128,200 persons in structured employment for 1986.
2.4      In absolute as well as in relative terms, the technical skilled labor
profile, in particular the higher-level technical labor profile of Laa PDR is
low by international standards. For example, in Bangladesh (1981), 3.8? of
the modern sector labor force was comprised of engineers and technicians, of
which 352 were university graduates. It is not therefore surprising that
shortages of high level technical manpower exist in all sectors of the
economy. The development of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI) under
the project will assist in reducing these shortages.
The Vocational and Technical Education System
2.5      Tte structure of the education system is depicted in Chart I.  A
description of the education system and the evolution of student enrollments
2/ In agriculture, growth will come partly from new investments and partly
from a transfer of non-formal activities to formal activities, in
particular in the context of the extension of the state farm system.
3/ Mainly by new investments.
4/  Resulting from two trends within the government sector:  the first,
being a relative contraction of civil servants resulting from the new
Government structural adjustment policy; the second, due to the
transfer of a part of non-formal government to formal employment,
especially in relation to the transfer of municipal workers.



from 1975 to 1985 are given in Annex 2. The education and training system
offers four types of vocational/technical training: semi-skilled/skilled
workers, lower and higher level technician training and engineer instruction.
Vocational schools are available at the secondary level for entrants with
eight years of basic education who follow two-year courses of training as
skilled workers. There are 14 vocational schools with an enrollment capacity
of 2,300 and an average annual output of 1,200 at the skilled worker level.
Eleven of these schools are administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE)
(Chart II), two by the Ministry o' Transport, Post and Communications and one
by the Ministry of Agriculture. The main courses offered are general and auto
mechanics, welding, construction, secretarial skills, tailoring/home
economics, agriculture and electronics. Middle level technician training
includes two to three years of technical training, following 11 years of basic
and secondary education. There are ten lower technician schools (including
the new Soviet Polytechnicum) with a capacity of 2,600 and an annual output of
700 (900 when the Polytechnicum is fully operational in 1989). Seven of these
institutions are administered by the MOE, two by the Ministry of Transport,
Post and Communications and one by the Ministry of Industry. Courses are
offered in electricity, business, advanced general mechanics and welding, auto
mechanics, agriculture, veterinary science (at the assistant level), and
geology and mining. Higher technician training consists of three to four
years of instruction after 11 years of basic and secondary education. The
higher technician level is offered in four institutions: the Electrical Tech-
nology and Electronics Institute run by the MOE, the National Building Insti-
tute run by the Ministry of Construction, the Higher School of Transport, Post
and Communications run by the Ministry of Transport, Post and Communications,
and the Higher Irrigation Training Center run by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Courses offered by these institutions are electronics, electricity, architec-
ture (at assistant level), topography/surveying, mechanics, hydrology, public
works management and bridges and roads. Enrollments at these institutions in
1985 were 1,520 in two and three year programs, with an annual output of 60 in
electronics/electricity, 200 in architectu.e/construction, and 80 in transport
and communication, for a total of about 340. Engineering training requires
five years of post secondary education. Engineer training is offered at the
NPI, under the MOE, which was established in temporary facilities in 1984 and
would be the beneficiary of this project. It now enrolls 420 students and
offers degrees in three specializations: electrical, civil and mechanical
engineering. The first NPI output of about 40 engineers is expected in 1989,
with 90 in 1990. All the above institutions, in varying degrees, experience a
lack of equipment, educational materials and shortages of qualified staff.
2.6      The current output of higher technicians is meeting the requirements
of the economy. However, there is a need to improve the coordination,
relevance and quality of the various programs. Later, a partial consolidation
of programs would be beneficial to maximize the use of the limited number of
qualified teachers, equipment and facilities, as well as to improve utiliza-
tion of costly instructional materials. Cot.sideration should also be given to
the development of retraining/upgrading courses for existing technicians whose
qualifications are not up to standard and using that avenue to select the best
for upgrading to the engineer level. To date, all higher technician graduates
have been placed, either in Government or private employment. When needs have



been greater than the output, enrollments have been increased by decision of
the State Planning Committee. In cases where output exceeded demand (first
level telecommunication trainees in 1985-1986), enrollments were reduced.
Intakes of the higher technician programs are reviewed annually. Due to
limited resources, Government makes efforts to train only those engineers and
technicians for whom employment opportunities exist. Thus, all the engineers
and higher technicians that graduate have been assured employment. However,
in view of the Government's recent decision to reduce civil service employment
and its policy of decentralized management of state enterprises, employment
will not always be assured to each gradua' e. But, due to the shortage of
skilled manpower, it is estimated that graduates will have no difficulty
finding employment. For that reason, the manpower planning mechanism for
engineers would be revised under the project (para. 2.20).
2.7      Until 1984, the only degree-awarding institutions in Lao PDR were the
medical echool, training assistant doctors, and the national teacher training
institute which produces secondary teachers. Until 1984, Lao PDR depended
totally on foreign institutions for training its engineering manpower. As the
demand for engineers grew, it became unrealistic for the country to depend
solely on foreign training programs. Therefore, in 1984, to meet the demand
for degree holding engineers, the Government, with UNESCO technical
assistance, opened the NPI in temporary facilities. As of July 1988, in its
fifth year of operation, NPI still lacked adequate workshop facilities, was
ill-equipped and the level of qualification of its staff needed upgrading.
Under these circumstances, the quality of training was weak and urgently
required upgrading.
The Demand and Supply of Higher Technical Manpower
2.8      Government estimates of demand for higher technical manpower are
based on a survey of the anticipated requirements of technical ministries
during the Second Plan period (1988-95).5/ The Association extended that
analysis by estimating the economy's overall demand for higher technical
manpower over the ten-year period which would include the Third Plan
(1995-2000). Two assumptions were adopted when forecasting the trend within
the time frame specified. First, it was established that the present ratio of
1.62 of the formal sector labor force is very low in comparison with regional
averages (para. 2.4), or even compared to international averages. Second,
based on comparator and country conditions, a target of about 32 of the formal
sector labor force should be set for the year 2000. Taking into account the
period of project execution and the relative decline in the numbers of
students sent abroad for training, the increase would be slow at the start of
the period, reaching a ratio of about 2? in 1990, and would gain pace
thereafter, reaching about 2.32 in 1995, and 2.72 in the year 2000, very close
to the 3Z comparator-based target (Annex 3).

2.9      As regards the structure of the levels of training within these
overall numbers, it was decided that in the short and medium term an average
proportion of one engineer to every three higher technicians would be the norm
appropriate to the level of economic growth projected. This average might
vary slightly from one subsector to another, with a ratio of one to two in
public utilities, and of one to four in agriculture, for example. In the long
term, the ratio might fall significantly. These estimates determine the
sectoral need for the succeeding periods: between 1991-95, a total of 615
engineers and 1,610 higher technicians; and for the 1996-2000 p2riod, 765
engineers and 2,645 higher technicians will be needed (Annex 3, page 1).
2.10     The assumptions used to determine the manpower needs are detailed in
Annex 3. For 1995, the reference year used in determining the size of the
facility for NPI for the project, there will be need for about 140 engiaLeers
and 370 higher technicians. When fully operational NPI will have an output of
110 engineers, responding to about 60X of total needs. In addition, with the
inclusion of overseas training, about 20% per year, total engineer supply will
meet 802 of demand in 1995.
2.11     To ensure effective use of NPI and to minimize training costs, it has
been determined that the specializations retained for the project would be
those which require an output of more than 20 engineers per annum.
Specializations which meet the criteria are: electrical, civil, mechanical
and management/economic engineering. Of the ongoing engineer training, now
underTay abroad, these four specializations represent about 80% (Annex 4).
Two other specializations, mining and chemical engineering, have smaller
requirements (about 10 p.a. of engineer training needs) which are closely
related to planned future investments in mining, fertilizers, and food
processing, all consisting of small numbers in man) different sub-
specializations. At present, it is more appropriate to continue to train
these groups of engineers abroad.  If the planned investments materialize and
long-term demand for mining and chemical engineers rises sufficiently to make
local training viable, the appropriate courses could theni be introduced at NPI
within a second phase expansion.
2.12     With respect to higher technician training, the existing
institutions, working in coordination with NPI (all on the same site, except
agriculture), should be able to cover almost all the training requirements at
that level. Training abroad will be necessary for only a few highly
specialized higher technician fields. For the purpose of this report, it was
assumed that in 1995, 90% of all the higher technicians would be trained in
the country.
Suitability of Existing Engineer Training Programs
2.13     The present sources of engineers are overseas training programs and
the NPI (para. 2.5). Students normally spend a period of six to seven years
overseas, including one to two years of language training and five to six
years of engineering studies.  The NPI program is expected to reduce that
training period by two years.  Lao PDR has been advised by donor countries
that the training of engineers abroad through grant financing is being phased



out. Some donors have indicated a short-term willingness to make grant
financing for fellowships fungible within the country to facilitate national
training, but in the long term, external funding for engineer training will be
limited, necessitating the development of national training capacity at NPI.
This national capacity would also better adapt the training programs to
national needs. Previously fellowships or training abroad were predetermined
according to programs existing in donor countr7 universities and by the
limited scope of the training offered.
2.14     There are also importanl educational reasons for establishing the
engineering institute in Lao PDR. Students trained in overseas educational
systems follow regular programs which are not adapted to the Laotian context
and thus lack the knowledge relevant to resolving nationa; engineering
problems. They also lack a common analytical framework and technical vocabu-
lary. The dropout rate for overseas training programs is high, estimated at
about 25Z. The dropout rate for the NPI is estimated at about 157 and should
be reduced to less than 5? through improvements introduced by the project.
The proposed development of NPI would help reduce wastage and produce
engineers who would be prepared upon graduation to assist in alleviating the
country',: most pressing problems. Although instruction at the NPI is better
geared to Laotian conditions, a lack of adequate facilities, instructional
materials and experienced staff presently reduces the quality of the output.
Coordination of Training Levels
2.15     Inadequate attention has been given to the management and
coordination of skilled training activities at the higher technical and
vocational levels. There has been a rapid expansion of the secondary
technical schools preparing semi-skilled and skilled personnel for specific
ministries. The latter expansion has increased costs and resulted in poor
quality training, shortages of qualified and experienced teachers, weak
management which depends heavily on technical assistance, and inadequate links
between the training institutes and the employers. Thus, while the pyramid
for technical education (Chart III) conforms to the standard international
configuration, the distribution of training in small institutions controlled
by four ministries has resulted in little systematic evaluation of the types
of technical skills and levels of training required for Lhe development of the
country. IDA asked the Government, prior to appraisal, to Leview the number
and role of institutions with the view to improving their efficiency and
better responding to manpower needs. As a result of that dialogue, the
Government has already transferred the Mines and Geology Institute and the
Polytechnicum from the Ministry of Industry to the MOE. In addition to
improved coordination, the Government also plans to transfer the Higher School
of Electrical Technology and Electronics, the Vocational Teacher Training
Institute and the Higher School of Transport, Post and Communications to the
MOE. Each institution would retain its existing management and the transfer
would, as a first step, improve the coordination of programs. The MOE has the
capacity to undertake the task of managing all higher technical and NPI
institutions.

Financing of Education
2.16     Over the period 1980-85, expenditure for education has been among the
most rapidly growing categories of national expenditure, increasing at a rate
of 62Z p.a., while during the same period, the total government budget
increased by 432 p.a. Education expenditure has averaged 82 of total govern-
ment expenditure and, in 1982-85, averaged 4.42 of GDP, which is relatively
significant. During this period, the total MOE budget grew at an average
annual rate of 412, with recurrent and development expenditures increasing at
approximately the same rates, 412 and 39Z, respectively. That growth is
largely explAined by the Government's policy of catcning up withi regional
averages for educational development.6/ Following yea.s of internal conflict,
the Government realized that, unless it improved access to education, the
probability of achieving the country's development goals would be remote.
Large budgetary increases were necessary so that the Lao PDR could reach
participation levels closer to those in neighboring countries. However, in
spite of that important effort, central government expenditures on education
as a percentage of total central government expenditures in 1985 were still
only about 92, as compared to the East Asia regional average of 15.92 (Annex
5).
2.17     Available data on the subsectoral distribution of education
expenditure (1983) indicate that 682 of total expenditure was allocated to
preschool and primary education, 29Z to the secondary level, and less than
3Z to higher education. The percentage of resources allocated to higher
education is on the low side, as the median for other countries is about 112
for low-investment and 202 for high-investment countries in the Region
(Annex 5). However, in the future, major education budgetary adjustments
shculd also be concentreted on improving the quality of basic and secondary
education, where higher rates of return occur. The Government will need to
find an adequate balance in allocating resources to the various education
subsectors.
Financing of Higher Education
2.18     Some progress was made recently in budgetary allocations to education
and in 1987, out of a total budget of about KN 30,075 million, national
education accounted for KN 2,890 million or 9.62 of the total of the Central
Government's budget. The following tables summarize the budgets of higher
education institutions (Table 1) and the budget of NPI, as compared to the
national education budget (Table 2).
6/ Participation rates in 1975 were estimated by UNESCO to be 20-25Z in
primary education, about 5Z in secondary euacation, while vocational,
technical and higher barely existed. In 1985, LPDR educational
participation rates, were: primary, 812; secondary, 131; and tertiary,
1.3Z, closer to the regional medians of primary, 83Z; secondary, 262
and tertiary, 4Z in the same year. (Source: World Bank, Asia

Shortcomings of the Present Manpower Training System
2.19     Manpower Deficiencies.  Deficiencies in the supply of industrial and
agricultural manpower are not being satisfied by the present in-country and
overseas training programs. Taking a conservative approach to calculating
manpower needs,7/ it is estimated that the stock of higher-level technical
skilled manpower, primarily for the productive sectors, should increase from
2,000 in 1986 to about 5,550 in 1995. This means that about 3,600 higher
level staff will need to be trained during that period, comprising about 900
engineers and 2,700 higher technicians (Annex 1, page 2). With some
rationalization and improvement of the technician training programs and
facilities already existing in the country, higher technician needs can
largely be met. However, the tra.ning of engineers will require new
facilities, equipment and staff training in order to maintain and expand
existing capacity and primarily upgrade the quality of the programs. The
policy of training engineers abroad has been inefficient, with quality and
length of the training programs not suitable to national needs (paras. 2.13
and 2.14). In addition, the quality of the national training program will
remain weak unless it receives administrative and program development
assistance, including the upgrading of the national staff, and provision of
better facilities.
2.20     Manpower Planning.  In accordance with new government planning
procedures, the final decisions on NPI enrollment would be determined by the
State Planning Committee. To facilitate that task and in support of the new
policy of decentralized decision making, a joint NPI/Industry Council (whose
membership would include representatives of all NPI graduate-user ministries
and industrial enterprises) will be created. Its principal objective would be
to facilitate the exchange of information and to develop cooperative links
between NPI and the industrial sector. Such exchanges should enhance the
development of more suitable government manpower policies.
2.21     To achieve the above, the Council's main responsibilities would be to
advise on: (a) overall engoieering manpower necds and the number of engineers
to be trained overseas and in-country, particularly those to be trained within
NPI; (b) the distribution of specializations offered at NPI to satisfy
manpower needs; and (c) the content of the curriculum. The Council would help
the Institute to define and organize: (a) student internships in industrial
settings; (b) the senior thesis (a graduation requirement); and (c) joint
NPI/Industry applied research projects, which will be undertaken by NPI
professors. The Council would also be consulted before new specializations
were added to the curriculum and would assist NPI in placing its graduates in
industry entry-level jobs. In addition, the Council would provide the
Institute with feedback on the qualifications of its graduates and the
suitability of their training for industry needs.
2.22     The Council would have the right to present to the MOE
recommendations on: (a) the professional qualifications of future engineers;

- 13 -
and (b) the structural and management changes which may eventually be
necessary in the context of the Government's policy regarding the training and
remuneration of NPI s-aff. After appropriate internal consideration, the
recomaiendations would be transmitted by the MOE to the State Plan Committee.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on the membership and functions of
the NPI/Industry Council and on its establishment by January 1, 1990 (para.
7.1(a)).
Government Strategy
2.23     In the education sector, during the First Plan Period (1980-85), the
main emphasis of the Government was to expand education participation to a
level comparable to that of neighboring countries (para. 2.16). Primary and
vocational/technical education received the bulk of government support.
Toward the end of the development period, emphasis was also given to secondary
education. A large part of the financial burden for primary and secondary
expansion was covered by the parents, with limited financial support from the
national and provincial administrations. Vocational/technical education
development was also primarily supported by governmeat funds.  In the
preparation of the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1986-95), the MOE
reviewed the situation, through a dialogue of the local level, referred to as
Education Reform. The draft plan prepared indicates that major education
sector goals will include: (a) enlargement of national training opportunities
at the higher level, particularly to alleviate the most acute manpower
shortages in the productive sectors. This requires setting up a permanent
structure for the NPI (paras. 2.5-2.7); (b) improvement of the quality of
vocational training by establishing closer links with industry and parastatals
through the introduction of apprenticeship and management training programs.
This cooperation should improve the utilization of the training centers and
assist in restructuring the vocational/technical programs so they can better
respond to the training needs; (c) emphasis on the quality rather than
quantity of general education. This requires increased funding of learning
materials, teacher upgrading and increasing basic education coverage up to
grade 4 in the rural areas;81 and (d) revision of the MOE budgetary structure
to achieve a more equitable subsectoral distribution of resources and to
identify alternative financing sources for the sector. The above sector goals
are well formulated, and fit the needs and potential of the country.
2.24     During the last ten years the Government, largely through parental
efforts, has been able to achieve enrollment ratios in the primary and
secondary subsectors comparable to regional averages, although the quality of
education and its output still need to be improved (paras. 2.16-2.17). Also,
for basic and secondary subsectors, the Government prefers to use internally
8! At present, primary level attendance is 100? in urban areas, with
school offering six years of education. Rural schools reach only
50-602 of gross enrollment and almost 502 of the schools offer only two
years of basic education whereas four years are universally recognized
as necessary for literacy.



- 14 -
generated financial sources or grants.9/ Government also indicates that during
the last Plan period, over half of the education sector investments were
supplied by provincial Government and parental contributions. Government's
policy for the education sector is to finance general education on grant
terms, thus limiting the scope for Association involvement in primary and
secondary general education. Vocational/technical training at levels below
university instruction has received assistance from many donors. Coverage is
ample, with significant assistance from the Soviet Union.
Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
2.25     This would be the first Bank Group education operation in Lao PDR;
previously, the Government was reluctant to borrow, even on IDA terms, for
investments in the sector. To date, the Government has received little
external assistance in higher education, although it is receiving substantial
assistance from UNICEF, UNESCO, Swedish International Development Agency and
the Eastern Bloc countries in the primary and secondary subsectors. The
Government accords very high priority to the expansion and improvement of NPI.
It has asked IDA to assist with this project to benefit from its project
preparation and implementation capabilities and its ability to mobilize
substantial incremental grant assistance for Laotian education development.
The project would assist with the alleviation of the most acute manpower
shortages at the higher level. It would also provide an opportunity for IDA
to expand its knowledge and initiate policy dialogue on basic and general
education issues.
III. THE PROJECT
objectives and Scope
3.1      The proposed project would produce about 850 trained engineers and
2,510 trained higher technicians by 1995 in the basic disciplines required for
development. This supply would help reduce shortages of professional manpower
in Lao PDR, particularly in the industry, agriculture, and transport sectors.
Specifically, the project would: (a) increase the supply of engineers;
(b) improve the planning, management and quality of the present engineering
training programs; (c) promote coordination of higher technical education
programs now provided by various ministries; and (d) initiate studies in the
education sector.
3.2      The project would, over a six year period, provide at NPI:
(a) general and specialized facilities; (b) equipment; (c) furniture;
(d) instructional materials; (e) fellowships; and (f) technical assistance for
NPI to teach four specializations: electrical, mechanical, civil and
management/economics engineering. The project would replace inadequate
existing facilities and would supply required workshops and laboratories
without which the engineering specialization cannot operate efficiently.
9/ HOE receives assistance for textbooks, teacher training, school
furniture manufacturing and primary classroom construction.



- 15 -
Inadequate furniture would be replaced and equipment (hardly existing) would
be provided (para. 3.4). Instructional materials, now lacking, would be
purchased externally and produced locally (para. 3.7). Fellowship training
abroad would be provided to upgrade a sufficient number of NPI staff (which
now include 32 qualified engineers and 28 graduate teachers) to the required
postgraduate level. In addition, pedagogical and technical staff training
would be provided at NPI by the technical assistance (para. 3.9). To improve
NPI's links with practicing engineers, upgrading and in-service courses would
be offered (para. 3.10). To facilitate the training of existing staff and
improve NPI's management, technical assistance would be supplied through a
link with a Swiss polytechnic where a high percentage of NPI staff would study
(para. 3.11). Funds would be included for studies of educational finance, a
review of efficiency and quality issues in vocational and technical education,
and external efficiency of NPI programs. The project would be administered by
MOE and monitored by a joint NPI/Industry Council comprising representatives
from central and line ministries and industry (para. 2.20). Each of the above
inputs is described in more detail below.
Development of NPI Facilities and Equipment
3.3      In order to maximize the use of existing facilities and equipment,
and achieve the most economical training methods, it has been recommended that
NPI's temporary, site at Sok Paluang in Vientiane would be retained. The
presence of four higher technical institutes on the same site would facilitate
better coordination of the engineering and higher technician training
programs. All services are available at that site, resulting in lower initial
and long-term recurrent costs. The administration of the engineer and higher
technician training programs would be placed under one coordinating
administration.10/ The NPI program would enroll 735 students in courses
including a preparatory year, followed by five years of engineering training.
The preparatory year would make possible provincial representation in order to
satisfy the Government's policy to distribute qualified manpower in the
provinces to facilitate development of these areas. Students would be
admitted to NPI on the basis of an entrance examination, primarily in
mathematics and physics. The best secondary graduates would go directly into
the five-year engineering course; weaker students (originating mainly from
rural areas) would have access to the preparatory year, while the lowest
scoring students would be directed to the higher technician training programs.ll/
It is expected that the combination of good secondary graduates who qualify
for direct entry (up to 302 of entrants) and the students brought up to
standard through the preparatory year would provide a sufficient number of
students for the successful operation of the NPI.
10/ All higher technician training programs are being transferred to the
MOE to facilitate coordination and reduce costs.
11/ It is important to note that basic and secondary education in Laos
takes only 11 years, the inclusion of a preparatory year is an effort
to reach a grade 12 equivalency of other countries. The preparatory
year for engineering training is thus not adding a year in comparison
to engineer programs in other countries.



- 16 -
3.4      Some classrooms, science laboratories, a multipurpose facility,
storage facilities, a few small workshops, some administrative offices and a
few staff houses already exist at NPI. The project would provide more
classrooms, laboratories, training and production workshops, a kitchen, a
library, additional offices, and sanitary facilities, as well as student
boarding and staff housing. A summary of the facilities to be provided is
given in Annex 6 and a summary of equipment lists for each specialization is
given in Annex 7. Supplementary equipment would also be supplied to permit
practical training for both instructors and students outside NPI (para. 3.10).
Since some of the equipment supplied is not available elsewhers in the
country, NPI will, for a fee, undertake industrial tests, and provide
maintenance and repairs for private companies. Funds earned from these
activities will be retained and used for the purchase of spare parts,
materials and operational costs. These inputs are expected to facilitate the
improvement of the quality of the engineer program.
Types of Training Programs
3.5      The structure of the NPI programs, options, enrollments and student
output is presented in Chart IV. Satisfactory courses and programs have been
selected for NPI which are closely related to existing needs and planned
activities, primarily in agriculture, transportation, construction,
electricity and industrial development. The scope and content of the programs
were reviewed and found to fit the planned activities. The programs would
devote about 351 of instruction time to practical and 65X to theoretical
activities. The program would include each year a five-week practical
training session in industry or government parastatals. As shown in the table
below, the training program is broad-based with specialization occurring
during the last year.

However, some final harmonization between the course outlines and the
institution's operation will still be made during implementation. It is
expected that the training programs offered at NPI would thus respond to the
country's practical needs. The preparatory year would enroll about 120



- 17 -
students, followed by two years of common instruction for about 270 (140 12/
and 130) students. The expected output of the third year (120 students) 13/
would be split into three groups in the fourth year, i.e. electrical, civil
and mechanical engineering. During the fourth year of engineer training, the
department of industrial eitgineering and management would be added with all
students taking some management courses.14/ In the fifth year of engineer
training, the students would be divided into seven groups of about 15 each for
their final specializations.
3.6      In addition, the project w ald allocate funds for the review or the
higher technician programs. The review would be undertaken by a joint
national and external team during the first two years of project
implementation. Based on that review, staff training programs, repair/supply
of equipment and renovation of facilities would be planned. The major goals
of the review team would be to prepare a recommended distribution of training
programs et the higher technician level. The study would also determine how
the training activities of these institutions could permit student transfers
between engineering and higher technician levels at the end of the preparatory
and third years.15/ The engineering program could thus retain only the best
suited students and the best technicians could be transferred into the
engineering courses following completion of their program. The latter
transfer of students would improve the coordination of the technician and
engineering training programs to best meet higher-level training needs.
Education Materials and Language of Instruction
3.7      Due to similarity of the Lao and Thai languages, the Lao students and
teachers can read Thai. Thus, the project would make immediately available
classroom sets of Thai language books for all instructional levels at NPI.
Additional reference books would be supplied in Thai, English and French. A
series of teaching lessons and student workbooks in Lao have alrcady been
prepared for the first four years of training. During the project period,
lessons would be developed for the fifth year and the existing lessons revised
12/ Estimating direct entry for about 30 students, with the remainder
coming from the preparatory year.
13/ Due to attrition only 120 students of the original 140 remain in
school.
14/ Special attention would be given to principles of industrial
organization and cost and rate of return analysis.
15/ Also, the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) in Bangkok, which has
staff proficient in Lao, has offered to assist NPI with the review ot
prepared lessons, and training of NPI staff at graduate and post-
graduate levels, and to provide technical assistance, if need be, to
NPI. The Thai and Lao Ministries of Foreign Affairs have given their
agreement to the above cooperation.



- 18 -
using a computer desk-top publishing approach. NPI already has a limited
number of computers and has successfully experimented with the process. To
permit the above development and the updating of materials, NPI would
initially rely heavily on the Thai language books and gradually move to the
Lao language books when they are developed. The above activities would be
supported by training and necessary supplies listed in Annex 8. With the
provision of this training and educational materials, the Lao students would
have rapid access to recent engineering books of good quality. Instruction at
NPI would be provided in Lao in conformity with the national law. The
curriculum would also include the teacbing of English. The teachers and
students would be given intensive courses annually followed by weekly
reinforcement courses, and all students would receive language training during
the academic year. At negotiations, agreement was reached on the inclusion of
the English language in NPI training programs (para. 7.1 (b)).
Output from Specialized Institutions
3.8      On the basis of a policy that 80? of engineering training will be
done in the country, it is expected that by 1995 about 110 engineers and 370
higher technicians will graduate annually from the teaching institutions
located at the Sok Paluang campus (para. 2.10). Allowing for a drop-out rate
of about 10? at the start of the training phase, later decreasing to about 5Z,
total NPI enrollment is expected to reach 735 students, of whom about 615 in
the five-year engineer course and 120 in the preparatory year. The present
participation of about 15? women at NPI is expected to increase by 1995
(para. 6.5). The specialization breakdown by branch of economic activity in
1994-95, based on recent economic developments, is presented in Annex 9. The
mechanical, civil and management;economic engineering programs would respond
to urgent training needs related to agriculture and agro-industry where the
country now requires an annual output of about 20 graduates respectively. :n
addition to the latter, other necessary engineering specializations were
identified (mainly chemistry/food production and mining/geology), but these
would require an annual output of less than 16 graduates each. This group,
though not negligible, is substantially smaller than the specializations
offered on the campus (para. 2.11). Therefore, for cost-efficiency purposes,
these specializations would continue to be traited outside the country in the
immediate future and would be considered for future inclusion within the NPI,
if the demand expands. If exports in the mining/geology sector increase
during the next five years, the inclusion of a faculty at NPI should be
considered by or shortly after 1995. The relatively high enrollment in the
industrial ensineering option is due to the management requirements associated
with the work of engineers in the productive sectors and the Government. As
such engineers generally devote at least as much time to project analysis,
management and appraisal as to purely technical tasks, management courses
would be taught to all NPI trainees.
NPI Staff Development
3.9      The Institute now employs about lOC teachers and administrators,
of whom 32 are qualified engineers. Based on an acceptable teacher:student



- 19 -
ratio of 1:10, a staffing plan indicates that at full operation, NPI would
require a total faculty of about 75 teaching staff. However, during the first
years of operation when curricula and teaching materials will be adapted to
local requirements, a teaching staff of about 95 will be needed, of whom 60 to
65 would be teaching engineers (Annex 10). Of these teachers, about 15 to 20
would be new recruits. The project would include provision for 624 man-months
of fellowships with an estimated cost of LS$1,250,000 to upgrade the existing
teachers and train the new teachers eventuaUly required. Training abroad
would consist primarily of the upgrading of existing engineers to the post-
graduate level, primarily at the link polytechnic. Some short courses and
institutional visits would be offered to NPI department heads and senior
administrators. Fellowship training and upgrading of teaching staff abroad,
by specialization, would be not less than 6 and up to 36 months duration. An
outline of the NPI personnel training plan, including overseas fellowships and
national upgrading programs, is presented in Annex 11. For each training
plan, a satisfactory prosram, selection criteria for the trainees, operational
and financial details aLd implementation schedules have been prepared. These
would be reviewed yearly by IDA and adjusted with the help of project
technical assistance. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
number and types of overseas and local training programs, and on the trainee
selection criteria to be used (para. 7.1(c)).
In-Service Training of Existing Engineers
3.10     The project would provide about US$200,000 in seed money for the
initial operation of in-service training courses for practicing engineers.16/
The training, lasting 3 to 5 days, would consist of seminars dealing with
specific technical or managerial topics. These courses would initially be
taught by technical assistance specialists provided under the project, and
later by the national staff. Rotation of teaching staff in industry will be
undertaken during project implementation. Engineers trained abroad in many
countries lack a background common to Laotian conditions (para. 2.14). The
training programs provided by the project would therefore include the devel-
opment, printing and distribution to participants of a technical dictionary in
Lao (already started) which would enhance the engineering profession within
Lao PDR and would facilitate necessary links between practicing engineers and
NPI. In additicn to the above training, NPI would hold an annual Engineer Day
at the Institute. The day would be used to have students and staff demon-
strate work and experiments done during that year. Commercial firms and state
enterprises would be invited to demonstrate equipment and new procedures
simultaneously. The seed money would also cover some costs of the National
Engineer Day and trips to, and communication with, other engineering insti-
tutes, with a view to establishing external links and encouraging the transfer
of knowledge in the engineering fields. Such links would also allow the
organization of practical training sessions needed by both the NPI staff and
trainees. In addition. it would facilitate the identification and recruitment
16/ The seed money will provide funds for establishing the courses. A
large part of the ongoing operational costs would later be covered
through participation fees and participant payment for teaching
materials.



- 20 -
of practicing engineers to teach special courses, topics or modules. Finally,
to facilitate the retention of qualified engineer staff at NPI, during negoti-
ations the Government provided an assurance that it would review within the
framework of its salary adjustments, the compensation of the NPI staff with a
view to keeping such compensation as competitive as possible with that of
industrial and parastatal engineers. This review would be undertaken at mid-
term and end of the project (para. 7.2(a).
Technical Assistance
3.11     Due to insufficient NPI staff expertise and experience, technical
assistance would be required for both project management and instruction. The
project would provide both long and short-term technical assistance, totalling
768 man-months, to assist in improving teaching content and methods, adapta-
tion of materials, delivery of in-service programs and administratior. of the
NPI. To overcome the slow implementation of technical assistance experienced
in previous Bank Group projects, that assistance would be supplied primarily
through a university link.17/ Technical assistance needs have been determined
on the basis of existing engineering specializations not adequately covered by
current NPI staff or vacancies due to staff studying abroad. The main tasks
of the technical assistance would be to review existing programs, assist
national teachers with the preparation of their lectures and other materials,
and ensure appropriate use and integration of equipment into instructional
programs. They would conduct upgrading training courses (content and
pedagogical) for NPI staff and play a key role in the organization of in-
service training programs for existing engineers. Technical assistance terms
of reference and tasks are outlined in Annex 12. Technical assistance would
also assist the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) director with the
management, equipment procurement and implementation of the NPI project. For
each specialization, as well as project management, one or two long-term
technical assistance specialists would be supplied, while other needs would be
supported by short-term specialist visits (from one to four months). These
needs would be evaluated and, if necessary, adjusted during annual reviews
with IDA. The summary and distribution by specialization and timing of
technical assistance are shown in Annex 13. Technical assistance would be
provided and utilized on the basis of terms of reference and contracts
acceptable to the Association. During negotiations, agreement was reached on
the terms of reference and a timetable for consultant services and overseas
and local training, and criteria and procedures applicable to staff selection
for award of fellowships (para. 7.1(d)).
Studies, Sector Work and Evaluation
3.12     The project would provide about US$400,000 for studies and evaluation
of programs. The proposed program would: (a) assess higher education programs
(particularly technical and vocational) with a view to improving their
efficiency and quality, (b) assess the efficiency of secondary education as
17/ The university will train NPI staff, supply technical assistance,
assist with review of programs and equipment lists, and offer a
collegial link.



- 21 -
preparation for admission to higher education, (c) include a tracer study on
the initial employment and subsequent job changes of NPI graduates, (d)
prepare possible future investments in the education sector and human resource
development ir. general, (e) review the financing of basic and secondary
education, and (f) examine the external efficiency of the NPI program to
determine: (i) the technical quality of graduates, in comparison with job
market tasks and responsibilities, (ii) the salary levels of graduates and the
external efficiency of the pool of graduates; and (iii) the perception the
labor market has of NPI graduates by engineering specialization over time.
Finally, during the fourth year of project implementation, an engineer
evaluation team would review the content and quality of the programs to ensure
their international level and relevance to national needs (Annex 14).
Status of Project Preparation
3.13     As a result of four joint IDA, UNESCO and Swiss Development
Cooperation (SDC) missions, five UNESCO consultancies, the presence of a
UNESCO Chief Technical Advisor in Vientiane for three years, and long-term
services of another four consultants, each for almost one year, project
preparation is at an advanced stage. The site where NPI is operating is
located in the capital, Vientiane, and its size is suitable for the present
and future expansion needs as it can accommoda.te up to 5,500 students. The
architectural master plan (initial sketch plan), prepared by a UNESCO
consultant architect, was found suitable. Preparation of facility designs by
a Swiss architectural firm is scheduled to start shortly using Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) funds (para. 4.5). Preliminary furniture and
equipment lists have been prepared and tenders are expected to be called
during the first year of project implementation. The curriculum is ready
(para. 3.5) and teacher guides and student lessons for four out of five years
of engineering training have been completed. Linkages with a Swiss
polytechnic would be established (starting May 1989), and the final revision
of the present curriculvm would be done during project implementation by the
consultants and NPI staff. Draft national, overseas and in-service training
and fellowship programs have been prepared and are ready for implementati-n.
Staff recruitment and training plans have been prepared and the director and
staff of the Project Implementation Unit (para. 5.2) were identified by the
time of negotiations. Satisfactory preliminary terms of reference for the
technical assistance program and course outlines for the in-service training
programs have been completed (para. 3.11).
IV. PROJECTED COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
Cost Summary
4.1      The total cost of the project at Juily 1988 prices is estimated at
US$18.7 million equivalent including a foreign exchange component of
US$15.3 million (821). A breakdown of local and foreign costs by category of
expenditure is given in Table 3 below. A summary of project costs by
component is given in Annex 15 and project costs by year and category of



- 22 -
expenditure are listed in Annex 16. Customs duties and taxes on building
materials are estimated at US$0.5 million equivalent, representing about 142
of the total civil works component or 2.72 of the project costs. Equipment
and teaching materials imported under the project would be exempt from duties
and taxes.
Cofinancing and Aid Coordination with Donor Agencies
4.2      In order to minimize borrowing costs for education investment, the
Government requested grant cofinancing for the NPI project. The SDC has
agreed to provide US$13 million equivalent for technical assistance,
fellowships, in-service training, equipment, educational materials and studies
that are part of the project. The Association would administer the SDC funds
in accordance with IDA procedures and would provide project monitoring and
supervision, under the terms of the framework cofinancing agreement between
the Government of Switzerland and the Association, dated April 9, 1987. The
fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Swiss
Contribution Agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of the
Development Credit Agreement. In addition to the financing required for the
proposed project, the Government of France is expected to provide
supplementary bilateral funding up to US$4.0 million equivalent in grant
assistance that would support technical assistance, fellowships and
educational materials. While the IDA/SDC program would ensure successful
implementation of the self-sufficient core of training, French assistance
would enhance the quality and relevance of training through professional
application programs mainly in laboratories and workshops.
Basis of Cost Estimates
4.3      Estimated costs are based on recent tender prices given by the
Ministry of Construction and quotations from local and foreign construction
firms active in Lao PDR. Estimated equipment costs are based on master lists
prepared by the UNESCO chief technical advisor, subject specialists who
visited Lao PDR, and a UNESCO procurement specialist. Equipment costs are
based on international prices and costs ..n neighboring countries, adjusted to
import conditions in Lao PDR (mainly for transportation and installation).
Furniture has been costed on the basis of a UNICEF furniture project operatirg
within the country and recent purchases made by construction firms. Technical
assistance and training fellowship costs have been estimated on the basis of
1988 consultant and fellowships costs in UNDP projects under implementation in
Lao PDR. The unit capital costs and areas of the project buildings are in
line with 1983/84 Bank medians for comparable facilities (Annex 17). The
foreign exchange component of US$15.3 million has been calculated on the basis
of the following estimated foreign exchange percentages (excluding taxes and
duties): civil works at 702; furniture, 302; equipment, 10O2; teaching
materials, 95Z; technical assistance and professional services, 10OZ; and
paper printing materials, 952.

Contingency Allowances
4.4      Estimated project costs include physical contingencies (US$0.46
million) estimated at 32 of the base cost of all project components (10Z of
base costs for civil works and 5% for furniture, equipment, paper, printing
materials and professional services and OZ for technical assistance). Price
contingencies (US$1.40 million), equivalent to 10 of the base cost plus
physical contingencies, were calculated in accordance with the implementation
schedule and the following expected average annual price increases for
domestic inflation: 75Z in 1988, 55? in 1989, 20Z *in 1990 and 5? from 1991
onward; and for foreign costs: 3? in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and 42 from 1991
onward.
Financing Plan
4.5      The total project cost of US$18.7 million equivalent would be
financed as follows: (a) a proposed IDA credit of US$3.5 million equivalent
would cover 19Z of total project cost, net of taxes; (b) SDC would provide
cofinancing of SwF20.8 million (US$13.0 million equivalent) corresponding to
71? of total project cost, net of taxes; and (c) the Government would finance
the remaining costs of US$2.2 million equivalent (10Z of total net cost), as
well as all tax, estimated at US$0.5 million equivalent. Total external
financing would cover 90? of total project costs, net of taxes. To avoid
implementation delays, provision has been made for the use of PPF funds
amounting to US$200,000 for the preparation of architectural designs and
master plan, for the employment of a consultant firm to prepare equipment
specifications, and for the establishment of the technical assistance team.
Funds made available by IDA through the PPF would be repaid by SDC at the date
of effectiveness on behalf of the Borrower.

a/   Includes staff salaries and students' local scholarships.
Recurrent Costs
4.6      The estimated annual recurrent cost of the proposed project when the
institute is operating at full capacity in 1995 is expected to reach
KN 212 million (at 1989 prices). By 1995, it is estimated that the average
cost per student would double in constant terms. Of the total budget
allocation earmarked for NPI in 1987, staff wages and student scholarships
represent 78Z. Annex 18 shows the progressive transfer of the NPI budget from
the project to the Government and the percentage of local and foreign exchange
costs which the Government would have to assume each year in order to meet NPI
operating costs at project completion. In 1995, it is estimated that the
Government could finance about two thirds of the operating costs of NPI from
its own funds. The remainder would be funded by fees to be charged to regular
students, as well as to individuals enrolled in private evening and weekend
courses (computer courses), and from fees charged for services (industrial
testing, maintenance and repairs). Provision for staff salaries, operations,
and maintenance would be realistic and adequate. If the education budget
grows at 5Z p.a., the estimated GDP growth rate, the NPI budget would
represent a reasonable 4.8Z of the total. During negotiations, the Government
provided an assurance that it would gradually assume the incremental recurrent
costs of operating NPI in accordance with a schedule agreed with the
Association so as to reach about two thirds of these costs by June 30, 1995
and thereafter (para. 7.2(b)).

V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Administration of NPI
5.1      The Institute would be administered by the MOE and monitored by a
joint NPI/Industry Council, with functions similar to those of a university
board of trustees (para. 2.22). The Council would oversee project imple-
mentation and undertake annual reviews of manpower and training needs. This
would ensure that the Institute would respond to the training needs of the
country. The project would provide technical assistance for the management of
NPI, namely a chief technical advisor, a contract with an architectural/
engineering firm, and accounting specialists (Annex 13). The proposed
structure for NPI administration and project implementation is shown in
Chart V. For the duration of the project, a full-time project director would
be assigned to the implementation unit. The project director would be a
member of the executive committee together with the NPI director and two vice-
directors, to guarantee that inputs such as curriculum, equipment, training
programs and facilities supplied under the project would satisfy the overall
institutional needs of NPI.
Implementation
5.2      A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be established at NPI and
would include technical and administrative divisiona. The technical division
would be staffed by the architectural/engineering firm and the administrative
division by a procurement specialist, an accountant and an administrative
officer responsible for personnel and transport. This technical assistance
would be provided to strengthen NPI's implementation capacity. The candidates
selected for the above positions would be recruited under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Association.
Procurement
5.3      Civil works contracts estimated at about US$3.5 million, including
contingencies, would be awarded on the basis of International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines. Equipment and educational
materials, estimated at US$4.8 million, including contingencies, would be
procured as follows: (a) heavy equipment, estimated at a total of
US$1.1 million, would be grouped into packages related to the four major engi-
neering specializations, and would be procured under ICB in accordance with
IDA guidelines; and (b) light equipment, computer and office supplies, paper,
books and other instructional materials, estimated at a total of
US$3.7 million, would be grouped into packages not exceeding US$50,000 in
value, due to the diversified nature of the items, and would be procured
through international shopping, based on comparison of three to five price
quotations obtained from various foreign or local suppliers, to ensure compet-
itive quotes. Workshop supplies, electronic components, tools and related
spare parts estimated to cost $5,000 equivalent or less per contract, up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent of $360,000, may be procured
through direct contracting with the suppliers or manufacturers thereof under
procedures acceptable to IDA. Some of the equipment, about US$0.6 million,



- 27 -
would be designated for the higher technician train'ng programs and the
existing in-service training program. Furniture estimated at US$400,000, with
contingencies, would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally. Foreign firms would be allowed to participate in
accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA. All contracts for civil
works, equipment, furniture, books and educational materials above US$50,000
and all contracts for consultants and fellowships would be subject to prior
IDA review. Civil works, equipment and furniture contracts under US$50,000,
would not be subject to prior IDA review. Equipment and furniture contracts
below US$50,000 would be subject to post-award review. In the comparison of
bids for the supply of goods under ICB, local manufacturers would be extended
a margin of preference of 15Z of c.i.f. costs of competing imports, or the
actual customs duties, whichever is lower. For civil works under ICB domestic
contractors would be extended a margin of preference of 7.5Z in the comparison
of their bids with those of nondomestic contractors.   Specialists and
architectural/engineering consultants would be selected in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines on the use of consultants. All remaining contracts
would be procured according to local regulations. Table 5 provides a
breakdown of expenditures by procurement category.

Disbursement
5.4      The proposed Credit of US$3.5 million and the Swiss co-financing
grant of SwF20.8 million (US$13.0 million equivalent) would be disbursed over
a period of six years. Disbursements would be made on the basis of:
(a) 100? of the cost of civil works;
(b) 100? of all costs relating to maintenance and production facilities;
(c) 10O? of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment, furniture, books and
instructional materials; 10O? of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured equipment, furniture and materials; and 802 of the cost
of imported equipment, furniture and materials procured locally;
(d) 100? of the cost of specialist and professional services or
fellowships;
(e)  lOOZ of the cost of evaluation and studies; and
(f) 42Z of the project operating costs.
The IDA funds would be disbursed for civil works and furniture, the SDC funds
for the other categories.
5.5      Disbursements against all contracts below US$50,000 and operating
costs would be based on SOE's. Documentation supporting the SOEs would be
retained by the PIU and made available for review by IDA supervision missions.
All other expenditures would be fully documer.ted. To the extent possible,
withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$50,000 or more,
prior to submission to IDA for reimbursement. The estimated disbursement
schedule given in Annex 19 has taken into consideration IDA's disbursement
experience in the Asia Region where the usual project disbursement period ie
nine years. However, since this is a small and relatively simnle project at
an advanced stage of preparation, disbursements are expected to be completed
within six years. Furthermore, the NPI is already operating in temporary
facilities, it would have recruited most of its staff by the time of project
effectiveness, its study programs have been prepared, and preparation of
architectural designs is expected to be at an advanced state by Credit
effectiveness (Annex 20). To allow sufficient time for submission of final
withdrawal applications following the scheduled completion date of June 30,
1995, the Closing Date would be June 30, 1996.
Special Account
5.6      In order to ensure that funds for the project would be made available
when needed, two Special Accounts operated by the PIU would be established in
the Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao in Vientiane. Each account
represents an estimated average of four months of IDA- and SDC-financed
expenditures, respectively. The IDA Account would be maintained in US dollars,
with an authorized allocation of US$200,000. Funds from this account would be
withdrawn in proportion to the percentages financed under the Credit. The SDC
account would have an authorized allocation of SwFl,100,000.



- 29 -
Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting
5.7      The PIU would prepare and maintain project accounts in accordance
with sound accounting practices. Project accounts would be prepared annually
and withdrawal applications would be supported by full documentation, except
for expenditures on salaries and other recurrent expenditure, and disburse-
ments against all contracts below US$50,000 which would be reimbursed against
Statements of Expenditure (SOE) certified by the Project Director.
5.8      The PIU would prepare a progress review report on the basis of key
indicators for project implementation (Annex 21), to be sent to IDA for
comments every six months starting in March 1990.
5.9      There are no indtpendent auditing firms operating in the Lao PDR  The
project would be subject to the normal government audit carried out by the
Committee of Control and Audit, which was established in 1985 with the status
of a ministry. The PIU would submit to the Association the Committee's annual
audit report covering (a) project accounts, (b) the Special Account and
(c) Statements of Expenditure. The report would be submitted within nine
months of the end of each fiscal year. The Special Account and SOEs would be
audited separately from PIU accounts. Such an audit would contain a separate
opinion as to whether the disbursements made on the basis of SOEs were used
for the purposes for which they were intended under the project. Within six
months of the Credit Closing Date, the MOE/PIU would submit to the Association
a Project Completion Report covering all project components. The report would
evaluate the execution, initial operation, cost and benefits of the project,
as well as the performance of the Government, the Association and the Swiss
Development Cooperation. It would also include lessons learned during project
implementation. During negotiations, agreement was also reached on project
implementation review reports to be prepared by the Government and sent to the
Association for comments by March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing
in 1990 (para. 7.1(e)).
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.1      The main benefits would be: (a) an improved supply of qualified
engineers from NPI, reaching an output of about 110 engineers p.a. by 1995,
ensuring a sufficient supply of direly needed higher level specialists and
managers in the major sectors of the national economy; (b) lower cost of
national engineer training and a shorter training period since one to two
years of language training abroad would not be required; (c) improved
management and upgraded teachers at NPI; (d) improved coordination of
multitiered technical training with courses more relevant to specific national
training needs; (e) increased control of the placement and retention of
graduates in the positions for which they have been trained; (f) improved
standardization and relevance of engineer training programs, resulting in



- 30 -
better staff integration within the work place, and (g) improved links between
NPI and the industrial sector and government parastatals. The presence of
nationally trained engineers and the homogeneous approach to technical and
managerial issues are likely to improve the efficiency of the state and
private organizations.
Risks
6.2      There are three major risks:  First, there is a risk that implemen-
tation delays might occur due to MOE's inexperience with IDA procedures.
Therefore, project design has been kept as simple as possible, and NPI and MOE
staff (about 50 of whom are already experienced in general project administra-
tion) would be trained under the project's substantial technical assistance
component to strengthen the implementation capabilities, in particular, of
MOE. Second, based on past experience, it might be time-consuming to obtain
government approval for implementation of the technical assistance and
fellowship components of the project. To reduce this risk, a link with a
Swiss polytechnic, which would be responsible for the coordination of both
short- and long-term technical assistance and the organization of overseas
fellowships, would be established. Third, if the prevailing financial crisis
continues, budgetary allocations to the higher education subsector might be
constrained. However, it should be noted that in the preliminary Second Five-
Year Development Plan, the Government accords high priority to the expansion
&' national higher education training opportunities. Also, the Plan intends
to maximize the use of resources allocated to the education sector, while
finding alternative sources of financing (para. 2.23). In addition, at
negotiations, the Government provided an assurance that sufficient funds for
the project would be available in a timely manner, including an increasing
share of the incremental recurrent costs (para. 4.6).
Environment and Health Aspects
6.3      No adverse environment or health effects are expected to result from
this project. In fact, improved training of staff in thE agriculture and
industrial sectors should lead to a better technical knowledge base and, as a
result, more concern for the environment and improved ways to implement
projects in this respect.
Female Participation
6.4      Based on 1984/85 MOE statistics, the participation rates of females
in education are: primary 49Z; lower secondary, 45Z; senior secondary and
vocational, 37? and higher education about 20?. Participation of women at NPI
is already 15? and effort would be made to increase that number during project
implementation. Government has agreed to compile statistics on women's
participation during project implementation.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on:
(a) membership and functions of the NPI/Industry Council and on its
establishment by January 1, 1990 (para. 2.22);
(b)  the inclusion of the English language in NPI trairing programs (para.
3.7);
(c) the number and types of overseas and local training programs, and the
trainee selection criteria to be used (para. 3.9); and
(d) the terms of reference and a timetable for consultant services and
overseas and local training, and criteria and procedures applicable
to staff selection for award of fellowships (para 3.11).
(e) project implementation review reports to be prepared by the
Govarnment and sent to the Association for comments by March 31 and
September 30 of each year, commencing in 1990 (para. 5.9).
7.2      During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it
would:
(a) review within the framework of its salary adjustments the
compensation of the NPI staff with a view to keeping such
compensation as competitive as possible with that of industrial and
parastatal engineers. This review would be undertaken at mid-term
and end of the project (para. 3.10); and
(b) gradually assume the incremental recurrent costs of operating NPI in
accordance with a schedule agreed with the Association so as to reach
about two thirds of these costs by June 30, 1995 and thereafter
(para. 4.6).
7.3      A special condition of effectiveness is that all conditions precedent
to the effectiveness of the Swiss Contribution Agreement have been fulfilled
(para. 4.2).
7.4      Subject to the above conditions and agreements, the proposed project
would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 2.7 million (US$3.5
million equivalent) to the Lao People's Democratic Republic, on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity.

The Education Sector
1.       General education in Lao PDR comprises one year of pre-school, five
years of primary education (grades 1-5), three years of lower secondary
(grades 6-9), and three years of senior secondary (grades 9-11). The
education system grew rapidly between 1975 and 1980, expanding at about 10?
p.a., with the result that primary and secondary enrollments grew by 5O0 at
the primary level and about 26? in the other subsectors. Between 1980 and
1985 overall growth slowed to about 8? p.a. Only the preschool and higher
education subsectors maintained high growth rates. This rapid expansion of
the education system resulted in 1985 enrollment ratios of 812 at the primary,
13Z at the secondary and 1.31 at the higher level. The primary ratio is about
average for the Asia and Pacific Region (83Z), while the secondary and higher
ratios are low for the Region (26? and 4?, respectively). Enrollment growth
realized from 1975 to 1985 is summarized in the table on the following page.
2.       The primary pupil:teacher ratio of 27s1 is about average for the
Region, while the secondary ratio of 15:1 is lower. During the last decade
the necessary qualitative inputs were lacking, with the result that only 18Z
of primary students finished five years of education. Schools built largely
with parental and provincial funding have been constructed in almost every
community but in most rural areas these schools offer only two years of
education. As a result, while primary level attendance is almost 100? in the
urban areas, with schools offering 6 years of education, rural schools reach
only about 50-60? of gross enrollment since almost 50? of the schools offer
only two years of basic education whereas 4 years are recognized as necessary
for achieving literacy.  Equitable distribution of basic education and quality
at all levels require more attention.
3.       The education system offers a variety of training opportunities at
the semi-skilled, skilled and professional levels. In 1985, training for
semi-skilled workers was offered by ten ministries enrolling about 1,200
students in agriculture, mechanics, electricitj, construction, telecommuni-
cations and forestry. For skilled workers,training opportunities were
provided to 2,300 students in 14 schools under the Ministries of Education,
Agriculture, Public Works and Industry. The rapid increase in the number of
vocational/technical training programs at the secondary level has led to high
unit costs and poor coordination, resulting in many unsuitably trained
graduates. All the institutions at that level appear to experience serious
shortages of qualified staff, as well of materials and equipment necessary to
effectively train the students. There is, thus, an urgent need to rationalize
the number and types of training programs offered at the vocational level.
There also appears to have been very little systematic evaluation of the typas
of technical skills and levels of training required for the development of the
country. Until recently, insufficient attention has been directed to the
coordination of the supply and demand of skilled manpower. The Government is
aware that the system of technical education (both under and outside its



ANNEX 2
- 35 -                           Page 2 of 3
control) requires rationalization, but has not yet decided which measures it
would take to restructure the system.  During 1987 the Government placed the
administration of the new vocational school built by the Soviet Union under
the MOE and the transfer of higher technician training institutions, except
agriculture, to the MOE has been prepared.
4.       Over the period 1980-85, expenditure for education has been among the
most rapidly growing categories of national expenditure, increasing at a rate
of 62Z p.a., while during the same period, the total government budget
increased by 43? p.a. Education expenditure has averaged 8? of total govern-
ment expenditure and, in 1982-85, averaged 4.4? of GDP, which is relatively
significant. During this period, the total. MCE budget grew at an average
annual rate of 41?, with recurrent and deveilopment expenditures increasing at
approximately the same rates, 41? and 39?, respectively. Thus, expenditure
for education has been among the most rapidly increasing categories of
budgetary expenditure. These data compare favorably with education
expenditures in the Asia and Pacific Region and indicate the strong commitment
the Government is giving to increasing access to education at all levels.
5.       Government has realized that quantative inputs alone are not
sufficient to improve the education system. Consequently, the Second Plan is
emphasizing more equitable distribution of basic education and increased
supply of textbooks at the primary and secondary levels, along with t:X
training of teachers. The Government also plans to rationalize training
programs at the vocational/technical level and to increase training
opportunities at the higher level.

/a  In this table, the cumulative projected demand for chemdcal engineers falls close to a need of 20 engineers p.a.
The latter was the determination by which the mission decided If a faculty should be established. Since the demand
for chemical englieers is largely based on future prospects and the group involves many different types of speciali-
zatlons, It was determined that the groups would be too small and too costly to establish natlonal training.
/b  This group lncludes many types of engineers' speclalization needs estimated at 5 for geology, 4 for mining and 7 for
petroleum and others, thus making the needs too low and too costly to justify, at thiLs stage, a faculty.

Sector Studies and Evaluation Activities
1.       In order to gain perspective on the education sector and to develop a
deeper understanding of its structure and operation, the project will include
studies analyzing diverse aspects of the functioning of the education sector.
The first aspect tied directly to the objectives of the project, relates to
the study programs of the higher technician training institutes. The
principal objectives of the study will be to evaluate the type, adequacy, and
level of the instructional programs, as well as the condition of the existing
facilities. In addition, the study will also examine the demand for teacher
training, as well as the relationship between the demand and supply of higher
technicians.
2.       A second aspect relates to the internal efficiency of the higher
education institutions. A team of experts will visit all of the institutions
in order to determine if they are responding to the country's training needs.
This team will evaluate the training capacity of the institutions, including
their facilities, equipment, teaching resources, and teacher qualifications.
Taking into consideration the new changes in the development policies of the
country, and basing itself on recent economic and sector reports, this study
will verify if the study programs offered by these institutions correspond
well with the economic needs of the country. This study will include a mid-
project evaluation of the training programs of the NPI. The project would be
visited by a group of experts and administrators experienced in the operation
of engineering schools. This evaluations will permit the Institute to
identify problems and to find solutions to them before the completion of the
project.
3.       The third aspect relates to the efficiency of secondary education as
preparation for admission to higher education and particularly its impact on
the Preparatory Year program providing access to higher education.
4.       Given its recent establishment, the OI  will need to know where its
graduates are working and how their performance is evaluated by employers and
the general labor market. Toward this end, the Institute will undertake two
activities which will permit it to follow its graduates and to aessess the
quality of its curriculum. At the beginning of the project, the Institute
will initiate a graduate tracer study which will continue for the duration of
the project. Secondly, in approximately 1994, the Institute will undertake a
study of the external efficiency of its curriculum to evaluate the technical
and professional quality of its graduates and the range of salaries they earn.
5.       The fifth aspect relates to education financing.  Since the portion
of the national budget of Laos devoted to education has grown rapidly during
the past five years, it has become important to examine its allocation among
the various subsectors. It is equally important to determine the efficiency
with which these funds are employed. Toward these ends, this study will
identify all financing sources for primary and secondary education, examine

ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 2
the budgetary allocation process at the national and provincial levels, assess
the benefits resulting from these investments, and will recommend means of
improving the efficiency and the impact of education financing. Insofar as
feasible, the study will identify possible new sources of financing.
6.       The total estimated cost of these studies will be approximately
US$300,000. An additional allocation of US$100,000 will finance other studies,
to be gradually defined during project implementation, which will support
further analyses (e.g. the issue of equipment depreciation financing) and the
preparation of possible future investments in the education sector and human
resource development in general.
