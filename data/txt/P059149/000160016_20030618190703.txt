3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

Karnataka's Reform Program. Karnataka is India's 8th largest state with a population of about 53
million. It has benefited significantly from India's process of liberalization since 1991. Karnataka has
embarked on a major program of fiscal and governance reform, under the label of the Karnataka Economic
Restructuring Program (see 3.3 for a summary). The strategy is two-pronged, aiming to (i) rationalize and
refocus the role of the state and (ii) enhance the effectiveness, transparency and accountability by which the
state performs this role. Sectoral reforms have also been initiated in the power, roads, water, health,
education, transport, urban and agriculture sectors.

World Bank Assistance Strategy to Karnataka. Support to reforming states has been an important part
of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy to India since 1998. The Bank has been supporting
comprehensive reforms in Karnataka since late 1999. The Bank's program of assistance to Karnataka has
three important features: (i) it is aligned to the Government of Karnataka's (GoK's) own reform program;
(ii) it is focused on poverty reduction, with particular focus on the poorer, arid regions of the state; and (iii)
it is programmatic in nature, with a sequence of interventions designed to further government reforms and
goals. The overall program consists of analytical work, technical assistance, investment lending and
adjustment lending.

Loan/Credit Objective. The latest CAS, discussed by the Board on April 5, 2001, reflects a higher
emphasis on fiscal and governance reforms and increased reliance on programmatic adjustment lending.
The recent CAS update (November 2002) endorses this strategy. So far, sub-national loans have been
made to the states of Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The objective of both the First and the
Second Karnataka Economic Restructuring Loan/Credit (KERL1 and KERL2) was to support GoK's
efforts to stabilize its fiscal position, improve governance, and foster an enabling environment for structural
reforms and sectoral investments under the Karnataka Economic Restructuring Program.

In keeping with the focus on programmatic lending, KERL1 was envisaged as the first in a series of
adjustment loans/credits (i.e the first loan in a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan series or PSAL)
to help the state implement and finance KERP. In particular, although the KERL1 President's Report (the
Memorandum of the President or MOP) identified that the financing requirement for 2001/02 was US$250
million, KERL1 only provided US$150 million equivalent. (The reason for this split was a perception that
the reform program was still at an early stage. In particular, in the power sector, the government had
deferred an agricultural tariff increase ordered by the electricity regulator.) Upfront actions were specified
in the KERL1 MOP for a second loan/credit, KERL2, which was designed in such a way that, provided
good progress was made with the reform agenda, the loan/credit could also be disbursed in the GoK
2001/02 fiscal year. Good progress was indeed made, performance under KERL1 was rated satisfactory in
the KERL1 ICR (a verdict endorsed by OED), and KERL2, in the value of US$100 million equivalent, was
approved by the Board on March 14, 2002, and the Rupee equivalent was disbursed by the Government of
India (GoI) to GoK prior to the close of the Indian 2001/02 fiscal year.

KERL3 was originally planned for the Indian FY03 fiscal year (ending March 2003), subject to good
reform progress. However, two factors have caused a delay in KERL3. First, Government of India sought a
review of the Bank's state adjustment lending, and a pause until new guidelines were in place, which took



                                                       - 2 -

till December, 2002. (The new guidelines make adjustment lending a facility any state can apply for to
support a multi-year reform program aimed at fiscal consolidation.) Second, once the go-ahead was given
to the Bank in December 2002 to prepare for KERL3, the Bank's assessment in January, 2003 was that
Karnataka did not then qualify for KERL3, for reasons explained later in this report.

Scope of the ICR. This Implementation Completion Report is an evaluation of KERL2. KERL2, like
KERL1, was based on upfront policy actions, all of which were completed prior to loan approval and none
of which have been reversed. To provide an adequate assessment of KERL2, this ICR, like the KERL1
ICR, goes beyond certification of compliance with upfront actions to include an assessment of progress in
KERP reforms post-approval of KERL2. The reason for this is the lack of progress following approval of a
loan would indicate weak program design and/or ineffective implementation. In addition, this ICR, unlike
the KERL1 ICR, includes additional information (in Section 10), with a summary in Box 4, providing an
assessment of development outcomes achieved in Karnataka. The reason for this is that, with Bank support
for Karnataka's reform program now about three years old, it is worth taking a step back and looking at the
outcomes actually achieved on the ground in Karnataka. Not all the outcomes can be linked to Karnataka's
reforms, still less to the Bank's support for these reforms. However, it is very important to have a broader
sense of whether, to what extent, and in what areas Karnataka is succeeding.

3.2 Revised Objective:

Not applicable.

3.3 Original Components:

As per the Government's Letter of Development Policy for KERL2, the various components of
Karnataka's fiscal and governance reform program (the Karnataka Economic Restructuring Program or
KERP), can be summarized as follows.

     ·   The fiscal and public expenditure reforms include a multi-year framework for fiscal adjustment,
     as well as reforms to improve fiscal transparency, tax and expenditure policies, public expenditure
     management, financial accountability, and transparency in public procurement, with the objectives of
     restoring the state's financial health, creating additional fiscal space for high priority development
     expenditures, and promoting more efficient and transparent management of the government's financial
     resources.
     ·   Administrative reforms focus on civil service reforms, freedom of information, service agency
     reforms, anti-corruption initiatives, decentralization, and e-governance, with the objectives of
     improving the efficiency and transparency by which government conducts its business and delivers
     services.
     ·   The private sector development component focuses on improving the business environment
     through deregulation and privatization or closure of public sector undertakings.
     ·   The poverty monitoring and statistical strengthening component supports the better use of data in
     policy making, through the development of a poverty and human development monitoring system,
     increased emphasis on program evaluation, and strengthening of the state's statistical system.

There are also two sectors recognized by both GoK and the Bank as being of particular importance to
KERP, the power sector and the education sector. The power sector is important because, as it currently
functions, it is a huge fiscal drag and constraint on industrial growth. (In Karnataka, like many other Indian
states, the power sector has a large, negative fiscal impact.) The education sector is important to promote
human development, a key strategic challenge facing this fast-growing state. Focus on the education sector

  came after KERL2 approval. Focus on the power sector came right from KERL1 preparation, and was
  manifested in two ways. One, a consolidated fiscal target was defined which included the losses of the
  power sector and other important off-budget liabilities as well as the traditional budgetary deficit. Since
  program targets required reduction in this consolidated target, this implied reduction in the financial losses
  of the power sector, separate targets for which were agreed on. Two, in terms of structural reforms in the
  power sector, although these were not formally specified as triggers in the way that the fiscal and
  governance triggers were, benchmarks for progress were agreed on in the documentation for both KERL1
  and KERL2, and subsequently closely monitored.

  3.4 Revised Components:

  The addition of education as a key sector of importance to the KERP was the major extension of the
  programme, which took place in the course of 2002.

  3.5 Quality at Entry:

  QAG assessed KERL1 as highly satisfactory for quality at entry, but did not assess KERL2. The KERL1
  ICR and OED assessed KERL1 as satisfactory for quality of entry, and this ICR proposes the same rating
  for KERL2. While the design of KERL2 was largely defined at the time of KERL1, three years of
  experience have also confirmed the appropriateness of the design of the overall Karnataka Economic
  Restructuring Program. Some of the lessons learnt in KERL1 were applied in the development of KERL2
  (e.g. in relation to the power sector where a lot more attention was given to limiting aggregate supply).
  There was some risk in moving ahead with KERL2 on the basis of fiscal estimates for 2001/02, but these
  estimates turned out to be reasonable overall. Reality on the ground at the time of loan approval was worse
  than expected in two regards: the volume of civil service transfers; and collection efficiency in the power
  sector. These are discussed in more detail in the text.

  4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

  4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

KERL2, like KERL1, included a set of "triggers" -- upfront actions -- on which approval of the loan/credit
was based (shown in Box 1 below). The final KERL2 triggers were very similar to those set out in the
KERL1 MOP as indicative triggers. Only one trigger agreed at the time of KERL1 was not achieved, and
that was the notification of the Right to Information Act, something which the Bank agreed to allow more
time for, and which was done by July 2002. By design, all of these measures were implemented prior to
Board approval and subsequent disbursement of the loan/credit. None have been subsequently reversed,
although one could note that the Corruption Prevention Committee, though established, has never really
become active. Achievement of this trigger (#8) has thus not really served any purpose.

                                       Box 1. Activating Triggers for the Second KERL
       Fiscal Policy and Public Expenditure Management
       1.   Progress towards agreed fiscal targets, as indicated by: (I) actuals for 2000/01; (ii) monthly fiscal
            accounts data for 2001/02; and (iii) progress in implementation of revenue and expenditure reforms.
       2.   Further development of the Medium Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP), including: (I) approval of the draft
            MTFP to guide budget approval; (ii) development of 4 departmental MTFPs (education, health,
            roads, and rural water); and (iii) greater use of performance evaluations.
       3.   Draft Fiscal Responsibility Legislation.
       4.   Establishment of Central Procurement Cell, and approval of an Action Plan to implement agreed
            recommendations of the Karnataka Procurement Assessment.
       Administrative Reforms
       5.  Drastic reduction in number of civil servant transfers.
       6.  Implementation of pilot reforms to reduce elapsed time in government administrative transactions.
       7.  Completion of functional reviews for major departments to rationalize the government administration.
       8.  Establishment of the Corruption Prevention Committee to monitor and publicly report on the
           Government's anti-corruption program.
       9.  Roll out of pilot agency reforms to other parts of the state.
       10. Notification of rules for, and effectiveness of, Right to Information Act.
       Private Sector Development
       11. Implementation of reform measures in the Karnataka Policy Paper on Deregulation of the Business
           Environment.
       12. Closure or sale of 3 Public Enterprises.


In addition to these fiscal and governance triggers, key upfront actions were also required in the power sector
to show progress against the benchmarks identified in the KERL1 project documentation. These measures
included:

           ·         Initiation of metering of irrigation pump-sets (IP sets)
           ·         Passage of Anti-Power-Theft Act
           ·         Implementation of an agricultural tariff increase of 80% which had been ordered by
                     the Regulator in January 2001, but deferred by the Government.
           ·         Filing of a second tariff order (for 30% increase) during 2001/02.

A more detailed evaluation of performance under each component, as well as in the two important sectors of
power and education, follows in 4.2. In general, one can see that Karnataka's reform program has come a
long way over the last few years. As documented in 4.2, it has taken significant steps forward across a range
of reform areas, including in the areas of fiscal adjustment and reform, governance reforms, public enterprise
reforms, poverty monitoring and education.

Before going into this specifics, however, we make a more general evaluation, based on three types of
consideration: (i) broad strengths and weaknesses of the reform program; (ii) the environment for reform; and
(iii) a broader analysis of the success of Karnataka in improving development outcomes.

Taking first a broad view of the reform program, it can be argued that it has displayed two cross-cutting
strengths: an openness to participation in reforms and government activity by the private sector, NGOs and
citizens' groups (which are vibrant in Karnataka); and the adoption of a legislative approach to reform. On
the former, Karnataka has benefited from having an active private sector and civil society willing to work
with the government, and from having a government willing to involve the private sector and NGOs.
Public-private partnerships have evolved in a range of disparate areas, as outlined in Box 2 below.




                                                                 - 5 -

On the latter issue of a legislative approach to reform, more than any other reforming state, Karnataka has
attempted to take this route. Seven pieces of legislation underpin the state's reform efforts: in the power
sector, the Electricity Reform Act and amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act to strengthen penalties for
the theft of electricity (the so-called "Anti-Power-Theft" Act) ; to improve transparency, the Right to
Information, and the Transparency Act in the Public Procurement Act; to strengthen fiscal discipline, the
Ceiling on Government Guarantees and Fiscal Responsibility Act; and to deregulate business, the Industries
Facilitation Act. As shown by Table 1 below, no other state has passed this raft of laws. One should not
overstate this achievement. The list below is not comprehensive (e.g. Maharashtra has passed an act to
mandate PSU privatization and closure). And laws themselves may or may not be implemented. At the same
time, it is hard to deny that legislative backing is extremely important in a country such as India with a
well-developed legal framework. Certainly, in Karnataka, its reform legislation is having an impact.

Notes: The Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility legislation has been tabled but not passed; the TN RTI Act is regarded
as flawed. The Anti-Power-Theft Act is actually an amendment to the Electricity (Supply) Act.


On the negative side, progress has been slower than expected and some important milestones have not been
achieved in the areas of business deregulation, and power sector reforms. The latter in particular is an
important shortcoming, given the overall importance of this sector. In fact, the Bank ruled that it was largely
on account of inadequacies in power sector reforms that Karnataka did not qualify for KERL3 in FY03.
(KERL3 has its own triggers defined at the time of KERL2. This ICR does not extend to a formal analysis of
progress against KERL3 triggers. It suffices to say here that several of the power sector reform benchmarks
have not been achieved, including targets for collection efficiency.)

                        Box 2: Examples of public-private partnerships in Karnataka

External feedback to Government. Karnataka is fortunate to have organizations such as the Public Affairs
Centre (PAC) to provide feedback and pressure for reform. It has carried out two surveys ("report cards") for
various government services in the Bangalore area, and, more recently, a similar exercise for all of India. The
most lowly-ranked service in the 1999 Bangalore survey, the Bangalore Development Authority, asked PAC for
assistance after the results were out, and it is now widely-regarded as having turned around its performance.
The Government has been receptive to PAC's feedback, and has itself commissioned work from the
organization. While PAC has clearly been a pioneer, there are now other organizations playing a similar role,
both in cities other than Bangalore, and, though the challenges are obviously greater, in rural as well as urban
areas. GoK has also encouraged the provision of participant feedback on its schemes and programmes by
launching the "independent evaluation initiative" under which government departments are encouraged to
finance external evaluations of their programmes, usually by academic institutes or NGOs. So far, about 30 of
these evaluations have been completed.




                                                           - 6 -

Urban services. In late 1999, the Government institutionalized a role for citizen involvement in Bangalore by
issuing a Government Order to set up the Bangalore Agenda Task Force (BATF) headed by a prominent
business leader, with a largely non-government membership, but a government secretariat, and with a mandate
to work with city agencies to improve the quality of life in Bangalore. Over the last few years, BATF has played
a number of very useful roles: it has annually and publicly monitored the performance of major city agencies; it
has helped with specific reforms, such as the reform of property tax, and the introduction of fund-based
accounting in Bangalore; and it has helped nurture other citizens' groups with an interest in service delivery.
Both the BATF concept and the reforms it has helped spawn in Bangalore are now spreading to other cities in
the state as well as in other states (Maharashtra, UP).

Education. The Azim Premji Foundation, based in Bangalore, and financed by one of India's software giants,
has a mandate to work for universal education. It is playing a unique role in improving the delivery of
education services in Karnataka. The Foundation has already piloted the introduction of computer facilities in
rural schools (on a self-funding basis). It has now started a scheme to incentivize better school performance.
Any school in the backward north-east region of the state is now entitled to a Rs 20,000 grant provided it can
show: (i) 100% enrollment, (ii) 90% attendance, and (iii) 60% student competence. Given that the annual
discretionary expenditure of a typical school in Karnataka is only less than Rs 3,000 it is perhaps not surprising
that some 6,000 schools have applied to participate in this scheme, perhaps India's first attempt to move
towards a performance-based allocation system in the school education sector.

Infrastructure and contracting out. Karnataka has farmed out the maintenance of its core road network to the
private sector for the last three years. Bangalore has contracted out solid waste management to private sector
firms. IDeCK, a joint venture company between GoK and IDFC was set up in 2001 to develop infrastructure
projects with private sector participation. Karnataka is one of four states to be participating in the ADB Private
Sector Infrastructure Project.

Agriculture. Karnataka is India's first state to amend its Agricultural Produce Marketing Act to allow
private-sector marketing of agricultural produce. A one-time exemption was provided to establish a large,
non-government vegetable, fruit and flower market, which is expected to be opened in Bangalore around the
middle of 2003. Karnataka has also taken a lead in promoting contract farming, seen as a private-sector
solution to the support needs of small farmers.

Task forces. Karnataka set up several task forces that have prepared reports covering almost every conceivable
subject from administrative reforms, to sector issues, to womens' empowerment and regional divides. Both
these reports and their implementation are of variable quality, yet the reports ensure that there is a constant
flow of new ideas entering the public policy debate.

Turning now to the environment for reform, the second factor entering into our overall assessment, as Box 3
summarizes, there can be no doubt that this has been negative over the last two years, each of which has
recorded the lowest rainfall in the state for the last 20 or 30 years, and accordingly has led to a significant
decline in agricultural Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and a considerable degree of both rural
distress and political agitation.

                               Box 3 Rainfall and Growth in Karnataka, 2000-2002

2000-01 was a good year in terms of economic growth and rainfall for Karnataka, with the only real problem
being low prices for some agricultural products. However, 2001/02 and 2002/03 were both low rainfall years. As
the figure below shows, the rainfall shortage in each of these two years was the worst since 1980 (1970 for
2002/03). Correspondingly, these were years of negative agricultural growth and low GSDP growth, as the table
below indicates, with a cumulative decline in agricultural production of about 17% over the two years. Industrial
and services growth continued to be fairly high, with the latter estimated at around 13% for each of the two years,
and the former at an average of 7.5%.While these are early estimates, and while one might expect some
exaggeration of agricultural distress in the official figures, econometric analysis suggests that a cumulative fall in
agricultural output of about 15% would not be unexpected given the shortfall in rain. Agriculture is notoriously

volatile in Karnataka due to a low proportion of irrigated to cultivated land, and single-year declines in food grain
production by 10% or 20% are fairly common.

Apart from leading to a growth slowdown, and causing rural distress (e.g. drinking-water shortages), the rain
shortfall of the last two years has also had a negative financial impact on the power sector in various ways: (i)
increased pumping (at subsidized tariffs) by farmers to substitute for lack of rain; (ii) increased power supply
costs due to reduced availability of hydro-power; and (iii) a reluctance to take "harsh" measures, such as
implementation of tariff increases or collection of tariff dues. Given the huge impact of the power sector on the
fiscal position, this made the task of fiscal adjustment much more difficult than expected.


The final input to our overall assessment of performance should be, as mentioned, a broader analysis of the
success of Karnataka in improving development outcomes. This issue is gone into in some detail in Section
10, the main results of which are summarized in Box 4 below. Essentially, Karnataka shows rapid
improvement across a range of indicators. The fastest-growing state in India, it has a relatively good
investment climate, and an increasing ability to attract private investment. With above-average growth, there
is a marked decline in poverty. Social indicators are also improving, and Karnataka shows relatively good
and, to the extent that there is evidence to judge it, improving service delivery. Yet, for all this progress, in
terms of fundamental outcomes, as measured by poverty and basic social indicators, Karnataka still appears
to be a rather average state, with slightly worse-than-average levels of poverty, and slightly
better-than-average human development indicators. Rates of improvement in basic social indicators have also
roughly been average by Indian standards. The challenges for Karnataka in the coming years are twofold: (i)
to maintain if not accelerate the 8% growth rate achieved in the last half of the nineties; and (ii) to achieve
the human development standards of its southern neighbours, first Tamil Nadu and ultimately Kerala.

       Box 4. Development Outcomes in Karnataka: Progress in Recent Years (summary of Section 10)

     Growth. Karnataka is India's fastest growing state. Its growth rate picked up from 5.3% in the eighties (below
     the national average) to 7.4% in the nineties. Growth in all three sectors of the economy was above the Indian
     average.

     Poverty. Using the now-widely-accepted Deaton-adjusted poverty estimates, rural poverty in Karnataka fell
     from 37.9% in 1993/94 to 30.7% in 1999/00 (compared to an all India decline from 33% to 26%) and urban
     poverty fell from 21.4% in 1993/94 to 10.8% in 1999/00 (compared to an all India decline from 18% to 12%).
     Thus there was a slightly-above-average reduction in rural areas and a greatly-above-average reduction in
     urban areas.




                                                              - 8 -

   Investment climate. Karnataka's investment climate was ranked fourth in the country by the World Bank-CII
   multi-state firm-level competitiveness survey of 10 states. During the second half of the 1990s, Karnataka
   became the third largest recipient of FDI among major Indian states, accounting for nearly 19 percent of FDI
   approved to the top six recipient states (and 9% of total approvals in the country).

   Human development. Karnataka's performance in human development indicators is improving, though
   rather average. The nineties saw a eleven percentage point improvement in literacy, a slow down in population
   growth, and above-average improvement in infant mortality. Yet Karnataka has a long way to go to catch up
   to the comparator states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, as well as Maharashtra and, on the issue of population
   growth, Andhra Pradesh.

   Service delivery. State governments in India are responsible for the provision of basic social services. The
   independent and well-respected Public Affairs Centre (PAC) has recently conducted a nationwide survey to
   examine how well states perform on service delivery based on user feedback. The results show that Karnataka
   emerges in third place out of 22 states. As to whether public service delivery has been improving in Karnataka,
   evidence is not available for the whole state, but evidence from Bangalore suggests it has been. The Public
   Affairs Centre conducted two surveys in 1994 and 1999 of satisfaction with government services among
   Bangalore residents. For the six public utilities covered in the survey, and on average the proportion of
   satisfied users rose from 9% to 32%, while the number of dissatisfied users fell from 41% to 19%. There is
   also information on individual services which suggests positive improvements.

   Improvements in specific services
     o Education: A large number of initiatives have been launched to ensure universal enrollment, and the
          number of out-of-school children since 2001 has been halved.
     o Government hospitals: The system of government hospitals has been overhauled resulting in a massive
        increase in utilization of the system: the number of occupied beds and day-patients each more than
        doubled between 1996 and 2002, the number of surgeries increased eleven-fold, the number of lab-tests
        increased more than thirty-fold, and so on.
     o Land records. About 5 million farmers a year request the government for a copy of or change in their
        land records. Karnataka has now computerized its 20 million land records. Whereas land record issuance
        took 3-30 days under the manual system it is now done immediately. Feedback from farmers has been
        positive.
     o Public transport. About 7 million passengers uses public (government) buses in Karnataka every day.
        On-time departures for the Karnataka's largest bus company on main routes have increased from 92% in
        1998/99 to 99% in 2002/03, and a range of customer-friendly initiatives adopted.
     o Transport regulatory services. In Karnataka, some 260,000 people a year receive licenses a year, and
        some 30,000 vehicles are registered annually. The Regional Transport Offices in Bangalore, as well as
        now a few outside Bangalore, have been fully computerized. An independent survey found that 41% of
        driving-license applicants reported paying a bribe in the non-computerized setting, but only 3% in the
        computerized setting.


Taking all of the above considerations into account, overall our assessment of GoK's achievement of reform
objectives under KERL2 is that it is satisfactory, even though it was not sufficient to proceed to KERL3 in
2002/03. This is based on: the achievement of the KERL2 upfront actions; the progress made since KERL2,
despite an adverse environment for reforms, in a range of areas, which is impressive even if inadequate to
qualify for KERL3 in 2002/03; the important underlying strengths of the reform program outlined above;
and the good progress in recent years improving basic development outcomes in the state.

 For the reasons mentioned in Section 3.1, we examine progress both prior to approval of KERL2, and
 post-approval. This section reviews first progress under the four individual fiscal and governance

original policy matrix milestones were contained in GoK's Letter of Development Policy dated 8th
February, 2002. For an assessment of the program against performance benchmarks, see Annex 1.

(i) Fiscal and Public Expenditure Reforms.

This component includes sub-components relating to fiscal adjustment, revenue and expenditure reforms,
and reforms in the areas of public financial accountability and public procurement.

(a) Fiscal Adjustment

Karnataka probably has the best fiscal position of any of the major Indian states. It has the highest credit
rating of those states which are rated. It is the only major state not to have relied on RBI's overdraft facility
in the recent past: its use of this facility in 2001/02 was zero compared to about 130 days for the major
states (up from 30 days in 1997/98, which was the last year before the current state-level fiscal crisis).
Karnataka also probably has the most flexibility in its expenditure structure of all the major states, with a
relatively low ratio (about 60%) of committed expenditure (salaries, pensions and interest) to total revenue.

Karnataka's fiscal position has, however, been deteriorating. To avert a crisis, fiscal reform commenced in
Karnataka in 2000/01 and fiscal targeting began the following year, the first year a Medium Term Fiscal
Plan was produced. The target consolidates important off-budget liabilities, such as power sector losses,
                     1


with budgetary liabilities. While Karnataka achieved its fiscal targets for 2001/02 in nominal (Rupee)
terms ­ falling short by just Rs 1 billion or 1.4% of the target -- the lower economic growth for that year
has meant that the fiscal deficit in fact rose slightly as a percentage of GSDP to 6.2%. The primary deficit,
however, did fall slightly, and it stood in 2001/02 at 2.6% of GSDP compared to the 3.0% observed prior
to the commencement of fiscal reform in 1999/00 (Table 2).      2




For 2002/03, the latest estimates show a drop in the fiscal deficit to 5.4%, on target and a fall in the
primary deficit to 1.4% in 2002/03, better than targeted, even with lower-than-expected nominal growth.
The 2003/04 budget targets further deficit reduction (Table 2). It does now appear that Karnataka is on the
path of fiscal adjustment. In particular, the following encouraging signs are now evident:

    l Consolidated borrowing has fallen to below 5%.The achievement of the mandated Fiscal
         Responsibility Act target of a fiscal deficit of 3% by 2005/06 appears to be in reach provided the
         deficit continues to fall.
    l Slow down in interest growth. Consolidated interest has grown annually at about 20% for the last
         five years, but is budgeted to grow at only 6% in 2003/04, resulting in a decline in the
         interest/GSDP ratio for the first time since the fiscal deterioration began.
    l Debt stabilization. The rate of increase in the debt-stock has slowed and, if Karnataka sticks to its
         MTFP, the debt-GSDP ratio will peak this year (2003/04), and thereafter start falling.
    l Off-budget borrowing by special-purpose vehicles is on the decline, as per GoK's stated
         announcement to abolish such borrowing by 2005-06.

Note: Consolidated borrowing includes budget borrowing, off-budget borrowing by special purpose
vehicles, and power sector borrowing defined as the financing requirement of the transmission and
distribution sectors net of budgetary support. The consolidated primary deficit is consolidated borrowing
minus consolidated interest payments. 2002-03 figures are based on revised estimates. Targets as % of
GSDP are divided by the assumed GSDP growth at the time of target setting.



The paragraphs following provide some further detail on Karnataka's fiscal adjustment over the last two
years.

   l Current deficit. One area where Karnataka has not done as well on fiscal reform is in relation to
         its current (revenue) deficit. GoI monitors the current deficit, and notes in its comments attached to
         this ICR that this variable deteriorated in 2001/02. This is for three reasons: (i) As GoI notes, this
         was largely due to GoK paying its power sector subsidy obligation in full in 2001/02 unlike in
         earlier years, on account of which budgetary support to power sector went up Rs 23.0 billion from
         Rs. 8.6 billion. This change is in the nature of bringing an off-budget liability on budget, and
         should be adjusted for in any comparison over time. (ii) For both 2001/02 and 2002/03 revenue
         growth has not been rapid, requiring expenditure cuts to meet the budget targets. These have
         naturally fallen on capital projects. (iii) A rapidly mounting interest burden, which has grown by
         40% in the last two years, makes it very difficult to reduce the current deficit. But while
         acknowledging limited progress on the revenue deficit front, overall it does seem that Karnataka is
         now on the path of fiscal adjustment.

   l Fiscal targets under KERP. Experience under KERL1 indicated the difficulty of monitoring a
         target which includes "borrowing" from the public accounts as the fiscal deficit conventionally
         defined does. These accounts proved to be quite volatile (especially between revised estimates and
         actuals) and, on closer analysis, to be largely in the nature of book adjustments with no
         corresponding expenditure or creation of actual liability. The KERL1 ICR highlighted this
                                                                    3


         problem and noted that "Targeting of the fiscal deficit excluding borrowings from those public
         accounts where no debt liabilities are involved may also be advisable." This decision has since been
         implemented. Thus a consolidated borrowing variable is now targeted, defined as the sum of three
         elements: (i) budget borrowing defined as an increase in public debt, and so excluding non-debt
         public accounts; (ii) off-budget borrowing defined as borrowing by special purpose vehicles
                           4


         largely for infrastructure projects the servicing of which will fall on the budget; (iii) power sector
         borrowing, defined as the financing requirement of the transmission and distribution sectors net of
         budgetary support.

 l Overall fiscal performance in 2001/02: actuals v. estimates and targets. Table 3 compares
      fiscal targets for 2001/02 (KERL1 targets) with the estimate for 2001/02 at the time of the KERL2
      MOP (February 2002), with the ICR estimate (June 2002), and with actuals. It can be seen that the
      final outcome of Rs 67.66 billion was Rs 1 billion above the KERL1 target and almost identical to
      the estimate at the time of KERL2 approval. However, it was above the KERL1 ICR estimate,
      which was only a partial update of the KERL2 forecast and turned out to be too optimistic.
      (Learning from this, an attempt has been made in this ICR to provide a prudent estimate of the
      2002/03 fiscal outturns.) In 2001/02, the fiscal (budget) deficit turned out to be Rs 58.7 billion
      against the KERL1 target of Rs 51.3 billion (and revised estimates of Rs 51 billion). This large
      difference of Rs 7.4 billion is mainly due to much larger than budgeted use of non-debt public
      accounts (which, as explained earlier, is now not part of the fiscal targeting): Rs 4.5 billion of the
      increase is explained by this. The increase in net budget borrowing was about Rs 3 billion above
      target, an excess which was offset by a reduction in off-budget borrowing.

   due to change in definition relating to budget borrowing as discussed above, plus a change in definition C2
   (government support) due to a different treatment of pension funding.


l Overall fiscal performance in 2002/03. KERL2 targeted a deficit reduction in 2002/03. Table 4
  compares the latest estimate for 2002/03 with the KERL2 target. It seems likely that the target will be
  achieved. The power sector financing requirement has been exceeded due to higher unit power purchase
  costs (low hydro due to the drought), and higher than expected interest costs (due to lower than
  expected power subsidy payments forcing KPTCL to borrow off budget; in turn the lower power
  subsidy payments were due to lower-than-budgeted resource availability, in particular the non-receipt
  of KERL3 in 2002/03 as budgeted). From the perspective of consolidated borrowing, however, this
  has been offset by below-target borrowing both on- and off-budget. (More detail in the power sector is
  presented in 4.2(v).)

                       Notes: As per Table 3. Targets from GoK 2002/03 MTFP and power sector cash flow targets.


l Institutional reforms for fiscal adjustment. Karnataka has made good progress in implementation of
    its fiscal institutional reform agenda. In August 2002, Karnataka became India's first state to enact a
    Fiscal Responsibility Act, which binds the states to achieving a fiscal deficit of 3% by 2005/06,
    consolidating with off-budget or SPV borrowing, with reduction to this target every year, among other
    targets. This has had a strong demonstration effect, and three states have since passed similar Acts;
    others are expected to follow soon. Karnataka's Act became effective as of April 1, 2003. Karnataka
    also published its second Medium Term Fiscal Plan in August 2002, thus institutionalizing an annual
    cycle of MTFP updation.      5




l Fiscal transparency. One of the aims of the fiscal reforms is to promote fiscal transparency. Further
    steps have been taken in the last twelve months in this direction by: (i) putting a larger amount of
    material on to the Finance Department Website (tax and borrowing information, as well as monthly
    accounts); (ii) providing information to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy to bring out a
    monthly report on Karnataka, which includes detailed fiscal as well as economic data. However, it
    should be noted that in 2002/03 the Website data was not updated as frequently as it was in 2001/02.

(b) Revenue and Expenditure Reforms

Revenue reforms. Karnataka has made significant progress in relation to both tax reforms and increases
in user charges. With respect to tax reforms, an agenda was provided for the Government by the Tax
Reforms Commissions whose two reports (delivered in 2000 and 2001) provided a road-map for the
Government. Many of its recommendations have since been implemented, including:

   l In sales tax, abolition of the turnover tax, and infrastructure cess, and reduction in scope of the
         entry tax. Important administrative reforms have also been introduced such as self-assessment, and
         a system of advance rulings. Karnataka is one of the better prepared states for VAT introduction.




                                                           - 13 -

   l On transport taxes, a shift to ad valorem taxes, rationalization of rates, and introduction of a green
         tax, penalizing old polluting vehicles.
   l Taxes on property transactions have been cut as of April 1, 2003 from 13.5% to 9% of property
         value.

The main tax reform challenge facing Karnataka now is the successful introduction of VAT. While the
state has passed VAT legislation and made extensive preparations for VAT introduction, at the time of
writing the timing of the introduction of VAT is uncertain due to the breakdown of the national consensus
for VAT introduction in April 2003.

With respect to user charges, the Government has brought about major increases in utility charges:

   l Bus charges have been increased by 30% since late 1999.
   l Power tariffs have been increased by about 34% since end-2000;6
   l Urban water charges for Bangalore residents were increased by 45% in 2001.
   l Irrigation charges have been doubled.
   l Higher education charges have been increased by 20%, and are set to increase 10% every year.


These charges have at times been controversial and difficult to implement. Government has also had
difficulties collecting increased charges in rural areas.

Revenue performance. Revenues grew strongly in 2000/01 (by 15%) but growth has slowed in the last
two years to 7% in 2001/02 and an estimated 6% in 2002/03. Own-tax performance has been reasonable
with growth of 17%, 9% and 7% (estimated) for each of the last three years. While own-tax growth has
been lower in the last two years due to the economic slowdown, the own-tax/GSDP ratio has also risen
from 8.1% in 1999/00 to 8.6% in 2000/01 to 9.0% in 2001/02, falling slightly to an estimated 8.9% in
2002/03. There were two main reasons for the slow-down in own-tax growth in the last two years. Excise
(alcohol) tax growth slowed to zero in 2002/03 on account of the drought which reduced demand. And
commercial taxes, the most important, showed two years of slow growth, perhaps partly related to the slow
growth in Karnataka over the last two years, and partly due to the increasing impact of sales tax
concessions (no longer given to new projects, but still impacting revenue through projects in operation).
Karnataka has launched a compliance drive in 2003/04 to boost revenues in both commercial taxes and
excise.

Revenue forecasts. One area where Karnataka has suffered has been through reliance on unrealistic
revenue forecasts. For the period 1996/97 to 2001/02, Karnataka's own-tax revenues have been on average
                   7


only 92% of budget estimates. Non-realization of unrealistically high revenue estimates has led to the need
for large expenditure cuts and difficultt in achieving fiscal targets. This problem was highlighted in the
KERL1 ICR, and is one area in which no improvement is evident over the last three years, apart from
2000/01, when very strong revenue growth made 96% achievement of budget estimates possible.
Karnataka would certainly benefit from adoption of a more prudent approach to revenue forecasting.

Expenditure reforms. High-priority development expenditures, defined as elementary and secondary
education, health, roads and rural water supply, and non-wage O&M for irrigation and public buildings,
are targeted to be first protected and then expanded under the Restructuring Program. With good revenue
growth in 2000/01, high-priority expenditures were expanded in that year with real growth of about 7%,
despite containment of the fiscal deficit. With relatively slow growth in revenue over the last two years,
expenditure growth has correspondingly been constrained. In 2001/02, excluding interest payments, power
sector subsidy, and the debt-servicing of off-budget liabilities, budget expenditure grew by only 6%.


                                                      - 14 -

However, high priority areas have been protected from cuts to the extent possible. Estimates for 2001/02
show nominal growth in high-priority expenditures of about 3%, slightly above estimated inflation. The
food subsidy is falling. Hiring and pay restraint remains in place. Expenditure on housing remains a high
and expensive priority for the government, but identification of beneficiaries and recoveries in case of low
cost public housing programs remains very poor.

Public expenditure management. To promote departmental accountability and planning, departments are
now encouraged to produce Departmental Medium Term Fiscal Plans (DMTFPs) to indicate the
performance targets, strategies, resources and major programs that will be undertaken over the MTFP
period. In August 2002, pilot DMTFPs were published by Elementary and Secondary Education, Health
and Family Welfare, Medical Education, Public Works Department, and the Drinking Water Supply
component of the Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Department. DMTFPs are now being extended to
a much larger number of departments. These DMTFPs have helped departments think more strategically,
but they need to be more closely linked to the budgetary process.

In return for the departments accepting hard-budget constraints and more accountability, a start has been
made in simplifying the budget to give departments greater flexibility. The number of object codes (which
report on the object of expenditure: salaries, purchases, etc) has been reduced from 269 to about 70. A
number of departments have already greatly reduced the number of schemes they operate (e.g., Health,
Commerce and Industry, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry). Demands for grants have been rationalized
along departmental lines to promote the concept of departmental budgeting and accountability and reduced
in number from 62 to 29.

(c) Financial Accountability and Procurement Reforms

Public financial accountability and management. The state's payment system has been fully
computerized under the Khajane project. Khajane has automated a system which generates every year some
22 million payments and disbursements, including monthly payments for 1.8 million pensioners, transacted
                                                                                                  8


through about 220 treasury offices. A system of automated, on-line clearance for each one of these
payments has been put in place through satellite-linking of all the 220 offices to the project headquarters in
Bangalore and the disaster recovery center in Dharwad. The new system is expected to greatly reduce
abuse and discretion, to make single-visit same-day payments possible (inconceivable under the manual
system where payments typically took a week or more to be processed), and to revolutionize the state's
accounting, cash-management and budget-management capability. Computerization of the payments
systems of the irrigation, public works and forestry departments, which are separate from the treasury
system described above, is now underway, and will also have major benefits.

Other areas where progress has been made include a substantial reduction in backlog in audits of public
enterprises, employee provident and insurance funds and the lowest tier of rural local governments: a
backlog remains in urban local governments and the top two tiers of rural local governments. GoK has also
tried to improve its own responsiveness to the audit reports of the Controller and Auditor General, which
prior to this initiative was almost non-existent. A database has been established of audit observations made
over the years for which a response by government is required. 453 paras required a response in October
2002; in February 2003, the backlog was 282 paragraphs or 62% of the October figure. A State Financial
Accountability and Management Study is under preparation by the Bank and will be completed this Bank
fiscal year.

Finance and audit accounts for 2001/02 were released within 12 months of the close of the year. However,
unlike the previous year, summary accounts were not released within about 6 months of the close of the




                                                     - 15 -

year.

Initial progress has been made in cleaning up the public accounts of government, referred to earlier as a
major cause of inaccuracy and lack of transparency in government accounts. With respect to personal
deposit accounts, a ban has been placed on their use to carry forward budget funds, and some 1095 have
been closed. More systemic action to close public accounts which lack corresponding liabilities is under
preparation but yet to commence.

Procurement. GoK is implementing a Procurement Reform Action Plan developed in the Country
Procurement Assessment Review for Karnataka. The overall thrust of the Action Plan is to revise
procurement guidelines and documents to ensure their consistency with the Karnataka Transparency in
Public Procurement Act. Progress, albeit slow, is being made in this regard. More importantly, the
Transparency Act is definitely having a useful impact, and is being widely applied. For example, KSRTC,
the public bus company, estimates that it has saved over $US 1 million (Rs 54 million) with respect to 23
purchases since the Transparency Act came into force. However, GoK has recently decided to extend the
exemption given to purchases by Government from PSUs under the Act by another year, to October 2003.
This seems to violate the spirit of transparency.

(ii) Administrative Reforms.

Reforms under this component relate to (a) e-governance and service delivery, (b) initiatives to reduce
corruption, and (c) civil service reforms. The framework for these reforms is provided by GoK's annual
Governance Strategy and Action Plan (GSAP), the second of which was published in August 2002.

(a) E-governance and Service Delivery

E-governance. Karnataka has become a leader in e-governance in India. Its two flagship projects are
Bhoomi, the land-records computerization, and Khajane, the computerization of the state's payment
system, both of which are described elsewhere: (4.2(i)(c) for Khajane, and Section 10 for Bhoomi). Other
large e-governance projects are either complete (transport department computerization, which is complete
in Bangalore and now being rolled-out across the states; the system of on-line agricultural prices; a
computerized secretariat file-management, office attendance, and Local Area Network system; and the
Chief Minister's performance monitoring system) or underway (stamps and registration, value added tax).
Experience with completed e-governance projects so far in Karnataka is positive: they reduce corruption,
improve customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and are sustainable. Bearing in mind that international
experience suggests that about half e-governance projects fail, and that evidence from India suggests an
even higher proportion, Karnataka's achievement is a significant one, even if one concedes that there are
                          9


still risks to sustainability. The recently-approved e-governance strategy, and the creation of a dedicated
                                                                           10


position of Secretary, E-Governance position give grounds for hope that the e-governance momentum will
be maintained if not increased in the coming years.

Service delivery. Substantial service delivery improvements in Karnataka are noted in Section 10 on
outcomes. Many of these draw on e-governance initiatives, but those that do go beyond e-governance
reforms to include citizen charter initiatives, departmental re-organization and staff re-training and
re-deployment. Other service delivery improvements have little or nothing to do with e-governance, such as
the improvements noted in education delivery and government hospitals.

Decentralization. Reforms in urban governance include reforms of the property tax to increase revenue
and reduce discretion, and a major delegation of financial powers to urban governments. In rural areas,
amendments to the Panchayati Raj (rural local government) Act have been tabled to enhance accountability


                                                      - 16 -

and transparency. Training for local government officials has been expanded, and computerization of local
governments is underway.

(b) Measures to reduce corruption

The Public Affairs Centre 1999 survey of service delivery in Bangalore found a significant improvement in
service delivery, but no reduction in corruption. Since 1999, GoK has made significant progress in tackling
corruption, one of the most serious problems Karnataka and other states face.

In terms of corruption prevention, Karnataka has passed two significant pieces of legislation ­ the
Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act and the Right to Information Act. The former has had
a positive impact, at least based on feedback from government officials in the procurement business. The
latter, the Right to Information (RTI) Act, was made effective in July 2002 after considerable delay. While
it is still very early days in the implementation of this Act, a start has been made. Responsible government
officials have been designated, and trained, and publicity has been given to the Act through workshops.
Records management is being modernized to enable easier access to archived documents. NGOs have
started to monitor GoK compliance with the RTI, to publicize its provisions, and to mobilize citizens to
submit applications.

E-governance initiatives have also helped cut down on corruption. Steps have been taken to reduce
officer-citizen interaction (e.g. allowing citizens to provide their own forms, rather than purchasing them
from the government) and to demonopolize service providers on the grounds that monopolies breed
corruption (e.g. in Stamps and Registration, increasing the number of officers who can register documents).

In terms of corruption enforcement, Karnataka has always had, since 1985, the most powerful
anti-corruption office in the country, the Lok Ayukta. In other states, there are multiple anti-corruption
agencies (Andhra Pradesh) or the agency lacks independence (Tamil Nadu), or there is an independent
office, but it is woefully under-resourced (UP). In Karnataka, the Lok Ayukta, appointed by the Chief
Minister, is an independent office, the sole body charged with combating corruption, is well-resourced with
500 staff, and has a wide-ranging mandate to act in relation to complaints against both politicians and
officials. (He can also take his own investigative actions without complaints against all but the most senior
officials.) The Lok Ayukta has the power to search, seize, interrogate, prosecute, and recommend
disciplinary action against errant officials. The substantial power of the Lok Ayukta Office
notwithstanding, it had a low profile until July 2002, when Justice Venkatachala was appointed as Lok
Ayukta. The current Lok Ayukta has conducted a series of high-profile raids and investigations both in
Bangalore and around the state which have attracted enormous media attention. While some question the
methods and follow-up of the Lok Ayukta, there can be no doubting the publicity he has given to the
problem of corruption, and the pressure thereby placed on the system to clean up corruption, whether in the
health sector, property registration, the transport offices, etc. One indicator of the higher profile of the Lok
Ayukta is that the number of complaints he receives has increased to over 1,000 a month at the end of 2002
compared to about 300 a month at the start of 2002.

One ineffective measure taken by GoK to control corruption was the establishment of a Corruption
Prevention Committee the purpose of which was to review initiatives against corruption, and provide
pro-active leadership. The Committee's creation was a trigger for KERL2, but the Committee has rarely
met, and has had no impact.

Direct evidence for a fall in corruption comes only from the two recent surveys of land records and the
transport department (see Section 10). Broader evidence of the impact of the last two years' initiatives is


                                                       - 17 -

not available, but will be once the follow-up survey by PAC on service delivery in Bangalore is undertaken
this year. Many serious problems of corruption remain, but the Government deserves credit for its efforts to
date.

(c) Civil Service Reforms

Transfer of civil servants. Priority has been given to the problem of excessive and non-transparent
transfers of civil servants common to many Indian states, and certainly Karnataka. Transfers in Karnataka
averaged 27,000 transfers a year over the nineties, and rose to about 50,000 in 2000/01. Karnataka has
been able to limit transfer in individual years in the past, but has not been able to sustain a low level of
transfers. In 2001/02, the first steps were taken to put a permanent lid on transfers. Restrictions were
placed on transfers (a so-called "general ban"), which failed to eliminate them, but did reduce them to about
16,800 in 2001/02. While this was certainly a "drastic reduction" in transfers, as required by one of the
KERL2 triggers (#5), it should be noted that this figure of 16,800 was double the estimate for 2001/02
transfers made at the time of KERL2. It was then thought that most transfers would be in the first half of
2001-02, since the transfer season is in the first half of the year. However, in fact transfers for the second
half of the year were 8,390, almost identical to the first half-year figure of 8,408. The 2001/02 figures also
presaged a problem that would become very evident in 2002/03, that of excessive transfer of teachers. 60%
of the second-half-year transfers in 2001/02 were transfers of teachers, up from 35% for the first half of
the year.

In 2002/03, a new government policy came into force on transfers. This required transfers at all levels of
the civil service to be authorized by cadre management committees, set minimum tenures at all levels of the
civil service, and established an annual norm of a ceiling for transfers of 5% of staff strength. The idea was
that this committee-cum-guideline system would introduce transparency and discipline into the system of
civil service transfers, and limit the scope for bilateral deal-making and individual discretion. In general,
informal feedback indicates that the impact from the introduction of this system has been positive. Most
departments established cadre management committees, adhered to their rulings and their guidelines, and
have seen low volumes of transfers. Data for 2002/03 shows that total transfers reached about 35,000 for
the year, somewhat above the average of the last decade, but around the 5% norm set by the transfer policy.
However, as many as 28,000 of these were teachers. Transfers of teachers also continued well beyond the
transfer season with teachers accounting for 8,350 out of 9,700 transfers (roughly 86%) in August and
September, all outside the framework of the newly-established cadre management system, and disruptive
for school-children since they occurred during the school year. While there were violations of the transfer
norms in departments other than Education (especially in Finance and Transport), overall, excluding
Education, transfers were less than 3% of staff strength.

Coming to terms with the problem of excessive transfers of teachers thus seems critical if the government is
to keep transfers down. It turns out in fact that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
had a computerized transfer system (in which requests for transfers were entered into a computer which
decided on the outcome on the basis of a number of pre-identified criteria). Removal of this system in early
2000, for reasons which remain unclear but probably relate to a backlash against transparency, was a
mistake which gave rise to the high volume of teacher transfers seen in 2001/02 and 2002/03. The
computerized transfer system was reintroduced into the Education Department in May 2003, a move which
should certainly help the Government to sustain its reform efforts with respect to the transfers of civil
servants.

While the focus of the government policy has been on containing the aggregate number of transfers, it
should also be noted that there is a serious problem of frequent transfers, and thus short tenures, at the


                                                       - 18 -

senior managerial level. GoK is yet to deal effectively with the question of how to provide senior
management with sufficient tenure to enable them to perform competently and to be informed
reform-champions.

Speeding-up decision making. GoK has introduced various procedural initiatives over the last couple of
years to speed up decision making, such as the "single-file", "desk-officer" and "level-jumping" systems,
the last of which prescribes the maximum number of layers any file can go through. Government's own
reviews suggest mixed implementation of these measures. In 2002, a major step forward was taken with the
introduction of a computerized file monitoring system into the Secretariat. This is now being widely used
across departments, and by senior management to monitor file disposal. It has already increased pressure
on departments to reduce file pendency, and is expected to provide an objective basis on which to judge the
speed of governmental decision making. In a related move to "delayer" government, the offices of
Divisional Commissioners ­ which stood between the state and district governments ­ have been abolished,
and the necessary legal amendments made.

Functional review implementation. Prior to KERL2, 13 departmental functional reviews were completed
by external consultants under the auspices of the Administrative Reforms Commission. Attention has since
naturally turned to the implementation of these reviews. Overall, progress has been rather slow.
Departments have been asked to respond to the review and draw up an action plan for implementation.
These are in turn reviewed by a senior committee of the bureaucracy, a sub-committee of cabinet on
governance, and then finally by Cabinet itself. This process has been started by all departments, but is yet
to be completed by any. The most advanced is that of Commerce and Industry, the restructuring plan for
which has been approved by the Cabinet Sub-Committee but not yet by Cabinet itself. Some initial
measures have been taken, such as the abolition of the Stores Purchase Unit in the Commerce and Industry
Department (a central unit for common purchases) but much more remains to be done.


(iii) Private Sector Development.

Implementation of reform measures in the Karnataka Policy Paper on Deregulation of the Business
Environment has been slow. Implementation of the Policy of Public Enterprise Reform has shown more
tangible results.

(a) Business Deregulation.

The benchmark survey of industries carried out by the Public Affairs Center in 2002 at the GoK's behest
confirmed that regulatory processes are a major burden on business, especially for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, progress towards business deregulation which began in 2001 with the
publication of the Karnataka Policy Paper on Deregulation of the Business Environment has been slow.
The Karnataka Industries Facilitation Bill (KIFB) was passed by the Karnataka Assembly in August 2002,
and sent for Presidential Assent. However, GoI clearance has been slow. Some minor comments were
received in March 2003. These now require that an amended Bill be passed by the Karnataka Legislature,
which is expected in July 2003.

The considerable delay in enacting KIFB has held back implementation of several deregulation measures as
they are contained in the rules supporting the KIFB. An example is the Combined Application Form
(CAF) for all new investment proposals in the state. Other reforms have been implemented, such as a
reduction in the number of required annual registers and returns from 24 to 4, and the introduction of
random (though not joint) inspections to replace the old discretionary inspection regime. An industry portal



                                                    - 19 -

has been launched highlighting the various procedures and processes involved in setting up and expanding
a business in Karnataka. Upon receiving Presidential approval of KIFB, a user-friendly Handbook for
Entrepreneurs explaining the new deregulation measures will be released. A follow-up survey of
businesses is planned in 2004.

(b) Public Enterprise (PE) Reforms.

Karnataka has one of the highest number of state level PEs in India (last count was at 83) and since March
2001, with the publication of a new Public Enterprise Reform Policy, it has embarked on a PE
restructuring programme with the objective of privatizing or closing all commercial PEs. There has been
reasonable progress in this component, with the pace of implementation increasing following the creation of
the new Department of Disinvestment and Public Enterprise Reform (DDPER) in 2002.

Phase I PEs. (See Table 5 for a status summary as of end January, 2003.) Out of a revised Phase I list of
20 PEs, 9 have been closed, and government orders for privatization issued for 3. Of the remaining 8, 5
show no movement, and 3 are pending. Of Karnataka's four biggest PEs (excluding the utility power,
water and bus companies), two have been closed (NGEF and Mysore Lamps) and two are being put up for
sale (Mysore Paper Mills and Karnataka Soaps). Severance payments have been offered to about 50% of
total 10,774 employees of Phase 1 PEs of which 3,083 have been paid. GoK appointed the Director of
Employment and Training as the Social Safety Net Advisor and their office has been arranging for monthly
counseling sessions for retrenched workers at various locations. After much deliberation, several policy
related issues ­ such as privatization procedures and VRS guidelines for cases where pay scales have not
been revised ­ have been settled and implementation of Phase 1 program is expected to gain momentum in
coming months.

                          Table 5: Summary of PE Reform Programme

Beyond Phase I. Apart from the 20 PEs in Phase I, there are 19 more commercial PEs that need to be
either closed or privatized. These include several large loss making PEs with substantial liabilities. These
are now covered by a Phase II list. Apart from closing or privatizing all commercial enterprises in
Karnataka, the Department of Disinvestment's mandate also extends to reviewing the restructuring options
of various other government-owned companies, including the various boards and corporations. This will be
another important reform area for the future.

(iv) Poverty Monitoring and Statistical Strengthening.

Good progress has been made in this component, the aim of which is to deepen the capacity of GoK to
track the poverty reduction impact of its policies and programmes. Following the publication of a state
Human Development Report in 1999, GoK sought to institutionalize this one-off effort with the creation of
a Poverty and Human Development Monitoring System (PHDMS) to be managed by the Human
Development Division within the Department of Planning. Starting in 2002, a new poverty and human
development monitoring chapter has been included in GoK's annual Economic Survey to provide an annual
update on poverty and human development in the state. Collection and processing of data on wages, rural
retail prices, and the main agricultural commodities have been streamlined, and the first two quarterly
Economic and Statistics bulletins highlighting the key changes in these series have been published.

Efforts are also underway to improve program performance through increased emphasis on independent
program evaluations. In 2000/01, GoK issued a Government Order to establish the "Independent
Evaluation Initiative," which earmarked 1% of plan outlays on major schemes in the annual plan budget for
evaluation studies, defined broadly to include process evaluations (e.g., procurement audits) as well as
impact evaluations So far over 30 evaluations have been completed under this initiative. These evaluations
as well as departmental responses and action-taken reports have been discussed in a series of
interdepartmental workshops.

Finally, an attempt is being made to strengthen the GoK's statistical system. The statistical strengthening
sub-component aims to strengthen the Department of Economics and Statistics (DES) and to improve the
accuracy and timeliness of state output and inflation estimates. DES has begun to produce a quarterly
index of industrial production. An initial round of computerization and computer training is complete, the
integration of data entry and survey field operations is underway, and a new DES website with improved
dissemination capability has been launched.

(v) Power

Karnataka is relatively advanced in power sector reform processes. It has passed a Reform Act, established
a regulator, corporatized and unbundled with the creation of four new distribution companies. Yet, overall
the reform performance has been mixed.

Power sector finances. The financial status of Karnataka's power sector is very poor, as Table 6 shows.
Costs have risen sharply over the last few years due to the induction of expensive private generation plants
into the grid, a growing share of thermal plants relative to hydro.

Karnataka overshot its power sector financing requirement target in 2001/02 by Rs 165 crore or 7%,
largely due to higher interest payments on deferred payments (Table 7). However, the target itself allowed
for a slight nominal increase over the financing requirement in 2000/01. Losses were targeted to fall
significantly in 2002/03, but achieving this target has been very difficult for four reasons:

   l The target assumed a tariff increase of 30%, as requested by KPTCL of the regulator. In the event,
         however, the regulator only awarded a 15% increase.
   l Implementation of that 15% increase was then delayed by the government by 2 months on account
         of sensitivities over increasing the agricultural tariff. In the event, the increase was announced
         without the agricultural tariff increase, which remains deferred.
   l The rain shortfall has reduced hydro availability, pushing up costs by about Rs 4 billion.
   l Government has been unable to meet its subsidy obligations, forcing the sector to borrow on its
         own and delay power purchase payments, and thus pushing up interest payments.

The sector has been able to partially offset these negative shocks by restricting aggregate supply to its level
of the previous year, rather than allowing a "natural" growth of about 5% as originally envisaged. Other
cost-cutting measures have been introduced since January 2003: switching back to night-time supply to
farmers (to enable cheap, off-peak supply to be provided), and making use of the new Availability Based
Tariff to source cheap power supply from the national grid.     11  The net result of all this as per the latest
estimates is for an overshooting of the financing requirement target by about Rs 3 billion this year, which
would result in a moderate decline compared to last year: 1.9% of GSDP compared to 2.3% the year before
(Table 7). This is a significant achievement in the face of major cost escalations over which the company
had no control. Further reduction in power sector losses is targeted for 2003/04 with the agreed target of Rs
1,647 crore seen as realistic (provided that there is not a third year of drought).

       Note: The power sector financing requirement is equal to the negative of EBIDTA ( Earnings Before Interest,
       Depreciation, Tax and Amortization) plus interest plus capital expenditure. It relates to the transmission company
       and the four distribution companies created in 2002. The target "% GSDP" figures given are as a % of GSDP
       assumed at the time the target was formulated. From 2002/03 onwards, most pension payments (about Rs 2
       billion) are excluded as they are managed directly by a separate funding arrangement financed by government.


Power supply to agriculture The key problem in the power sector in Karnataka, as in other southern
states, has been agriculture. According to the Planning Commission, farmers with electric pump sets in
Karnataka, receives a Rs 26 billion subsidy. GoK has found it very difficult to increase agricultural tariffs,
and has twice deferred tariff orders from the regulator in this regard. So far a single increase of 80% has
been awarded, with much larger increases for better-off farmers. Karnataka is at about the national average
for agricultural tariffs (Rs. 0.39/kWh versus a national average of Rs. 0.41/kWh). The two-year drought
has made it difficult to raise tariffs, and the government has taken a soft-line on non-payment by farmers,
which has resulted in deteriorating collection efficiency, which has fallen to less than 15% among farmers,
compared to 50% in the previous year.

Supply rationing. One of the reasons for the increasing power sector losses in Karnataka in the past (as
indeed in other Indian states) has been the rapid increase in unmetered consumption of electricity. One of
the achievements in the last two years, as shown in the figure below, has been to restrict this growth, while
increasing the level of sales to consumers with meters. Whereas unmetered supply is estimated to have
grown by 28% in the two years up to 2000/01, in the two years since it has grown only by 2%, and it
actually declined marginally in 2002/03. ("Unmetered supply" is the difference between power purchases
by the transmission company and metered sales, and so includes unmetered sales as well as theft and
technical losses.) The share of metered sales to total supplies has grown from 35% in 2000/01 to 37% in
2002/03. Industrial consumption of electricity, which is profitable for the utility, has grown at an average
rate of 12% per annum for the last four years.

Tariff adjustment. Since the creation of the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission in 1999, there
have been three tariff orders in 2001, 2002, and 2003 respectively, for 17%, 16% and 2% increases
respectively. GoK has delayed the agricultural tariff increases in respect of each of the first two orders
(there was no increase in the third), and so far has implemented a single agricultural tariff increase (from
Rs 300 to Rs 540 Rs/HP p.a. or 80%; the second increase to Rs 720/HP has not yet been implemented).
The total effective tariff increase to date works out at about 34%. Increases filed for have been much larger
than those awarded: 30% and 10% for the last two filings. The 2001 filing was delayed due to its
controversial proposal to hike agricultural tariffs, and implementation of the order was likewise delayed for
about two months for the same reason. KERC has denied the utilities any compensation for a hydro-power
shortage, but has held out the prospect of compensation for 2001/02 once actuals are available, and for
2002/03, if required, through a mid-year tariff correction.

Along with increases in the average tariff, cross-subsidies have been reduced. The average commercial
tariff has fallen as a ratio of the average tariff from 268% in 1999/00 to 219% in 2002/03, and the average
industrial tariff over the same period from 198% to 167%.

Revenue growth from sales of electricity has been strong over the last two years. Revenue grew by 24% in
2001/02 (from Rs 36.6 billion to Rs 45.3 billion), and growth in 2002/03 was about 15%.

Collection efficiency ­ the ratio of cash collections to amount billed ­ has actually fallen over the last three
years: from 111% in 2000/01, 91% in 2001/02 and 85% for 2002/03, well below the GoK target of 95%.
Even the 91% achieved in 2001/02 is not very good, and more attention should have been given to this
problem earlier. Although cash collections have risen (by 13% in 2002/03 or 16% per unit of energy input),
this fall in collection efficiency reflects two factors: (i) disproportionately high tariff increases for the
subsidized categories (rural households and farmers) which are also reluctant payers; and (ii) worsening
performance across these categories. Collection efficiency among farmers (users of irrigation pump sets or
IP sets) is 15% (to December 2002), compared to 52% the year before; for rural households, 16%; and for
public lighting and rural water supply, 52%. For other categories, basically metered customers, collection
efficiency is 96.5%. GoK has taken a number of initiatives to improve collections in rural areas, the latest
being the contracting out of billing and collecting on a pilot basis, which is set to start in April. However,



                                                        - 24 -

with the poor rain in the last two years, government has been reluctant to disconnect farmers. In the
absence of a political message that farmers need to pay their bills or face disconnection, it is unclear what
success such measures can have.

Metering. Karnataka has adopted a policy of universal metering within three years, and in 2002/03
installed 1 million new meters including 100,000 on irrigation pumpsets. However, this was only 61% of
the overall target, and about 40% of the target for IP sets. There were long delays in procuring meters,
while resistance from farmers to being metered certainly hampered the metering drive among farmers.

Theft and loss reduction. Karnataka has amended the Electricity Act to tighten penalties for theft (the
so-called "Anti-Power-Theft Law" or ATL). Prior to enforcement of the anti-theft provisions, GoK
regularized almost 870,000 illegally connected consumers and cracked down on abuse of KPTCL's
subsidized electricity scheme for poor households in March/April 2002. Anti-theft activities are now
underway, and the distribution companies (Electricity Supply Companies or ESCOMs) are carrying out
raids and inspections, and booking offenders. However, vigorous enforcement of the ATL has been
hampered by lack of police personnel for the ESCOMs, a problem which has only recently been corrected.
While energy loss in 46 high-loss towns is being monitored monthly with a view to reducing losses, energy
auditing has not taken off, despite metering at the 11kV level. This activity has now been bid for
outsourcing by one of the ESCOMs, and the others are expected to follow suit. Although it is difficult to
accurately estimate theft and loss levels due to a lack of agricultural metering, the Government of
Karnataka estimates that theft and losses have fallen from 38% in 1999/00 to 32% in 2002/03.

Financial restructuring. It is unlikely that the past financial losses of the power sector could be recovered
by future tariff increases. Hence financial restructuring of the power utilities (a "bail-out") becomes
inevitable. Karnataka has been active in this regard. At the time of the formation of the ESCOMs, a
balance-sheet clean up was undertaken through which the Government agreed to take over significant
power sector liabilities. In addition, GoK has agreed to take on Rs 7.58 billion of KTPCL arrears to central
suppliers, which will be paid back at discount through the issuance of 10-year bonds under a tripartite
settlement worked out by GoI. GoK is also funding directly most pension obligations of KPTCL and the
ESCOMs.

Subsidy payments. In 2001/02, GoK increased its subsidy payments to the power sector in recognition of
the losses being incurred by the utilities on accounts of the Government's subsidy policies. As mentioned,
total budgetary support to the power sector increased from Rs 8.68 billion in 2000/01 to Rs 23 billion in
2001/02. The non-availability of KERL3 has made it difficult for government to fulfill its subsidy
obligations in 2002/03. The latest estimate is for budgetary support at about Rs 17.5 billion, of which
about Rs 8.5 billion was financed by debt write-off to the generation corporation, as against an initial
budgetary target of Rs 21.4 billion.

Unbundling. Four regional distribution companies (ESCOMs) were unbundled from KPTCL and began
operations in June 2002. The ESCOMs are now directly responsible for key areas of the reform agenda
such as metering, ant-theft implementation, improving collection efficiency and customer service, and so
on. They are directly owned by the Government, rather than by KPTCL, for greater autonomy in operation.
However GoK's recent decision to appoint the KPTCL MD as Chairman of all ESCOMs is contrary to the
stated objective of independent operations.

Privatization. GoK made public its Cabinet-approved Privatization Strategy in December 2002. This
strategy adopts the so-called "distribution margin" approach under which the privatized distribution



                                                     - 25 -

companies will be protected from power purchase and power supply risks, and their remuneration will
depend primarily on their ability to improve collections. The Government's plan is to complete privatization
for the whole state in early-2004, but, given the delays to date, it is uncertain whether this goal will be
achieved.

(vi) Education

Education, like power though for very different reasons, has also been identified as a critical sector for
accelerating growth and reducing poverty. In the past 2 years, GoK has completed a series of education
studies covering a range of sub-sectors from elementary to tertiary education, teacher and teacher
education, pedagogy reforms and governance reforms. These culminated in a new education sector strategy
paper (EduVision) which outlines the following priority areas for attention: (i) ensuring universal
completion and improving quality of elementary education; (ii) widening access of poor student to
secondary education and improving its quality; (iii) reforming teacher education and teacher in-service
training; (iv) introducing system-level pedagogic improvement and support systems; (v) improving the
relevance and quality of higher education; and (vi) reforming the system of educational governance. Both
in elementary and secondary education, quantitative targets were set, namely to ensure that all children
complete eight years of elementary education by 2007 and that 65 percent of the 14-16 year age group are
enrolled in secondary education, with 80 percent of them completing 10 years of school.

A number of actions have already been taken, including: hiring of additional teachers; a large school and
classroom/toilet/drinking water construction program; and new programs to bring drop-outs including
child-labourers back to school. According to the latest data, enrollment levels have gone up considerably
(see Section 10 for figures). A special program has been launched for the educationally-backward districts
in the north of the state. Steps have been taken to rationalize student-teacher ratios across the state
(generating savings of Rs 1.37 billion), reduce teacher absenteeism (e.g. through surprise inspections),
strengthen teacher training, and improve the curriculum and assessment system. School Development and
Monitoring Committees have been established. Members are elected from among parents, and monitor
teacher attendance and pupil progress. Public-private partnerships have been developed both to improve
elementary education standards and to introduce IT based education at the secondary level (see 6.1 for
details). A mid-day meal scheme has been introduced in the north-east, and will be extended to the entire
state in 2003/04. Finally, five action plans have been approved by GoK to operationalize the
recommendations of EduVision. These include: a program for universalising elementary education in the
backward north-eastern districts; a high school development plan; the restructuring of Block Resource
Centres and Cluster Resource Centres; teacher management reforms; and establishment of a School Quality
Assurance Organisation. Implementation of these plans will depend to some extent on the availability of
additional resources, which GoK is currently seeking through various means.

institutions were established or existing institutions were reformed under most components. Under the
fiscal and public expenditure reforms component, the Medium Term Fiscal Plan has been well
institutionalized, has had a major impact, and now has legal backing through the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
GoK's capacity for poverty monitoring and statistical output has been strengthened, and the independent
evaluation initiative is doing well. Under the administrative reforms component, institutional reforms to
improve service delivery by public agencies, especially through e-governance, have been significant and are
expanding. It is still early days for th institutional innovations to make civil service transfers more
transparent, but it they are sustained their impact will be considerable. Under the private sector
development component, creation of a new Department for Disinvestment and Public Enterprise Reform
(DDPER) is expected to accelerate the pace of PE reform. However, progress in reforming the various
GoK departments and agencies from being controllers to facilitators of business development has been
slow. Major sectoral institutional reforms have also been seen, such as the creation of separate distribution
companies in the power sector, and the establishment of School Development and Monitoring Committees.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

The main factor outside government control was the two consecutive years of poor rainfall: 2001/02 the
worst in the last twenty years, and 2002/03 the worst in the last thirty years. The impact of this in terms of
low growth and higher fiscal costs, especially in the power sector, has already been discussed (Box 3). The
political environment for reforms also deteriorated in 2002 due to the intensive dispute over the sharing of
the Cauvery waters between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu ­ which resulted in the Karnataka CM being held
in contempt of the Supreme Court ­ and due a second kidnapping by the forest brigand, Veerappan, which
ended in the tragic death of his hostage, a former Minister. These events diverted attention from the
                                                                12


reform agenda.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

The KERL1 ICR noted that KERL2 and KERL1 were negotiated largely by the same set of government
officials. However, since KERL2 approval, there has been a high turnover in key positions. In some cases,
this has been disruptive. Fortunately, however, Karnataka benefits from a strong and capable bureaucracy,
many of whom agree on the state's reform agenda, and who have largely ensured continuity of direction.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

The GoK was the implementing agency. See 5.2 above.

5.4 Costs and financing:

KERL1 provided GoK US$150 million equivalent and KERL2 US$100 million equivalent both in
2001-02. Each loan was disbursed in one tranche upon effectiveness, and were 50-50 IDA-IBRD blends.
The marginal impact of this financing in 2001/02 can be most clearly seen in two areas:

   l Meeting budgetary power-sector subsidy obligations. Prior to 2001/02, GoK was unable to do this,
         which resulted in the utility borrowing off-budget. The extra subsidy payment in 2001/02 over
         2000/01 of about Rs 14 billion was made possible by KERL financing.
   l Voluntary retirement (VRS) payments to help closure/sale of public enterprises. These are
         estimated at Rs 0.6 billion in 2001/02.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The project is considered likely to be sustainable. To be sure, despite the progress made to date,
sustainability of the reforms does face various risks ­ some unique to Karnataka and some applicable to
most reforming states in India. While consolidated borrowing is now falling, there needs to be more fiscal
adjustment before the state's fiscal position can be regarded as sustainable. Power sector financial losses
are also falling, but continue to be the single largest drain on the state's finances. The constraints to
reforming the power sector, while similar to those faced by other states, appear to be formidable. In
particular, Karnataka has a very strong farmers' lobby, which will resist several of the reforms required,
especially in the power sector. Other vested interest groups will continue to resist reforms which aim to
reduce corruption and eliminate waste.

However, the rating of sustainability as likely, despite the above risks, rests both on the progress made to
date, including in the power sector, and on two cross-cutting strengths of Karnataka's reform program
outlined in 4.1, namely: reliance on public-private partnerships and an active civil society; and the
implementation of a legislative approach to reform. Pressure from civil society will continue to promote
reform, while the willingness of the government to give a larger role to the private sector means will mean
continued movement in the direction of contracting out and privatization. The legislative approach to
reform taken in Karnataka helps provides institutional backing to reform objectives. While the legislative
route is a slow one, it is likely to promote the sustainability of reforms. It is important to note that two of
Karnataka's seven reform acts were passed prior to the 1999 elections which brought the current
government to power (the Electricity Reform Act and the Ceiling on Government Guarantees Act). A third
(on procurement transparency) was drafted, though not passed, by the previous government. One can
indeed reasonably hope that the reform legislation passed to date will survive the next election (due by
end-2004), regardless of its outcome.

We also take into account, when making this sustainability rating, the success achieved to date in
improving development outcomes (as detailed in Section 10 and summarized in Box 4). The facts that
Karnataka is on a rapid growth path and has a track-record of improving service delivery and reducing
poverty all make it more likely that the state will be able to sustain reforms. Reformers in Karnataka are in
the fortunate position of being able to point to the fruits of reform rather than being forced to resort simply
to the promise of a better tomorrow. While the state and its government both have a long way to go before
they reach their full potential, there is good reason to believe that an irreversible process of reform has been
set in motion.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

The Bank's lending performance (identification, preparation, and appraisal) was satisfactory. The original
idea to make KERL2 available within the same fiscal year as KERL1, subject to good performance, was a
good one, and helped accelerate reforms. The project concept is consistent with the present focus of the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy in India, namely, to focus resources on states that demonstrate



                                                      - 28 -

willingness to implement reforms needed to improve economic performance and reduce poverty. It is also
strongly aligned with the CAS theme of strengthening the enabling environment by improving government
effectiveness and promoting private-sector led growth.

7.2 Supervision:

The Bank's supervision of the operation during implementation was satisfactory. There was close
collaboration between the authorities and the Bank missions. GoK's monitoring system worked well to
give early warning signs of fiscal stress. In addition, the Bank team helped develop detailed matrices that
tracked progress under most components. Problems and delays were identified earlier and resolved
wherever possible. Joint wrap-ups between GoK, GoI and the Bank helped highlight problems and ensure
coordination.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

The Borrower's performance was satisfactory, when considering identification and preparation. GoK
continued to implement the comprehensive economic restructuring program it has embarked upon. Further
reports and studies commissioned by GoK were completed prior to KERL2, which helped take the reform
agenda further forward. GoK has also demonstrated a high level of technical capability in designing and
managing the reform process.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

The GoK's implementation performance is considered satisfactory (consistent with the assessment of 4.1 of
GoK's achievement of its reform objectives under KERL2 are satisfactory). Karnataka remains one of
India's leading reformers and best performers, and much has been achieved both leading up to and since
KERL2 approval despite a difficult environment. Yet, as noted, there have also been important
shortcomings, and performance was judged inadequate for GoK to access KERL3 in 2002/03, though the
door was left open for the state to qualify in 2003/04 subject to various catch-up measures being taken.
Some further comments on government performance follow.

Judging the adequacy of the speed of reforms is a difficult and inevitably subjective matter. Yet there can
be no doubt that reforms have not moved as fast as they could have. This is certainly true in the power
sector. To give another example, the state's initiatives to deregulate the business environment are still not
properly in place almost three years after they were conceptualized. There can be no doubt that the political
attention on reforms was challenged by the events of 2002 (see 5.1). In hindsight, more of the tough
decisions required under the reform program should have been taken in 2000. Indeed, it is ironic that the
first agricultural tariff increase was deferred in that year on account of a bumper harvest leading to low
prices, and apparent agricultural distress ­ but nothing like the distress seen in the next two years!

Karnataka's reform style has also been one of "reform through consensus." Various reform measures such
as metering of IP sets, and revision of user charges for higher education, have inevitably met with
resistance from vested interests, and in several of these cases GoK has backed down in the face of protests.

8. Lessons Learned


Experience with both KERL1 and KERL2 supports the conclusion that a series of single-tranche
adjustment operations, anchored through a medium-term reform framework, state-level can be an effective
instrument to support reforms in India, both in the state concerned and in other states through a
demonstration effect. The experience specifically shows that, especially at the start of a reform process,
having more, smaller loans/credits is an effective way of adding impetus to the reform program.

A number of policy lessons have emerged, in addition to those which were identified in the KERL1 ICR
and which are not repeated here.

·        Fiscal targeting is difficult in the power sector. Any targets have to make assumptions on tariffs
and costs. Yet neither of these is under the control of the utility, and both are difficult to predict. Fiscal
targeting is exactly what the power sector needs, yet some flexibility is required given the way the sector
works. This said, there can be no doubt that having a consolidated fiscal target forced the government to
look beyond the budget, and introduce fiscal discipline into the power sector. The falling financial losses of
the sector bear testimony to the success of this approach. Clear milestones for power sector reform also
helped monitor progress in this very difficult reform area.

·        Fiscal targeting with respect to the budget needs to allow for volatile growth given the dependence
of states on agriculture, and the dependence of agriculture on an uncertain rainfall. Fiscal targets expressed
as a percentage of GSDP cannot be regarded as sacrosanct, though nominal (Rupee) targets should be
adhered to wherever possible, at least until the fiscal position is more comfortable.

·        Institutional reforms take time. It is striking that Karnataka's two most impressive institutional
reforms, the two e-governance projects which have successfully computerized land records (Bhoomi) and
treasury operations (Khajane), were conceived of in the late nineties and have just now come to fruition.

·        Some of the hardest reforms are those which require cooperation across departments, such as the
industrial deregulation, which require departments as diverse as Environment, Labor and the Inspectorate
of Factories and Boilers to co-operate; or the integration of taxation check-posts, which would affect
Excise, Commercial Taxes, Transport, Forestry, and Agricultural Marketing. Perhaps reflecting GoK's
decentralized style of functioning, reforms in Karnataka are more likely to succeed if they are owned by,
and depend on, a single department. Strong, central leadership is needed to make co-ordinated reforms
work.

·        India's federal structure does allow reforming states like Karnataka to move ahead in a range of
areas. The creation of the Fiscal Reforms Facility by GoI has certainly upped the impetus for reform.
However, state-level reforms would move faster if central government reforms moved faster, especially in
the area of fiscal adjustment. State reforms which require central action are often going to be slow (e.g.
VAT introduction, budgeting and accounting changes).



                                                       - 30 -

·        One risk to Karnataka Economic Restructuring Program is that it is getting overly-complex and
ambitious and is losing its focus. The larger the number of components and conditions, the greater the
corresponding requirement for judgment and compromise, since invariably performance will be better in
some areas than others. Cross-cutting reforms and sectoral focus are complementary to each other, not
least because the latter provides a reality check on the former (e.g. the lack of progress in education in
restricting teacher transfers). It is also recognized that, in a reform program such as this, it will be
impossible to remove the element of judgment when assessing overall performance. To maintain focus,
however, there may be a need to consider dropping some Program components, or at least reducing the
number of items under each component.

                             Borrower's Perspective ­ Government of India


         The Government of India's perspective on the Karnatak's Economic Restructuring Loan will be
dealt with in two parts. The first would refer to the GoI's view on the general World Bank structure of
loan. Secondly, the measures that are identified as critical milestones under KERLs.

         As far as the first part is concerned, assistance for Loan/credit is a commitment based on a phased
/ tranched manner over the medium term subject to the State achieving the critical and key milestone
priorities combined with overall fiscal environment of the State.

        In so far as the critical measures on KERL II are concerned, Department of Expenditure would
comment on them in two parts
.
A.       Fiscal Outcomes

         The progress in achieving the core outcome objectives of fiscal sustainability, have been mixed.

         1.       The Consolidated Fiscal Deficit (CFD) (including power sector subsidy gap) fell in
         2001-02 (PA) to 5.60% of GSDP from 6.53% in 2000-01(Act.) and is further targeted to fall to
         5.43% in 2002-03(B.E.).

         2.       However, the Consolidated Revenue Deficit (CRD) has gone up to 2.66% from 2.23% of
         GSDP and is projected to go up further to 2.85% during the same period.

         3.       Under the State Fiscal Reforms Facility, apart from CFD, importance is given to CRD as
         a % of Total Revenue Receipts.

         4.       While the deterioration has been sought to be blamed in equal measure to the shortfall in
         Central devolution as well as state's Own Tax and Non Tax efforts, disaggregating the secular
         deterioration as given in the table below, gives a different picture :

                 Indicators                                1999-00        2000-01       2001-02

                 CRD as % TRR                              -21.93         -16.46        -20.21

                 State's Own Fiscal Effort as % of -50.53                 -45.24        -50.13

                 TRR

                 Central Transfer as % of TRR              28.61          28.77         29.93


                  This would show that Central transfers as a % of TRR increased in 2001-02 over
         2000-01. The deterioration in CRD as a % of TRR is almost attributable to the State's
         deteriorating fiscal stance on the Revenue Account. This is a worrisome trend and requires

        immediate correctives.

        5.      The deterioration in the States own fiscal stance is explained as due to the full power
        sector subsidy budgeted in 2001-02. However, had the subsidy for the earlier year been fully
        provided for in the budget 2000-01. The position would be as follows :

                                                              (Rs. in crore)

             Particulars                                        2000-01       2001-02

             Consolidated Revenue Deficit (CRD)                 3460 *        3008

             As % of GSDP                                       3.28          2.66

        * - Including non - budgeted power sector subsidy gap of Rs.1112 crore.

        The improvement thereby registered is marginally higher in 2001-02 vis-à-vis 2000-01 in this

context.

B.      Process Milestones

        As agreed upon by the State Govt. and World Bank, the GoK had to achieve 12 key fiscal and
governance reforms milestones under KERL I for KERL II, eleven of these actions were completed.
Thereafter, twelfth, the Right to Information Act, has also been notified on 18th July, 2002 and the act is
now effective. GOK has made good overall progress in fiscal and governance reform programme during
2000-01 and early part of 2001-02 and became eligible to draw the second tranche of US $ 100 million.
KERL II focuses on the eleven completed upfront actions, which would be used as objective indicator of
progress of reforms to qualify for KERL III. These are as summarised below:

Power Sector Reforms

        The most critical sector for the State Government is the power sector, where reforms need to be
accelerated to improve the fiscal position of the State and to justify continuing bank support to the State.
GoK has taken the following actions in the last few months.

    ·   GoK has released Rs. 2300 crore as subsidy budgeted during 2001-02 to avoid cumulative build
        up of arrears. It is also decided to make    provision in the budget for the next years as financial
        requirement by power sector.
    ·   The order of first tariff revision of 17% in December, 2001 and the second revision of 16.2% in
        May, 2002 was issued by the regulatory Commission.
    ·   Four Distribution Companies were formed in April, 2002.
    ·   The anti theft legislation as an amendment has been promulgated effective from April, 2002.
        Special Court have been set up for special trial.
    ·   A privatization strategy for distribution companies adopting " distribution margin" approach has
        been developed so as to make it attractive to investors. It is expected that the complete privatization
        will be done within the next 2 years.
    ·   Upto July, 2002, 5.45 lakh meters were installed as against the target of 18.44 lakh during
        2002-03.
    ·   Power sector finances are monitored by the State Government on a monthly basis, and a Financial
        Restructuring Plan for the power sector, fully consistent with MTFP and the budget, is being
        implemented.

Poverty Monitoring and Statistical Strengthening

    ·   To monitor the rural living standards and agricultural condition, a new poverty and Human
        Development monitoring System was created in 2001.
    ·   A monthly industrial production series will commence this year. GSDP estimation will also be
        computerised and the comparative analysis with other States will be done.
    ·   The MTFP also included a section on growth and inflation estimates and prospects.

        The initial steps taken by the State Government, despite a difficult economic environment during
the year 2001-02, may put Karnataka on the road to fiscal recovery.

        Fiscal and Governance reforms as well as power sector reforms are expected to continue in respect
to the Karnataka's Economic Restructuring Programme. Sixteen critical milestones would also be used as
indicative triggers for KERL III by the World Bank.

EVALUATION REPORT ON THE SECOND KARNATAKA ECONOMIC
RESTRUCTURING LOAN/ CREDIT BY GOVERNMENT OF KARNATAKA

         Government of Karnataka has embarked upon a comprehensive economic reforms programme
encompassing various sectors since the latter part of 1999. The overarching goal of the State Government
is reduction of poverty through high economic growth tempered with equity. With this in view, the
collaboration with the World Bank for a programme loan in the form of budgetary support was envisaged.
This was necessary as in the interim period during restructuring, there would be need for additional support
so as to maintain a minimum acceptable level of expenditure in priority sector areas of human development
and infrastructure including elementary education, health, rural water supply, roads, housing and the like.
          The Karnataka Economic Restructuring Programme has four components: (i) the fiscal and public
expenditure reforms (ii) Administrative reforms (iii) the private sector development component (iv)
establishment and development of a poverty and human development monitoring system.
         Government of Karnataka received assistance of $150 million under KERL-1 on 24th August
2001. Government of Karnataka successfully negotiated KERL ­II after action was taken upfront on all
the 12 triggers. The second tranche of $100 million was received on 27th March 2002 under KERL-II.
         Government of Karnataka has fully achieved all the activating triggers for KERL-II. Some of the
initiatives which are unprecedented among Indian States under each of the components are given below:

Fiscal Policy and Public Expenditure Management:

1.       Karnataka has taken several measures to institutionalize fiscal discipline. It is the first state to
bring out annual fiscal frameworks for two or more years running; one of the few to have a legislated
guarantee cap; and the first to enact a Fiscal Responsibility Act. Progress against the specific benchmarks
is highlighted below:
(i)      The MTFP for the period 2002-03 to 2005-06 was tabled in the Legislature on August 6, 2002.
This is Karnataka's second annual Medium Term Fiscal Plan. Besides communicating to the public the
government's fiscal targets, it also reports against progress last year. The 2002 MTFP has been widely
disseminated.
(ii)     The Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Bill was passed by the Legislature on August 7, 2002. The
Act, the first of its kind for an Indian state, commits the Government of Karnataka to eliminate the
revenue deficit and restrict the fiscal deficit to 3% of GSDP by 2005-06. Each year leading up to 2005-06,
these ratios are required to be reduced. Among other things, the Act requires the Finance Minister to report
every six months to the Legislature on fiscal progress; any change in fiscal policy during the year is
required to be offset by countervailing measures so that fiscal targets are achieved.
(iii)    The Ceiling on Government Guarantees Act is being adhered to. Guarantees are being restricted to
80% of revenue receipts pertaining to the year 2 years prior to the current year, less the outstanding
guarantees at the beginning of the year. From 2002-03 onwards the government has been reallocating the
ceiling according to sectoral priority.

2.       Good progress has been made towards the core goal of achieving fiscal sustainability. The
Karnataka Economic Restructuring Programme targets the consolidated deficit as the core fiscal indicator.
This is a comprehensive measure, which includes in addition to the budget deficit, off-budget borrowing
and power sector financial losses. According to the revised estimates presented in the 2002 Medium Term
Fiscal Plan (MTFP), the consolidated deficit fell in 2001-02 to 6.19% of GSDP (Rs 7,012 crore) from
6.53% of GSDP (Rs 6,882 crore) in 2000-01 (actuals). This is the first reduction in the consolidated deficit
in Karnataka since the mid-nineties. For 2002-03, substantial reduction in the consolidated deficit has been

targeted.

3.       Government of Karnataka tracks its fiscal performance on a monthly basis. Monthly fiscal
accounts are being posted on the web-site (www. kar.nic.in/statebudget) and are very much on track. Last
year, GoK established a credible record of cutting expenditure in line with any revenue short-fall, and stuck
to its borrowing targets, both on and off-budget.

4.       The Government of Karnataka lays emphasis on improving public expenditure management to lead
to more efficient and productive public expenditure management. Major progress was made in this regard
last year with the publication of five Departmental Medium-Term Fiscal Plans (DMTFPs). These were for
the following major departments: health; school education; public works; medical education; and rural
water supply component of the rural development and panchayati raj department. These DMTFPs are
4-year plans, in which Departments articulate their objectives, strategies, programmes, resources, and
performance indicators against which their performance will be judged. The resource envelopes provided in
the DMTFPs are consistent with the overall Government MTFP. The DMTFPs are intended to provide the
departments with greater resource predictability, and will also be used to give them greater flexibility in
operation of their programmes (which are an amalgamation of related schemes). All departments are
preparing DMTFPs for the period 2003-04 to 2006-07. This would further help in better public
expenditure management.

5.       Karnataka is one of the leading states as far as introduction of VAT is concerned. Karnataka has
already taken many important policy measures and administrative steps towards introduction of VAT and
rationalisation of the sales tax regime, including the following measures which were announced in the
2002-03 budget: abolition of the turnover tax; abolition of entry tax on inputs and packaging material;
abolition of the infrastructure cess on sales tax; and the rationalisation of sales tax rates towards four main
rates, 4%, 8%, 12% and 15%; A number of measures have been taken to improve compliance and reduce
corruption. Self-assessment is now widely in place. An Authority for Clarification and Advance Rulings
has been constituted to improve transparency and reduce disputes. To reduce assessor-assessee contact,
dealers with annual turnovers of above Rs 1 crore are allowed to use their own forms rather than statutory
Form-37 declarations. Discretion in the levy of penalties in cases of assessment, re-assessment, short
payment and misuse of tax concessions has been reduced. The Government has decided to re-organise the
Commercial Tax Department along functional lines, and is strengthening its enforcement capacity. The
Department will be coming out with a Citizens' Charter shortly.

6.       In 2000, Karnataka passed the Transparency in Public Procurement Act. This is being
implemented strictly, resulting in a major reduction in procurement-related irregularity. In February 2002,
the Government of Karnataka drew up a Procurement Reform Action Plan to bring about further reforms
towards transparency in procurement. One of the main aims is to produce standard bidding documents,
which can be used across departments. These have now been drafted, as have a number of circulars
clarifying rules for tendering (e.g. specifying cases in which negotiations with the lowest bidder are
allowed). These documents will be finalized and published shortly. An increasing number of Departments
are now using websites for placing tender notices, as well as bidding documents, pre-qualification details
and evaluation results. KBJNL and KRDCL have started pilots in e-tendering, by which bids for tenders
are placed over the Internet.

Administrative Reforms:

7.        In August 2001, GoK tabled its first annual Governance Strategy and Action Plan (GSAP). The
2002-03 Governance Strategy and Action Plan 2002-03 was tabled in the Legislature on August 8, 2002.
This document reports on progress in governance reforms in the last year, and sets out targets for the
current year.

8.       Premature and frequent transfer of civil servants has been a major problem affecting quality of
administration in Karnataka as well as in all other Indian states. Government of Karnataka took cognizance
of this major problem and implemented several reform measures. In the year 2001-02, a general ban on
transfers was declared, and the number of transfers came down to 16,830 from 50,029 in 2000-01. To keep
the number of transfers at a sustainably low level, an order has been issued in November 2001 prescribing
that the transfers are to be done only by Cadre Management Authorities constituted by each department as
specified in the order. These authorities will suggest transfer of Government servants only during the
beginning of the fiscal year, except under very extraordinary circumstances. The transfers effected will be
the barest minimum and ordinarily will not exceed 5% of the working strength of the cadre. Minimum and
maximum periods of stay have been prescribed and premature transfers have been banned except under the
very limited circumstances mentioned. In the course of 2002-03, this order has been implemented, and
Cadre Management Authorities have been established. The Government of Karnataka will continue to
publicly report on the volume of transfers every six months on its web-site (vsb.kar.nic.in / dpar
/dpar.htm).

9.       Reforms to speed up decision making, through reduction in numbers of levels through which files
are processed, including in the offices of the Heads of Departments has been undertaken. Desk- Officer
system and single file system have been introduced. This year, in addition to continued implementation of
the single-file system and desk-officer system in various departments, a Government Order has been issued
to introduce level- jumping in the Secretariat, so that a file does not pass through more than three levels in
its processing. All the departments of the Secretariat have been linked on the Local Area Network, and
have been provided with common software applications. The network has bi-lingual operations in Kannada
and English. All this initiatives have helped in considerable reduction in the time taken to process files.


10.      Karnataka enacted a Right to Information Act in 2000-01. The rules for the Right to Information
Act were notified on July 18, 2002 and the Act is now effective. This is a comprehensive legislation, which
promotes transparency by giving citizens the right to obtain information from government. Officials have
already been trained with respect to their new obligations under the Act.

11.      Karnataka's agency reforms made major progress in 2002-03, with respect to both rollout and
deepening in areas such as Transport, Stamps and Registration, and Police departments.

12.      The Government has taken up several e-governance initiatives. The Government's e-governance
strategy has been approved and published. Karnataka is also the first state to have fully computerized its
land records under the       Bhoomi project. Another notable initiative has been the computerization of
treasuries. All the 215 treasuries in the state have been computerized. Necessary infrastructure has been
created. All the 215 treasuries are connected to a central server at Bangalore through V-SAT network. The
treasury transactions are being done in the new software "KHAJANE' since November 2002.                    All
payments are being made on-line through the Central Server. The details of remaining treasury transactions
are captured each day at the end of the day by the central server. All the treasuries have started their
monthly accounts in the computerized system and monthly reports like receipts, expenditure, Head of
Account wise plan and Non-Plan Expenditures are being generated. This MIS has helped in taking quick
decisions and led to better financial management.

13.      Government has constituted a High-Level Anti-corruption Committee under the Chairmanship of
the Chief Minister to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the existing components of the
anti-corruption effort and to monitor the implementation of the programme. Institutions like the Lokayukta
have been strengthened and this has had a positive impact.



                                                     - 41 -

Private Sector Development:

14.     The Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Bill has been passed by the Legislature on August 9, 2002.
The Act has the following key provisions: (i) establishment of a High Level Clearance Committee, and
State and District Level Single Window Clearance Committees which will have final authority for project
approvals; (ii) introduction of a Combined Application Form, to replace separate application form for
different approvals; (iii) approvals to be given on the basis of self-certification of compliance; (iv) deemed
clearances to be given if not provided within the stipulated time-period; (v) rationalization of inspections,
through the use of joint inspections on the basis of random selections. Through implementation of these
provisions, the Act is expected to make it much easier for businesses to set up and operate in Karnataka.
Appropriate provisions to ensure environmental protection have been incorporated. The supporting work to
enable implementation of this new Act is also well underway. The Inspectorate of Factories and Boilers has
already started inspections on the basis of random selection, and this will soon be generalized across all
inspecting departments. A Combined Application Form has been devised, and various clearance committees
have been established. A new inspection system based on generation of random samples is being developed.
In addition, a Handbook to explain the change in procedures to industry has been drafted, and a base-line
survey of industry satisfaction with government services completed.


15.     Since the publication of the Karnataka Policy on State Public Sector Reforms and Privatization at
the end of 2000-01, Government orders have been issued for closure of 8 PSUs, and VRS has been offered
to all the staff of these units, viz: Karnataka Telecom Limited, Chamundi Machine Tools, Mysore
Cosmetics, Mysore Match Company, Mysore Lamps Works, NGEF, Karnataka Agro-Proteins, and
Karnataka Small Industries Marketing Corporation. Closure orders are expected shortly for another two.
Privatization of three more PSUs is under active consideration. VRS has been offered to more than 5,000
and has been accepted by more than 4,000 employees. In addition, to speed up implementation, an order
was issued on 5th August, 2002, changing the Karnataka State Bureau of Public Enterprises into a
Department of Disinvestment, with authority over all matters relating to disinvestment of state government
equity in public sector undertakings.


        Government of Karnataka had to face unprecedented drought for the second consecutive year. This
adversely affected agricultural production and in turn economic growth. The Cauvery river water dispute,
direct fallout of this, complicated the problem further. The drought also affected the level of reservoirs for
hydroelectric generation. This meant that the transmission company had to buy power from IPPs at a much
higher rate affecting the power sector finances and in turn the State finances. Inspite of this problem,
reforms in the power sector continued. Generation, transmission and distribution have been fully
unbundled. Four distribution companies were formed in April, 2002 and are now fully functional under a
statutory transfer scheme.     Their balance sheets have also been cleaned up.           These companies are
independent and are not subsidiaries of Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL).
Daily supply position is being monitored and placed on the Internet.


        As explained above, the State Government has made significant progress on all the aspects, the
highlight being the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Act. The State Government feels that the
implementation of the KERL-II has been quite satisfactory. This has been a period of stabilization,
consolidation and further progress of the reform programme initiated. The quality of interaction between
State Government officials and the Bank staff has been of a very high order. It is hoped that the next phase
of the programme will further consolidate the gains and improve upon them both in quality and quantity in
a substantial way.

10. Additional Information

                      An Assessment of Recent Development Outcomes in Karnataka

In this annex, we step back from the detailed assessment of the reform program provided so far, and
attempt a broader assessment of "results on the ground" in Karnataka in the nineties, and especially in the
second half of the nineties. We begin with growth and poverty reduction, then turn to the investment
climate, and finally to human development and service delivery.

(i) Growth and Poverty Reduction

Karnataka has emerged as India's fastest growing state. Its growth rate picked up from 5.3% in the eighties
(below the national average) to 7.4% in the nineties, making it the fastest growing state in the nation.
Karnataka is also the only state to have experienced average growth in excess of 8% per year during the
second half of the 1990s, a period for which (1995/96-99/00) the average growth rate for the 14 major
states in India is around 5.6%. During this period, Karnataka's agricultural, industrial and service sectors
grew at a rate of 4.0%, 9.2% and 10.6% respectively, compared to the all-India averages of 3.6%, 5.0%
and 8.7%. Karnataka's good growth record was maintained in 2000/01 (with real growth of 6.7%), but
slowed down in 2001/02 and 2002/03 on account of drought (see Box 3 in the main text on this).

Karnataka's performance in reducing poverty in the nineties has also been impressive. Using the
now-widely-accepted Deaton-adjusted poverty estimates, rural poverty in Karnataka fell from 37.9% in
                                                          13


1993/94 to 30.7% in 1999/00 (compared to an all India decline from 33% to 26%) and urban poverty fell
from 21.4% in 1993/94 to 10.8% in 1999/00 (compared to an all India decline from 18% to 12%). Thus
there was a slightly above average reduction in rural areas and a greatly above average reduction in urban
areas. Karnataka is one of India's most urbanized states, and overall poverty fell from 32.6% to 24%
                                                          14


compared to the national decline from 29.1% to 22.2%.

The faster pace of poverty reduction in urban relative to rural areas is explicable largely in terms of much
more rapid average consumption growth in urban areas (according to the NSS average per capita
consumption grew by 27% in urban areas in Karnataka between 1993-94 and 1999-00, whereas rural
consumption grew by 10% over the same period). This in turn is linked to Karnataka's very rapid industrial
and service sector growth. Nevertheless, the rural poverty reduction is significant, and corroborated by
                           15


growth in agricultural wages which was 3.2% on average for the nineties in Karnataka, compared to 2.5%
for India as a whole.16

(ii) Investment climate

A country or state's investment climate is a key determinant of its growth performance. Karnataka's
investment climate (IC) has recently been studied as part of the World Bank-CII multi-state firm-level
competitiveness survey. Karnataka comes out 4th in this study of 10 states in a ranking based on investor
perceptions, behind Gujarat and Maharashtra, which are way ahead of all other states, and Tamil Nadu,
which emerges as marginally better than Karnataka (Table A3). Compared to Maharashtra and Gujarat,
Karnataka essentially suffers from higher unit costs as well as poorer availability of industrial power
supply and higher interest rates. Notwithstanding these factors, the gap between best and good IC states in
                                 17


India has been narrowing down and the southern states, particularly Karnataka, have been successful in
attracting fresh investments in automobile, food processing, software and biotechnology sectors in the past
3 years.

An obvious indicator of the investment climate is investment levels. Comprehensive data on investment is
not available, but foreign direct investment is tracked. As per Figure A1, during the second half of the
1990s, Karnataka became the third largest recipient of FDI among major Indian states, accounting for
nearly 19 percent of FDI approved to the top six recipients states (and 9% of total approvals in the
country) . The corresponding share of Karnataka during the first half of the 1990s was only 3% (and 1.5%
         18


of the total).

(iii) Human Development Outcomes

Karnataka's performance in human development indicators is improving, though rather average. Overall
out the 15 major states, Karnataka is ranked seventh on the UNDP human development index (HDI), which
combines poverty, and human development outcomes. As Table A4 shows, Karnataka's ranking has
remained more or less unchanged for the last twenty years. The six states above Karnataka in the HDI can
be divided into three groups: (i) the "Green Revolution" states, Punjab and Haryana, which are much richer
than Karnataka on account of their widespread irrigation; (ii) the western states, Maharashtra and Gujurat,
which have a stronger industrial base, and hence higher income, than Karnataka; and (iii) the southern
states, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which have much better human development indicators than Karnataka.
While these states are ahead of Karnataka for different reasons, it would be feasible for Karnataka to catch
up with all of them, except Kerala, over the next decade, and this would be a good overall aim for public
policy in the state.

Social indicators are improving in Karnataka, as Table A5 below shows. The nineties saw a eleven
percentage point improvement in literacy, a slow down in population growth, and above-average
improvement in infant mortality. Yet Karnataka has a long way to go to catch up to the comparator states
of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, as well as Maharashtra and, on the issue of population growth, Andhra
Pradesh.

(iv) Service delivery

State governments in India are responsible for the provision of basic social services such as school
education, drinking water, public buses, public health, and subsidized food. This section focuses on how
well these services are delivered in Karnataka. It is thus more concerned with processes and outputs (e.g.




                                                     - 47 -

enrollment, hospital beds) rather than with the fundamental outcomes considered earlier (e.g. literacy,
IMR).

The independent and well-respected Public Affairs Centre (PAC) has recently conducted a nationwide
survey to examine how well states perform on service delivery based on user feedback. The results are
summarized in Table A6 below. They show that Karnataka emerges in third place behind Gujarat and
Tamil Nadu in terms of overall user feedback on various dimensions of service delivery. The state is ranked
third for school education, public transport, and drinking water, fourth for the PDS, and eighth for health
services.

This relatively high ranking reflects both a high degree of access to basic facilities and a reasonable level of
functionality. On the former, to give two examples, national survey data from 1998-99 show that 81% of
households in Karnataka use electricity, the fourth highest rate in India (after Punjab, Haryana and
Gujarat) and significantly above the national average of 60%. Similarly, 1999 survey data shows that
                                                                19


78% of poor households have access to the subsidized food distribution system in Karnataka, the third
highest in the country after Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and about double the national average of 38%. On   20


the latter, the issue of functionality, while Karnataka's performance may exceed that of most states, there is
still a long way to go in improving efficiency and reducing corruption, issues dealt with in subsequent
sections.

Improvement in services What the PAC national survey does not show is whether public service delivery
has been improving in Karnataka. Here evidence across services is available only for the city of Bangalore
(with a population of 6.5 million or 12% of Karnataka's population). The Public Affairs Centre conducted
two surveys in 1994 and 1999 of satisfaction with government services among Bangalore residents. For the
six public utilities covered in the survey, the number in which the percentage of users expressing
satisfaction outnumbered those expressing dissatisfaction increased from none in 1994 to three in 1999, and
on average the proportion of satisfied users rose from 9% to 32%, while the number of dissatisfied users
fell from 41% to 19%. However, there was no sign of a reduction in corruption: in fact, for five out of the
                          21


seven services, more users reported paying bribes. A third survey is planned for 2003, and it will be
interesting to see what this reveals.

Individual services. Various individual services are being reformed, and show signs of improvement:

ü        Elementary education. There has been a rapid increase in the network of educational institutions
(government and private) over the last twenty years, financed both by a real growth in public education
expenditures in the nineties (the most rapid among Indian states), and by a large increase in private sector

participation in secondary and higher education. Almost the entire population now has a primary school
within a distance of 1 km of their habitation. In recent years, Government has launched a number of
initiatives to improve school utilization and quality, including campaigns to bring children to school, and
the establishment of local monitoring committees for all schools. The most tangible sign of success so far is
in improving enrollment. Approximately 1.1 million children in the age group 6-14 years were out of school
in early 2001 according to a special child census; the most recent data, from a repeat survey in early 2002,
show that this number has approximately halved due to the enrolment of the younger children in primary
schools and alternative learning centers. Karnataka's major challenge now is to ensure that all children
complete elementary education by improving quality and equity: in 1995/96 only 65% of children
completed five years of schooling, and only half of the poorest one-fifth of children compared to 94% of the
richest one-fifth. Although these indicators are likely to have improved since then, a large number of
children, especially from the poor, still do not complete the elementary cycle. See Section 4.2(vi) for further
detail on reforms in the education sector.

ü         Government hospitals. Health indicators in Karnataka show substantial improvement in recent
years. This is likely to be in part the result of a series of improvements in the government hospital system,
the results of which are summarized in Table A7 below. These show a massive expansion in utilization of
the system: the number of occupied beds and day-patients each more than doubled between 1996 and 2002,
the number of surgeries increased eleven-fold, the number of lab-tests increased more than thirty-fold and
so on.

Several steps have been taken to achieve these results, in addition to physical investments. District-level
                                                                                              22


maintenance teams have been created to service all hospitals. A computerized Health Management
Information System has been created for the entire state, hospital performance is being monitored, and the
first set of hospitals are applying for ISO-9002 accreditation. Revenue from user charges has been
increased ten-fold since 1997/98, and is being retained at the hospitals for service improvements. Skill
mismatches and staff shortages have been more than halved through hiring and redeployment. Health
camps for screening and health education for disadvantaged groups (SC/ST) have been in operation since
1996/97 and have covered some 6.7 million through 64,000 camps over that period. A larger role has been
given to the private sector in the running of hospitals. Non-clinical services have been outsourced to the
private sector in most hospitals, and private doctors and technicians are used in government hospitals on a
contract basis. The running of one major hospital and six primary health centers (PHCs) has been given to
private sector and non-government groups. Guidelines have been drafted to put another 100 PHCs in
private hands. Finally, corruption in hospitals has been cracked down by Karnataka's pro-active
Ombudsman; all hospitals now have citizens' charters, and the prices of drugs and services are prominently
displayed.

ü        Land records. About 5 million farmers a year request the government for a copy of or change in
their land records. Karnataka has now computerized its 20 million land records, under the self-funding
Bhoomi project, completed in 2002. Whereas land record issuance took 3-30 days under the manual system
it is now done immediately. A survey of farmers by the Public Affairs Centre showed the following results :   23




    l 78% of users found Bhoomi simpler.
    l 80% only had to interact with one officer under Bhoomi, whereas under the manual system 61% of
         users met 2-4 officers
    l 66% of users paid bribes often under the manual system compared to 3% under Bhoomi: which
         shows why users were prepared to pay an enhanced user-charge under Bhoomi.
    l only 8% of users complained of errors in documents compared to 64% in the manual system.


Monetary cost savings (reduced bribes v. increased fees) were estimated at Rs 81 million a year, while
labour savings are estimated at Rs 66 million a year, compared to an upfront investment by GoK of Rs 180
million, and operational profits of Rs 40 million, thus indicating a positive net present social value even if
only the first year's benefits are taken into account.

ü        Public transport. About 7 million passengers use public (government) buses in Karnataka every
day. (There are private buses in Karnataka, and the 2003/04 budget liberalized the public transport sector
considerably. Nevertheless, most people rely on public buses.) On-time departures for the Karnataka's
largest bus company on main routes have increased from 92% in 1998/99 to 99% in 2002/03;
private-sector, computerized booking centers have been established; and a range of customer-friendly
initiatives adopted, such as a compensation fund for accidents, and a refund scheme for delays; efficiency
indicators have also improved, and the public bus companies are breaking-even financially.

ü        Transport regulatory services. In Karnataka, some 260,000 people a year receive licenses a year,
and some 30,000 vehicles are registered annually. The Regional Transport Offices in Bangalore, as well as
now a few outside Bangalore, have been fully computerized over the last couple of years under an initiative
now held up by Government of India as a model for Indian states. Waiting times have been reduced; citizen
charter standards are in place and enforced; staff are trained in customer relations; customer feedback is
encouraged, and is generally very positive. An independent survey found that 41% of driving-license
applicants reported paying a bribe in the non-computerized setting, but only 3% in the computerized
setting.

(v) Summary of outcomes

On the positive side, Karnataka shows reasonable growth in agriculture and rapid growth in services and
industry, a relatively good investment climate, and an increasing ability to attract private investment. With
above-average growth, there is a marked decline in poverty. Social indicators are also improving, and
Karnataka shows relatively good and, to the extent that there is evidence to judge it, improving service
delivery.

However, for all this progress, in terms of fundamental outcomes, as measured by poverty and basic social
indicators, Karnataka still appears to be a rather average state, with slightly worse-than-average levels of
poverty, and slightly better-than-average human development indicators. Rates of improvement have also
roughly been average by Indian standards. The challenges for Karnataka are twofold: (i) to maintain if not
accelerate the 8% growth rate achieved in the last half of the nineties; and (ii) to achieve the human
development standards of its southern neighbours, first Tamil Nadu and ultimately Kerala. Karnataka's
inability to match the performance of these two states has much to do with low levels of social indicators in

the northern part of the state: the social sector focus of the government on this region will need to be
maintained and indeed intensified in the coming years.

As mentioned, it is not easy to make links between reform initiatives, such as fiscal adjustment, and
outcomes on the ground, such as poverty reduction. Yet, ultimately, measures to shift spending to more
productive areas and to improve the effectiveness of government functioning will surely contribute to faster
poverty reduction and accelerated social development. It is reassuring that Karnataka is showing reasonable
signs of progress in these fundamental areas of human welfare.

Endnote:
1Budgetary targeting started in 2000/01, but this ignored important off-budget liabilities.
2Lack of fiscal adjustment in 2001/02 also resulted, ironically, from fiscal performance being significantly better in 20010-01
than expected. At the time of 2001/02 target formulation, it was expected that 2000/01 would show significant deficit
deterioration over 1999/00. In the event, this did not happen.
3The state provident/insurance fund is a real liability on government: this part of the public accounts needs to be included in the
government's borrowing. There are other elements of the public accounts which constitute real liabilities but these are small
enough to be negligible.
4Like the fiscal deficit, this includes borrowing from GoI, from the market, from negotiated loans, from small savings, and from
state provident/insurance funds, but, unlike the fiscal deficit, does not include non-debt public account entries. It corresponds
to the "Statement of Borrowings" (Table 4(i)) in the Annual Financial Accounts.

6The first increase was for 17%. The second increase was for 16%, but the agricultural increase component of that is yet to be
implemented, reducing the second increase to 12%. The third increase, effective April 1, 2003, is for just 2%.
7For the last six years, budgeted tax growth rates have averaged 21.4% over actuals of the previous year. The average growth
rate over revised estimates is somewhat less at 16.9%. One problem is that revised estimates themselves are unrealistic
estimates of actuals, causing growth estimates for the following year to be from too high a base. (On average, actuals are 96%
of revised tax estimates.)
80.45 million are retired civil servants; the remainder are entitled to social-security benefits.

11The Availability Based Tariff is a new tariff regime introduced by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission regulating
the interchange of electricity among the regional utilities. It is expected to introduce grid discipline by introducing penalties for
unscheduled interchanges which worsen grid frequency. It was introduced in the Southern Region on January 1, 2003.
12The extent to which the former controversy was outside GoK's control could be disputed.
13The Deaton-adjusted figures differ from official estimates in a number of regards: see Angus Deaton and Jean Dreze (2002).

give combined poverty figures, only separately for rural and urban areas. Combined figures are calculated by the authors using
urban and rural population weights. Note also that 1999/00 is the most recent year for which poverty estimates are available.
Poverty has likely risen since on account of the drought.
14Only Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have higher urbanization levels that Karnataka.
15Whereas Karnataka has India's highest growth rate according to CSO data, the NSS shows Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil
Nadu all having higher average consumption growth than Karnataka. Hence, not surprisingly, Karanataka does not have the
highest rate in poverty reduction among the states, though it still emerges as an above-average performer.

17The Government has also commissioned its own baseline survey of firms on the investment climate, which the Public Affairs
Centre has carried out.
18There is no reliable data on actual FDI inflows into states. Here we assume that, actual inflow is a constant fraction of the
total FDI approval into the state.
