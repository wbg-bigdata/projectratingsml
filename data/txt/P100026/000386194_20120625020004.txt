         1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of the 2006 appraisal of the National Initiative for Human Development
Support Project („INDH‟, „the Project‟), Morocco suffered from high levels of poverty (14.2%,
with a further 23% „economically vulnerable‟), strikingly poor income inequality, and low human
development indicators – over half of adults illiterate, compared to 10% for all lower middle
income countries. Poverty was equally pronounced in both rural and urban areas, albeit with
different characteristics. Although half of public expenditures were allocated to the social sectors,
access and quality were limited, particularly for rural people.

2.       Government‟s past approach to dealing with poverty and social exclusion had been
centrally driven, with low levels of participation, weak coordination amongst line ministries, and
inadequate targeting. From the end of the 1990s, Government began to test out participatory
approaches to targeted poverty reduction, and as social and political tensions grew, the King
announced, in May 2005, the launch of the INDH, a massive and high profile program designed
to reduce poverty and close the social gaps in the national fabric. The program was designed to
introduce a new bottom-up concept of integrated socio-economic development based on
participation, local governance, partnership, sustainability and results orientation. In 2005, after
the launch of the INDH, Government requested the technical support of the Bank as key technical
partner for the program.

3.      For the Bank, INDH was one of the main vehicles supporting the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) outcome (# 2.2) of improving access of the poor and vulnerable population to
basic services. INDH also contributed to the cross-cutting CAS objective of improving
governance as transparency, accountability and inclusiveness were the principles on which INDH
was based. Other donors shared the focus on poverty reduction and service delivery. The
European Union (EU), which was to become a principal partner in INDH (see 1.5 below), had a
particular focus on reduction of rural poverty.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.       The approved project development objective and indicators were:

1.3 Revised PDO and key indicators, and reasons for revision




                                                     1
5.      Following the mid-term review (MTR) in November 2008, the Bank and Government
agreed to amend the indicators. The four original PDO indicators were altered and increased to
five to better capture the outcomes of inclusiveness, accountability and transparency, and to
measure the impact on the target population. The revised PDO indicators matched to outcomes
were:

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.      The beneficiaries were the populations of 403 rural communes and 264 urban
neighborhoods with high concentrations of poor and vulnerable people (rural and urban
components), together with poor and vulnerable populations throughout Morocco (vulnerability
and cross-cutting components). Each component had specific targeting criteria to ensure that
benefits were directed towards the intended beneficiaries (details in Annex 2).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

7.      Component 1 Rural poverty reduction (the „rural component‟, $300 million) was targeted
at the 403 poorest rural communes, with $600,0001 allowed over five years for each commune to
finance sub-projects under four categories: (1) access to basic infrastructure and services; (2)
promotion of social, cultural and sports activities; (3) building and developing local capacity; and
(4) promoting and supporting local income generating activities (activités génératrices de revenus,
AGR).

8.      Component 2 Reduction of social exclusion in urban areas (the „urban component‟, $300
million) was targeted at 264 urban quartiers in 30 cities, with $900,000 2 allowed for each
quartier. Sub-project categories were the same as for Component 1.

9.      Component 3 Tackling vulnerability (the „vulnerability component‟, $300 million)
covered all Morocco and financed the preparation of vulnerability mapping and related action
plans, and sub-projects which were typically: construction or rehabilitation of centers for




1
 This allocation averaged about 10% or more of the communes‟ budgets, and in the case of the poorest and
smallest communes actually doubled their budget.

2
 As the quartier is not a budgetary unit, it is not possible to express the allocation as a percentage of the
budget otherwise available. However, in the smallest and poorest communes urbaines, the INDH annual
allocation represented almost half of the total commune budget.



                                                       2
provision of social services for the vulnerable and capacity building for the governmental and
non-governmental agencies involved.

10.     Component 4 Strengthening governance and institutional capacity (the „cross-cutting
component‟, $300 million) again covered all Morocco. The principal activities were: (1) finance
of sub-projects ($275 million) selected through a competitive fund with an open call for projects
under the same four categories as for the rural and urban components; and (2) implementation
support: (i) capacity building in participatory project design and management; in facilitation,
social mobilization and animation; in administration and financial management; and in income
generating activities; (ii) information systems and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) , including
impact evaluation; (iii) partnerships; and (iv) communications.

11.      Total estimated cost was MAD (Moroccan Dirham) 10 billion ($1.2 billion) over five
years, 2006-2010, financed by: central government 60%; local government 20%; and
international donors 20%. World Bank financing was EUR 78.9 million ($100 million
equivalent) over four years, 2007-2010, counted under central government‟s share. Total support
from fourteen grant donors was $197 million, including an EU grant of 60 million Euros ($47.2
million), focused on the rural component. Other grant financing included: Saudi Arabia ($50
million); France ($6.3 million); Italy ($6.3 million); MCC ($9.3 million); Germany ($3.9
million); Belgium ($3.1 million); Japan ($4 million); China ($4.7 million); Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development ($25.3 million); Islamic Development Bank ($1.0 million);
Equatorial Guinea ($1 million); and OPEC Fund ($0.3 million). The EU also supervised the
German and Belgian contributions.

        2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

12.     Soundness of the background analysis. INDH design took into account lessons learned
from prior in-depth analytical work, notably the Bank‟s Poverty Report of 2004 which
demonstrated the need and mechanisms for targeting social expenditures to poorer communities.
Lessons were also available on participatory processes and community-driven development from
global experience and from previous projects financed by the Bank in Morocco, including several
rural development and watershed management projects based on community-driven development
models, and a social fund (ADS). The Bank‟s decision to take part in the INDH was consistent
with country and Bank objectives, and the Bank was uniquely qualified to add value to a
community-driven program, due to its substantial global experience, its ability to mobilize a
multi-sectoral team, and its experience in partnering Morocco in the participatory programs.
Given the national priority accorded to the INDH, government made an urgent request for the
Bank‟s assistance, although the project was already on the move at the time of appraisal.

Assessment of the project design

13.     A very Moroccan initiative in participatory development. INDH guiding principles and
program design were outlined in government‟s 2005 concept document („Plateforme‟): bottom up
participatory planning, increased delegation of responsibility to elected local government, and
involvement of civil society through Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) etc. INDH was
presented as a uniquely Moroccan commitment to improve living standards in targeted
communities, to give greater voice to the poor, and to develop new relationships between
government, civil society, the population at large and elected officials. It represented a genuine
and landmark national-scale initiative to foster greater participation and decentralization of


                                                3
resources and decision making to local levels, building on the lessons of the previous community-
based projects.

14.     The program-based approach (SWAp) was clearly the right model, as it enabled the Bank
to advise and guide the entire INDH process. It also allowed for a concerted approach amongst
the fourteen donors involved. Bank finance was appropriately made available as a Specific
Investment Loan (SIL) through a SWAp under which the Bank financed 10% of all expenditures
and released annual tranches based on the satisfaction of disbursement indicators selected from
amongst the PDO and intermediate outcome indicators (see Data Sheet).

15.     Bank influence on design. By the time of Bank appraisal, government had already set the
main framework of the INDH, the components were largely designed, and the program had been
underway for a year. The Bank was nonetheless able to identify areas where improvements were
needed, and these were built in to Bank support:

       (1) Design and support to the participatory process, where particular Bank contributions
       included supporting the preparation or revision of the operational manuals that guided the
       entire program.

       (2) strengthened institutional design and rules to ensure inclusiveness and good
       governance, including having the governance committees chaired by elected persons and
       not government officials, creating local „social mobilization teams‟, setting a 20% quota
       for women and youth in the governance committees, having all decisions made public, and
       strengthening the coordination unit (CN, see below) to develop from a small „cell‟ to a
       full-fledged program coordinating office.

       (3) stronger provision for capacity building, M&E, learning, and development
       communications: , including ensuring a dedicated budget for each of these functions,
       elaboration of capacity building and development communication strategies, creation of a
       panel of experts, improvement of the Management Information System (MIS), and
       introduction of participatory M&E.

       (4) strong focus on procedures to ensure fiduciary soundness and safeguards, including
       elaboration of financial and procurement manuals, an environmental management plan and
       a resettlement plan, inclusion of environmental screening in sub-project selection, and
       designation of a safeguards focal person at the CN level.

16.      Components were generally well-defined and structured. The beneficiary population was
(mostly – see below) clearly identified, and the implementation mechanisms were adequately
engineered. Procedures for targeting and inclusiveness were on the whole sound, but with the
following aspects that proved during implementation to need refinement (details in Annex 2): (i)
targeting mechanisms of the urban neighborhoods could have been refined to ensure more
objectivity in selection; (ii) the procedures to be adopted for the participatory planning process
(Initiative Locale de Développement Humain, ILDH) left much to local initiative, which had
potential advantages but often left local teams without adequate guidance; (iii) management of
the vulnerability component at regional rather than provincial level resulted in weaker local
anchoring and participation; and (iv) criteria for ensuring that only the poor benefitted from the
competitive fund under the cross-cutting component were imprecise.

17.   Little attention appears to have been given at design to exploiting the potential of
community-driven programs for reducing infrastructure costs or to sustainability issues (see 2.5


                                                4
below). The income generating activities facility available under the rural, urban and cross-
cutting components suffered from the add-on of a micro-credit component (details in Annex 2).

18.     The organizational arrangements were well thought through, although the institutional
complexity was considerable, with over 700 hundred joint public/private governance bodies,
almost 700 social mobilization teams (Equipes d’Animation Communal/du Quartier, EAC/Q), 70
provincial level support teams (Division d’Action Social, DAS), over a thousand local, provincial
and regional level participatory plans, and several thousand largely non-governmental sub-project
sponsors. All this multiplicity of organizations were to be coordinated by a small central unit in
the Ministry of the Interior (Coordination Nationale, CN). Given the untested nature of the
arrangements and the lack of a pilot phase, INDH could have benefitted from a slower build up,
with learning and capacity building. However, the emerging lessons of the first year were well
factored in to Bank support (see above), and going full scale nationally created momentum and
demonstrated Government‟s seriousness.

19.      Government commitment and stakeholder involvement were strong. Following the
King‟s announcement of the program, there was a vast mobilization, with top level committees,
full involvement of the Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, establishment of the National
Coordination Unit (Coordination Nationale, CN) and 70 provincial units, full engagement of
regional heads (walis), provincial governors, local councils, line ministries and public service
staff at all levels. The social development fund (Agence de Développement Social, ADS) and the
national social support agency (Entraide Nationale, EN) were fully committed. NGOs, CBOs
showed their commitment from the start by participating in the local level Comités Local de
Développement Humain (CLDH) committees and in the preparation of the local ILDH
development plans, which led to over 1,100 sub-project approvals within the first year.

20.     The design of the participatory process was for the most part well thought through. Sub-
projects were to be identified largely by a bottom-up, participatory process in which local
communities were to be empowered to have a say in proposing INDH investments. Specific
provision was made for the inclusion of women and young people, and for NGOs and civil
society, in both implementation and decision making. Beneficiary contribution in cash was
mandatory in order to improve project quality and ensure ownership. Transparency and
accountability were to be supported by regular bottom-up, participatory M&E, by frequent
reporting, and by independent results evaluation (by the Observatoire Nationale de
Développement Humain, ONDH). Sharing of experiences, learning and the incorporation of
lessons into the program were to be systematic, through „innovation teams‟. Mechanisms for
complaining and for seeking resolution of disputes were to be set up. The main weakness in the
participatory process was that mentioned above - the under-design of participatory planning
mechanisms, particularly for the vulnerability component.

Assessment of risks

21.      The risk assessment at appraisal captured most of the foreseeable risks, and the mitigation
measures were on the whole correctly identified. The table below summarizes the risks, assesses
their reality, notes the mitigation measures (and also assesses whether in fact the mitigation
measures proved effective). However, other risks emerged which were not foreseen at appraisal,
particularly the difficulty of measuring impacts, and institutional capacity for the participatory
process.

QAE rating: Moderately satisfactory (see 5.1.a below)

2.2 Implementation

22.     The project was fully implemented in terms of geographical coverage and target areas,
and commitment and disbursement targets were met. A large number of sub-projects (over
22,000) were implemented, and over 5 million beneficiaries were tallied. The following factors
contributed to successful implementation or gave rise to problems:

23.     Governance set up: The roll-out of the more than seven hundred governance committees
was an extraordinary accomplishment. These committees – the 667 Comités Local de
Développement Humain (CLDH) at the rural commune or urban quartier level, the 70 Comités
Provincial de Développement Humain (CPDH) at provincial level, and the 12 Comités Régional
de Développement Humain (CRDH) at regional level - worked well on the whole. In some cases,
the provincial level CPDH, which took most of the resource allocation decisions, was too
directive, and sometimes the governor overtly used INDH financing as an integral part of an
overall development plan rather than as a bottom-up program. The commune/quartier level
CLDHs were of variable quality, and because of their number it is difficult to generalize. Some
were dominated by politics, but the commonest weakness was low capacity for programming and
contracting. The Bank continued its inputs to setting up and strengthening institutions throughout
the implementation period through regular field visits and dialogue, guiding INDH particularly on
the need for inclusion and transparency. A specific improvement prompted by the Bank was the
requirement that all governance committees should establish formal internal operating procedures.

24.     Support functions: The establishment of more than seven hundred support units was
again a remarkable feat. After a hesitant start, these agencies grew in strength but with some
weaknesses that affected the quality of outcomes. The national coordination unit (CN) was
highly motivated and well-managed, and developed capacity over the period, overseeing
implementation effectively. Its periodic reporting was of good quality. However, the CN was not
always responsive to lessons or guidance aiming to strengthen the management of the Initiative



                                                     6
and to orient it more toward results and impacts. It tended not to use the results of M&E or
ONDH to learn, and after an initial stage it disbanded the innovation teams which could have
helped it capitalize on lessons. The CN was initially relatively weak on capacity building,
communications and M&E, and these functions improved only slowly over the implementation
period. The 70 provincial-level support teams (Division d’Action Sociale, DAS) were on the
whole energetic and responsive, and grew greatly in strength over the period, although inevitably
they were of variable quality. The 667 social mobilization teams were often highly motivated and
competent, but overly dominated by professional civil servants, with too technical an approach.
They lacked strong expertise in participatory programming approaches, and were generally
under-resourced. The institutional framework of INDH, through the DAS and the social
mobilization teams, established the support mechanisms for participatory programming and
community-driven development. The Bank sustained a high level of supervision of all these
structures, with particular emphasis on strengthening key CN functions such as capacity building,
communications and M&E, on developing the capacity of the DAS, and on defining the role of
the social mobilization teams in written terms of reference. Results of Bank support were largely
positive. The slow rate of improvement in communications and M&E can be largely attributed to
the issue of conflicting incentives between a bottom-up design and a top down legacy culture
correctly identified as a risk at appraisal.

25.     Partnerships: INDH formed partnerships with ADS and EN, and increasingly effective
partnerships with NGOs, which grew in strength during the period, thanks to capacity building
and experience. However, local area associations that would have genuinely represented the poor
and the marginalized were largely weak or absent at the outset. Program implementation
witnessed an increase in their numbers and some development of existing associations, but still
well short of genuine local representative institutional capacity in most communities. It was
because of this absence or weakness of grassroots institutions that project design allowed for
sponsors, typically NGOs, to act as proxies for the beneficiary communities, which proved a
workable and largely successful approach. Bank guidance resulted in more structured relations
between INDH and NGOs through the formulation of partnership conventions, which also began
to address sustainability issues by requiring O&M provisions.

26.     Participatory approach and strategic programming: Almost 700 participatory diagnostics
and local investment programs (ILDH) were prepared and implemented for the rural and urban
components, involving over 3 million beneficiaries. This is a remarkable achievement by any
standards. However, there was no one clear model of how to do it. Some of the participatory
processes were best practice; others were rather vague consultative processes. The resulting
ILDHs were sometimes just project proposals and project lists, not real community-based needs
assessments and prioritized investment plans. In terms of the INDH as a genuinely community-
driven development (CDD) program, resources were delegated only to provincial (CPDH) level,
which is far from local stakeholder control over resource allocation. In addition, much sub-
project implementation was by government departments or by the provinces. These realities
meant that in this first phase the poor and vulnerable end users were sometimes only marginally
involved in a process driven mostly by officials. The Bank contributed through the supervision
process to helping INDH address the challenges involved in introducing participatory approaches
in an environment with entrenched top-down public sector management practices. Specific
improvements resulting from Bank guidance included the multi-annual strategic planning process,
and province-wide capacity building programs to strengthen the front-line social mobilization
teams.

27.      Communications/transparency/grievance procedures: The communications program was
late in starting, but did produce some effective messages. The big gap was the lack of two-way


                                               7
communications channels. The proposed „grievance mechanisms‟ were written into the
operations manuals but were only set up sporadically and largely informally, with variable quality
and performance. Bank guidance gave substance to the development communications program
through the elaboration of provincial communications plans, and helped to enhance transparency
by mandating publication of governance committees‟ decisions.

28.     Revenue-generating activities: Support to small business start up (Activités Génératrices
de Revenus, AGR) was provided under three components (rural, urban, and cross-cutting). The
program initially suffered from design and implementation difficulties: the procedures manual
was ill-adapted and initial sub-project sponsors were inexperienced. Arrangements to associate
micro-finance institutions (MFI) required the MFI not only to cofinance the sub-project but also
to provide technical assistance and M&E. The details of these arrangements proved hard for
INDH to work out with MFIs, and the requirement that MFIs be involved in each sub-project was
preventing the component from going forward. In early 2009, the manual was revised to reflect
Bank guidance, introducing the use of business plans, increasing technical assistance, and leaving
the choice to the sub-project sponsor whether or not to employ micro-finance. Thereafter, the
program gathered speed and strength.

29.     Decentralization and „convergence‟. As INDH was intended to be demand-driven and
programmed outside the classic programming and budgeting mechanism, there was a big risk of
overlap or incoherence with the programs of line ministries. INDH institutions made
considerable effort at systematic involvement of line ministries at least at CPDH level, and there
was also considerable line ministry technical support to INDH, for example in sub-project
preparation and implementation. However, Government intention to rapidly „deconcentrate‟ line
ministry budgets to be decided at provincial level, or to decentralize some budget decision-
making to the control of local government, was not fulfilled during the Project period. The issue
ran into opposition from line ministries, and was referred in 2007 to a special „convergence
committee‟ which has not yet reported. As a result, lack of „convergence‟ between bottom-up
and top-down planning, as well as simple lack of knowledge at the local level on ministry plans
resulted in some duplication of projects, lost opportunities for integrated local development
planning, and disconnect between investment and subsequent O&M. Nonetheless, the Bank
constantly sought to move the process forward, helping (through WBI) to mobilize three high-
level round table discussions on lessons learned on participatory approaches to poverty reduction,
on change management, and on „convergence‟, in preparation for Phase II of the INDH.

Findings of the Mid-Term Review and subsequent restructuring

30.      A Mid-Term Review was conducted in November 2008. The main problems noted were:
(i) weaknesses in the participatory process; (ii) the poor performance of the income generating
activities; (iii) the need to apply the procedures manuals more generally; and (iv) weaknesses in
M&E (see 2.3 below). Following the MTR, government and Bank agreed to simplify results
tracking and align the Bank‟s results framework with government and partner monitoring
frameworks, with a smaller number of indicators more closely linked to the PDO and to project
outcomes, and with more realistic and relevant targets. The disbursement indicators (para 14),
which had proved ill-adapted and had held up the release of the third tranche, were reduced from
ten to eight and reformulated in line with the new results framework. Because of the need to hold
stakeholders‟ workshops to refine the new results framework, and because consensus had to be
reached not only with national stakeholders but with the numerous cofinanciers, the request from
government for restructuring was not presented until December 2009, thirteen months after the
Mid-Term Review. The restructuring was promptly processed by the Bank. Following the MTR,
the Bank and EU increased supervision emphasis on the weaker performance areas, which proved


                                                8
generally effective. Strengthened focus on M&E did have some impact, but overall the result fell
short of expectations (see 2.3 below).

QALP rating: Implementation moderately satisfactory; Bank supervision satisfactory (see 5.1.b)




                                               9
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.      M&E design. M&E design was thorough, with emphasis on the importance of M&E not
only as a mechanism for tracking and improving INDH performance and for measuring
achievements against targets, but also as a key element in two-way communication with
beneficiaries. A baseline was established through a diagnostic and vulnerability mapping, to be
updated every two years as a gauge of progress. Quantitative and participatory surveys of
providers and users were to measure how far the needs of the target population were being met, as
well as degrees of satisfaction with services. CLDH would collect quantitative and financial data
on implementation and on key outcome indicators; the DAS would collate the information at
provincial level and input it to a web-based information system; and the CN would consolidate
the data in the MIS. Periodic surveys were to be conducted. ONDH was to be responsible for
independent evaluation. A rigorous impact evaluation was designed covering 3,570 households in
121 rural communes (61 treatment/61 control) and 114 urban quartiers (57 treatment/57 control).
As it was not possible to randomize, a regression discontinuity approach was used to identify
control groups. For the Bank, indicators were selected to measure both use and process. There
was, however, no indicator for benefits e.g. number of beneficiaries, increase in incomes etc.; nor
for efficiency e.g. cost of infrastructure, quality of infrastructure.

32.      M&E implementation. INDH set up an M&E system, with officers responsible both in
the CN and in all 70 DAS. Over time, a flow of information on implementation resulted,
allowing the CN to prepare good progress reports. However, from the outset, it emerged that the
M&E design was overambitious, and this proved a handicap throughout the Project period. The
big lacunae were: (i) no monitoring of the efficiency of infrastructure implementation; (ii)
information on outcomes was not collected; (iii) no mechanism for beneficiaries to report
systematically on implementation, usage and satisfaction; (iv) the specific, elaborate M&E
provisions for the vulnerability component were not activated; (v) the web-based system was only
partly operationalized; and (vi) the reports of the ONDH are largely neglected. INDH also
commissioned qualitative surveys and impact evaluations in 2009 and 2011. Only summary
results from the 2009 and 2011 qualitative survey are so far available. The impact evaluation
mentioned above has been conducted, with the baseline survey completed in 2009, and the
follow-up round in 2011. Results are not yet available.

33.      M&E utilization. The CN produced reports on the satisfaction of the disbursement
indicators (para 14) as part of the tranche release process. All four tranches were released. Three
were released on satisfaction of the indicators, but with some delays due to shortcomings
(subsequently corrected) in the initial versions of the reports. One tranche (the third) was
released after a waiver, because two disbursement indicators under the original results framework
were not satisfied (see para 30 above). More generally, the progress reports produced by the CN
since 2008 are a useful source of information on INDH implementation and outputs. They give
government and donors a clear picture of progress. However, they contain little information on
outcomes, and little critical evaluation. By and large, M&E data was used only partially to inform
decision taking and resource allocation. In general information flowed up, but not back down,
and much reporting was essentially oriented towards donor requirements as well as to
government‟s needs to oversee implementation and disbursement progress, rather than to the
interests of beneficiaries or managers, who would be able to use the data to check progress
against benchmarks and comparators for their projects and ILDH local development plans. There
was no post-completion tracking of projects. CN was not fully responsive to ONDH reports or to
many mission recommendations.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.     Environment. INDH was classed as a Category B project. The Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) defined the screening process, and simple tools were incorporated into
the operational manuals, together with a list of generic mitigating measures. However, the
environmental and social safeguards were new for the governance bodies and supporting agencies
and for the sub-project sponsors, and INDH did not carry out the proposed campaign of training
and environmental awareness raising. Major efforts were made by the Bank during supervision
to raise awareness and to train staff and sponsors in the implementation of the EMP.
Environmental screening did begin in 2008 and all INDH‟s projects were screened, even those
before 2008 became systematic and effective from 2009, with retrospective review of sub-
projects approved before that date. Levels of awareness of decision-making bodies, support
agencies (including the DAS) and beneficiaries initially remained low, but improved towards the
close of the project. On balance, the judgement of the Bank‟s safeguards team is that the sub-
projects financed as well as the project overall were compliant with the Bank‟s environmental
safeguards, but that environmental awareness and safeguards compliance need to be
systematically factored in to the next phase from the outset.

35.      Resettlement. An agreed RPF was included in the Operational Manuals. Most sub-
projects were expected to have no major negative impacts in terms of physical or economic
displacement, due to their generally small size. Land acquisition and resettlement screening was,
however, slow to be implemented and was only mainstreamed in sub-project selection in 2008
after the CN launched training and information campaigns on the subject. At project completion,
local awareness of OP 4.12 issues had been raised and screening was systematic. Overall, the
judgement of the Bank‟s safeguards team is that the project was compliant with the Bank‟s
resettlement requirements, but with recommendations for improvement in Phase II (see Annex 2).

36.     Procurement. Procurement arrangements had to take account of the fact that the vast
majority of expenditures would be on numerous sub-projects executed at the decentralized level.
The procurement capacity assessment carried out at appraisal found generally adequate capacity
in public agencies. A Manual of Fiduciary Procedures set out procurement rules and capacity
requirements for project sponsors. Overall, risk for procurement was assessed at appraisal as
„average‟. In implementation there was no misprocurement declared and no fraud or corruption
issues were reported. However, post-reviews indicated that national procedures were generally
used in preference to the specific procedures set out in the Manual, the quality and monitoring
controls envisaged at preparation were not fully implemented, and the performance of the central
procurement supervision unit was sometimes weak. The overall judgement of the Bank‟s
fiduciary team is that these weaknesses and deviations from procedures did not greatly affect the
efficiency of implementation and that the main principles in procurement (transparency,
efficiency, probity) were observed and that for these reasons, procurement performance can be
judged generally satisfactory.

37.      Financial management. A simple INDH-specific financial management manual was
developed, accompanied by capacity building and a monitoring and reporting system, and
development of ex-post controls and external audit requirements. A fiduciary innovation team
was to track progress, conduct assessments and respond to emerging problems. An annual
performance audit was to assess efficiency. Appraisal assessed overall risk as „significant to
high‟, given the risks inherent in working through numerous untried sponsor agencies.

38.      Financial management implementation was largely satisfactory.    Audits were
satisfactorily carried out by IGAT/IGF. Although delayed and not performed annually as


                                               11
originally intended, performance audits were nonetheless conducted, and internal audit
procedures were satisfactorily introduced. Weak points were inadequate capacity building, the
late activation of the fiduciary innovation team, and lax follow up on audit recommendations. No
corruption issues were reported, an outcome to which the transparency and civil society
participation involved in the project certainly contributed. Overall, the judgement of the Bank‟s
fiduciary team is that audit reports were candid and revealed no major issues and that, despite
delays, financial management, reporting and auditing were overall satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Transition arrangements to post-completion operation of INDH sub-projects

39.     The sheer number of sub-projects (22,000 to date), their geographical dispersion, and the
wide range of project sponsors pose a considerable challenge for post-completion operation.
During implementation, each project had an identified institutional sponsor with first round
responsibility for continuity, and INDH sub-project appraisals require a statement of how the
project will be operated sustainably. In addition, there is an implicit pressure from the local
population who have requested the project and who have an interest in sustaining the welfare
gains involved in continued operation.

40.      In practice, arrangements for operating sub-projects are many and various. Many
projects are the subject of a multi-annual operating agreement with project sponsors. In some
cases, line ministries have taken over responsibility for running sub-projects – or are financing
their running. Local authorities have taken responsibility for certain public infrastructure such as
roads, whilst local communities themselves have taken responsibility for some sub-projects. In
the case of revenue-generating activities, sponsors have an evident interest and responsibility for
running their sub-projects sustainably. Constraints to adequate O&M are, however, sizable: (i)
local authorities have limited means for maintenance; (ii) NGOs similarly have limited resources
of their own; (iii) community-selected investments will not always coincide with ministry plans
or budgets; and (iv) ownership of INDH-finance assets is not clear.

Sustaining INDH innovations and implementation capacity

41.     Government is strongly committed to sustaining INDH, and in June 2011, the King
announced Phase II with an increase of the budget. The Bank has again been invited to partner
Morocco on the program. This will provide a first rate opportunity to build in key areas for
sustaining and strengthening the INDH where the Bank could add value (see Section 6 below).

        3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.     INDH was conceived in the light of new and pressing development priorities for
Morocco (see 1.1 above). There has been no shift in those priorities, and INDH has, if anything,
become even more relevant today with the intensifying socio-political pressures, hence the King‟s
announcement of an expanded Phase II with more ambitious objectives and an enlarged budget.
Similarly, INDH remains key to the Bank‟s current country and global goals, which emphasize
demand-driven, participatory approaches, poverty reduction, and inclusion, with particular
emphasis on women, youth and the vulnerable. Proposed future support to Phase II is one of the
main lending vehicles to support the second pillar of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
2010-2013: „increasing access to and quality of service delivery by all‟, as well as contributing to


                                                12
the CPS cross-cutting objective to improve governance. Overall, the design, as developed by the
Government and with additional inputs from the Bank, was complex but with potential high
rewards. Testament to overall soundness was the success of the design in mobilizing a very large
number of institutions and stakeholders to contribute constructively to full-scale implementation.
Design proved flexible enough to be adapted during implementation to mitigate some potential
shortcomings. Bank inputs during implementation (see 2.2 above) helped guide adjustments to
the program to increase inclusiveness, accountability and transparency.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

43.     The PDO was achieved as measured by the five project outcome indicators, which
capture the four aspects of the PDO and all of which were met (Table 4 below, and Data Sheet).
Minor to moderate shortcomings were recorded based on a more qualitative analysis of results.
Sixteen of the seventeen intermediate outcome indicators were also met. In terms of outputs (see
below), INDH set up processes and institutions as planned that reached almost 5.4 million direct
beneficiaries through 22,000 sub-projects. These outputs allowed INDH to reach its poor and
vulnerable target population and to meet its ambitious geographic and sector targets (see below
and Annex 2 for more details).

Source: INDH Qualitative Survey 2011; INDH M&E system

There were moderate shortcomings affecting INDH’s attainment of the inclusiveness outcome

44.     The participation of civil society and elected representatives and of women and youth in
governance structures surpassed quantitative targets (Indicators # 4, 5, 15, see Data Sheet).
Involvement of non-governmental organizations in planning and implementation of sub-projects
to take care of vulnerable populations also exceeded the target (Indicator # 14). The extent of
involvement of the target population in the participatory process is also reported as satisfactory,
with more men participating (54-58%, depending on component) than the target of 40%.
Women‟s participation (42-54%) was more than twice the targeted 20%, and youth participation
(37-48%) was more than four times the target (Indicators # 6, 10)

45.      Qualitative reviews suggest that the participatory programming process has been carried
out efficiently but there are some questions over its quality. Reviews by the Bank of samples of
the ILDHs (participatory local development plans) suggest that the work was conducted in a wide
variety of ways and is of mixed quality, ranging from best practice to weak. Most of the projects
identified are high impact, poverty-reducing projects, but in only some cases are the ILDHs
genuinely multi-annual phased investment programmes built on a truly participatory process,
validated with and owned by poor people and poor communities within the commune. Many are
project lists updated from time to time, pieced together through a range of consultative processes
of varying quality.


                                                  13
The outcome of accountability and ownership is being largely attained, with moderate
shortcomings

46.     Communities, NGOs and communes have taken responsibility for most project
implementation, implementing 72-90% of sub-projects, well above target (Indicators # 3, 15).
One remarkable result has been the growth of competent NGOs, with almost 7,000 sub-projects
being sponsored by associations and cooperatives. However, the number of sub-projects actually
implemented by local community-based organizations – a key feature of community-driven
development - is probably low. Although no firm data are available, spot checks show that most
projects are implemented by public agencies on behalf of sponsoring communes, though there is
some variation across provinces in this regard. What is encouraging is that the overall trend as
reported across provinces has been towards greater local implementation either by communes or
NGOs.

47.     Mechanisms for accountability and ownership have been established and are operating,
with all governance bodies established and operating, and almost all (91%) having established
proper rules and procedures (Indicator # 19). The target was 100%, and this is the only INDH
indicator that was not recorded as met. Qualitative evaluation shows some weaknesses not
picked up by the indicators, particularly that the proposed „grievance mechanisms‟ have not been
formally set up all across the program.

48.      Considerable implementation capacity has been created, through a major effort at training
(Indicator # 20). The training of local actors and associations and the creation of a professional
cadre of 6,300 university-trained social workers are notable results. Seventy provincial training
plans were drawn up and 104,437 persons were trained, compared to the target of 70,000. This
greatly contributed to the rise in status and competence of NGOs, the professionalization of social
work, and the raising of the competence of the INDH governance and support bodies (see Annex
2).

Despite the positive indicator, there were moderate shortcomings in achieving the transparency
outcome

49.     INDH met the PDO indicator on publication of decisions of governance bodies (Indicator
# 2). However, M&E and the communications program (see 2.3 above) are not yet fulfilling their
intended function as the key instruments of accountability, transparency and ownership.

There were very positive results on enhanced use of social and economic infrastructure and
services by poor and vulnerable groups, but also some shortcomings

50.      Responses on the four indicators of improved access to infrastructure and services
(Indicators #1, 8, 12, 21) show actuals well above target, particularly for women and youth.
Visits to sub-projects suggest that most are operational and well-used. Information on the results
of the income generating activities is inadequate to permit a judgement on its contribution to
sustainable increase in incomes of the poor and vulnerable (see 2.2 above), but a study on a small
sample of sub-projects suggests problems with targeting and a relatively high failure rate (see 3.3
below).

51.     Access of the vulnerable to quality care services has certainly increased, with over half a
million beneficiaries and a real momentum of professionalization of social services, dynamic



                                                14
partnerships between associations and the state, and the inclusion of the vulnerable and the
marginalized.

Summary assessment of outcomes and attribution to Bank contributions

52.      Overall, these statements, taken together, support an assessment that the program has
achieved the institutional development and process targets set. However, the qualitative
assessment made above has also highlighted a range of shortcomings. Evidently, continued
efforts into the longer term will be needed to put in place a permanent, inclusive process of
participatory strategic planning that improves the lives of poor and marginal people. Phase I has
been a good start and a very important learning experience.

53.     Bank financing accounted for only 6% of total financing, but the Bank‟s most significant
contribution was guidance to government, the original rationale for government‟s invitation to the
Bank to become lead technical partner. Bank contribution to design and implementation,
summarized above (2.1 and 2.2), made significant contributions to INDH outcomes:
strengthening inclusiveness through support to the participatory process and to capacity building
for front-line staff; improving accountability and ownership through ensuring balanced
representation and formal operating procedures in the governance committees, helping develop
multi-annual strategic planning, and putting in place fiduciary, environmental and social
safeguards; and enhancing transparency through emphasis on the publication of decisions and the
focus on development communications and M&E. The Bank has also assisted the Government in
drawing out the valuable lessons (see Section 6 below), which need to be applied in the second
phase. It should also be noted that a more detailed impact evaluation is being carried out by the
government with Bank support, but this was not available by the deadline for this ICR.

3.3 Efficiency

54.     For the purposes of this ICR, the Bank commissioned an economic study (Annex 3) of a
sample of 50 INDH sub-projects under all four components. Infrastructure sub-projects evaluated
had an average IRR of 12%, with electrification sub-project returns ranging from negligible to
10%, roads sub-projects from 17% to 50%, potable water sub-projects from negative to 47%, and
urban upgrading subprojects from negative to 43%. Returns tended to be higher for simple sub-
projects that were not very capital-intensive. Rates of return were not calculated for social
services sub-projects. The study found that in general health and education sub-projects brought
indirect social returns in terms of social capital formation and socio-economic dynamic in
population centers. However, the evaluation found uneven levels of use, and inadequate cost-
effectiveness assessment of alternatives – for example, there was a bias towards construction of
school boarding houses rather than cost-effective alternatives such as improving school transport
services.

55.      No rates of return were calculated for sub-projects in favor of vulnerable segments but
the study noted that cost effectiveness was higher for cutting edge centers financed, which
worked more in the community on a participatory basis than for „classic‟ in-patient approaches,
which were also financed. The study also noted lack of assured operating funds for these sub-
projects. Half of the sample of income-generating sub-projects had good rates of return (12-14%),
whilst half had rates below 8% - and three sub-projects had already failed. The study identified
linkages to downstream markets, quality of support provided, adequacy of fixed and working
capital, and the education and skills of the entrepreneurs as the key success factors. The
successful sub-projects also had a multiplier economic effect and contributed to leveraging more
investment. The study faulted targeting, as beneficiaries were not always in the target groups.


                                               15
56.      Limited observations during Bank supervision and the Completion Mission suggest that
project implementation and the quality of infrastructure have been of mixed quality, mostly good.
On the basis of a very small sample, 75% of infrastructure projects were found to be of good
quality, and 25% of moderate quality. Costs were about 20% lower than usual costs for public
contracts. The explanation for this appears to be largely adoption of lower cost models adapted to
local needs or, in some cases, lower design and construction standards, rather than efficiency
gains. There was no information or follow up on standard costs. Sustainability was a concern,
with limited provision for maintenance, with particular concern for drinking water, urban
cleansing, and social care centers.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

57.      As discussed above (3.1), the INDH program is relevant to current country and Bank
priorities. The program has met its PDOs (3.2), which are largely concerned with setting up
processes and institutions. Further work is needed to make those processes truly inclusive,
accountable and transparent. The program has achieved considerable outputs (22,000 sub-
projects, with over $1.7 billion invested in poor areas), and achieved its outcomes with minor to
moderate shortcomings based on a more qualitative analysis. Evidence on efficiency (3.3) shows
a mixed picture with at least moderate shortcomings: rates of return for infrastructure sub-projects
are positive and often high, and access to and use of infrastructure and services are generally in
line with expectations, but there are shortcomings, particularly on the income generating sub-
projects. One most precious outcome of the program to date is the wealth of lessons on how to
improve processes and institutions. If these lessons can be put to work for the subsequent phases
of the program, this will provide a good return to the investment in the first phase. Overall,
INDH‟s continued high relevance, the verifiable fair progress on process, the generally good
implementation performance, and the evidence on positive outcomes justify a rating of
moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.     The impact evaluation study (results expected in 2012) is expected to show changes in
both income and expenditure of the poor and in their nutritional, health and education status.
Until that information is available, no assessment of poverty reduction impacts can be made.
INDH has a well-defined strategy for integrating gender and youth aspects into governance
structures, and the program has achieved its performance targets on this score (3.2). Women and
youth are also prominent beneficiaries in sub-projects. Women accounted for 53% of
beneficiaries in the income generating activity. Social capital is clearly forming: INDH
governance and implementation processes involve very large numbers of people: more than
11,000 members of the CLDH/CPDH/CRDHs, 104,437 people trained, and over 7,000
associations participating.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.     Institutional base and enabling environment for Phase II. The setting up and
strengthening of the governance bodies and support services has been a remarkable achievement
(see 2.2 above). Although competence and performance vary, these organizations represent a


                                                16
solid institutional base to support bottom-up processes in subsequent phases. The emergence of
many competent NGOs and their strengthening are also notable achievements. More generally,
INDH has had an undisputed impact in creating an enabling environment for inclusive citizen
participation through civil society, including NGOs and community organizations.

60.     Donor coordination. The fit of INDH with development priorities (3.1 above) and the
well-structured implementation arrangements encouraged fourteen grant donors to provide $197
million, equivalent to about 16 % of program costs, in addition to the Bank‟s contribution.
Donors agreed on joint supervision, essentially confiding leadership to the World Bank, alongside
the EU which also played a leading role in supervision.

61.     Decentralization and „convergence‟. Although decentralization and „convergence‟
(horizontal and vertical inter-ministerial coordination) were not amongst the project objectives,
they were expected to be important factors in the efficiency of implementation and sustainability
of outcomes (see 2.2 above). INDH was unfortunately not effective in catalyzing this agenda.

3.6 Summary of Findings of the Stakeholder Workshops

62.      Over a three day period (May 30-31 and June 1, 2011) three workshops were held to
listen to the appreciations of beneficiaries and other INDH partners. Over 150 participants spoke
openly and vocally both in plenary sessions and in thematic group sessions. Overall, there was
consensus that the benefits of INDH have been considerable, with a noticeable improvement in
the lives of the target population and a strengthening of community social capital and of
institutions at all levels, particularly in the NGO sector. However, there was unanimity that there
is a need to better capitalize all the hard-won lessons of Phase I as a basis for Phase II. Many
things in Phase I went well, many improved over time, some went less well. Phase II should be
built on the findings of the evaluation of Phase I. Based on the results, improvements should be
built into Phase II, and the capacity building, communications and M&E programs of Phase II
should be built around the findings. The following particular concerns were expressed
throughout:

63.      There is a need to strengthen the participatory process to better include the poor and
disadvantaged. The poorest and most marginalized may not have the priority in resource
allocation which was intended, because the poorest lack the means of accessing INDH. This is
largely due to weaknesses in the participatory process which should have better helped the target
population argue for their needs. For example, the really poor do not have strong representative
associations and that, as presently set up, the EAC/Q are not properly equipped to be the
animators and facilitators of community-driven development. Better off areas and groups were
perceived to be more able to organize and to present persuasive projects. The main
recommendations were (see Annex 6 for details): (i) strengthen the participatory process, with the
social mobilization teams to be full time professionals, properly trained and equipped; (ii)
capacity building focus to be on the development of local social capital and local area
associations; and (iii) targeting procedures for urban areas to be improved.

64.     There are concerns over sub-project quality and sustainability. Sub-project quality was
considered to be very variable, and many participants pointed to a lack of proper follow-up during
implementation and operation. Recommendations included: (i) standardize appraisal criteria,
perhaps in a „project preparation manual‟; (ii) provide for technical support to preparation and
supervision, possibly delegating these support functions to professional partners; (iii) strengthen
the capacity of the social mobilization teams for follow-up; and (iv) extend support and M&E
beyond the project construction period to cover the first years of operation. Consideration could


                                                17
also be given to risk-based partnership agreements that tie payments for project sponsors to
verified quality of implementation.

65.     There are problems of overlap and incoherence with line ministry programs i.e. the
classic problem of „convergence‟ (see 2.2 above). Recommendations were: (i) reactivate the
national program for improving „convergence‟ and push for decentralization or at least
„deconcentration‟; (ii) associate line ministries in all levels of INDH governance bodies; and (iii)
reconcile local development plans such as the Plans de developpement communal (PDCs) with
the ILDHs




                                                18
        4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate to significant

66.      There are several risks to the outcomes of Phase I and to their sustainability. There is a
risk to the inclusiveness outcome that the participatory planning process will not be further
developed and that INDH will become a complement to general investment financing. With the
announcement of a doubled budget for Phase II and expanded territorial coverage, there will be
strong pressures to get on and spend, to establish facts on the ground. These pressures could
easily undermine the rather frail participatory planning process already in place and overwhelm
the efforts that the Bank will be promoting to strengthen that process and to allow more time for it
to mature.

67.     There is a risk to the outcome of accountability and ownership that lack of
„convergence‟ will continue to reduce INDH efficiency. There is a „country risk‟ that Morocco‟s
gradual move towards decentralization and empowerment of local government will not be
completed or will have weak impact, and that this will impair the chances of efficient integrated
planning for investment and service delivery.

68.     There is a sustainability risk to Phase I outcomes due to doubts over the effectiveness of
arrangements for continued management, operation and maintenance of facilities (see 2.5 above).
Targets for ensuring sub-project sustainability are formally met (Indicators # 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17,
22 – see Annex 2), but these targets are low and there are clearly problems of sustainability that
are not captured by the formal data. INDH reports that only three quarters of infrastructure
projects are operational and less than two thirds of centers under the vulnerability component are
covered by operating agreements. Under Phase II, attention will be needed not only to ensuring
sustainability of new investments but also to strengthening arrangements for Phase I sub-projects.

69.       There is a risk to the overall PDO that the „lessons learned‟ from Phase I will be found
too difficult and that INDH will essentially continue „business as usual‟. Phase II will require
actions to consolidate gains and to strengthen processes, particularly in the areas of: (i) improving
the participatory approach; (ii) improving efficiency; and (iii) maximizing welfare gains. All
these improvements will require objectivity, frankness and readiness to accept change, and there
is a risk that the needed flexibility will not be forthcoming.

        5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

 (a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

70.     Rapid appraisal of an already ongoing program was accepted within the Bank because it
opened a window of opportunity to move faster on the linked participatory and poverty reduction
agendas. Given that the Bank was essentially joining a process that was underway, appraisal
correctly focused on key areas where the Bank could add value by improving design and
managing risks: (1) targeting and inclusion; (2) the participatory process and the related
governance and support mechanisms; (3) fiduciary and safeguard arrangements; (4) capacity
building; (5) M&E; (6) development communications; and (7) involvement of partner agencies.


                                                 19
71.     Appraisal took into account country and global lessons. There was an excellent review of
early INDH results. The poverty analysis, based on poverty assessments and mapping, was well
done. Although there had been no pilot specific to INDH, lessons from precursor CBD/CDD-
type programs which the Bank had financed were adequately factored in. The risk assessment is
detailed and comprehensive (see 2.1 above), and the PAD is frank on where Bank views differed
from those of Government and what were the implications.

72.     A weaker point at appraisal was the results framework, where the links between outputs,
outcomes and PDO were unclear, and the indicators did not capture the real results of the
operation. The linkages were improved when indicators were revised after the MTR (1.3).

73.     With hindsight, it is clear that on some aspects – particularly M&E and communications
– the Bank overestimated the commitment and the capacity of INDH to implement the good
design. This was one area where intensive supervision was expected to help INDH grasp the
importance of these activities, and to implement them according to the proposed design. In the
event, during implementation the CN realized the importance of these issues. Some progress was
made on development communications, although less so on M&E.

74.     More generally, Bank management accepted that the gains to be won from partnering
Government on this high return program outweighed the relatively high risks, and decided that a
large supervision budget would be allocated to permit early detection of any problems and to
allow design to be improved during implementation. This was a reasonable approach.

75.      QAE rating: Moderately satisfactory, although on several criteria the quality was rated
higher: technical, financial and economic analysis; poverty, gender and social development; and
environment. The rating was justified by general endorsement of the quality of appraisal,
tempered by concerns about high risks and that more could have been done to mitigate them. The
principal concerns cited were: (i) prospects would have been improved with a slower start-up and
more initial capacity building; (ii) the apparent unreadiness of the CN coordination unit; (iii) the
risk that pressures to disburse would lead to cutting corners on participatory decision making and
local governance; and (iv) the arrangements for evaluation were unclear. The ICR concurs that
these risks were real. However, in the event, most were addressed during implementation and
supervision, except for the concern over evaluation which remains an issue (see 2.3 above).

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

76.     Supervision quality. Supervision posed a challenge, due to the sheer size of the program,
the multi-sectoral programmatic approach, the large number of national and donor partners, and
the immediate full-scale implementation with untried approaches and new institutions.
Supervision was necessarily selective, but the empirical and analytical work and the resulting
judgments and recommendations proved generally sound. The Bank followed implementation
closely, consistently raising issues and proposing solutions to implementation issues. Reports
were clear and of good quality, and there was transparent and consistent „restitution‟ at both
central and local levels. The Bank shared with the EU leadership of the donor group and
maintained a permanent dialogue both with the CN and with the high level Steering Committee.
More might have been done on sustainability issues, where attention was limited until later in the
Project period.



                                                20
77.      Supervision inputs. The Bank maintained co-task team leaders throughout, of whom one
was based in the country office and spending more than half of the time on supervision of INDH.
The supervision budget was adequate and well used, and the Bank fielded well-qualified, multi-
disciplinary teams of up to ten or more specialists, with fair continuity. Regular site visits were
made to verify progress on the ground and to ensure that participatory processes and institutions
were in place and operating as designed, that needed strengthening was provided, and that sub-
projects were being correctly selected and implemented for the benefit of the target population.
Over the life of Phase I, Bank teams visited and evaluated in detail INDH activities in some fifty
of the total of 65 provinces. Although the team lacked dedicated specialists in income generating
projects and participatory CDD processes, considerable support to these aspects was provided
through supervision. As mentioned above (para 29), the Bank organized three high-level round
table discussions on lessons learned on participatory approaches to poverty reduction, and also
organized a study tour to Brazil and subsequent policy discussions for decision-makers to learn
from experience of community-driven development and income generating programs there.

78.     Areas of greater or lesser supervision impact. Overall, the Bank had a strong positive
impact on the success of the program (see 2.1, 2.2 and 3.2 above), but there were areas where
impacts were more muted. The Bank team played a key role in the development of good
procedures, especially in the preparation of the operation manuals. Continuous supervision
support from the Country Office and regular supervision missions were used to bring together key
stakeholders to exchange views, learn lessons and align approaches. This served to keep a focus
on results in terms of process and institution building, and also on outputs and outcomes. On
M&E, the Bank helped the CN to improve the MIS and set up an M&E plan. However, the M&E
proposed in the PAD proved over-ambitious. The restructuring of the project aimed to streamline
the Results Framework and to make it clearer, with fewer indicators and more realistic targets,
including for disbursement indicators. Strong supervision emphasis on M&E by the Bank and
EU did have some impact, but overall the result was disappointing (see 2.3 above). Several key
aspects of M&E remain to be developed: community-based M&E, follow up on sustainability,
information on whether the targeting worked. These shortfalls from appraisal expectations are
not unusual in a first phase CDD project and a more incremental approach was clearly indicated.
In addition, INDH‟s high profile and the consequent pressure to show success placed constraints
on data collection and reporting. It will be vital to ensure that government and Bank agree on a
frank assessment of M&E and integrate the lessons into the Phase II design.

79.      On environment, the well-designed EA procedures were formally respected but, although
supervision attention was consistent, the Bank did not succeed in „mainstreaming‟ environment
within INDH. Despite a well-designed development communications component and high
quality supervision inputs, in the face of muted government interest, the Bank could catalyze only
partial progress towards the intended role of communications as a „key instrument of
accountability, transparency and ownership‟.

80.     QALP rating (August 2008) for implementation progress was moderately satisfactory.
The highest score (highly satisfactory) went to „ownership‟, and the lowest (unsatisfactory) to
M&E. Implementing agency performance was rated moderately satisfactory, with the note „slow
to get going‟. INDH‟s performance on resolving issues was also rated moderately satisfactory.
Bank supervision was rated satisfactory. This ICR concurs with the evaluation by the QALP.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory



                                                21
81.      Responsive and constructive appraisal processes, with in-depth analysis of all key issues,
resulted in a relatively high risk but high reward decision for the Bank to proceed in response to
Government‟s clearly expressed desire to have the Bank as its lead partner. The key risk
management strategy was intensive and interactive supervision. This was provided by a large
supervision team with most required skills and giving quality advice. Candid reporting back to
government at both decentralized and central levels, making clear all deficiencies and
highlighting options for correcting them, was the hallmark of the Bank‟s supervision performance.
This is clear from the detailed and constructive presentations made to the authorities at the end of
each mission, and by the subsequent aide memoires and follow-up from the resident supervision
team. Government was, in general, highly appreciative of Bank inputs, and of its focus on key
issues and its commitment to supportive dialogue. Government did raise some administrative
issues regarding Bank supervision (see para 97), but the enthusiastic invitation to the Bank to
renew its lead partner role for Phase II is testament to the esteem in which Bank guidance is held.
Taken together, the Bank‟s proactive approach to partnership and risk management, and the
intensity and quality of its work on design and implementation, with moderate shortcomings
experienced at appraisal and regarding team composition during supervision, support an overall
rating of „moderately satisfactory‟.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

82.     INDH was a truly national initiative, marked by very strong ownership, and driven by a
keen appreciation of the need for a major, high profile response to worsening socio-political and
poverty circumstances. INDH fitted well with new movements towards democracy, human rights
and accountable governance, a more inclusive growth model, and a broader definition of
development goals, encompassing human development beyond simple economic growth. The
guiding principles and program design were outlined in the 2005 Plateforme, a clear concept
document, and an initial set of actions was launched twelve months before Bank appraisal.
Government set up two top level committees chaired by the Prime Minister, allocated very large
financial resources, and backed implementation consistently throughout the Project period.
Shortcomings lay in government‟s reluctance to implement key governance measures, especially
requirements for transparent and relevant M&E and for the establishment of grievance
mechanisms. Delays in implementation of deconcentrated resource allocation undermined
expectations of convergence for INDH planning and operations (2.2).

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

83.     The CN was a new agency operating in a very challenging and constrained environment.
Although the model was untried, CN was expected to implement it full scale from day one.
Given the high profile of the INDH, political scrutiny was intense, and there was little scope to
fail and to learn from failure. Complexity proved another challenge, with a vast number of
governance structures, implementing partners and stakeholders. CN‟s role, too, was a tricky one,
with no direct authority over decision making, and only advisory powers to improve
implementation and outcomes. The challenge was for CN to guide and coordinate a massive
program according to rules which encouraged innovation from the bottom up and demand-driven
programming, making coordination an heroic task.


                                                22
84.     CN‟s strengths were, first and foremost, its professional commitment to implementation,
which was largely delivered on time. CN showed respect for its fiduciary and safeguard
obligations, and sought guidance from the Bank and elsewhere on selected issues. Given its
coordination rather than management, role CN proved adept at steering a fine line between
necessary „instructions‟ – procedures manuals, annual orientation notes, circulars – and
„delegated flexibility‟ for adaptation and innovation at the decentralized level. The holding of
numerous open workshops, study tours etc. demonstrated a spirit of critical enquiry and
awareness of the need for constant improvement. CN was also successful in developing
numerous standards and tools for decentralized management.

85.      However, initially CN lacked experience in many areas of responsibility, and was slow to
acquire the needed methodologies and competences, notably in environment, M&E, development
communications, and capacity building. Also, driven by a need to always show good progress,
CN sometimes had a defensive reaction to suggestions for improvement, which were taken as a
critique, and there was a corresponding reluctance to accept needed changes. The setting aside of
the innovation teams, which initially provided useful inputs, is an example.

86.       The INDH governance bodies were an innovative conjunction of elected leaders, officials
and civil society. Generally, they worked effectively, with written internal procedures. However,
it is not clear to what extent the poor and marginalized actually had a voice in these bodies. The
DAS evolved effectively, although at different paces. Most have proved capable in supporting
implementation and have capacity to push forward the participatory development agenda in Phase
II. The social mobilization teams are heterogeneous in composition and competence. They have
generally proved energetic and effective – but only within limitations: lack of clear terms of
reference, inadequate training, and absence of a mandate and resources to do a quality job in
supporting the participatory process.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

87.     Commitment to INDH was strong throughout, and all partners worked hard to solve
implementation problems and achieve output targets. Excellent dialogue and relations were
maintained with all stakeholders, including donors.          Weaknesses were in the partial
implementation of governance measures, in the uneven quality of the participatory process, in
M&E and capacity building, and in provision for sustainability. Given the generally strong
commitment and good results, but the need to strengthen key parts of the process for the Phase II,
an overall rating of moderately satisfactory is appropriate.

        6. Lessons Learned

88.      The valuable lessons drawn from the implementation of INDH I are based on continuous
learning and dialogue between the Government, the Bank and other partners, and are
supplemented by contributions from a broad spectrum of stakeholders through stakeholder
workshops. The overall conclusions are presented here, but given the need for intensive learning
and applicability to INDH II, Annex 2 and Annex 6 contain more detailed lessons learned in all
areas of the project.

89.    INDH has shown that new participatory approaches can be put in place rapidly. In an
environment with a history of top-down, centralized decision making, implanting a culture of


                                               23
participatory diagnostic and programming and real empowerment of poor communities poses
many policy and institutional challenges. The first five year phase of the INDH has succeeded,
with strong government commitment, adequate resource allocation and good technical support, in
building capacity in governance and support structures, establishing participatory approaches, and
showing what improvements are needed.

90.      Further, INDH has also demonstrated that large numbers of sub-projects can be
implemented in a very short period. Despite the risks, a well-designed and supported program
can begin from almost nothing and achieve high levels of implementation in a very short time,
provided that adequate supporting measures are in place. The first phase of INDH has invested
$1.7 billion in 22,000 sub-projects for over 5 million beneficiaries. Indications from both
qualitative evaluations and preliminary results of the impact evaluation are that these INDH
investments have had an impact on human development indicators

91.     The experience of INDH has also highlighted the lessons and areas in which better
performance are needed, which not surprisingly correspond with the themes on which Bank
support has been requested by the Government for Phase II. First is the area of social
accountability and participation to improve real empowerment of poor communities. The lessons
from Phase I and areas for improvement under the second phase of INDH would include the need
to improve real empowerment of poor communities through:

-   Strengthening the participatory planning approach by improving the methodologies for ILDH
    preparation and better convergence with sectoral programs and reinforcing local support
    mechanisms, notably social mobilization teams
-   Supporting grass roots associations by strengthening their mandate and ensuring that they are
    truly representative of local communities
-   Decentralization of decision-making powers, including strengthening local governance bodies
    (CLDH) and reinforcing their representativity, possible community management of funds,
    and promotion of community contracting
-   Strengthening community ownership of sub-projects and reinforcing measures for the
    sustainability of their operation and maintenance
-   Reinforcing participatory M&E procedures, strengthening two-way communications, and
    ensuring that „grievance mechanisms‟ are properly established

92.      Second is the area of economic inclusion, where lessons from INDH suggest that
additional risks are associated with income generating activities and that the model needs to be
refined, building on existing global knowledge. In particular there is a need for:

-   Improving design of the linkages to micro-finance
-   Providing much better technical assistance and continued business management support to
    sponsor associations
-   Development of a typology of revenue-raising projects and adaptation of appraisal and
    financing arrangements for different categories
-   Directed focus on certain interventions such as vocational training and job placements for
    youth
-   Increased use of “community participation? procurement procedures to foster local
    employment during construction of sub-projects and local infrastructure

93.    A third area concerns overall enhancement of service delivery access and quality so as to
maximize and sustain human development outcomes. Here, the main lessons are the need for:



                                               24
-   Establishing clear criteria for the selection of projects
-   Keeping costs down by adopting standard models, standard unit costs, and follow up
-   Building in sustainability considerations from the start and finding ways to support
    sustainability of Phase I investments
-   Continuing to carry out detailed impact evaluations, including longitudinal surveys,
    employing third party M&E, and establishing clear benchmarks for Phase II
-   Overhauling and expanding support to revenue-generating activities, improving both
    commercial sustainability and pro-poor targeting

94.     Finally systems improvements are needed to improve efficiency, sustainability and
impacts. Some of the lessons and recommendations in this regard are:

-   More effective M&E and learning, including strengthening the capacity for innovation
    through revival of the innovation teams, possible pilot operations, and (perhaps) twinning
    with similar CBD/CDD operations in other comparable countries.
-   More active management of integration and „convergence‟ of investment programs, including
    reconciliation and synergy between ILDH and the PCD communal plans, and strengthening
    of partnerships with the local branches of government technical services
-   Review of the criteria for selecting target areas and groups and redefining the targeting
    instruments, especially for urban areas
-   Strengthening results-based management through a well-defined Results Framework and
    realistic disbursement-linked indicators, and improved M&E of results, including of sub-
    project impacts. The management information system also needs to be upgraded in Phase II
    to make it more user-friendly and informative.
-   Strengthening the capacity building program, starting with a capacity building strategy,
    adapting it more to local needs and focusing on development of specific required
    competences, including local level investment programming and implementation
-   Streamlining procurement, including appraisal of sponsor‟s procurement capacity as part of
    sub-project evaluation procedures, simplified procurement tracking, and strengthened
    procurement capacity building.
-   Mainstreaming fiduciary, environment and social safeguards into programming and sub-
    project appraisals and follow-up
-   Expanding the communications program, giving priority to two way communications and to
    facilitating dialogue with beneficiaries

       7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

95.     Based on self-evaluation and on attitude surveys, the Borrower, through the CN, prepared
an ICR (May 2011), summarized in English in Annex 7. Overall, the Borrower‟s ICR shares the
Bank‟s evaluation of a challenging but high reward project which has largely achieved its
objectives.

96.     The Borrower‟s ICR also provides a substantive assessment of the World Bank‟s
contribution to INDH, explaining that government requested Bank involvement because of the
Bank‟s global expertise, its ability to mobilize multi-sectoral teams, and its in-depth
understanding of Morocco. Overall, the Government ICR rates World Bank support as valuable
in providing technical assistance, in improving performance, and in convening and aligning other
partners. The Bank has helped to create a culture of collective on the job learning. Bank
missions enabled a marked improvement in the design and implementation of the INDH,


                                              25
achieving this through consultation, dialogue, mutual trust and respect, objectivity and common
sense.

97.      Nonetheless, the Borrower‟s ICR notes some tensions with the Bank, particularly
regarding Bank role, the periodic changes of mission staff, and the burden placed on the CN by
the size and frequency of Bank missions. Bank response to the critique was that every effort had
been made to ensure that the Bank played its advisory role appropriately, and that changes in
mission staff had been kept to the very minimum, with one co-team leader in place since
appraisal. The ongoing role of the Bank, mission frequency and composition were subsequently
clarified during appraisal of Phase II. In addition, the Bank received comments from the
Borrower on an early draft of this Bank ICR (see Annex 7). The Bank responded that most of the
comments are the result of a misunderstanding and all clarifications were done to the client. For
the other, the necessary corrections will be made in the final version of the ICR..

(b) Cofinanciers (EU)

98.     Comments were received (Annex 8) from the principal cofinancier, the European Union
(EU). Overall, the EU shares the Bank‟s evaluation regarding the quality and sustainability of
achievements, convergence, capacity building, etc. Appropriate changes have been made to take
into account EU comments.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society): None received

            Annex 2: Outputs by Component and Implementation Arrangements



2.1.    The objective of Bank support to the INDH program was to assist the Government in
improving inclusiveness, accountability and transparency of decision making and implementation
processes at the local level in order to enhance use of social and economic infrastructure and
services by poor and vulnerable groups.

2.2.     The objective was to be reached through four components: (1) Poverty alleviation in rural
areas („the rural component‟), estimated cost $300 million; (2) Alleviation of social exclusion in
urban areas („the urban component‟), estimated cost $300 million; (3) Alleviation of extreme
vulnerability („the vulnerability component‟), estimated cost $300 million; and (4) Mainstreaming
INDH governance mechanisms and strengthening of institutional capacity („the cross cutting
component‟), estimated cost $300 million.


2.3.    The program was based on the introduction of a new bottom-up concept of integrated
socio-economic development based on participation, local governance, partnership, sustainability
and results orientation.

2.4.    The key outcomes expected were designed largely to gauge the strength of the
participatory planning and implementation process and to measure increases in welfare for the
target population:

        - Rural component: Communities in targeted rural communes actively participate in
          selecting priority interventions based on a strategic planning process and in
          implementing and operating the subprojects.
        - Urban component: Communities in targeted urban neighborhoods actively participate
          in selecting priority interventions based on a strategic planning process and in
          implementing and operating the sub-projects.
        - Vulnerability component: People living in vulnerable conditions have access to a range
          of social services of improved quality which emphasize social and economic inclusion.
        - Cross cutting component: The Provincial Competitive Fund (PCF) set up under the
          project is used in a transparent manner to leverage investments made at the local level;
          and institutional capacity for implementation is strengthened at all levels.

2.5.    Performance of INDH as a whole, as measured against key indicators is shown in the
table below. The design, activities and outputs for each component, and their contribution to the
key outcomes are detailed in subsequent sections.

Performance of the INDH as whole

2.6.     The Program Development Objective (PDO) of the INDH was: to assist the Government
in improving inclusiveness, accountability and transparency of decision making and
implementation processes at the local level in order to enhance use of social and economic
infrastructure and services by poor and vulnerable groups. As revised at MTR, the following are
the specific targets and actuals at completion:

                                   COMPONENT 1: RURAL

The Component as designed

2.7.   Morocco‟s poorest rural communes were selected as targets for this component. All
communes with a poverty rate above 30% were selected, and another 54 communes with a rate
between 22% (national average) and 30% were selected on the proposition of provincial
committees. The average population of a rural commune is about 20,000. Procedures for
implementing the component are contained in the procedures manual which was vetted by the
Bank before issue.

2.8.    The component was to finance projects that would achieve the intended outcome, under
four headings:
        1. Access to basic infrastructure and services
        2. Promotion of social, cultural and sports activities
        3. Building and developing local capacity
        4. Promoting and supporting local income generating activities

2.9.    Local Human Development Committees (CLDH) were to be set up in each targeted rural
commune, comprising elected members of the commune council, local government staff, NGOs,
civil society representatives, and representatives of the private sector. In order to avoid
dominance by government officials, the percentage of representatives of elected officials and civil
society representatives was to be at least two thirds. On average, the committees were to have
about 10-15 members.

2.10. In each commune a „facilitation and social mobilization team‟ was to be set up (EAC/Q),
comprising volunteers from civil society, staff of the commune, and local staff of central
government ministries.

2.11. At provincial and prefecture level, a Provincial Human Development Committee (CPDH)
was to be set up, and the Social Action Division of the provincial branch of the Ministry of the
Interior was to be strengthened to provide support and supervision services.

2.12.   The component was to be implemented in five steps:

        - A participatory rapid assessment and the writing of a „monograph‟ describing the
          socio-economic situation in the commune.
        - A participatory diagnostic process to identify needs and capacities, and to draw up a
          preliminary list of project proposals: (1) small projects, typically MAD 30,000 that
          could be implemented quickly and have high impact; and (2) larger projects that
          needed to be reconciled with the investment programs of the line ministries and the
          communal councils.
        - The preparation of a five year development program (2006-2010) – the ILDH - based
          on common eligibility and selection criteria: (1) response to identified needs; (2)
          strong ownership; and (3) targeting the poorest.
        - Adoption of the ILDH by the CPDH and presentation to the CPDR for no-objection,
          based on a check of: (1) eligibility under the INDH program; (2) avoiding overlap
          with line ministry programs; and (3) possibility that line ministries could provide
          support to both financing and implementation.




                                                32
         - Implementation by the project sponsor, typically an NGO, other civil society groups,
           or the commune. An agreement signed between the governor and the sponsor spells
           out the conditions, and line ministries provide technical support.

The Component as implemented: outputs

2.13. The rural component was executed in a total of 403 target communes: 348 where poverty
rates exceeded 30%, and in 55 communes selected by the CPDH where the rate exceeded 22%.

2.14. According to the information system (IS), the participatory process was carried out in line
with the plan. A total of 403 CLDHs were set up, one in each of the 403 targeted rural
communes. The CLDHs comprised the range of members specified – according to the IS, two
thirds of CLDH members comprised elected representatives (i.e. members of the conseil
communal, and nominated members representing civil society such as associations etc.); and one
third were local officials of line ministries. This is in line with targets. Virtually all CLDHs
(91%) were reported as having developed and adopted internal operating procedures.

2.15. A total of 403 EACs were set up, comprising largely local staff of central government
ministries (about three quarters), with the rest coming from associations (about 15%), and from
communal personnel (about 10%).

2.16. Training and capacity building programmes were conducted for the CLDH, the EACs,
and other local actors.

2.17. A total of 403 ILDHs were prepared, one for each commune. The processes by which
they were prepared are imperfectly documented. About half the target populations are reported to
have participated in the process (see Indicator 6 in the table below).

2.18. The ILDHs were all approved in some form by the CPDH, and were implemented. A
total of 6,756 projects (about 30% of the total number of INDH projects) was undertaken, for a
value of MAD 2.76 billion ($340 million, higher than the target $300 million, but only 19% of
total project costs. INDH contributed MAD 2.1 billion ($260 million, 24% of total INDH
financing, close to the initial expectation of 25%), and a combination of communal funds and
contributions from local associations and beneficiaries paid the balance of MAD 645 million
($800 million). The „leverage‟ effect was thus 24%, lower than average for the INDH program,
presumably because of the relatively lower cash flow in rural areas. A total of 1.53 million rural
people benefitted from the component.

2.19. The breakdown of projects between the four sub-components is shown in the table Rural
Projects, which suggests: (i) rural preference for basic infrastructure in the first phase (77% of
number of projects, 85% of total project value); (ii) the relatively low share of AGR; and (iii) the
apparent lack of interest in (or promotion of) capacity building projects.

2.20.       The main types of investment in each sub-component were:

Rural projects
 Sub-component                                   Main projects executed, in order of popularity
 1. Infrastructure and services     Drinking water, education, water management, agriculture, health, centers

 2. Social, cultural and sports     Youth and sports facilities, centers polyvalent, education, culture
 3. Strengthening governance and    Support the implementation of the governance committees, extension
 local capacities                   procedure manuals; anchoring the values, principles and foundations of
                                    the INDH; strengthening the participatory strategic planning process and
                                    exchange of experiences;
 4. AGR                             Agriculture, artisanat, SSI, commercial centres, tourism, centres
                                    polyvalents

2.21. No information on the results of the projects is currently available, but a comprehensive
impact evaluation is ongoing.

2.22. The participation of women in the CLDH was 17%, equivalent to about two women in
each CLDH. The participation of women in the EACs was also about 16%, which would mean
that about every second EAC contained a woman member.

2.23. The participation of youth (under 30) in the CLDH was 12%, equivalent to about two
young persons in each CLDH. The participation of youth in the EACs was reported as about 4%,
which would mean that a young person participated in about one EAC in six.

Evaluation of the Component

2.24. Reviews by the Bank of samples of the participatory rapid assessments and the resulting
„monographs‟ suggest that „the work was conducted in a wide variety of ways and is of very
mixed quality, ranging from best practice to weak.

2.25.       Reviews by the Bank of samples of the ILDHs suggest that:

        -   Most of the projects identified are high impact poverty reducing projects.
        -   In some cases the ILDHs are genuinely multi-annual phased investment programmes
            built on a truly participatory process, validated with and owned by poor people and poor
            communities within the commune. The greater number, however, are project lists
            updated from time to time, pieced together through a range of imperfect consultative
            processes.
        -   Generally, the presentation to the CPDH comprised lists of projects and project fiches,
            rather than coherent ILDHs.
        -   There was a reasonable response from the CPDR (i.e. turnaround time, acceptance of all
            well-founded projects, no substitution by the CPDR for CLDH level choices)

2.26. The low share of AGRs points to difficulty for rural people in putting together persuasive
projects. In the beneficiary workshops the reasons advanced were: (1) lack of organization and of
support to organization; (2) lack of commercial and technical knowledge, and support to
developing that knowledge; and (3) high risk and lack of commercial opportunity.

2.27. Conclusion of project agreements has been with a range of sponsors, typically NGOs,
other civil society groups, or the commune.




                                                    34
2.28. There has been a mixed experience regarding dealing with overlaps with line ministries,
or getting them to provide support to both financing and implementation.

2.29. Project implementation and the quality of infrastructure have been of mixed quality,
mostly good. Costs are about 20% lower than usual costs for public contracts, the explanation for
which appears to be largely lower quality of works.

2.30. In some cases, arrangements for operation and maintenance are weak or non-existent.
The reported percentage of projects with adequate arrangements for maintenance is 77%.

Outcome of the Component

2.31. The absence of any information on the results of projects makes evaluation of their
impact difficult (but see Annex 3). An impact evaluation is ongoing. The targeted outcome of the
rural component was: Communities in targeted rural communes actively participate in selecting
priority interventions based on a strategic planning process and in implementing and operating
the subprojects. The specific targets and latest actual are shown in the table below:

                                   COMPONENT 2: URBAN

The Component as designed

2.32. Apart from targeting procedures and nomenclature the design and scope of this
component are identical to Component 1: Rural, and the details are not repeated here.

2.33. Because poverty maps could not provide a straightforward list of the most socially
excluded neighborhoods, no simple targeting rule could be adopted for the urban component.
Instead, the INDH steering committee selected a number of urban centers across the country;
specified the number of neighborhoods to be supported in each urban center; and set out a series
of social exclusion indicators to be used in the selection of urban neighborhoods at the local level:
access to basic services, unemployment, illiteracy, and housing conditions. It was left to the
provincial authorities to rank the importance of the criteria, to introduce others, and to apply them
to select the target neighborhoods, and the specific poverty pockets within those neighborhoods.
The resulting anomalies are well described in the PAD (pp. 49ff).

2.34. The EAC in the urban component were called EAQ; and the CPDR referred to the
prefecture and not the province

Outcome of the Component

2.35. During 2005-2010, 1,627,600 people benefited from 4,069 projects (see table),
amounting to a total investment of more than 4,123 MDH, of which 1,950 MDH (47%) was
partner‟s contribution.

                              COMPONENT 3: VULNERABILITY

The Component as designed

2.37. According to the PAD (pp. 58-60), the following activities to improve services to the
vulnerable were to be carried out:

    -     Design and implementation of holistic services, including outreach and support, psycho-
          social rehabilitation, and support to economic opportunities
    -     Developing alternatives to institutionalization, such as foster care and community-based
          day care
    -     Design of standards and protocols for addressing the needs of each target group
    -     Improving the management and quality of existing centers and institutions
    -     Capacity building
    -     Prevention of vulnerability

2.38. The program was to be prepared by a combination of bottom up identification at
community level, including collaborative efforts of the vulnerable and involvement of civil
society, and professional expertise from NGOs, government services etc.




                                                  37
The Component as implemented: outputs3

2.39. The component was implemented on a regional basis, with the Comité régional de
developpement humain as the governance and decision making body. A procedures manual
specified eligibility and mechanisms. A regional diagnostic and needs assessment was carried out,
and on this basis regional vulnerability maps and action plans were prepared.

2.40. A partnership with EN was agreed, under which EN coordinated implementation of the
component, oversaw preparation of the diagnostic and vulnerability maps and the regional multi-
annual project planning, and drew up and implemented the capacity building program and the
communication plan. NGOs played the major role in implementation as project promoters.

2.41.      Major progress was recorded:

      -    16 regional vulnerability assessments, maps and investment programs were prepared
      -    1,625 sub-projects were implemented, directly benefitting 428,000 people. In addition,
           523 student hostels were constructed, benefitting a further 108,537 people.
      -    Total investment was DH 1, 820 millions, of which INDH contributed DH 1,111 million
           (61%), and other partners contributed DH 709 million (39%).
      -    The handicapped (63%) and vulnerable women (20%) were the main beneficiaries.
      -    The partnership with EN was effective.
      -    The participation of NGOs was effective, and NGOs grew in strength
      -    Professional standards for services to the vulnerable were raised, and largely conformed
           to the national standards laid down by Law 14.05
      -    An innovation team helped develop concepts and procedures, and experience was
           capitalized in a national seminar on vulnerability in 2010

2.42. Financial leverage was high, and was aided by the number of rich patrons who organized
themselves in associations to contribute more effectively Problems emerged during execution,
many of which were dealt with:

           - The diagnostic and vulnerability mapping were largely carried out „top down‟,
           depending largely on NGO knowledge, and were not based on much involvement of the
           vulnerable themselves or of their communities nor on the rural/urban participatory
           diagnostic led by the EAC/Q
           - As a result, the programs were often conceived more top down than bottom up, and so
           had weaker local anchoring and participation than hoped for, and were not always well
           adapted to real needs
           - Early on, there was a strong bias towards infrastructure, inconsistent with component
           design, and „institutionalization‟ rather than working in situ or reinsertion has remained
           dominant
           - Almost one fifth (18%) of projects did not specifically address the problems of the
           vulnerable (for example, sports centers for the community as a whole, decided on as part
           of the municipal development program)
           - The infrastructure bias was made worse by lack of provision for staffing, O&M etc. of
           newly built centers



3
    The evaluation of this component is based on a working paper by Najat M‟jid



                                                     38
        - Generally, there was a lack of provision for sustainability, both at the level of oversight
        („encadrement‟) and of management, operation and maintenance. In response:

                - Annual operating subsidies were contracted
                - Management was contracted out
                - Partnership approaches specified multi-annual financing plans

2.43. These arrangements solved the problem of some centers, but at completion risks to
sustainability remained (see Section 4 of Main Report).

2.44. There was a lack of professional capacity, and training and other capacity building was
not always well adapted to needs. In response:
           - Partnership agreements were signed with many NGOs for center operation, and
                relevant training was provided
           - Up to 10,000 social workers were trained

2.45.   M&E to track the quality and quantity of results was not in place

Evaluation of the Component and lessons and recommendations

2.46.   Targeting should be revised, enlarged and adapted to regional differences by:
           - Giving more emphasis to street people
           - Providing more alternatives to institutionalization and prioritizing reintegration
           - Prioritizing preventive actions for those vulnerable but not yet excluded

2.47.   Reconfiguring the governance and implementation arrangements by:
        - Making the CRDH the regulation and supervision organ, and the CPDH the
           execution and follow up organ
        - Reactivating the regional technical commissions to provide more methodological
           guidance
        - Revising the procedures manual to make it more accessible
        - Redoing the diagnostic from the bottom up, involving actions at the base by EAC/Q
           and involving the target population themselves (and not just sponsors)
        - Including in the diagnostic emerging vulnerability factors so that preventive action
           can be integrated in the action plans
        - Preparing and implementing the vulnerability maps at provincial level

2.48. The innovation team should be retained and strengthened, with broader membership and
terms of reference

2.49.   Improve project quality by:

    -   Developing care standards for each category of vulnerable people
    -   Linking the vulnerable to income-generating opportunities
    -   Working on prevention as well as „cure‟
    -   Standardizing M&E, and including indicators of rehabilitation and reintegration
    -   Contracting with project sponsors for running facilities long term, with specific targets

2.50.   Move away from capital bias:

    -   Encouraging more emphasis on walk-in facilities, home visits, caravans medicales etc.


                                                39
2.51.   Strengthen capacity building by:

    -   Preparing standard statutes and job descriptions for each category of social worker
    -   Evaluating the „10,000 social workers project‟ and deploying these resources for Phase II
    -   Enabling experienced associations to become trainers and mentors
    -   Training, exchanges etc., with a standard manual for each category and specific emphasis
        on management, with monitoring and follow up of impacts of training
    -   Training for the support and governance structures

2.52.   Make the partnership with EN more productive by:

    -   Refining the ToR
    -   Strengthening EN
    -   Operationalizing the EN agreement in all provinces

2.54. Strengthen provisions for sustainability by:

    -   Standardization of projects, with norms for capital and operating costs
    -   Multi-annual contracts specifying sustainability and accountability
    -   Multiannual budgets for O&M
    -   Rigorous M&E of results and impacts
    -   Preparing and debating regional reports on the state of vulnerability

2.55. Improve procedures for convergence by:

    -   Strengthening collaboration between EN, health departments, the local authorities, and
        associations
    -   Strengthening collaboration with the whole range of state actors, preferably through
        agreements

Outcome of the Component

2.56. The targeted outcome of the vulnerability component was: People living in vulnerable
conditions have access to a range of social services of improved quality which emphasize social
and economic inclusion. The specific targets and latest actual are shown in the table below:

COMPONENT 4: MAINSTREAMING INDH GOVERNANCE AND STRENGTHENING
         OF INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES (CROSS-CUTTING)

                                     1. The Competitive Fund

The Sub-Component as designed

2.57. This was the only component managed at provincial level.              The INDH Steering
Committee provides each CPDH with an annual envelope for the Provincial Competitive Fund
(PCF), a combination of a fixed amount MAD 10 million (equivalent to $1.2 million) per
province and a variable amount based on the share of the population living below the poverty line.

2.58. The CPDH allocates PCF financing to project sponsors through a competitive and
transparent selection process. Eligible sponsors are communes and municipalities, associations,
cooperatives, and professional organizations.

2.59. The OCF can fund up to 70% of a project with a funding ceiling set at $35,000 per year
(funding can be extended over three years).




                                                   41
2.60. Each CPDH requests proposals at least twice a year. In 2009, 163 requests were
launched and 1,487 sub-project proposals were submitted. The DAS vets them and then the
CPDH allocates funding based on criteria in the operational manual.

2.61. The categories of the sub-projects are the same as for the rural and urban components: (i)
infrastructure and services; (ii) social, cultural and sporting activities; (iii) capacity building; and
(iv) revenue earning projects.

Evaluation of the Sub-Component

2.62. There was an impact on people‟s lives: 2005-2010, there were more than 1.5 million
beneficiaries from 9,049 sub-projects. Infrastructure sub-projects were the most requested. Total
investment was MAD 3.9 billion, with the INDH share being MAD 2.1 billion, a „leverage‟ of
47%.
2.63. A new social dynamic formed: More than 11,000 actors/sponsors took part, and a new
dynamic emerged amongst central government – elected officials – local government agencies –
civil society organizations

2.64. Inclusive and accountable governance structures took root: Participatory governance
bodies were set up, women and youth participation grew strongly, marginalized populations were
able to integrate into economic life, and a culture of transparency and accountability began to
emerge.

2.65.       The following areas for improvement have been identified:

        -   Capacity building for local actors
        -   Strengthening the participatory approach
        -   Improving integrated planning and convergence
        -   Revamping the revenue earning activities component by promoting more innovation,
            improving the focus on marketing and involving micro-finance organizations
        -   Strengthening local level communication circuits
        -   Reinforcing gender aspects

                                      2. Revenue raising projects4

The Sub-Component as designed and implemented

2.66. Revenue raising projects (Activités Génératrices de Revenus, AGR) are financed under
three components: rural (about 25% of all revenue raising projects); urban (10%) and cross-
cutting (65%). However, for ease of analysis, the entire activity is evaluated separately here.

2.67. Evolution of AGRs under the INDH. Financing of AGRs under the Project was
envisioned from the very beginning of implementation. These types of projects have been
implemented in the whole country. From 2005 to early 2009, AGR projects were implemented
under procedures which required use of a microfinance institution. Prior to 2008, there was no
requirement for AGR project proposals to have a business plan. Until 2009 all AGR projects

    The evaluation of this activity is based on a working paper by Jorge Munoz (World Bank AGR)



                                                    42
were financed with a 70% subsidy from INDH, 20% coming from a micro-credit institution, and
a 10% contribution from beneficiaries themselves (promoteurs).

2.68. The component got off to a difficult start: the procedures manual was ill-adapted, project
sponsors were inexperienced, and arrangements to associate micro-finance institutions never got
off the ground.

2.69. In early 2009, the Operations Manual (for AGRs) was revised to improve the
performance of these projects. The new manual introduced the use of business plans, increased
technical assistance, and eliminated the requirement that 20% of funds ought to come from a
micro-finance institution. Therefore from 2009 onward, 20% of the financing of an AGR project
could come from any source the beneficiaries could find (whether as loans or grants from any
source).

2.70. Subsequently, implementation picked up: in the cross-cutting component alone, 358,870
people benefitted from the 2,111 sub-projects, with DH 593 million invested. To this, INDH
contributed DH 354 million, indicating a high leverage of 40%. Agriculture, handicrafts and
commerce account for more than 80% of all projects. Notable is the large number of women
beneficiaries (53% of the total in 2009).

Evaluation of the Sub-Component

2.71.   From 2005 to 2010, INDH financed 3.685 AGR projects, or about 700 per year.

2.72. The majority of AGR projects were in response to calls for proposals (i.e., under the
transversal component) and as such they are submitted directly to the Provincial Committee for
Human Development (CPDH). Therefore, they were not the result of participatory planning
processes using the local facilitation teams in either rural (EAC) or urban areas (EAQ).

2.73. Most AGR projects were medium to large size. Only about 34% of AGR projects had a
total cost below DH 250,000 (that is to say, with INDH financing of up to DH 175,000), while
some 28% were between DH 250,000 and DH 700,000, and the rest (38%) were above DH
700,000. The program did not have rigid rules about how many beneficiaries different types of
AGRs ought to have. On average, AGR projects had 211 beneficiaries per project which is very
high compared to similar types of programs in other countries. This resulted in an average
investment of about DH 1,600 per individual (about US$200) which in turn is somewhat low
compared to other countries. These numbers suggest that the majority of AGR projects were not
“small-scale enterprises? which would be suitable for implementation by small groups of
beneficiaries. They tended to be medium-size enterprises with somewhat more sophisticated


                                              43
technical and managerial requirements. A 2010 survey found that about 37% of AGR projects
benefitted women, 18% were mixed, and 45% benefitted men.

2.74. In addition to issues related to size, operational practices under INDH tended to favor
sophisticated rather than simple economic enterprises. Once beneficiary associations (i.e., not-for-
profit societies) were created and received financial support from INDH for an AGR, they were
encouraged to become cooperatives (that is, profit-seeking commercial enterprises capable of
distributing profits among members).
Lessons and Recommendations

2.74. A fairly comprehensive study on AGRs, carried out in 2010 under the auspices of the
European Union, reached the following conclusions and recommendations:

    -       AGR entities (associations and cooperatives) were typically not well founded.
    -       There was very little diversification of AGR projects due to a limited perspective of what
            was locally feasible.
    -       Also, there was little business guidance or follow up to AGR projects (in substance and in
            time), certainly before 2009 when a business plan was not required to obtain INDH
            financing.

2.75. In addition, the EU study noted that the quality and sustainability of AGR projects have
suffered from more general constraints related to:

            Poverty, illiteracy, and little capacity-building of the target populations.
            Apparently, there was little effort to encourage new ways of doing things (e.g. breaking
             away from traditional practices and social roles)
            AGR projects suffered from excessive geographical dispersion and weak market
             linkages.

2.76. The EU study made several specific recommendations to improve the performance of
AGRs, many of which were also made by successive Bank supervision missions and other partial
reviews of the program. The following recommendations are noteworthy:

            Increased and more effective coordination (convergence) among the various institutions
             (national and partners) is fundamental.
            Support to AGRs must be based on the actual challenges and opportunities found on the
             ground in each region.
            Define the scale and sizes for certain types of projects.
            Carry out studies on production systems and local markets for key products.
            Pay more attention to marketing and profitability of projects.

2.77. A workshop carried out in February 2011 further recommended that:

           A typology of AGRs should be developed with different modalities for selecting projects
            and financing mechanisms, depending on the type of project.
           The program should enhance its regular monitoring of and support to beneficiary groups
            throughout the project cycle.
           The call for proposals modality should be strengthened.




                                                   44
2.78. In addition, given the obvious constraints related to poverty, illiteracy and weak
organizational capacity, a strategy that focuses on simpler and smaller AGRs seems more
appropriate than the current practice of favoring medium-size enterprises which are quickly
encouraged to turn themselves into more sophisticated for-profit cooperatives. Also, there seems
to be significant scope for improving the access to microfinance by project beneficiaries. For
example, the largest microfinance institution in Morocco, Al Amana, which has a market share of
about 50%, has barely interacted with INDH in the past. There are signs that it might be
interested in working with INDH in the future. They have over 2.000 trained staff distributed
among more than 400 branches throughout the country, 90% of whom are in the field and have
experience in evaluating the economic feasibility of small-scale projects.

2.79. More general recommendations for improved AGR implementation:
     Increased use of “community participation? procurement procedures. These practices are
       not widely known or applied under the project.
     There should be some discussion about establishing either (i) some standard sizes for
       types of projects, or (ii) total number of beneficiary limitations, or (iii) defined benefit per
       beneficiary, with some flexibility for choice of project.
     For the most geographically remote populations (low density, poor roads, distance to
       markets), AGRs may not be the most effective mechanism to increase their welfare.
       Clearly, doing this under the vulnerability component would be most appropriate.
     Development of a typology of revenue raising projects and adaptation of appraisal and
       financing arrangements for different categories
     Continuous follow up and support, through contracted agencies


                                        3. Capacity building

The Sub-Component as designed and implemented

2.80. Capacity building is central to INDH at all levels, particularly: (1) strengthening the
community base of the INDH; (2) strengthening the technical and managerial capacity of project
sponsors (both non-governmental and governmental); and (3) strengthening the governance
bodies and support agencies. Throughout, design put great emphasis on inclusion, particularly of
women and youth.

2.81. The set up provided for:

       - Appointment of capacity building coordinators at the central and provincial levels – the
         provincial level function was expanded into 70 services formation in the DAS
       - Drawing up of a list of trainers and institutions
       - Partnership with ADS
       - Contracts with universities and NGOs for training delivery

2.82. 70 provincial training plans were drawn up and 104,437 people were trained, compared
to a target of 70,000.




                                                  45
Evaluation of the Sub-Component5

2.83. Among the positive results were:

      -   The rise in status and competence of associations, and an associated notable improvement
          in the quality of sub-projects, their implementation and their subsequent operation
      -   Professionalization of social work, with 6,300 professional social workers trained in the
          universities 2008-2012, and the establishment of social work and workers as a profession
      -   The training of the governance bodies, which certainly raised their level of awareness and
          professional competence
      -   Development of the DAS as fully functioning professional and competent organizations
      -   Awareness by other government departments, which were at least made much more
          sensitive to the INDH, its importance and the need to interface with it
      -   Diversification of training content, where the themes spread beyond straightforward
          awareness raising and professional competence to cover gender and youth inclusion, civil
          rights etc.

2.84. There were understandable difficulties. The activity was slow to start, and much of the
early part of Phase I was spent in „learning by doing‟. The training needs identification was
initially weak, and much training appeared ad hoc and not quite adapted to needs. The quality
and range of training competences was initially quite low. There was no follow up mechanism to
match outputs against targets or to assess the actual value of the training given to the job in hand.

2.85. Overall, the achievements were considerable and notable improvements in organization,
adaptation of training to needs and improvements in capacity and performance were evident
towards the end of the Phase. The lessons can be capitalized to prepare a more coherent and
adapted professional capacity building program for Phase II.

Lessons and recommendations

2.86. A capacity building strategy should be developed at the start, linked to the overall INDH
strategy for Phase II.

2.87. A particular focus should be on clarifying and strengthening the statute and competence
of the various categories of social worker

2.88. Content should be specifically adapted to needs as gauged by professional needs
assessments, and training modules and materials should be developed and „stored‟ centrally

2.89. Third party contracting of capacity building should be the norm, centers of excellence
should be identified from amongst professional service providers (universities, associations,
consulting firms), and networking and professional groupings amongst providers should be
encouraged.

2.90. Training needs assessments and provision should be decentralized and determined at
provincial level.

                                                   46
2.91. All training should be made more practical, and more on-the-job training should be
encouraged.

2.92.     Performance and impact indicators should be developed, and M&E should be set up.

2.93.     A specific dedicated budget should be assigned to capacity building.


                                          4. Communications

The Sub-Component as designed

2.94. Development communications is highlighted in the PAD as a priority (page 65), essential
to a program based on participation as it is a key instrument of accountability, transparency and
ownership. The vision was that the communications function would promote information sharing
and two-way dialogue in pursuit of these three virtues. The program was to support: (i)
awareness raising; (ii) capacity building; and (iii) development of a communications strategy.

Evaluation of the Sub-Component6

2.95. INDH set up a communications unit, conducted training, and helped the development of
local communications plans.

2.96. Results included: dissemination of the operations manual; some limited communication
of information top down; a fair degree of information flow between INDH, line ministries and
provincial level actors; a good flow of information to development partners; and a website (which
however had limited usefulness).


2.97.     Weak points included:

      -   The communications strategy was never approved or updated, and implementation
          seemed more „learning by doing‟ than structured and professional. Messages were not
          clearly defined or targeted. Only a limited rage of media was used, and local level media
          such as imams were not considered.
      -   The proposed provincial level quarterly reports and workshop dialogues, and the
          proposed half-yearly national workshop dialogues, did not happen
      -   Two way communication channels were never really set up – these depended on the
          EAC/Q and the CLDH which were never really trained to conduct such a dialogue
      -   Linkages with the M&E system which could have provided ample content and messages
          were never really established
      -   The key indicators did not really pick up impacts of the communication program: the
          only Bank indicator was „decisions of governance bodies published‟.
      -   Overall, the activity raised awareness of INDH to some extent but did not achieve the
          objectives of reducing the costs of access to information, ensuring high levels of

    The evaluation of this component is based on a working paper by Anwar Soulami




                                                   47
transparency, or establishing a two way dialogue between the actors, above all between
„beneficiaries‟, governance bodies and project sponsors.




                                     48
Lessons and recommendations

2.98. Phase II should clearly build on the rather disappointing results of the Phase I
communication sub-component by drawing up a real communications strategy capable of
achieving the objectives of transparency and accountability by:

              -    Sending clear messages by a variety of media,
              -    Linking to the M&E system to communicate key information,
              -    Establishing mechanisms for two way communication,
              -    Experimenting with new products such as a „success stories‟ series, a blog,
              -    Assigning a dedicated budget to communications,
              -    Establishing an approachable „complaints procedure‟.

                         5. Overall Outcome of the Cross-Cutting Component

2.99. The targeted outcome of the cross-cutting component was: the Provincial Competitive
Fund (PCF) is used in a transparent manner to leverage investments made at the local level; and
institutional capacity for implementation is strengthened at all levels. The specific targets and
latest actuals are shown in the table below:

                                                TARGETING

2.100. The anomalies of urban targeting are well described in the PAD (pp. 49 ff). The absence
of clear criteria for the cross-cutting component left open a large margin for judgment by the
provincial committees that administered the program.

2.101. The Completion Mission recommended that beneficiary targeting should be sharpened
for Phase II in the following ways: (1) to include poor douar in non-target rural communes; (2)
better targeting and less subjective judgment for the urban component; (3) bring the unit of




                                                       49
planning for the vulnerability component down to the provincial level; and (4) be more restrictive
and normative on criteria of eligibility for the cross-cutting component.


                        MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)
                     DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND UTILIZATION

M&E design

2.102. M&E design was thorough, and throughout the PAD emphasis is put on the importance
of M&E not only as a mechanism for tracking and improving INDH performance and for
measuring achievements against targets, but also as a key element in two-way communication
with beneficiaries.

2.103. The design of M&E for the vulnerability component was particularly demanding,
requiring that a baseline be established through a diagnostic and vulnerability mapping, to be
updated every two years as a gauge of progress. Quantitative and participatory surveys of
providers and users were to measure how far the needs of the target population were being met, as
well as degrees of satisfaction with services.

2.104. The basic M&E design set up was that the CLDH would collect quantitative and financial
data on implementation and on key outcome indicators; the DAS would collate the information at
provincial level and input it to a „robust and well-designed web-based information system‟; and
the CN would consolidate the data in the MIS. Periodic surveys were to be conducted. ONDH
was to be responsible for independent evaluation.

2.105. For the Bank, indicators were selected to measure both use and process. There was,
however, no indicator for benefits e.g. number of beneficiaries, increase in incomes; nor for
efficiency e.g. cost of infrastructure, quality of infrastructure.

2.106. INDH set up an M&E system, with officers responsible both in the CN and in all 70 DAS.
Over time, a flow of information on implementation resulted, allowing the CN to prepare good
progress reports. However, from the outset, it emerged that the M&E design was overambitious,
and this proved a handicap throughout the Project period. The big lacunae were:

        There was no monitoring of the efficiency of infrastructure implementation: The costs
         and unit rates of individual sub-projects, the quality of infrastructure, and the adequacy of
         provisions for maintenance were not monitored, so that key parameters of efficiency and
         sustainability could not be tracked.
        Information on outcomes was not collected: The MIS followed project implementation,
         but not post-completion operations or outcomes. As a result, at the end of the Project
         there is little information other than Bank supervision reports and other donor
         assessments about where the 22,000 sub-projects fall on the spectrum of usefulness or
         sustainability, a significant shortcoming.
        There was no mechanism for beneficiaries to report systematically on implementation,
         usage and satisfaction. There was virtually no feedback from beneficiaries on project
         implementation or results, nor on the participatory process itself, so that it is hard to
         judge quality.
        The specific, elaborate M&E provisions for the vulnerability component were not
         activated
        The web-based system is only partly operational: Only 30% of DASS have access to the
         INDH Intranet.
        The reports of the ONDH are largely neglected

2.107. INDH also commissioned qualitative surveys and impact evaluations in 2009 and 2011.
Only summary results from the 2009 and 2011 qualitative surveys are so far available (see the
box below), together with some highly favorable findings from a 2011 attitude survey (see Annex
7). The impact evaluation is expected to provide key information on welfare gains (see box
below).

                               Some results of the 2009 qualitative survey

GoM with Bank support is carrying out an impact evaluation comparing changes in conditions in 62 INDH
targeted rural communes with 61 rural communes that are very nearly as poor but are not covered by
INDH. A baseline study was conducted in 2009 with a first follow up survey in 2011, with results expected
in early 2012. The evaluation is designed to show: (i) whether INDH has made a difference in household
revenues and expenditures; (ii) changes in participation of households in collective activities; (iii) use of
and satisfaction with public services and infrastructure; and (iv) changes in nutrition, health and education

M&E utilization

2.107. The progress reports produced by the CN since 2008 are a first class source of
information on INDH implementation and outputs. They give government and donors a clear
picture of progress. However, they contain little information on outcomes, and little critical
evaluation. The CN and the DASs have also prepared excellent PowerPoint presentations on
progress.

2.108. By and large, M&E data are being used only partially to inform decision taking and
resource allocation. The data are used in the annual guidance letter sent by the Minister of the
Interior to the walis and governors. However, in general information flows up, but not back
down, and much reporting is essentially oriented towards donor requirements as well as to
government‟s needs to oversee implementation and disbursement progress, rather than to the
interests of beneficiaries or managers. There is generally little or no comprehensive information
available at the CLDH level or below. There is no post-completion tracking of projects. CN is
not fully responsive to ONDH reports or to many mission recommendations. Recommendations
for improving M&E in Phase II are listed in the box below.

                                Recommendations for Phase II on M&E

By and large, M&E data are not being used to inform decision taking and resource allocation.
Recommendations are:

        - improve the quality and relevance of data, including more hard quantitative data (may need a top
        level consultant)
        - clean and confirm baselines for Phase II as part of the appraisal package

Information flows up, but not back down, and much reporting is essentially oriented towards donor
requirements rather than those of beneficiaries or managers, who would be able to use the data to check
progress against benchmarks and comparators for their projects and ILDH local development plans.
Recommendations are:

        - agree on a simplified and unique M&E framework for government and donors
        - training for management and beneficiaries on how to use M&E

There is no post-completion tracking of projects. Recommendations are:

        - establish a simple results and O&M monitoring system (1-2 indicators per project), combined
        with participatory M&E – see below
        - World Bank should multiply its already extensive program of site visits to sub-projects,
        particularly as more and more completed sub-projects come on stream

There is no mechanism for beneficiaries to report systematically on implementation, usage and satisfaction,
and there is weak understanding and capacity amongst beneficiaries and local CLDH committees regarding
the benefits of good M&E in terms of transparency and accountability. Recommendations are:

        - strengthen and generalize participatory M&E
        - integrate M&E into the communications strategy
        - set up grievance procedures

The CN coordination unit is not always responsive to ONDH reports or to mission recommendations. The
recommendation is:

        - continue and improve impact evaluation with increased transparency i.e. broad dissemination and

        discussion of results

                    SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

Environment

2.109. INDH was classed as a Category B project, and most sub-projects were expected to have
a positive environmental outcome. Negative impacts were expected to be neither significant nor
irreversible. The EMP defined the screening process, and simple tools were incorporated into the
operational manuals, together with a list of generic mitigating measures.

2.110. Environmental screening only began in 2008, with training and piloting of the screening
mechanism for each sub-project. From 2009, screening became systematic. In that year, 52 sub-
projects (4% of the total) were rejected on environmental grounds, while 61 projects were
approved which had a positive impact on the environment. However, the proposed campaign of
training and environmental awareness raising was not carried out. As a result, levels of
awareness of decision-making bodies, support agencies (including the DAS) and beneficiaries
have remained low. Some sub-projects carried out were not in conformity with national
environmental regulations, whilst some rejected sub-projects could still have been implemented if
minor mitigation measures had been incorporated.

2.111. Overall, the judgment of the Bank‟s safeguards team is that the project was compliant
with the Bank‟s environmental safeguards. There is nonetheless still a strong need to mainstream
environment through training and awareness raising, and to improve procedures for
environmental screening and promotion (see the box below).

Resettlement

2.112. An agreed RSF was included in the Operational Manuals. Most sub-projects were
expected to have no major negative impacts in terms of physical or economic displacement, due
to their generally small size. Land acquisition and resettlement screening was, however, slow to
be implemented and was only mainstreamed in sub-project selection in 2008 after the CN
launched training and information campaigns on the subject. At project completion, local
awareness of OP 4.12 issues had been raised and screening was systematic. Nonetheless, local
INDH staff, particularly within the DASs, continued to express the need for training and
information on social safeguards. Overall, the judgment of the Bank‟s safeguards team is that the
project was compliant with the Bank‟s resettlement requirements, but with recommendations for
improvement in Phase II (see the box below).


       Recommendations for Phase II on environment, resettlement and other social aspects

    Conduct a sample environmental audit on existing sub-projects in order to assess impacts and to
    propose an improved EMP for Phase II, which should include training and awareness raising

    Work out the terms of a partnership agreement to involve the Department of the Environment

    Activate an „environment innovation team‟ to advise the CN on continual improvements in
    environmental screening and promotion

    Factor in climate change impacts and mitigation measures



                                                   54
    Implement a more systematic training and information program on social safeguards

    Take a proactive approach on OP 4.12 issues by targeting more INDH funds to slum upgrading and
    resettlement

Procurement

2.113. Procurement arrangements had to take account of the fact that although some key
procurement would be undertaken by experienced central government agencies, the vast majority
of expenditures would be on numerous sub-projects executed at the decentralized level by a range
of public and private agencies.

2.114. The procurement capacity assessment carried out at appraisal found generally adequate
capacity in public agencies, but that roles, responsibilities and work flow needed to be clarified
and capacity built for decentralized operations. A Manual of Fiduciary Procedures set out
procurement rules and capacity requirements for project sponsors, following clear shopping,
community contracting and national competitive bidding procedures. Overall, risk for
procurement was assessed at appraisal as „average‟. The QAE assessment rated risks as „high‟,
and suggested that more prior review and ex post control would have been appropriate.

2.115. In implementation, procurement handling was transparent, with no major breaches of the
rules. No fraud or corruption issues were reported. However, post-reviews indicated that
national procedures were generally used in preference to the specific procedures set out in the
Manual, the quality and monitoring controls envisaged at preparation were not fully implemented,
and the performance of the central procurement supervision unit was „weak, scattered and not
service oriented‟ (QALP). Training was not adequately carried out, procurement planning was
weak, and there was inadequate response to recommendations from the Bank supervision team.
The follow-up project will provide an opportunity to learn from this mixed experience (see the
box below). Overall, the judgment of the Bank‟s fiduciary team is that despite these weaknesses,
procurement performance was satisfactory.


                           Recommendations for Phase II on procurement

          More use of national procedures

          Introduction of a simplified procurement tracking system

          More focused capacity building and an annual procurement training program

          Simplified national procedures for expense commitments („engagement des dépenses‟)

          Appraisal of sub-project sponsors‟ procurement capacity as an integral part of sub-project
          selection procedures

Financial management

2.116. The financial management challenge at appraisal was to devise a system that could cope
with the wide range of financial management capacities of numerous, as yet unidentified, project
sponsors. The solution adopted was to develop simple INDH-specific financial management
regulations and procedures in a manual, to put in place capacity building and a monitoring and
reporting system, and to develop ex post controls and external audit requirements. A fiduciary


                                                   55
innovation team was to track progress, conduct assessments and respond to emerging problems.
An annual performance audit was to assess efficiency. Appraisal assessed overall risk as
„significant to high‟, given the risks inherent in working through numerous untried sponsor
agencies. The QAE assessment concurred with the approach, and underlined the reality of risks
given that agreed safeguard measures were only slowly being implemented.

2.117. Implementation was largely satisfactory. Although delayed and never conducted
annually as originally intended, performance audits were conducted, and internal audit procedures
were satisfactorily introduced. Weak points were inadequate capacity building, the late activation
of the fiduciary innovation team, and lax follow up on audit recommendations. No corruption
issues were reported, an outcome to which the transparency and civil society participation
involved in the project certainly contributed. Nonetheless, genuine third party monitoring and the
implementation of the agreed grievance procedures would have further strengthened confidence.
The follow-up project will allow these accomplishments to be consolidated and strengthened (see
the box below). Overall, the judgment of the Bank‟s fiduciary team is that despite delays,
financial management, reporting and auditing were satisfactory.


                         Recommendations for Phase II on financial management

         Simplify community management of funds („CAS communautaire‟)

         Strengthen internal audit at the decentralized level, and integrate internal audit into all
         agreements with sub-project sponsors

         Further simplify financial management procedures and the procedures manual

         Maintain and strengthen the Fiduciary Innovation Team, and promote exchange of best
         practices

         Develop a systematic program of continuing training and capacity building

            Strengthen arrangements for third party monitoring and grievance procedures


SUSTAINING INDH INNOVATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY

2.117. The Completion Mission noted two sets of recommendations for improving sustainability.
First, recommendations for sustaining investments made under Phase I:

         There is a need for follow up, M&E and reporting on sub-projects over five year post-
          completion period
         Bank should evaluate a sample of sub-projects as part of the preparation of Phase II and
          make recommendations for more sustainable arrangements
         There has to be more systematic consideration of O&M etc. from the beginning, with
          the standard use of conventions, more engagement of beneficiaries through associations
          etc.
         A particular follow up by a specialized organization for income generating activities
          (AGRs) is recommended
         Specific measures may be needed for drinking water, with adequate levels of local cost
          recovery



                                                       56
2.118. Second, Government is strongly committed to sustaining INDH, and in June 2011, the
King announced Phase II with a doubling of the budget. The Bank has again been invited to
partner Morocco on the program. This will provide a first rate opportunity to build in key areas
for sustaining and strengthening the INDH where the Bank could add value. Completion Mission
recommendations for key areas for sustaining and strengthening the INDH where the Bank could
add value in Phase II design included:

        Strengthening local actors and governance, and improving targeting
        Reinforcing the participatory process and strengthening integrated planning:
         organization at douar/neighborhood level; the role, status, powers and resources of the
         EAC/Q; and the ILDH and integration with local level strategic planning (PCDs)
        M&E, communications, learning and innovation: participatory M&E, grievance
         procedures
        Revenue raising activities: helping INDH to move beyond infrastructure and services
         towards more effective mechanisms for boosting income streams
        Improving the sustainability of sub-projects across the board
        Strengthening capacity building: governance bodies, support agencies, project sponsors
         (NGOs, community associations…)
        The vulnerability component: improving the professionalism of actors and the cost-
         effectiveness of sub-projects

Cost-effectiveness7

3.1.     Limited observations during Bank supervision and the Completion Mission suggest that
project implementation and the quality of infrastructure have been of mixed quality, mostly good.
On the basis of a very small sample, 75% of infrastructure projects were found to be of good
quality, and 25% of moderate quality. Costs were about 20% lower than usual costs for public
contracts, although the explanation for this appears to be largely lower standards or lower quality
of works rather than efficiency gains. There was no information or follow up on standard costs.
Sustainability was a concern, with limited provision for maintenance, with particular concern for
drinking water, urban cleansing, and social care centers. During the stakeholder workshops (see
Annex 6), some participants said that the cost-effectiveness of vulnerability component
investments was sometimes doubtful.

3.2.    The Completion Mission team made the following recommendations for Phase II on
efficiency:

        Increased and more effective coordination (convergence) among the various institutions
         (national and partners) is fundamental.
        Support to AGRs must be based on the actual challenges and opportunities found on the
         ground in each region.
        Define the scale and sizes for certain types of projects.
        Associate line departments throughout the design, implementation and O&M stages
        Use standard models for centers to reduce costs
        Strengthen technical follow up, and insist on following construction standards
        Use open bidding
        Develop standard costs
        Priority to low maintenance design

Economic and financial analysis of a sample of sub-projects

3.3.     The ex-ante economic and financial analysis of the INDH (Annex 9 pp. 101 ff of the
PAD) comprised: (a) a general discussion of the economic rationale for government investment in
basic infrastructure, services, income generating activities and capacity development for poor
communities; (b) a general discussion of CBD approaches as efficient and cost effective
mechanisms for investment; (c) a discussion of five factors that can maximize social rates of
return in INDH; and (d) a brief discussion of why cost benefit analysis could be applied only to
the income generating activities of the INDH and not to other components.

3.4.     For the ICR, the economic and financial analysis was conducted on a sample of fifty sub-
projects. A summary of the study is included in the main body of the ICR (Section 3.3). A précis
of the study is featured below. The full text of the analysis is in Project Files.

    This evaluation is based on a working paper by Adel Bichara

Economic analysis of INDH Phase I

3.5.     Projects were selected in four sectoral groups: (1) income generating activities; (2)
infrastructure; (3) social service provision; and (4) aid to the vulnerable. The sample was spread
across urban areas, small towns, mountain areas, the oases, the highlands and the plains.

3.6.     For income generating activities and for infrastructure, an internal rate of return (IRR)
was calculated. For social service provision, „effective use‟ was taken as proxy for the IRR. For
aid to the vulnerable, either IRR or „net benefit transfer‟, or expert opinion were employed, as
appropriate.

3.7.    Of the fourteen income generating activities assessed, half (7 projects) had unsatisfactory
IRRs, ranging from negative to 8%. Three projects had been abandoned. The remaining seven
projects hade IRRs ranging from 12 to 14%, including three projects rated „excellent‟ in terms of
poverty reduction impact and sustainability.

3.8.    For the infrastructure projects, the average IRR was 12.3%, and smaller projects with
lower investment requirements performed better. The breakdown was:

                              IRR of infrastructure projects in the different sectors

                Sector                                           Min                Max

3.9.    The social services projects had a wide range of results, with very varying rates of use.
One weakness was the tendency to prioritize projects that brought services close to the population,
neglecting alternatives based on critical mass of beneficiaries and improvements in transport and
access: for example, school boarding houses or nursing homes for pregnant women were
constructed, where improving transport links or access to better equipped centers could have been
more cost effective.

3.10. For the aid to the vulnerable, the evaluation was complicated by the lack of set norms.
The better performing centers tended to be those with innovative approaches, particularly those
providing more for field and home visits and services rather than classic „in-patient approaches‟.
The key factors of success were the quality of the sponsors and the level of integration into the
local community.

5.1.     No Beneficiary Survey was conducted. However, government with Bank support is
carrying out an impact evaluation comparing changes in conditions in 62 INDH targeted rural
communes with 61 rural communes that are very nearly as poor but are not covered by INDH. A
baseline study was conducted in 2009 with a first follow up survey in 2011, with results expected
in early 2012. The evaluation is designed to show: (i) whether INDH has made a difference in
household revenues and expenditures; (ii) changes in participation of households in collective
activities; (iii) use of and satisfaction with public services and infrastructure; and (iv) changes in
nutrition, health and education status.

                     Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


6.1.     Over a three day period (May 30-31 and June 1, 2011) three workshops were held to
listen to the appreciations of beneficiaries and other INDH partners. Over 150 participants spoke
openly and vocally both in plenary sessions and in thematic group sessions.

Overall results

6.2.     The benefits of INDH have been considerable, with a noticeable improvement in the lives
of the target population, and a strengthening of community social capital and of institutions at all
levels, particularly in the NGO sector. There is a need to capitalize all the hard-won lessons of
Phase I as a basis for Phase II. Many things in Phase I went well, many improved over time, and
some went less well. Phase I needs an impact‟ evaluation and Phase II should be built on the
findings. Based on the results, improvements should be built into the four components, and the
capacity building, communications and M&E programs of Phase II should be built around the
findings. Three particular themes ran through the workshops:

        - There is a need to strengthen the participatory process to better include the poor and
        disadvantaged. The poorest and most marginalized may not have the priority in resource
        allocation which was intended. This is largely due to the inadequacy of the participatory
        process which should help the target population argue for their needs. Better off areas
        and groups were perceived to be more able to organize and to present good projects. The
        recommendations were: (1) to strengthen the participatory process; and (2) to pay special
        attention to strengthening of the institutions of the poor such as local area associations.
        This would compensate for a perceived bias towards the projects sponsored by the
        stronger NGOs, which trended to be „top down‟ and to reflect the interests – or at least
        the attitudes - of the better off.
        - There are concerns over project quality and sustainability. These need to be addressed
        through: (1) a diagnostic of what are the causes; and (2) strengthened measures in Phase
        II.
        - There are problems of overlap and incoherence with line ministry programs i.e. the
        classic problem of convergence. Recommendations were to: (1) reactivate the national
        program for improving convergence and push for decentralization – or at least
        deconcentration; (2) associate line ministries in all levels of INDH governance bodies;
        and (3) reconcile local development plans such as the PDCs with the ILDHs.

Rural and urban components

6.3. There are clear and beneficial results. A number of areas need improvement.

6.4.   The really disadvantaged lack the means of accessing INDH. For example, they do not
have strong representative associations. The EAC/Q are not properly equipped to be the
animators and facilitators of community driven development. Particularly in urban areas, projects
tend to go to the better off, who are the best capable of presenting persuasive projects.
Recommendations were:

        - EAC/Q to be full time professionals properly trained and equipped
        Capacity building focus to be on the development of local social capital and associations
        Targeting procedures for urban areas to be improved



                                                64
6.5.   Project quality is very variable, and there is a lack of proper follow-up during
implementation and operation. Recommendations were:

        - Standardize appraisal criteria, perhaps in a „project preparation manual‟
        Provide for technical support to preparation and supervision, for which provision could
        be made in project budgets
        Strengthen EAC/Q capacity for follow-up
        Extend support and M&E well beyond the project construction period to cover the first
        years of operation

6.6.   Conflicts of interest arise, with project sponsors doubling as members of CLDHs and as
EAC/Q.

Vulnerability

6.7.    An excellent component which has greatly improved access for the vulnerable; led to
professionalization of social services; and helped the NGO sector to „flower‟. Critique and
suggested improvements were:

Investments did not always meet real needs. For Phase II:

        - The needs assessment should be updated, with a much more „bottom up‟ approach,
        including full participation of the CLDHs and the EAC/Q
        - The classification of the „vulnerable‟ should be reviewed and probably enlarged as there
        were populations not captured
        - Service standards should be set in relation to Law 14-05, but not so high that service
        delivery becomes too expensive
        - Communications on the program should be greatly improved

6.8.    Cost-effectiveness of investments and the quality of services was sometimes doubtful. For
Phase II:

        - Norms and criteria for project selection should be standardized, and project selection
        and implementation should be speeded up
        - Sub-project implementation and management should be improved through professional
        follow up and capacity building
        - Sustainability should be reinforced through general adoption of multi-annual
        contracting and financing plans
        - M&E should be strengthened, with clear indicators, and should continue for at least five
        years after physical implementation is complete
        - The ownership of INDH-financed assets should be regularized, in line with sustainable
        arrangements for operation and financing.




                                               65
6.9.    Capacity of actors in the social sectors has improved but remains quite weak. For Phase
II:

        - A coherent long term strategy for training social workers and associations should be
        prepared
        - The capacity of associations for self-financing should strengthened

The competitive fund

6.10. Overall, results have been good, with real improvement in the lives of the target
population and improved capacity of communities to take charge of their own development. The
main problems raised were the poor quality of proposals, and the related difficulty of the
marginalized to prepare acceptable proposals due to the weakness of their capacity and
institutions and the lack of guidance for preparation, implementation and operation.
Recommendations were:

        - Improve the project cycle by adding (1) a pre-selection stage based on project ideas; (2)
        support to project preparation, including a possible fund to help prepare projects; and (3)
        follow up and „hand-holding‟ during implementation and operation..
        - Delegate these support functions to professional partners (for example to AMSED,
        ADS…). One idea was that these professional partners could group several projects for
        approval in a package for which they would take responsibility.
        - Improve communications, training and capacity building, aimed particularly at the
        really poor and marginalized to form associations and to prepare projects
        - Conduct M&E of results, not just of technical and financial aspects of implementation

Capacity building

6.11. The activity has had generally positive results, and the focus on associations and on local
actors has been good. Delivery through contracted service providers has been efficient.
Problems raised were:

Too much training has been ad hoc, not always adapted to need, and there has been no impact
evaluation. For Phase II, recommendations were:
             A needs assessment should be conducted, and this should drive a long term
                training strategy
             The assessment and the training programs should be specific by province and
                local area, adapted to real needs
             A dedicated training budget should be put in place

There has been no capitalization of training modules etc. Recommendations were:
            Networking of training institutions

Communications

6.12.   Communications was characterized as ‘the weakest link’. Recommendations were:
            There is a need for an integrated communications strategy with a dedicated
             budget
            Other institutions, especially NGOs, should be partners in communication
            It is essential to establish „two way‟ communication„



                                               66
M&E

6.13. The results are not accessible or usable, and are limited to outputs. For Phase II,
recommendations were:

               There is a need for M&E of results and of impacts. The EAC/Q has a capital role
                to play in this and should be trained and equipped to do it.
               A simplified reporting system in Arabic is needed, and this should form the basis
                of a genuine dialogue. The communications team should support this work.

Environment

6.14.   Environmental aspects are poorly integrated into INDH. Recommendations were:

               Mainstream environment into INDH, including involving environment agencies
                in the governance bodies
               Simple environmental assessment tools need to be introduced, and training and
                communications are required

      Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and Borrower’s comments on Draft ICR


       A. INDH Completion Report 2005-2010 prepared by the Borrower: May 2011

                          A summary translation prepared by the Bank

Context

7.1. The context is set by the ambitious development vision of the Moroccan state, which targets
economic development and human development alongside one another as complements. The
INDH is a very specifically Moroccan program that combines development, democracy and
citizens‟ participation, and in which human development and poverty reduction are measured
more by empowerment than by incomes and consumption.

7.2. The ICR is a forward-looking document that shows the areas of improvement needed for
Phase II, drawing in particular from the attitude survey carried out (see the appendix Enquete de
perception at the end of this annex).

Operational experience

7.3.    Overall, INDH has achieved its objectives. After 2005, which was a special „priority
program‟, INDH moved swiftly to full scale, implementing 22,000 sub-projects. Leverage was
very high, with 41% of financing coming from non-INDH sources, although in the rural
component leverage was only 24%, the lowest for any component. The cross-cutting component
had the most sub-projects, with 9,032. In the rural and urban components, equipment and
services were the preferred choice. In the vulnerability component, the reception centers were far
and away the largest component.

7.4.     Training was carried out on a huge scale 2005-8, but the program was not well integrated
into the overall INDH program. From 2009, a true „training engineering‟ approach was adopted,
with an integrated approach, standardized tools, local training plans, evaluation, and an annual
planning adapted to needs.

7.5.    Numerous communications activities were carried out, including an international forum
at Agadir in November 2010. Achievements include: wide ownership; embedding of the
participatory approach; training at all levels, including EAC/Q, in communications. A strategy
for local communications was developed in 2007. The next step is local two way
communications programs.

7.6.    The budget was targeted. Budget commitment and payment levels were a disbursement
condition, and they were all met.

Evaluation

7.7.    Evaluation has been intensive, and the results are positive. By 2010, the attitude survey
tool had been fine-tuned, and it was comprehensive and scientific. The impacts reported on
beneficiary capacity and confidence was all entirely positive.




                                               68
7.8.         The DAS report the following areas that may need strengthening:

        -     Weak partner involvement (local ministry offices, elected officials, the local councils…)
        -     Lack of resources for the DAS
        -     The need to ease financial procedures in order to facilitate disbursement
        -     Need to improve the income generating component, and to expand it
        -     Need to increase participation of women and youth in the governance bodies
        -     The need to improve and update targeting
        -     Measures required for more sustainability of projects and O&M budgets
        -     Need for continued M&E of sub-projects after physical completion

7.9.     The governance bodies were generally favorable to the tripartite composition and the
three hierarchic levels, even though there sometimes conflicts between levels. There is a need to:
      - Strengthen governance capacity and provide more training
      - Open up to more diverse participation, including more women and youth participation

7.10.         The EAC/Q were favorable to the project but reported that:
            - It was hard to mobilize the very poor and the most vulnerable groups and to respond to
              their needs
            - Logistical support was inadequate
            - Local institutions and agencies were not always supportive

Role of the World Bank

7.11. World Bank support has been valuable in providing technical assistance, in improving
performance, and in bringing in other partners. The difference between the „before the project‟
assessment by the Bank and the INDH today shows the results. Before the INDH, there was a
centralized approach to development which left little room for participation; there was no
integrated approach to poverty reduction; targeting was inadequate; and local decision makers
had little power.

7.12. The Bank has helped to create a culture of collective on the job learning. Despite the
achievements, there have been some tensions with the Bank, particularly regarding their role, and
the value of the inputs has been affected by the periodic changes of mission staff. Also, the size
and frequency of Bank missions has placed a burden on the CN, which has to host and support all
missions.

INDH structures

7.13. These have been well designed and effective. The innovation teams were helpful in
preparing the manuals and tools, and in implementation.

Strengths of the INDH

7.14.        The main strengths of the INDH have been:

        -     The participatory approach of bottom-up diagnostic and programming is well anchored
        -     NGOs have been full partners and have been strengthened
        -     The participation of women has grown




                                                    69
        -  Sub-project and Project ownership is strong, and the process has strengthened and
           empowered communities
        - Poverty has been reduced
        - Good governance has been achieved through the governance bodies and INDH
           transparency
        - The population has been empowered through income-generating projects
          Confidence and dignity have been enhanced

Weaknesses and measures to strengthen:

7.15.               Sustainability is sometimes questionable. This should be resolved by:
            -          Cost/benefit analysis carried out systematically for each sub-project
            -          Setting standards for O&M and following up
            -          The generalization of multi-year contracts and of delegated management contracts
            -          Government subsidies should be negotiated, against results

7.16.          Lack of ‘convergence’ remains a problem. Solutions include:
            - Continue with plans for „deconcentration‟ and for decentralization
            - Harmonization between ILDH, PDC etc.

7.17.               The program for income-generating projects needs to be improved by:

                -     Adopting a value-chain approach
                -     Reviving the participation of microfinance bodies
                -     Paying more attention to marketing

7.18.               M&E has not met expectations. Measures to improve include:
            -       More performance-oriented M&E
            -       Setting up standard performance indicators for sub-projects
            -       Ensuring follow up after the completion of physical works
            -       Participatory M&E

7.19. The development of the NGO sector has been impressive but their role needs to be
strengthened by:
      - More targeted capacity building
      - Promoting networking amongst NGOs
      - Permanent support and follow up to NGOs

                B. Borrower’s comments on an earlier draft of the ICR
                      (comments taken into account in the final version)

7.20. The Borrower wrote to the Bank on December 27th, 2011 conveying some comments on
an earlier draft of the ICR. The letter is on file. Highlights include:

7.21. All external partners, but particularly the Bank, contributed significantly to the INDH
financially and technically and also in terms of processes.

7.22. The ICR should take account of the characteristically Moroccan nature of the INDH and
its central place in the process of political, economic and social reforms that the nation is
undertaking. In this sense, INDH is much more than just a CDD fund.

7.23. The Government accepts that targeting is tricky in so vast a project and with so
heterogeneous a beneficiary population. For this reason, we are taking account of the lessons of
the first phase to refine the targeting criteria and broaden the range of target sites and
beneficiaries in the second phase.

7.24. The Government acknowledges that the income generating activities provided as much
learning as results and these lessons are being well incorporated into the second phase.

7.25. Likewise, the Government is aware of the need for a well-performing M&E system, and
we acknowledge the contributions of the Bank during supervision in this regard. Nonetheless, the
system has been adequate to satisfy the requirements of the Bank in respect of disbursements.

7.26. The Government feels that the draft could have given more consideration to the role of
the audits and inspections.

7.27. The Government underlines that INDH has always been open to all valid suggestions
formulated by various missions and by the ONDH, and that these have been well integrated in
flexible changes conveyed by our annual instruction notes.

7.28. Overall, the Government would like to see more balance in the final version of the ICR,
and a better recognition of the extraordinary achievements of INDH in the face of the enormous
challenges.

8.1.    The European Union wrote to the Bank on January 12th, 2012 conveying some comments
on an earlier draft of the ICR. The letter is on file. The principal message was that the EU‟s own
analysis confirms the key points made in the draft, and particularly the aspects of quality and
sustainability of sub-projects, the importance of convergence, and the performance of capacity
building activities. Some minor suggestions for improvement of the text were also made, and
these have been incorporated in the final version of the ICR.
