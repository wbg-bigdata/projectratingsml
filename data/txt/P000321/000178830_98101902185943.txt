INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENr
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of
US$9.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for education.
PART I - THE SEONOMY
2.          The most recent report on the Cameroon Economy, "Current Economic
Situation and Prospects of the Republic of Cameroon" (in five volumes, R71-4,
-11, -18, and -53), was distributed to the Executive Directors seriatim start-
ing on January 8, 1971. The report of the updating mission which visited Cameroon
in November 1971 was discussed with the Government in May, 1972 and will be
distributed to the Executive Directors in early July, 1972. A note on the
economy dated January 12, 1972 (updated) and country data are included in Annex II
PART II  - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
3.          The Bank uroup's commitments in Cameroon now total $70.8 million.
The loans and credits outstanding cover eight projects -- three in agriculture,
three in transport, and one each in education and public utilities. Implement-
ation has been generally satisfactory, although considerable delays have occur-
red in executing some projects. Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1972 and notes on the execution of on-
going projects.
4.          The 3Bnk Group's strategy is designed to support Cameroon's Third
Five-Year Plan (1971/72 - 1975/76). Although the very high level of total in-
vestment indicated for the Third Plan period may be optimistic, the sector
goals and priorities which the Government has set for the economy are justified.
The Third Plan allocates 32Z of public sector investment to transport and 13%
to agriculture and rural development. Investment in roads, railways, and ports
is essential if Cameroon is to realize its export potential in diversified
cash crops, forest products, and minerals; investment in transport will also
serve the needs of the adjacent land-locked countries. Assistance to agriculture
is needed since 65Z of the population depends on cash and subsistence crops
for a livelihood, and since there are viable projects dhich will increase
exports and the incomes of small farmers. The Bank Group is complementing
the Government's plans by financing transport, agriculture and education.



-2-
Since France and the European Economic Commuxnity (EEC) are major sources
of foreign assistance to Cameroon, the Bank will continue to collaborate
-with them and, from time to time, invest jointly with them. (For a summary
of the main current and prospective sources of external finance see para
15 of Annex II).
5.          Bank projects currently under preparation include a road project
which will help complete the Trans-Cameroon route, a cocoa project for small-
holders, a railway re-alignment and renewal project, a large expansion of
Douala's port, and a livestock project in a thinly populated area in the
north-central part of the country. It is hoped that the road and cocoa projects
will be ready for presentation to the Executive Directors in FY-73 while the
railway, port, and livestock projects wrould be for FY-74 (the preparation of
the railiway, port, and road projects is included in earlier Bank Group financing
of projects in those sub-sectors).
6.          Bank Group lending accounts for a very smnall proportion of
Cameroonts external debt of about U3`230 million, for only $23.3 million out
of $70.8 million in commitments has been disbursed so far. Total public debt
service is currently estimated to be 5.0% of projected export earnings; this
ratio is expected to rise to about 6.5% by 1975/76. The Third Five-Year Plan
calls for a gross investment of CFAF 280 billion (US;`l.l billion), of which
it is calculated that CFAF 200 billion will be forthcoming, broken doim as
follows: CFAF 100 billion private sector, and CFIF 100 billion public sector
(CFAF 36 billion from -the Government and public institutions, and CFAF 64
billion in foreign assistance). It is assamLed t1ia-c about 40% of foreign aid
will be in the form of grants. Since the Third Plan is much higher than the
Second Plan and since tne other major lenders, France and the EEC, are not
expected to increase thieir assistance, Bank lending could rise to close to
40% of all aid commitments made during the Third Plan period. The Bank Group's
share of total external debt, accumulated as of 1975/76, would then be about
40% with the Bank's share of debt service being estuimated at 26-1 at that time.
PARMT III  - EDUC.ITION IT CAI-EROON
7.          The complex adminis5rative and socio-political structure of
Cameroon, a result of its dual Anglo-French colonial hliszory, poses serious
obstacles -to creating a modern educational system capable of meeting the
country's needs. English-speaking  ;est Caneroon and French-soeakinc !ast
Cameroon, che two states of the republic, innerited educational systems
having marked differences in administracion, stracture, curricula and
language of instruction. These differences remain obstacles to an integrated
national educational system. Despite able federal and state ministerial
personnel, there has been insufficient coordination bet:ieen the public and
private authorities responsible -for education at the federal, state, and
local levels. As a result, there has been uncontrolled enrollment grotith,
sharply mounting expenses, lov: efficiency, and uneven regional standards.
rne successful iHay 20 referendun creating a United ,He-public is expected to
alleviate some of these conditions by centralizing the administration of
education.
8.          The desire for education is so strong in many areas that private
schools have expanded rapidly to meet -the demand 7nhich the federal and state



governments could not satisfy. The important role of private education at
primary and secondary levels makes effective educational planning and con-
trolled development difficult. This is particularly the case in ';Iest Cameroon
where, for instance, all primary schools and all but one of twelve primary
teacher training colleges are private, and 86% of all secondary enrollments
are in private institutions. In East Cameroon, 43% of primary and 65% of
secondar-y enrollments are in private schools. Although the teaching staffs
of priva-te schools are paid by public funds, private schools are not under
the effective control of the state and federal governments which suppor-t them.
9.          The maintenance of this system requires substantial public funds.
The responsibility for financing education is divided between (a) the Federal
Government which is responsible for financing construction materials for
primary schools and all capital and recurrent expenditures at secondary and
post-secondaryr levels, and (b) the state governments which are responsible
for minor construction for primary schools and the recurrent costs of primary
education, primary teacher training, and the vocational 'raining schemes of
various ministries. In 1969/70, total public educational expenditures amounted
to CF? 3.L14 billion and accounted for 20;1 of -the combined budgets oi' t'he then
Federal, East and .Jest Cameroon Governments, or 3" of GDP.
10.         Besides the structural problems anld the financial burden of the
education systeem described above, Cameroon has an immediate need for trained
technicians and skilled workers to meet it's economic targets over the next
decade. Shortages of such workers became increasingly apparent in the late
1960's when industry and commerce grew rapidly. Mloreover, a large proportion
o-f the professional (853%) and sub-professional ()46%) staff are expatriates.
The current vocational and technical education system is unable to produce
sufficient and appropriately trained nunbers of workers needed i* modern
industry and commerce. For this reason, the Government is placing emphasis
in its present planming on expanding and im-proving vocational and technical
traininrg. It .ould also like to draut up specific plans for training agricultura
personnel, but at the present time there is neither a siuficiently defined
policy nor any precise data on which to build agricultural and rural traini-ng
plans.
1l.         To imeet -these problems, th'ne Government has devised an educational
development strate-r -whicih places hiighest. priorit, on creating an integrated
education syjsstem 'or thle entire countriy, and also on expanding and upgrading
education in those regions of the country iiost 1harapered by its lackl, particular
ly the NTortLhern re-ion of East Cameroon. Levels of education given mosc wseight
within this overall strategy are primary and secondar-y education .-here reform
is intended t.o provide th1e underlying iramewaork for further developmen-t of the
entire system. in effect, tnhe Government ,jants to use educat.ion as 2 means
for unifying the coun-try as -wzell as for promot-ing economic development.
12.         As sDeciific measures for reform and f.or achieving an integrated
education s-ysterm b-y l'u, the Goverrmiientc intends in its Third l'lan to (a)
introduce a unif'orm education st-ructure in East and .,est Canaroon, .o eth-er
.Aith associ.ated curricu:Lar re°ornm t' both'- primarry and secondar-y levels to
create a syrs-ten adapted to -he l ocal environmnwent and designed to mect the



requirements of a modern economy in Cameroon, (b) create a national
planning mechanism, (c) develop local administration and supervision
over schools, particularly private ones, and (d) correct regional im-
balances by strengthening education, particularly primary education and
teacher training, in the Northern region. Since higher education is
already on a federal basis, the Third Plan,with respect to higher education,
deals only with expanding enrollments. J'Iork has already started in preparing
and instituting some of these reforms.
PAR! IV - TI-E PROJECT
13.         The Association's first education project (US.410.5 million,
Credit NJo. 161-CM, signed in September, 1962) is providing technical
assistance to hielp establish a national planning department, referred to
above, to be responsible for planning all levels of education "or Eas-t
and '.est Cameroon. Eventually this department will become part of a
National Institute of Education -wihich is to be created -with possible UNDP
and bi-lateral assistance during the Third Plan period. The Association's
first education project is also assisting the Government in improving
education by expanding and upgrading: (a) primary and secondary teacher
training, (b) general and technical secondary education, and (c) agricul-
tural secondary and haigher education. Because of delays in appointing con-
sultant architects and agreeing- on designs for projec-t ins-titutions, im-
plementation is about 12 months behind schedule.
1;,.        *iile Jiis 2 irsu project is meetino thle immedia-ae needs of
,jest Cameroon, it does no' cover fully the needs of East Canieroon. :?or
this reason, a second projecc. has been proposed primarily Go meet the
additional needs of East Cameroon, buc also bo provide assisGance in
defining tile future requirement-s for education and -training 61hroughouit
the country. A UMESCO mission -co Cameroon in Tovember, 19,70 iden'cified
i-tems suitable 'or a second educaDion project. After brief. II)", reconnais-
sance missions in June and October 15)71, agreement uas reached aith-! t'Uhe
Goverrnient on the items to be prepared ir. October-.Jovember l1'9i -iritn UJESCO

undertaken .Jith the participa'ion of representatives from FA0, 310, and
UIESCO. I'legotiations ,rere held in `ashington from May- ,- to 13, 1`72 7 ith
a Cameroonian dal_e-ation led by- IIr. _;adou Bello, Director of Programs in
the Tlinistry- of Planning.
13.         The proposed project is designed: (i) to assis&i the Govenument
in implementinEg -fs general educa-cional s'Cr C.eQVr -.nd ref'orms (paras 11 and
12 above), (ii) -to meet' speci'ic needs in teacher training and in cechnilcal
educatbion, (iii) to prepare iihe groundaorlk f'or further technical education
and agricultural and i-ural lraining, particularly in th4 e lJar hern re-ion.
Its objective -rould be to -crain sksilled .or-:ers, t-eclnicians and tecIni_-cal
teacIlers in t`l5O1   areas o:i t-;e couit'ry mos-c in need of' t-hem. Thle proposed

include a center for primarzy education ref'on-a and teaching
material production;
- extension o-' one secondary teacher and primary inspector
training college (at Yaounde);
- one new demonstration upper general secondary school (Yaounde)

17.         Annex III includes a summary of tlhe project. The complete analysis
is contained in -the Appraisal Report (PE - 46a) wJhich is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. One feature of -this projec't worth noting
is the adult vocational training center in Douala w4hich will offer short train-
ing and upgrading courses (1 to   w weels) for about 2,000 employees a year in
all trades represented in local industry at semi-slilled, skilled and tech-
nician levels; a minimum of 1,500 would attend training courses organized by
the center itself and 500 .-ould at-tend special courses organized on the speciffic
request oL firs chrough the Chanber of Commerce. The center tiould be a public
institution, sponsored by thne finistry oL 1ducation and jointly managed by public
administration and private sector representatives. Ano-tuher feature of the project
is the pre-investmen-t study of agriculture and rural training. This study would
determine lhowf the existing uneconomically small public institu-tions and the
various bilateral and private training pro-rams could best be integrated. The
study would also analyze measures needed for training women in rural areas so
they can improve their agricultural practices and methods of food preserva-xVon.
The study is in principle suitable for UMDP financinig, but cannot be included
in the curren-t UIDP program for Cameroon.
18.         The timetable for project execution calls for the completion of
all school construction by the end of the fourth year after the credit becomes
effective, while technical assistance would carry -through to the end of the
sixth year.
19.         The Project Unit established under the firsb IDA credit .would also
be responsible tor supervision of -this second oroject. The Project Uni-t :7ould
include the principal postus of Project Director, Project AL-rchitect (.u.ho -Tould
also serve as Depu'y- Project Director) and Procurement Specialist, and w.ould
be provided .i:th addi-tional supporting staff. The present Projec-t Director would
remain in office but a Projec-t Architect and architectural consulth-ans, accept-
able to the Association, -o..uld be appointed. T1he Project Director .rould no-.
become res:onsible d rectlT- to t'he Hiinister of Education so tha-t so.,ie dela-s
experienced in tihe first project may be avoided. The other minislbries invol-ved
in the project- .ould desi,nato senior representatives to coordinate ;iitn -tlhe
Project Unit, as required. The Credit irould finance tihe total costs o. tGne
architect, architectural consul-t<-antus  and Procurement p3-ecialis t s ser-vices
as -well as additional eqai-2meirnt and :`ani-ture to facilitate thae Unit -s expanded
opera-tions. ,ll other Project Unit cos-ts ;ould bc borne byr the Gover 'menv. 
20.         The es-timat-ed -toal cost of the project is the eauivalent of
US ll. It million, of .ic   i the C orai _n exchla:_e conr,?onene is ,7.9 million. nhe
proposed Credit Of .o,f .0 mi.llion .ould cover tihe foreign exchlan-e coriponea:i
and .;l.l million (about one-third) of vne local costs; the re;n-Jdea. of `the
local costs woould be borne by the Govenmnent. Goods and services imporved for
th.e projec-t -would be exefrou from customs du-ties and taxes, since this is t.nle
Governme:l''t s policyr on TO)A-'inanced education projects. Local expenditures
w.iould not oe tax-exemut- and sUc.c taxes, as .lell as indirect taxes, are estniated
a, *J3o, 000. T;his imeans that the project, net of all taxes, bothi direct and
indirac-t, .rould cos-t  1.0 imillion, of whTlich IT -,.ould con-tribut-e 32,.
21.         The esti.mates of construction costs are derived from a study of



-7-
recent school building costs in Cameroon and based upon information obtained
from public and private enterprises. The average cost is equivalent to US$154 per
m2 of gross area. Local cost adjustments varying between 10% to 30% of basic
prices have been made for buildings in rural areas to compensate for transport-
ation costs.
22.         The Government has undertaken to budget funds to cover the addition-
al recurrent costus involved in the operation of the project institutions (Sec-
tions 3.01 and 4.02 of the Development Credit Agreement). In 1975/76 ,Then all
project institu!Gions and programs would be operative, an additional CFALF 250
million would be required for their operation. Tne costs for scholarships and
allowrances for the trainees, w;here applicaable, iould amount to an additional
CYAF 250 million per year. Except for half of tlhe recurrent cost of the adul-t
vocational tralning cen-ter (CFAF 16 million), which would be met by the Orivate
sector, all costs w,ould be borne by the Government and would represenu abou-t
3.8% of the public recurren-t expenditures on education in 1975.
23.         All contracts for construction and for supply of furniture and
equipment wfould be a aarded in con,ormity -with the Association's Guidelines
for int>erna-tional competitive bidding. Cameroon accords preferential duties
on imports from the EEC but all goods and services imported for this project
will be exemp-t from customs duties and local taxes, as men-tioned in para 20
above. MIanu.°acturers in Cameroon and in the Customs Ulnion of the Central A-frican
States (UDEAC) would be accorded a margin of preference equal to the existing
rate of customs duty applicable to competing imports or 15% of -the c.i.f.
prices, -whichever is lower. 'This is substantiallyj the same formula as fas
applied to procurement under tlhe first education project. From experience with
the first education project, it is probablo t,hat the only i-tem on wAhichl local
or UDEAC suppliers would be bidding competitively is ifurniture, to cost an
estii2ated i400, 000 or less than 5% of bhe proposed cred-i-t U. '-ards i-or civil
works concracts are expected to be won by locally-based constrdction firms,
;while contrac'-s for ecquipmen are expected Qo g,o to foreigin bidders.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Performance under existing loans and credits has been generally
satisfactory, though there are some difficulties.   Credit No. 100 of $11
million and Loan No. 490 of $7 million to CAMDEV both of 1967 for a plan-
tation project: Disbursemenib for this CAMDEV project are slightly behind
schedule, but neither the delays nor their causes are serious; management
requires strengthening and CAMDEV has had considerable difficulty in re-
cruiting the small number of foreign experts required.   Loan No. 604 of
$5 million to SNEC of 1969 for a water supply project: This project was
completed ahead of schedule with substantial savings which have been
approved for investment in further water distribution works; disbursements,
however, have lagged due to the strong working capital position of the
borrower; the closing date for this project has been postponed to September
30, 1972 by which time all funds are expected to have been disbursed.
Credit No. 161 of $10.5 million of 1970 for an education project: This
project is about 12 months behind schedule because of delays in appointing
consulting architects and because of necessary revisions in the proposed
designs which were accepted by the Government.   Bids were received for
construction of schools and were found to be substantially in excess of
appraisal estimates.   The Government has since negotiated a contract with
the lowest bidder for the schools in the North and the draft contract is now
within the appraisal estimates.   We are presently exploring with the Govern-
ment ways and means of lowering the cost of the schools to be constructed in
the South.   Credit No. 180 of $7 million and Loan No. 663 of $12 million
both of 1970 for a roads project: This project is about fifteen months behind
schedule, due primarily to administrative delays on the part of the imple-
menting agencies.   This problem has been reviewed with the Government on
several occasions, and three contracts for construction and two contracts
for consultant services were signed in December, 1971 and work started in
January of this year.   Loan No. 687 of $5.2 million to REGIFERCAM of 1970
for a railway project: This project is being implemented satisfactorily and
full disbursement by the closing date of June 30, 1974 is expected.   Credit
No. 229 of $1.5 million of 1971 for a port project: This project is about
nine months behind schedule because of institutional changes required and
time-consuming government procedures involved; a revised disbursement schedule
has been set up.   The Government's preparation of the major port develop-
ment project, integrally linked to the first project, is also behind schedule
by nine months,   Credit No. 302 of $3.7 of 1972 for a rice project: This
credit was approved by Executive Directors on January 25% 1972,was signed
on April 26,but is not yet effective.  Loan No. 593 of $7.9 million to S0PAME
of 1969 for an oil palm project: A significant cost over-run is expected in
this project.   The supervision mission which visited Cameroon from January
24 to February 1, 1972 made a preliminary calculation of the cost over-run
through 1975 which is estimated at $2.9 million, about 25% of project costs.

Revenues from local palm oil sales by Sopame are expected to provide funds
for much of the additional expenditure after 1975.   Although the Govern-
ment is required under the Loan Agreement to provide all funds needed to
complete the project, the co-lenders (Fonds dtAide et de Coop6ration and
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique) have indicated that they may be
prepared to meet part of the supplementary financing provided (i) the
Government contributes a substantial amount, (ii) the Bank also participates,
and (iii) the economics of the additional investment are justified.   A re-
appraisal mission, undertaken from May 23 to June 7 in cooperation with the
co-lenders, has made a detailed field review of the cost over-run and ways
are now being studied to effect economies and, if necessary, to modify the
design of the project.   The Executive Directors will be informed in due
course of the measures proposed for dealing with Sopamets problems.

PART II - RECENT ECONOMIC DEVEIWPM!IENTS
1.        Cameroon is endowed with diversified although not abundant
natural resources.   Its development potential is favorable.   A
variety of climates and soils has permitted cultivation of a large number
of export crops, making Cameroon less vulnerable to external price fluc-
tuations than many other countries producing primary commodities.    The
rivers have good hydro-electric potential.   There are also indications
of oil, copper, natural gas, and bauxite but, thus far, no definite pros-
pects of commercial exploitation.   The lack of an adequate transport
network is a major problem and has hindered economic development.   Much
of past and current development efforts, including those of the Bank Group,
have therefore been devoted to improving transport.
2.        Economically, Cameroon has done well in its first decade of
independence.   Throughout the 1960ts the econony grew rapidly, well ahead.
of the 2.1 percent population growth rate.   During the last three to four
years real GDP increased by about 7 percent a year, chiefly due to favorable
export prices.   GDP per capita for 1968/69 was estimated at $145, and
latest estimates now show 1970/71 GDP per capita of $155 at constant 1966/67
prices.   The main factors of growth have been the diversification of agri-
cultural exports, rapid growth of industry and commerce, and large infra-
structure investments, particularly in transport.   A further important
factor was the liberal investment climate which encouraged foreign firms,
mostly French, to invest in Cameroon.
3.        A furtherfactor which has boosted economic growth was favorable
world market prices for the most important export products, cocoa and
coffee.   During 1965-1969, Cameroon's terms of trade improved annually by
9 percent.   This factor largely accounted for the 10 percent annual growth
of government revenues during 1965-1969 and for the increase during those
years of foreign reserves (from $27 million in 1965 to $91 million in June
1971, equivalent to four-five months of imports).   Since the beginning of
1970, however, terms of trade have been deteriorating, particularly due to
the decline in cocoa prices (from 46 cents per lb. in 1969 to 25 cents in
November 1971).   Moreover, cotton and groundnut crops were disappointing
due to the drought.   Economic growth has also been affected by the decline
in foreign investment.   GDP growth in 1970/71 is provisionally estimated
at less than 4 percent in real terms and the prospects are that the growth
rate will drop during 1971/72 as well.   As a result of declining export
prices, the balance of trade has shifted from a surplus of $20 million in
1969/70 to a deficit of $30 million (about 12 percent Of imports) in 1970/71.
Gross foreign assets have been declining since mid-1971.
4.        The worsening of the terms of trade since the beginning of 1970
puts into relief the major problems of Cameroon's economy which are: the
inadequacy of transport, backward agriculture, the increase in urban unem-
ployment, and the need for technical and vocational training.   As far as
human resources are concerned, the number of professionals and skilled
workers is still low.   Much progress has been made in the Cameroonization
of the civil service, although foreign technical advice remains vital.



ANNEX II
page 6
Foreigners still largely manage and own the private modern sector.
5.        Agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy., accounting for
40 percent of GDP and about three-fourths of employment.    Agricultural
equipment is not modern and techniques are largely traditional; the plots
are small, and credit and extension services are seldom available.    While
efforts to increase some export crops have been effective, the Government
has not yet come to grips with the problem of increasing production of
domestic foodstuffs and livestock, on which a large part of the population
depends for its livelihood and which is becoming increasingly important in
view of the rapidly growing needs of the cities.    This lack of government
action is in part due to the absence of a federal Ministry of Agriculture
and Livestock.   At present, agriculture is the responsibility of the state
governments of East and West Cameroon, which however neither dispose of the
necessary funds nor the qualified manpower to launch an effective agricul-
tural development effort.   For the same reasons, the institutional frame-
work has also remained weak.    Concentration of decision-making and
establishment of agricultural organizations for credit, instruction, land
reform and extension services are expected to take place soon following the
recent referendum creating a unitary state.
6.        Economic development hinges on investments in infrastructure,
particulary on improvements in transport -- roads, railways, ports.
Allocations to transport have accounted for 45% of public investment during
the past five years and are expected to continue on a large scale.    The
Bank Group is vigorously assisting the Governmentts efforts to improve the
transport network.   In spite of projects undertaken in recent years, however,
the movement of goods and people is still retarded by bottlenecks in the
Douala port and on the Douala-Yaounde railway and by inadequacies in the road
system.   The Trans-Cameroon road/railway route, costing over $100 million,
is the largest single development project in the country and will contribute
to the unification of the diverse peoples who make up the population.    It
will spur development of the Northern region, centered particularly around
the towns of Ngaounder6 and Garoua (the proposed second education project,
incidentally, includes studies of technical and vocational education
requirements in the Northern region).
7.        Partly due to the slow economic development of rural areas, people
are moving to the cities.   The urban population has been increasing by 6%
a year and is expected to reach 3.0 million by 1985.    This would be 38% of the
population as compared to only 16% in 1963 and 22% in 1970.    This increase
has been far more rapid than the expansion of employment in Cameroonts
secondary and tertiary sectors.   Urban unemployment is likely to increase
further in the next decade and to become a source of political and social
unrest.   Employment creation is thus becoming the most important objective.
Since effective agricultural development might slow down but could not possibly
stem the rural exodus, the Government will need to give urgent attention to
increasing urban employment in industry, transport, trade and other services.



ANNEX II
page 7
8.        The Government's success in this endeavor will to a large extent
depend on maintenance of the favorable climate for private investments,
both foreign and domestic.   In recent years, however, Government's relations
with the private sector became strained by bureaucratic interventions while
efforts to identify and promote industrialization possibilities remained
inadequate.   The Government has become increasingly aware of these short-
comings and the President is personally directing an effort to improve
communication with the business community.   Future industrialization will
principally depend on the ability of Cameroon to attract foreign capital and
expertise which can produce intermediate products for the local economy and
process local goods for export.
9.        The major development problems discussed in the preceding paragraphs
find adequate recognition in the Government's development plan 1971/2 - 1975/6.
However, action in the crucial areas of agricultural and industrial development
needs more precise definition and thus more resources (including foreign tech-
nical assistance) for project preparation.    The pipeline of directly productive
projects is small and without determined attempts to step up project preparation
much of the plan will remain unrealized.   Although Cameroonts administrative
ability has increased remarkably, it needs more foreig technical assistance
than is presently available to help work out the practical problems of agri-
cultural and industrial development.   Foreign aid donors have, nevertheless,
recognized the need to train local counterparts to replace, in due course,
the large number of foreign experts working in Cameroon.
10.       The Government announced the development plan at a time when
prospects for domestic resource mobilization were poor.    The plan calls for
total investment of CFAF 280 billion (US$1.1 billion) of which half would be
public.   This amount is a 70 percent increase over investment in the last
five years (1966/7 - 1970/1).   While it is doubtful whether the project
content of the plan is sufficiently worked out to permit the plants full
implementation, financial difficulties are likely to be even more of a
constraint.   In spite of the plants optimistic calculations of foreign aid
disbursements, the need for public savings was nevertheless estimated at
CFAF 10 billion a year, about 35 percent of proposed public investment.
11.       To realize  this amount of savings will require a very determined
effort.   During the recent period of rising export prices (1965-70),
Government revenue increased rapidly and in spite of rising current expendi-
tures, budgetary savings averaged CFAF 3 billion, about d percent of revenue
and 1.5 percent of GDP.   Public savings moreover increased through large
surpluses of the agricultural stabilization funds.    The more recent decline
in export prices has however led to a much less favorable situation.    In
1970/71 the Government realized only a small budgetary surplus and the
situation may not improve in the present fiscal year.



ANNEX II
page d
12.       At the same time, prospects for the agricultural stabilization funds
have become unfavorable.    The cocoa fund budget calls for price support
payments during 1971/2 of CFAF 3.7 billion plus CFAF 1.5 billion in arrears
from the past year. ' These payments would virtually exhaust the reserves of
the fund, which was heavily depleted last year by a special investment budget
of CFAF 10.5 billion.   Before long, the Government will probably have to
lower the cocoa producer price.   At present international prices, the Goven-
ment is paying the private sector about CFAF 24 per kg.    To mitigate the
effect ~of last year's drastic decline in cotton production, the cotton stabi-
lization fund has also been paying maintenance subsidies to farmers.    Only a
partial recovery of cotton production is expected this year.
13.       In order to improve prospects for .savings during the plan period,
the"Government will have to curtail,first of all,the growth of current
expenditures.   The Government is aware of this need; the plan foresees
current expenditures growth at 6 percent a year as compared to about 10
percent a year in the past five years.   However, if export income remains
depressed, the'Government may have to contemplate.an even lower growth rate
of current expenditures.,  The Government may moreover have to reduce the
cocoa and perhaps other agricultural producer-prices in spite of the serious
consequences for farmers' incomes and the risk that export volume would drop.
14.       Ever since independence the Cameroon Government has followed sound
financial policies and there is 'every reason to expect that the Government
will attempt to reduce low-priority expenditures to free resources for economic
development. However,the Government recognizes that a reduction in the
development plan may also be required.   Meanwhile, international aid agencies
can soften the impact of the export price decline on domestic savings by pro-
viding a high proportion of aid on concessional terms, and a high'proportion
of project cost, including the financing of local expenditures.
15.       As mentioned in paragraph 6 of the main Report and Recommendation, it
is estimated that some CFAF 64 billion out of a public investment program of
about CFAF 100 billion would come from foreign assistance.    Since the Third
Plan is much higher than the Second Plan and since the other major donors, France
and EEC, are not expected to increase their assistance, Bank Group lending
could rise to close to 40 percent of all aid commitments made during the Third
Plan period.   In comparison, in the five-year period 1965-69, disbursements
of foreign aid amounted to an estimated total of CFAF 46 billion (US$167 million).
The FAC provided 40 percent of this,,and the FED 25 percent, as grants.    Loans
amounted to about 24 percent of the aid total, mainly from the Caisse Centrale,
US AID, and the Kreditanstalt ftfr Wiederaufbau.   Disbursements averaged about
CFAF 9'billion annually (US$32.4-million). By 1970 the proportion of loans
increased as grants declined.   World Bank disbursements were very small during
1965-69.   In 1970 disbursements amounted to CFAF 19 billion (US$69 million)
from all sources, of which 30 percent from France.    French aid was concentrated
in infrastructure (40 percent) and productive sectors (30 percent).    The
Common I"hrket program was primarily in agriculture (50 percent) with a relatively
small emphasis on infrastructure (20 percent).



ANNEX II
page 9
16.       Cameroonts external public debt has increased rapidly.  It amounted
to $230 million at the end of December 1971. The debt service ratio is likely
to rise from 5.2% in 1971 to about 6.5% in 1975/76, taking into account service
on existing and estimated new public debt. In making this projection it has been
assumed that grant aid disbursements will remain substantial, that Cameroonts
traditional aid donors will continue to offer relatively favorable terms on
official loans and that meanwhile Cameroon, in order to avoid rapid exhaustion
of its debt servicing capacity, will keep supplier credit financing within
strict limits.  The forecast debt service ratio is still not very high and
a modest increase in conventional debt would therefore appear justified. However,
in view of the country's poverty and modest growth prospects, Cameroonts needs
for external capital are expected to extend over a considerable length of time.
A continued rapid build-up of external debt should be avoided and it is therefore
desirable that most foreign assistance be on concessional terms. Bank Groupts
assistance should be on soft blend terms under the circumstances.
