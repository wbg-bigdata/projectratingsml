MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A GAS SYSTEM EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
an amount of US$100 million equivalent is submitted for approval.   The
proposed loan would be extended to the Republic of Korea at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate with a 15-year maturity including a grace
period of five years.   The Bank loan would be onlent to the Korea Gas
Corporation (KGC) on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.  KGC
would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
2.        Background.  In 1981, in the wake of the second oil crisis, the
Government of Korea decided on promoting the importation of liquefied natural
gas (LNG) as a part of a broader strategy to diversify fuel supplies away
from imported oil. Deliveries (from Indonesia) started in 1987, and LNG now
accounts for 3X of total primary energy consumption.   More recently, the
Government's energy strategy has become increasingly influenced by environ-
mental considerations.  This has led to still greater emphasis on natural gas
as an economically attractive, yet environmentally harmless, form of energy.
3.        An energy strategy that encompasses the import of LNG needs to be
carefully formulated because of two key considerations.   First, LNG is a
relatively expensive fuel and its utilization is therefore limited to
applications: (a) where enhanced convenience in use, or gains in end-use
equipment efficiency compensate for differentials in energy costs; or (b)
where gas offers positive environmental externalities which are deemed
socially advantageous to capture. Second, the import and handling of LNG re-
quire extensive infrastructure investments in receiving terminals, regasi-
fication facilities, and transmission and distribution pipelines, the long-
term economic viability of which needs to be firmly established. Aware of
the strategic significance of investment decisions in the gas sector, the
Government sought the assistance of the Bank in carrying out a Gas
Utilization Study to help establish the scope for economical use of natural
gas in Korea. The Bank undertook this study in 1989, jointly with the Korea
Energy Economics Institute (Report No. 8142-KO dated January 23, 1990).
4.        The study established that natural gas (imported as LNG) was com-
petitive with alternative fuels in a number of applications, including power
generation (in combined-cycle plants), combined heat/power (CHP) plants sup-
plying district heating systems, and selected residential, commercial and
industrial uses (particularly where elements of convenience, quality, and/or
efficiency of end-use technology can be brought to bear on consumer choice).
The relatively benign effect of natural gas on the environment was seen to
add to its potential as an attractive form of energy for Korea (e.g., as a
space heating fuel for residential and commercial use in urban areas). The
study also helped define a strategy for the sector in terms of likely future
imports and the scope of investments required to handle the additional
quantities.



5.        The demand for natural gas, compared to the 2.4 million tons
consumed in 1990, is expected to increase threefold by the year 2000. KGC's
future demand scenario shows total demand rising to 4.9 mty by 1995 and 7.2
mty by the year 2000.  KEPCO, the Korean power utility, is projected to
account for 69X in 1995 and 611 in the year 2000 of these amounts, the
remainder being consumed by domestic, commercial and industrial customers.
On completion of the proposed project, the Pyong Taek LNG terminal throughput
will be increased from 3.0 to 5.0 mty. Plans are underway to install a new
LNG terminal at Incheon with an initial capacity of 3.0 mty.
6.        The prospective beneficiary of the Bank loan, KGC, was established
in 1983 as the government agency responsible for the planning and execution
of the basic infrastructure necessitated by the import of LNG (terminal and
transmission pipelines). Responsibility for gas distribution to the final
consumers (except for such large-scale users as KEPCO) has been vested in
privately-owned city gas companies (CGCs), which are KGC's customers.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. The main rationale for continued Bank
lending to Korea is the desire by the Government to receive Bank advice and
assistance in sector analysis and policy formulation, taking advantage of the
Bank's broader experiences.   The Bank is able to provide this type of
assistance with a relatively modest level of lending and sector work. Bank
operational work is focussed primarily on issues of equity and social
services, technology transfer, institutional development and environment.
The proposed project and the Bank's participation in its formulation are in
line with this general strategy. The Bank's involvement in project prepa-
ration has already resulted in a stronger interface between gas and elec-
tricity utilities and a streamlining of public policies affecting gas
utilization patterns. Further Bank participation in project design would be
useful to assist KGC through critical technology choices.
8.        The proposed project will be the first LNG-based project supported
by the Bank. It reflects the Bank's growing appreciation for the economic
and environmental merits of natural gas as an energy source. Its particular
significance lies in that it signals a broadening of this awareness to deve-
loping countries whose energy endowment does not include natural gas and
whose geographic location leaves no alternative but to import gas as LNG by
marine tanker. Bank association with this unique project will provide valu-
able opportunities to gain experience which could be relevant to other devel-
oping countries.
9.        Project Objectives. The project aims to: (a) provide the infrastruc-
ture required to facilitate the import and utilization of 5 mty of LNG by
1995, thereby improving the efficiency of energy use in Korea and mitigating
its impact on air quality in urban areas; and (b) strengthen KGC's operatio-
nal performance and management, particularly in the area of financial
management.
10.       YkoJect DesSciption.    The  project  consists  of  the  following
components: (a) extension of the Pyong Taek LNG receiving terminal; (b)



- 3 -
construction of additional pipeline capacity to deliver the increased
terminal throughput; an<, (c) utilization of consultants' services for the
engineering of terminal extension and pipeline expansion.   The terminal
extension component comprises the installation of two 100,000 m3 LNG storage
tanks and additional regasification and gas sent-out facilities. The pipeline
component expands the existing pipeline system covering the Seoul
metropolitan area, and installs a trunkline from Pyong Tasek to Tae Jon to
support natural gas market developments in the Central Region. The project
would be implemented over 5 years.
11.       Project Costs and Financing Plan. The total cost of the project is
estimated  at US$678  million  (excluding  interest  during  construction,
estimated at US$54 million).   The proposed Bank loan of USA100 million
represents 14X of total costs and 82X of estimated foreign exchange
expenditures. Additional financing for the project would come in the form of
additional equity, internal cash generation and other borrowings. The Bank
loan would be made to the Government which will onlend its proceeds to KGC
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bank. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedules are given in
Schedule B. Retroactive financing equivalent to $10 million is recommended
for expenses incurred after March 31, 1991, mostly for partial payments of
equipment with long delivery periods for cryogenic services, already ordered
through advanced contracting approved by the Bank.   A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea
are given in schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing project location
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9462-K0, dated August 13,
1991 is being circulated separately.
12.       Envronment. Globally, the project will have a positive impact on
the environment because use of natural gas would be in lieu of more polluting
forms of energy.   Actually, increased use of LNG will have beneficial
environmental implications both at the national/regional and global levels.
Its most immediate effect will be on sulfur dioxide and particulate
concentrations in urban and highly industrial areas; seen in a longer-term
perspective, use of LNG will provide a substantial, if partial, response to
concerns about global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions by a
factor of 35% to 50X compared to most alternative fuels.
13.       The construction of the project does not involve any sensitive
environmental issue.  The terminal expansion component does not require
acquisition of additional land and the designs of both the terminal and
pipeline components incorporate internationally-recognized safety standards.
Relevant information (including the original Environmental Assessment of the
Pyong-Taek terminal) has been submitted to and reviewed by the Bank.
14.       Agred Action.  The Bank has agreed with KGC that it shall: (a)
furnish to the Bank for comments its updated annual investment program; (b)
cause to be carried out regular safety audits of its technical operations;
(c) prepare and furnish to the Bank for its comments an Action Program to



strengthen its expertise in financial management; (d) prepare and submit to
the Bank for its comments a rolling long-term finaacial plan; (e) prepare and
submit to the Bank for its comments the rationale for the proposed wholesale
gas price structure; and (f) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2, a
debt/equity ratio not exceeding 75:25, and a debt service coverage ratio of
at least 1.2 times in 1992, and 1.4 times thereafter. Assurances have also
been given by the Government that it will take appropriate measures to enable
KGC to meet its financial covenants with the Bank.   The signing of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of loan
effectiveness.
15.       Benefits.    The  project  will  have  significant  economic  and
environmental benefits. About 80% of incremental gas consumption between
1990 and 1995 can be justified based on strictly-defined economic arguments
(i.e., ignoring environmental externalities).   In particular, the project
will support the use of natural gas in combined-cycle power and CHP plants
which have been shown to be parts of the least-cost solution to Korea's power
and residential space heating development requirements. Gas prices to CGC
consumers are set by the Government, taking into account the profitability
requirements of KGC and the CGCs. Gas demand from residential, commercial
and industrial users therefore largely reflects individual choices based on
economically-efficient pricing.   This notwithstanding, the Government has
taken measures (in the form of fuel use directives) to promote the use of gas
by certain categories of residential and commercial consumers with a view to
bettering air quality in urban areas. These policies will affect about 20%
of incremental sales (essentially the space heating loads); the additional
energy costs involved in meeting the Government's environmental objectives
are deemed reasonable. Overall, the project is projected to show an economic
rate of return of 29%, showing the robustness of the proposed project.
16.       While LNG will be used largely because of its competitiveness, an
important justification for the large proposed investments in gas
infrastructure, and the critical role assumed by the Government in bringing
these investments about, lies with the major contribution natural gas will
make toward mitigating the impact of energy use on the quality of the
environment. Compared to alternative sources of energy (with the possible
exception of nuclear energy), natural gas is a clean and low-polluting fuel
and its expanded availability in the Seoul-Incheon area (and progressively in
other parts of the country) will lead to a significant improvement in air
quality in these areas by reducing emissions of, inter alia, sulfur dioxide
and particulates. The new gas-fired power plants will in effect substitute
coal-fired stations, while CHP plants in support of district heating systems
will obviate the need for individual oil-fired space heating equipment.
Similarly, gas use by CGC consumers will substitute an array of (mostly
liquid) fuels with a higher sulfur and particulate content.
17.       Risks.  The project faces technical risks inherent to the gas
industry. The probability of these hazards arising, however, is minimal as
the necessary safety devices will be included in the design of the project



facilities. Also, KGC's record in operating the existing terminal and
pipeline facilities has been exceptionally good.
18.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
