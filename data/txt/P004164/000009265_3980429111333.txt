IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
GAS SYSTEM EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 3413-KO)
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Gas System Expansion
Project in the Republic of Korea, for which loan 3413-KO in the amount of US$100 million
equivalent was approved on November 5, 1991 and made effective on March 2, 1992.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1997 as originally planned. Final disbursement took
place on November 22, 1995, at which time a balance of US$5,282,700.42 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Esperanza Miranda, Consultant, under the supervision of Mr.
Mohammad Farhandi, Task Manager, EASEG. It was cleared by Mr. Yoshihiko Sumi,
Manager, EASEG.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission on
February, 1997. It is based on material in the project file, site visits by the ICR mission in
November, 1997 and updated project information provided by the Borrower (KGC). The
Borrower also contributed to the preparation of the ICR by preparing own project completion
report (attached as Appendix A), and commenting on the draft ICR.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
GAS SYSTEM EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 3413-KO)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    After the second oil crisis in the early 80's, the Government of Korea (GOK) decided to
promote the importation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a part of a broader strategy to
diversify energy supplies from imported oil and address environmental concerns. By 1983, the
Korea Gas Corporation (KGC) had been established as the state-owned agency responsible for
the overall planning, operation and management of the infrastructure necessitated by the import
of LNG. Aware of the strategic significance of investment decisions in the gas sector, the
Government sought the assistance of the Bank in carrying out a Gas Utilization Study to help
establish the scope for economical use of natural gas in Korea. The Bank undertook this study
in 1989, jointly with the Korea Energy Economics Institute. The study established that natural
gas (imported as LNG) was competitive with alternative fuels in a number of applications,
including power generation (in combined-cycle plants), combined heat/power (CHP) plants
supplying district heating systems, and selected residential, commercial and industrial uses. The
relatively benign effect of natural gas on the environment was considered to add to its potential
as an attractive form of energy for Korea. The Gas System Expansion project was prepared as
an aftermath of this study (para. 1).
Project Objectives
ii.   The project objectives as stated in the SAR were: (a) provision of the additional
infrastructure required to facilitate the import and utilization of 5 mty of LNG by 1995, thereby
improving the efficiency of energy use in Korea and mitigating its impact on air quality in
urban areas; and (b) strengthening KGC's operational performance and management,
particularly in the area of financial management.
iii.   The project components were: (a) extension of the Pyong Taek LNG receiving terminal
consisting of the construction of two 10,000 m3 LNG tanks and installation of ancillary
equipment; (b) construction of additional pipeline facilities, including expansion of the Seoul
metropolitan pipeline system (to meet increasing demand from the City Gas Companies and
KEPCO) and construction of a trunkline from Pyong Taek to Tae Jon (to support gas market
developments in the Central Region); and (c) utilization of consultant's services for the
engineering of terminal extension and pipeline expansion. In addition to the above components,
the loan agreement stated that KGC carried out the following safety audits of its technical
operations, and it furnished the results of said audits to the Bank: (a) prior to any construction;
(b) during the construction; and (c) prior to start-up of the Pyong Taek terminal.
iii



iv.   Although the project did not explicitly include any sector policy objective, it was
recognized during appraisal that gas prices to the City Gas Companies (CGCs) were subject to
wide fluctuations which could have a deleterious effect on. KGC's liquidity, and therefore, it
was agreed during project negotiations that KGC and the Government would prepare and
submit by the Bank by June 30 of each year, an annual paper discussing the rationale for the
proposed wholesale gas price structure for the following year, including an assessment of the
impact of likely LNG price fluctuations on KGC's liquidity. (para. 4).
v.    The project objectives were well defined, realistic and in line with GOK's general goal
in the energy sector which was to bring about greater efficiency in the use of energy while
minimizing its impact on the environment. For the implementing agency, the project was
essential to establish KGC's financial credit worthiness in the foreign market as the Bank loan
was the first foreign loan to assist KGC with its physical expansion program. (para. 5)
vi.   The project was very clear in setting specific outcomes with regard to the objective of
expanding the import and utilization of LNG and it spelled out clearly how the project would
achieve this objective, that is, through the extension of the Pyong Taek Terminal and
construction of additional pipelines. However, the project was less clear in providing details on
how the objective of strengthening KGC's operational performance and financial management
would be achieved as no specific activities or resources were established to monitor and
evaluate the achievement of this objective (para. 7)
vii.  The project was neither complex nor demanding for the implementing agency, mainly
because KGC had already gained experience while completing the original Pyong Taek LNG
terminal and pipeline facilities. During the construction of the original terminal (and during the
expansion project), KGC received valuable technical assistance from world-wide experts in
LNG technology (France and Japan) which provided an ample window for knowledge transfer.
The main anticipated challenges for the project, market, construction, and operation, were
foreseen to be manageable and not beyond the capability of the implementing agency. However,
the real challenge would come from the lack of commitment to implement the institutional
objectives of the project and the emphasis placed by KGG on the financial benefits of the loan
rather than on the value-added of the project. (para. 8).
Implementation Experience and Results
viii.  The achievement of the project's physical and environmental objectives was substantial.
KGC not only complete the two storage tanks financed by the loan, but it expanded its original
investment plan by adding a third tank, thus increasing LNG terrninal capacity up to 7 mty as
compared to the 5 mty anticipated in the SAR by December 1995. The project was completed
on July 1996, almost six months earlier than the anticipated date of December 1996. The actual
project cost, including the construction of the third tank, was US$679.4 million or about 7%
lower than the appraisal estimate US$732.1 million. The project cost was lower due to the fact
that actual contingencies and IDC costs were lower than anticipated (para 9). The internal rate
of return has been recalculated as 19% which is lower than the 29% but still it is considered
iv



satisfactory (para 10-12). The quality of air in the Seoul metropolitan area has improved as a
result of the substitution of fuels with a high sulfur and particulate content (coal and oil
products) by natural gas which is a cleaner and lesser-polluting fuel (para. 13). The institutional
objectives of the project were partially achieved, mainly because of KGC's limited
improvement in the areas of financial management and training (para. 16). Bank financing was
only US$80.7 million since US$19.3 million was canceled at the Borrower's request in
December 1994 because KGC's accessibility to less expensive funds; and in November 1995,
the Borrower requested the cancellation of the undisbursed balance of US$5.3 million from the
loan account (para. 17).
ix.   A major concern during project implementation was the issue of safety and the
implementation of safety audits. In spite of repeated requests by the Bank, KGC did not comply
with the submission of safety audits of its technical operations as required in the project
agreement. The Bank received only "approval certificates" issued by the Korea Gas Safety
Corporation (KGSC) rather than comprehensive reports indicating the actions taken by
management regarding safety issues. This issue became even more important when an
explosion in KGC's gas distribution network in downtown Seoul resulted in about 13 deaths
and substantial damages to properties in December 1994. Although the accident occurred in a
section of the pipeline not financed by the project, the Bank and KGC agreed to allocate up to
US$1.0 million from the loan account to fund a comprehensive safety audit of all KGC
facilities at large. However, KGC decided to use its own resources to carry out such audit which
was completed by KGCS in March 1995 but it was presented to the Bank only until December
1997 still in Korean language. Recently, KGC has initiated a program to revamp its entire
safety management system through a comprehensive five-year Environmental-Hazard-Safety
Management Plan which is being implemented with the assistance of international consultants
(Mobil Corporation) (para. 19)
x.   In spite of the above shortcomings, project sustainability is very likely given the
increased demand of LNG as city-gas markets are expanded nationwide and KGC carries out its
ambitious plans for future expansion. These plans include: a) a new LNG terminal at Incheon,
outside Seoul (already completed); b) further expansion of the Pyong Taek terminal, and c) a
new LNG terminal at An-jung in the south coast of Korea by year 2000 (para. 22-24).
xi.   The Bank and Borrower's performance during each phase of the project was
satisfactory. Project identification and preparation benefited greatly from the analysis carried
out by the Gas Utilization Study in 1989 as well as from the Borrower's readiness for the
project. Appraisal of the project was carried out in close collaboration with KGC, and it was
completed without a formal appraisal mission. Despite limited supervision resources available
for Korea projects as lending was being phased out of this country, Bank supervision was
satisfactory (para 27). KGC performed extremely well in the implementation of the physical
works but it failed to show the same commitment to the strengthening of its financial
management function and the compliance with the legal covenants regarding safety audits
(para. 31).
v



xii.   Based on the substantial achievement of the environmental and physical objectives of
the project and the sustainability of the project benefits, the overall outcome of the project can
be considered as satisfactory (para. 32). The project assisted KGC to secure its ability to supply
the increased demand of LNG that resulted from co-generation and combined-power plants
recently built in the Seoul metropolitan area, and it was instrumental for the consolidation of
KGC's physical expansion program, which is now aimed to expand the supply of LNG
nationwide by year 2000. The project value-added contribution, however, was reduced by the
lack of action from GOK and KGC in key areas such as KGC's financial management and the
implementation of safety audits (para. 33)
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
xiii.  Benefits from the project will likely be sustained. The demand for LNG has increased
significantly since project completion and is expected to increase steadily in the future years as
city gas-markets are expanded nationwide. (para 22). Likewise, KGC's LNG supply capacity
has increased and it is likely to increase as KGC carries out an ambitious investment program
which consists of further expansion of the Pyong Taek terminal, a new terminal at Incheo and
An-Jung, and expansion of the pipeline network to the southwestern region of Korea. (para 23).
On the safety issue, KGC is also working on revamping its entire safety management system
through a comprehensive five-year Environmental-Hazard-Safety (EHS) Management Plan
(para. 19). In addition, KGC's efforts in R&D are supporting the development of high-
efficiency technologies to foster the introduction of additional end-use technologies into the
Korean marketplace, for instance, in commercial applications (para. 34).
xiv.  The most important findings to be drawn from the experience in implementing the
project are as follows:
a) Project preparation and identification were greatly facilitated and benefited by the analysis
carried out in the Gas Utilization Study and by working closely with the Borrower (para. 6)
b) The potential for the success of any project is increased if it fits into the government's
development policy for the sector. The project received a great deal of Government's
support as it fitted well into GOK's strategy to promote the use of natural gas as an
alternative energy source while minimizing the detrimental impacts on the quality of the
environment (para. 4).
c) In project design, each development objective should be accompanied by an implementation
plan which describes how the objective would be achieved and the resources needed for its
implementation. Without these indicators, the project objective of strengthening KGC's
operational performance became too broad and difficult to monitor and evaluate (para 7).
The identification of performance monitoring indicators for each project objective is now
required in the preparation of all Bank projects.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
GAS SYSTEM EXPANSION PROJECT (LOAN 3413-KO)
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    Background. In 1981, in the wake of the second oil crisis, the Government of Korea
(GOK) decided to promote the importation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a part of a broader
strategy to diversify energy supplies away from imported oil and address environmental
concerns. In 1983, a contract between the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and
Pertamina (Indonesia) was signed which provided for imports of two million ton/year (mty) of
LNG for 20 years, starting in 1987. Subsequently, the decision was taken to establish the Korea
Gas Corporation (KGC) as a separate entity to assume responsibility for implementing the
contract with Pertamina and for the overall planning, operation and management of the
infrastructure necessitated by the import of LNG. Aware of the strategic significance of
investment decisions in the gas sector, the Government sought the assistance of the Bank in
carrying out a Gas Utilization Study to help establish the scope for economical use of natural
gas in Korea. The Bank undertook this study in 1989 (Report No. 8142-KO), jointly with the
Korea Energy Economics Institute. The study established that natural gas (imported as LNG)
was competitive with alternative fuels in a number of applications, including power generation
(in combined-cycle plants), combined heat/power (CHP) plants supplying district heating
systems, and selected residential, commercial and industrial uses. The relatively benign effect
of natural gas on the environment was considered to add to its potential as an attractive form of
energy for Korea. The Gas System Expansion project was prepared as an aftermath of this
study.
2.    Project Objectives. The project objectives as stated in the SAR were: (a) provision of
the additional infrastructure required to facilitate the import and utilization of 5 mty of LNG by
1995, thereby improving the efficiency of energy use in Korea and mitigating its impact on air
quality in urban areas; and (b) strengthening KGC's operational performance and management,
particularly in the area of financial management.
3.    The project components were the following: (a) extension of the Pyong Taek LNG
receiving terminal consisting of the construction of two 100,000 m3 LNG tanks and installation
of ancillary equipment; (b) construction of additional pipeline facilities, including expansion of
the Seoul metropolitan pipeline system (to meet increasing demand from the City Gas
Companies and KEPCO) and construction of a trunkline from Pyong Taek to Tae Jon (to
support gas market developments in the Central Region); and (c) utilization of consultants'
services for the engineering of terminal extension and pipeline expansion.
4.    Although the project did not explicitly include any sector policy objective, it was
recognized during appraisal that gas prices to the City Gas Companies (CGCs) were subject to
wide fluctuations which could have a deleterious effect on KGC's liquidity, and therefore, it
was agreed during project negotiations that KGC and the Government would prepare and
submit by the Bank by June 30 of each year, an annual paper discussing the rationale for the
1



proposed wholesale gas price structure for the following year, including an assessment of the
impact of likely LNG price fluctuations on KGC's liquidity.
5.    The project objectives were well defined, realistic and in line with GOK's general goal
in the energy sector which was to bring about greater efficiency in the use of energy while
minimizing its impact on the environment. Specifically, the GOK's strategy in the energy sector
was three-fold: (a) reducing Korea's dependence on oil by diversifying into alternative energy
sources, including imported coal, LNG and nuclear energy; (b) selecting a wider spectrum of
energy suppliers; and (c) fostering energy conservation. The project supported each of these
concerns. Also, the project was very responsive to KGC's needs for financial credit worthiness
in the foreign market as the Bank loan was the first foreign loan to assist KGC with its physical
expansion program.
6.    Because the project was prepared on the basis of the Gas Utilization Study carried out
by the Bank in 1989, it benefited from a comprehensive sector analysis and a clear scope for the
economnic and environmental benefits of natural gas as an alternative source of energy. As a
matter of fact, Bank assistance in sector analysis, particularly in sectors where the Bank could
contribute with a clear value-added (i.e environmental protection), was the main rationale for
Bank lending to Korea during its graduation program. The project was part of this program .
7.    The project was very clear in setting specific outcomes with regard to the objective of
expanding the import and utilization of LNG and it spelled out clearly how the project would
achieve this objective, that is, through the extension of the Pyong Taek Terminal and
construction of additional pipelines. However, the project was less clear in providing details on
how the objective of strengthening KGC's operational performance and financial management
would be achieved as no specific activities or resources were established to monitor and
evaluate the achievement of this objective.
8.    The project was neither complex nor demanding for the implementing agency, mainly
because KGC had already gained experience while completing the original Pyong Taek LNG
terminal and pipeline facilities. During the construction of the original terminal (and during the
expansion project), KGC received valuable technical assistance from world-wide experts in
LNG technology (France and Japan) which provided an ample window for knowledge transfer.
The main anticipated challenges for the project, market, construction, and operation, were
foreseen to be manageable and not beyond the capability of the implementing agency. However,
the real challenge would come from the lack of commitment to implement the institutional
objectives of the project and the emphasis placed by KGG on the financial benefits of the loan
rather than on the value-added components of the project.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
9.    The project physical obiectives were substantially achieved. KGC completed the
extension of the Pyong Taek LNG receiving terminal and pipeline facilities on July 1996,
almost six months earlier than the anticipated date of December 1996 (Table 5). In addition to
2



the two LNG tanks financed by the loan, KGC added a third tank to the original investment
plan. The third tank was completed within the original implementation period of the project and
financed through local funding. Consequently, LNG terminal capacity increased up to 7.0 mty
as compared to the 5.0 mty by 1995 as estimated at appraisal (Table 6). The actual project cost,
including the construction of the additional third tank, was US$679.4 million or about 7%
lower than the appraisal estimate of US$732 million (Table 9a). This was due to the fact that
actual contingencies and IDC costs were lower than anticipated.
10.   The internal rate of return (IRR) has been recalculated as 19 percent (Table 10).
While the recalculated IRR of 19 percent is lower than the 29 percent computed at appraisal, it
is still satisfactory. Although the recalculation predominantly follows the methodology used in
the SAR, the recalculation encompasses a wider scope. As discussed above (para. 9), KGC
revised their basic investment plan and constructed three storage tanks rather than two. KGC
treated this expanded investment program as a single project, and it is not possible to separate
out the costs and benefits specifically attributable to just the two tanks funded under the Project.
Hence, both incremental gas consumption with its associated benefits, and project investment
and other costs, have been increased accordingly in the recalculation.
11.   Further, shifting the usage of natural gas from the older thermal boiler power plants
(where gas had been substituting for low-value fuel oil) to higher-value city gas markets,
occurred before the first new storage tank was commissioned. Thus it is associated with gas
from the original tanks and not with the incremental gas consumption due to the Project. The
costs and benefits associated with the boiler units, which were included in the SAR's
calculation, have therefore been excluded from the recalculation.
12.   The recalculated IRR is lower for two main reasons. Firstly, the landed coal prices used
in the SAR were forecasted to increase significantly over the project period. Current Bank
projections show a slight decline in future international coal prices. This has the effect of
reducing the netback value of the gas utilized in the power sector. Secondly, the original
calculation assumed that benefits from incremental gas consumption would be realized
immediately after the Project's inception. A more realistic position has been taken in the
recalculation. It has been assumed that incremental gas consumption attributable to the Project
could not have eventuated until after the first new storage tank was commissioned in November
1993. Therefore, incremental benefits associated with this increase in gas consumption are not
considered to emerge until 1994.
13.   The achievement of the environmental obiectives has been substantial. The quality of
air in the Seoul metropolitan area has improved as a result of the substitution of fuels with a
high sulfur and particulate content (coal and oil products) by a cleaner and lesser-polluting fuel
natural gas. In particular, emissions of SO2 (which returns to the earth as part of "acid rain")
and of particulates are virtually eliminated through the use of natural gas. KGC estimates that
the use of 7mty of LNG has eliminated emnissions of S02 and TSP by 80,000 and 14,000 tons
respectively each year since 1995 (Table 6). In addition, it is estimated that each ton of LNG
used in Korea (instead of a mix of coal and oil) reduces CO2 emissions by about 3 tons. The
project thus offers a highly cost-effective response to the greenhouse challenge. In a longer-
term perspective, the use of LNG can be seen as a partial if not substantial response to concerns
3



about global warming which is now widely acknowledged as a serious source of environmental
concern.
14.   The Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by KGC for the planning of the Pyong
Taek site in 1981 covered the provision of the extension of the facilities proposed by the
project. Consequently, no new environmental impacts were expected from the construction of
the new facilities. All the actions proposed in the EA to mitigate the environmental impact of
the original project were carried out by KGC during the construction of the first phase
development of the Pyong Taek terminal. Since the expansion project was built using the same
specifications and technology of the first phase, the same preventive measures were
implemented in the project, namely, fire and gas leakage preventive systems, training on plant
operation and security procedures, safety manuals, and the maintenance of a central control
system. These measures proved satisfactory with no discernible negative environmental
consequences. As to the pipelaying activities and operation of the expansion project, their
environmental impact was covered by existing codes of practice supported by Korean law.
15.   Because the project would not require any additional land development and would
follow the same specifications as the original terminal construction investment, it was agreed
that the only environmental issues of the project were safety and local fishing rights. To ensure
that the same high standards and safety features used in the construction of the original terminal
were applied to the project, an agreement was reached with KGC during project negotiations,
that Korea Gas Safety Corporation (KGSC) would conduct, at least, three safety audits for
KGC during project implementation: (a) prior to construction; (b) during construction; and (c)
prior to start-up. Although the Bank was able to assure that the safety issues were more than
fully covered by the layout, design and operational standard of the Pyong-Taek terminal prior to
project implementation, the results of the above safety audits were made available to the Bank
only after the ICR mission. However, the reports were sent to the Bank in Korean language
which makes it impossible for the Bank to evaluate their content up to this date . Although
KGC has shown a strong interest to provide a copy of these reports after the ICR mission, the
fact is that KGC failed to submit these reports as required in the project agreement. With regard
to the local fishing rights, about 500 fishing families were compensated during project
preparation.
16.   The institutional obiectives of the project were partially achieved, mainly because of
KGC's limited improvement in the areas of financial management and training. Although the
current financial position of KGC is sound and a new international financing team was created
in early 1997, the number of financial specialists is very limited and training on financial
planning and management was minimal during project implementation. KGC has not yet
assembled the necessary expertise to perform financial planning and use it as a management
tool. This is very important in view of the growing complexity of KGC's operations and related
financial issues. KGC still needs to develop a stronger financial expertise that helps the
institution to maximize the returns from its operations and prepare it for a potential role as a
private enterprise.
4



C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
17.   Two factors were critical for the successful implementation of the project physical
components: first, KGC's previous experience in the engineering and construction of the
original Pyong Taek terminal and pipeline facilities; and second, the concerted decision on the
part of the Government to promote the use of LNG. In spite of the cancellation of US$14.0
million from the loan amount', the project was completed within its original scope and on
schedule.
18.  In contrast to the strong commitment from both GOK and KGC to carry out the civil
works of the project, the strengthening of KGC' s operational performance and financial
management was hindered by GOK's unwillingness to authorize any financial management
improvement program in government-invested corporations for which the Government had
plans to privatize. Although privatization of KGC is still under consideration, no action has
been initiated yet towards its privatization. In light of the little support received from GOK, the
Bank and KGC agreed to allocate about US$ 1.0 million from the loan account to train KGC
staff, particularly in the areas of financial management and planning capability. This effort
resulted also in disappointment as KGC did not carry out a comprehensive training program but
a series of short courses (3 months maximum) on rather broad aspects such as basic
international finance and capital markets which did not provide any substantial basis to
develop strong financial management and planning skills among KGC staff.
19.   A major concern during project implementation was the issue of safety and the
implementation of safety audits. In spite of repeated requests by the Bank, KGC did not submit
the safety audits of its technical operations as required in the project agreement. The Bank
received only "approval certificates" issued by the Korea Gas Safety Corporation (KGSC)
rather than comprehensive reports indicating the actions taken by management regarding safety
issues. This issue became even more important when an explosion in KGC's gas distribution
network in downtown Seoul resulted in about 13 deaths and substantial damages to properties
in December 1994. Although the accident occurred in a section of the pipeline not financed by
the project, the Bank and KGC agreed to allocate up to US$1 million from the loan account to
fund a comprehensive safety audit of all KGC facilities at large. However, KGC decided to use
its own resources to carry out such audit which was completed by KGCS in March 1995 but it
was submitted to the Bank only until December 1997 still in Korean language. Recently, KGC
has initiated a program to revamp its entire safety management system through a
comprehensive five-year Environmental-Hazard-Safety Management Plan which is being
implemented with the assistance of international consultants (Mobil Corporation).
20.   In 1994 KGC took the decision to issue corporate bonds to raise funds for its gas supply
investment program. This required that KGC was in compliance with all Bank covenants,
On the request of the Borrower, US$14.0 million was canceled from the loan account on December 12, 1994
because KGC's accessibility to less expensive funds through issuance of corporate bonds.
5



including the current ratio covenant which KGC had been in non-compliance with since FY92.
Because it was very unlikely that under the current expansion program (even without the
issuance of bonds) KGC would comply with this covenant in the future years, the Bank agreed,
in October, 1994, to the deletion of the current ratio covenant from the Project Agreement on
an exceptional basis. This allowed KGC to raise funds to carry out its large investment
program. Although KGC has had a positive rate of return and a substantial increase in net
income over the past six years (Table 7), it needs to reach a better liquidity position and a
capital structure which is less dependent on external borrowings.
21.   Another factor affecting the implementation of the institutional objective of the project
was the own nature of the Implementing Agency. KGC was and still is an organization run
largely by engineers. The completion of the construction of the facilities and the ability to raise
money to fund additional facilities were seen by KGC as the principal means to achieve KGC's
financial strengthening and management capabilities. Consequently, KGC did not take real
ownership of any other measure that would support the institutional development objective of
the project.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
22.   The project's achievements are likely to be sustainable. The demand for LNG has
increased significantly since project completion and is expected to increase steadily in the
coming years as city-gas markets are expanded nationwide. For instance, between 1991 and
1996, consumption of LNG increased approximately 243%, from 2.7 million ton to 9.2 million
ton, and LNG share in the total energy consumption increased from 3.4% in 1991 to 7.5% in
1996. By 2015, demand is expected to be 29 million ton (or a 219% increase from the 1996
level), and 34% of this demand would come from residential users (Table 15).
23.   KGC's LNG supply capacity has also increased since project completion and it is likely
to increase as KGC carries out its ambitious plan to extend the supply of LNG nationwide by
the year 2000. Since 1995, KGC has built: two more LNG storage tanks and a second jetty at
Pyong Taek, thus increasing terminal capacity to 8.7 million ton; a new LNG terminal at
Incheon (outside Seoul) with an expected capacity of 10 million ton by 2000; and distribution
pipelines that expand the pipeline network to the southwestern region of Korea. KGC's future
plans include the addition of one more tank at Pyong Taek (the terminal will have ten 100,000
m3 capacity tanks after the last tank is completed) and the construction of a third LNG terminal
at An-Jung (south coast of Korea).
24.   As the environmental benefits of the project are dependent on the use of natural gas, the
project is likely to maintain its environmental benefits as long as LNG is used as an alternative
source of energy which, as shown above, is likely to be the case in Korea.
6



E. BANK PERFORMANCE
25.   The Bank's performance during each phase of the project was satisfactory. Project
identification and preparation benefited greatly from the analysis carried out by the Gas
Utilization Study in 1989 as well as from the Borrower's readiness for the project. The concept
and design of the project were consistent with the sector strategy of the Borrower as well as
with the Bank's assistance strategy for Korea. The Bank's involvement in project preparation
resulted in a stronger interface between gas and electricity utilities and a streamlining of public
policies affecting gas utilization patterns, in particular for power generation and space heating.
During project design, the Bank assisted KGC in the selection of critical technology choices.
26.   The pre-appraisal mission was essentially able to complete the appraisal of the project
and the appraisal documents were finalized without a formal appraisal mission. The Borrower
was well kept informed of the processing of the project and most of the issues raised at
negotiations had already been discussed with the Government and the Implementing Agency
prior to formal discussion.
27.   The Bank performed satisfactorily in supervising the project despite limited resources
available for project supervision. The Bank carried out six supervision missions between July,
1992 and February, 1997 (about once a year) and an ICR mission in November, 1997. Project
supervision was intense at the beginning of the project but it declined as project facilities were
being built and supervision resources were limited. As lending was being phased out of Korea,
the amount of resources allocated to this country's portfolio was reduced. Although it is not
clear whether additional supervision would have yielded a better result given KGC's limited
actions in institutional development, it is clear that limited supervision reduced the time
available of Bank staff to develop a more profound interaction with KGC.
28.   The Bank reported and monitored issues and concerns on a regular basis, particularly
the issue of safety audits, but it had difficulty in ensuring compliance with the submission of
these audits. This was mainly due to the lack of cooperation from KGC in making the audits
available to the Bank on time. As a result of this, the Bank could not provide any comments or
review the procedures used in preparation of the audit reports and the information contained.
The Bank put a lot of emphasis in these audits because it felt that safety issues in KGC were not
yet institutionalized.
29.   Bank visits to the field were a common feature during project supervision and they
served as a first-hand measure to confirm the progress of the civil works and some of the safety
aspects of the facilities.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
30.   The overall performance of KGC was satisfactory throughout the project cycle. KGC
worked closely with the Bank during project identification, preparation and appraisal. They
7



showed readiness for the project, particularly for the implementation of the physical works, but
they showed limited commitment to the project's non-physical components.
31.   KGC's performance in the strengthening of its financial management capabilities and
the compliance with legal covenants was deficient for two reasons: First, KGC did not take the
necessary measures to build up its expertise in financial management and strategic planning
partly because it didn't receive the appropriate support from the Government (para. 18) and it
failed to carry out a comprehensive training program on financial planning. Second, KGC did
not submit to the Bank any of the safety audits required in the Project Agreement, namely, prior
to construction, during construction, and prior to start-up. It was only after the ICR mission that
KGC has shown interest to submit these reports to the the Bank. However, only reports in
Korean language have been received up to date. Lack of compliance with the submission of
safety audits was an outstanding issue throughout project implementation.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
32.   Based on the substantial achievement of the environmental and physical objectives of
the project and the sustainability of the project benefits, the overall outcome of the project can
be considered as satisfactory. The project assisted KGC to secure its ability to supply the
increased demand of LNG that resulted from co-generation and combined-power plants recently
built in the Seoul metropolitan area, and it was instrumental for the consolidation of KGC's
physical expansion program, which is now aimed to expand the supply of LNG nationwide by
year 2000.
33.   However, considering the lack of action by the GOK and KGC in key areas such as
strengthening KGC's financial management capabilities and the implementation of safety
audits, the project value-added contribution was reduced, and the loan became more a financial
instrument for KGC to procure goods and services. Although this is not the objective of any
Bank project, we cannot rate the project or its outcome as unsatisfactory in view of the
substantial benefits that the project has brought to the environment in Korea. The project also
was important for the consolidation of a new technology in Korea and for improving KGC's
credit worthiness when it was most needed.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
34.   As illustrated in para. 22 and 23 above, KGC is carrying out an ambitious investment
program and increasingly complex operations. KGC is also working on revamping its entire
safety management system through a comprehensive five-year Environmental-Hazard-Safety
(EHS) Management Plan that is being implemented with the help of international consultants.
In addition, KGC's efforts in R&D are supporting the development of high-efficiency
technologies to foster the introduction of additional end-use technologies into the Korean
marketplace, for instance, in commercial applications.
8



35.   The project was part of the graduation program for Korea and among the last projects in
the energy sector pipeline for the country. No more gas projects are anticipated for Bank's
lending to the Government of Korea.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
36.   The most important findings to be drawn from the experience in implementing the
project are as follows:
a) Project preparation and identification were greatly facilitated and benefited by the analysis
carried out in the Gas Utilization Study (para. 6) and by close collaboration with the
Borrower.
b) The potential for the success of any project is increased if it fits into the government's
development policy for the sector. The project received appropriate support from the
Government as it fitted well into GOK's strategy to promote the use of natural gas as an
alternative energy source while minimizing the detrimental impacts on the quality of the
environment (para. 4).
c) In project design, each development project objective should be accompanied by an
implementation plan which describes how the objective would be achieved and the
resources needed for its implementation. Without these indicators, the project objective of
strengthening KGC's operational performance became too broad and difficult to monitor
and evaluate (para 7). The identification of performance monitoring indicators for each
project objective is now required in the preparation of all Bank projects.

KOREA
3                         Gas System Expansion Project (Loan No. 3413-KO)
Implementation Completion Mission
Aide Memoire - November, 1997
1. A World Bank mission comprised of Mohammad Farhandi (Mission Leader), Calum Gunn
and Esperanza Miranda (Consultants) visited Seoul from November 11-1 5, 1997 to carry out the
Implementation Completion Mission for the above project. The mission would like to thank the
Korea Gas Corporation (KGC) for the courtesy extended to the mission and the collaboration
provided for the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission's
findings are summarized below.
Proiect Obiectives
2.    The mission discussed with KGC the achievement of the project objectives. As stated in
the SAR, this project had two development objectives: 1) to provide the additional infrastructure
required to facilitate the import and utilization of 5 mty of LNG by 1995, and 2) to strengthen
KGC's operational performance and management, particularly in the area of financial
management.
3.   It is clear that the first objective not only was fully achieved through the completion of
the extension of the Pyong Taek LNG receiving terminal, but it was exceeded substantially. By
*        December 1995, KGC was selling 6.9 mty of LNG to both Korea Electric Power Corporation
(KEPCO) and seven City Gas Companies (CGCs), and it was importing 7 mty from Indonesia,
Malaysia, Brunei, and Australia. From this perspective, the project has been instrumental for the
GOK to put in place an effective fuel import strategy which aims to: 1) secure a long-term stable
supply of Natural Gas; 2) reduce Korea's dependence on oil by diversifying into alternative
energy resources; 3) widen the spectrum of energy suppliers; and 3) alleviate air pollution
through the expansion of use of clean natural gas.
4.    The second objective, however, was partially achieved mainly because KGC's limited
improvement in the areas of financial management and safety audits as expected during project
appraisal. The mission advised KGC that in view of the growing complexity of KGC's
operations and related financial issues, KGC still needs to develop a stronger financial expertise
that assists KGC on how to maximize return from its operations in order to prepare the institution
for a potential role as a private enterprise. Although the current financial pQsition of KGC is
sound and a new International Financing Team was created in early 1997, the number of
financial specialists staff in KGC is very limited and training on financial planning and
management has been minimum during project implementation. With regard to safety
management, KGC did not comply with the submission to the Bank of the safety audits to be
conducted dWng project implementation (para. 10-13) nor it provided the Bank with the results
of the safety audit of KGC's technical operations to be carried out as a result of the explosion in
KGC's distribution network in Seoul in 1994. The mission expressed its disappointment on
*,       KGC's lack of action on the above areas and advised that the ICR will rate Borrower
performance in covenant compliance as deficient.



Project Implementation
5.    Project implementation was carried out satisfactorily with the exception of the safety
audits. The project consisted of the following components: 1) construction and installation of two
100,000 m3 LNG storage tank and ancillary equipment, 2) construction and installation of about
113 kms of the Seoul Metropolitan pipeline system and about 132 kms of the Central Region
trunkline; and 3) consultants services for the engineering of terminal expansion and pipeline
extension. KGC completed the project ahead of schedule and with virtually no overruns. Pyong
Taek terminal expansion was completed in November, 1995, and the pipeline component on
December, 1994. The original completion date estimated in the SAR was December 30, 1996.
Much of the efficiency in carrying out the implementation of the project came from KGC's
previous experience with the construction of the original terminal and pipeline facilities.
6.    The total project cost was Won 543.5 billion as compared to the original SAR estimate of
Won 474.7 billion. However, the increase in project costs is not the result of overruns but the
addition of one 1 00,000 m3 LNG storage tank to the original Pyong Taek Terminal expansion
project. In spite of the additional costs, KGC did not need to utilize the entire amount of the
Bank loan as it canceled about US$19.3 million from the loan account. The reason for the
cancellation was that KGC had access to less expensive funds through the issuance of samurai
bonds in 1994, and therefore, it could provide its own financing for the project.
7.    The mission had the opportunity to visit the project facilities at Pyong Taek LNG
receiving terminal. Since completion of the original expansion project which consisted in the
addition of two 100,000 m3 storage tanks to the already existing four 100,000 m3 tanks, KGC
has built three more tanks of the same capacity, and one more is under construction. Hence, LNG
throughput capacity at Pyong Taek terminal is expected to grow up to 15 mty by December,
2000, which is well above the Smty estimated during appraisal. In order to accommodate the
increased LNG storage capacity at the terminal, a new jetty has been built and additional land has
been developed for construction. The mission was informed that the Korea Gas Safety
Corporation (KGSC) performs an inspection of the plant twice a year.
Re-evaluation of the Economic Rate of Return
8.    The mission reviewed with KGC the necessary data to re-evaluate the economic rate of
return for the project. It was agreed that data on gas sales should be broken down by residential,
commercial, and industrial use, and data on KGC's investment and operating costs should be
related to the Gas System Expansion project only (i.e. Pyong Taek terminal expansion, Seoul
pipeline system, and Mid-Zone trunkline). KGC provided the above information before the
mission's departure. It is expected that the re-evaluated economic rate of return will be very
similar to the rate of return at appraisal ( 29%) in view of the increased volume of sales of LNG
from Pyong Taek terminal and efficiency gains in project operations.

Project Implementation Indicators
9.    Although the project did not require to be retrofitted with performance indicators because
of its closing date at the end of this calendar year, the project had very specific targets in terms of
physical implementation and enviromnental benefits. The mission requested from KGC, an
update on the physical targets achieved during project implementation by year as compared to
those specified in the SAR, and the environmental targets achieved so far through the project
(i.e. reduction of CO2 emissions and Total Suspended Particulates). KGC agreed to provide this
information and send it to the Bank on time so that it can be included in the final draft of the
ICR.
Safetv Audits
10.   A critical issue during project preparation was to ensure that the proposed Pyong Taek
terminal extension and pipeline system expansion would be built and operated at high safety
standards. To this end, agreement was reached with KGC during project negotiations that at least
three safety audits on its technical operations would be carried out and that the results of these
audits would be provided to the Bank as follows: 1) prior to construction; 2) during construction;
and 3) prior to start-up. The submission of the safety audits was made a covenant of the Project
Agreement between the Bank and KGC.
11.  In spite of repeated Bank requests to KGC to submit the above safety audits and raising
this issue during supervision missions, KGC did not comply with this covenant. Only recently,
vwe received a copy of the final report "Process Safety Management Audit of KGC LNG
Facilities" prepared by Arthur D. Little in 1996. During the ICR mission, KGC informed the
Bank that KGSC had carried out two safety audits: one before the construction of the Pyong
Taek terminal expansion project in 1990 and the second, during construction of the project in
1993. However, both reports were never translated into English nor were they submitted to the
Bank.
12.  In addition to the safety audits for KGC's technical operations, it was agreed as a result of
the explosion in KGC's distribution network in downtown Seoul in December, 1994, which
resulted in about 13 deaths as well as substantial damage to properties, to conduct a
comprehensive safety audit of KGC's facilities. The Bank and KGC agreed to allocate up to
US$1.0 million of the loan to fund this safety audit. During the ICR mission, KGC informed the
Bank that this report had been carried out by KGSC, however, the Bank never received a copy of
this report nor it was informed of the results of the study. KGC agreed to provide the Bank a
copy of this report as soon as possible.
13.   Albeit the lack of KGC's attention to the safety audits during project implementation,
KGC is now working on revamping its entire safety management system with the help of Mobil
Corporation through the implementation of a five-year Environmental-Hazard-Safety (EHS)
Management Plan. This five-year-plan (1997-2002) provides for a comprehensive training
program and the expansion of the safety and inspection function within KGC. In this regard, the
Bank believes that KGC is taking the appropriate steps to strengthen its safety operations and
3



thereby, ensure the sustainability of its operations in general.
Bank and Borrower Performance
14    Overall, Bank and Borrower performance was satisfactory from project identification to
project completion, with the exception of lack of compliance regarding safety audits and
financial management strengthening. It was recognized by KGC that Bank's assistance for the
project was very important in terms of gaining financial credibility when this institution needed it
most, and in terms of receiving sound technical advice on areas such as financial management,
project preparation and economic analysis. However, KGC's real commitment was in the
expansion of the Pyong Taek LNG terminal and not in the implementation of the institutional
objectives of the project.

Appendix B
!KOGAS'. Evaluation'Report of the loan: proj'ec't
1. Introduction
KOGAS' objective, as provided in the KOGAS Act and the Articles of
Incorporation of KOGAS, is to supply natural gas on a.stable and long-term
basis in order to improve the natlonal life style and cqontribute to the rising
standard of public,welfare.    KOGAS' business, therefore,.. is emphasised on
not only profitability but also publicity.
Under this background, the Gas System Expansion project'was projected in 1989
for the sake of securement of stability in Natural gas supply, following the rapid
increase of natural gas demand in Seoul metropolitan area and middle zone of
Korea.
2. The effects of the Gas System expansion prOject
a) Securement of stability in Natural gas supply following lthe steep increase of
natural gas demand as a fuel for power plants and, residents in Seoul
metropolitan and Mfiddle zone.
- Especially, with the completion of the loan project, KOGAS secured its ability
to supply sufficiently natural gas to co-generation power plants, combined power
plants built newly in Seoul metropolitan area.
Four co-generation power plants built in Anyang city, Pundang newtown, ilsan
newtown, Jundong newtown near Seoul, have consumed the natural gas
equivalent to 1.42 million ton of LNG each year from 1993.
-1-



Two combined-power plants also were newly established in Ildo near Incheon
city and have been supplied with the natural gas equivalent to 1.24 million ton
of LNG from KOGAS each year.
b) Alleviation of air pollution through expansion of use of clean energy, natural
gas in Seoul metropolitan area.
c) Reduction of petroleum's share in the total energy consumption through
diversification of energy resources.
- The total energy consumption in the Republic of Korea increased
approximately 59% from 103,622 thousand tons of oil equivalent ( "TOE" ) in
1991 to 165,015 thousand TOE in 1996.
Despite the Republic's efforts to reduce the demand for fossil fuels,
petroleum's share in the total energy consumption increased from 57.5% in
1991 to 60.5% in 1996.
Between 1991 and 1996, consumption of coal was stable while the
consumption of nuclear energy slightly increased.  i
The consumption of hydro energy had fluctuated, decreasing in 1996.
However, between those years, consumption of LNG increased approximately
348.2% from 3,503 thousand TOE to 12,197 thousand TOE, and also the LNG
