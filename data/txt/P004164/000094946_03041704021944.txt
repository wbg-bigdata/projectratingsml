I1.  SUNMY
1. 1 The Necessity of Project
In the long-range energy demand-supply plan of Korca, it has been required
ot diversification and long-term stable procurement of energy sources for
the purpose of  steady economic growth.   Especially, the anxiety  grows in
petroleum sector.
The Government has passecd a resolution in favor of importing LNG (Liquefied
Natural Gas)  as a energy  substitution schemc and  pushed the construction
work of receiving reservoir.
By the completion of this work, diminution of the dependency upon
petroleum, ancl changing of lucl for the use of urban into gaseous fuel, and
effects of preventing environment lrom pollution are expected.
1.2  The Contents ot Project
This project is a construction work of LNG Receiving Terminal, which locate
in Kyonggi-do, Pyongtaek-gun, Posong-myon, Wonjong-ri.
On 198,000 m 2of site which lies west of Pyonglaek Thermal Power Plant, and
on additional  lot of 118,000  m 2 of Ievelecl grouncd, LNG  storage  tanks,
vaporization facilities piping  facilities and accessory  equipments are to
be constructed.
Therefore,  the  dredging  work  of about   125,000 m 2   for harbor and
navigation route of the LNG vessel, ancd berthing equipments for unloading
process of LNG are to be built also.
- 1-



The construciton work ot Seoul-Inchon district of laying main pipes
underground reaches to 64.7 km f'rom receiving reservoir to Seoul-Inchon
diverging point, ancl from this point 29.2 km for Seoul main pipes and 23.1
km for Inchon main pipes.
On the  other hand, dredging   amount of   navigation  route  and  harbor   is
10,800,000 m 2.
1.3  Project etfect
From the latter half ot 1984 anticipating completion pf the first stage
consiruct work of this project LNG will be usecl as subslitute of heavy fuel
oil at Pyongtack Thermal Power Plant and from the end of 1987, LNG will be
used as fuel for Inchon 'I'hermal Plower l'lant and fuel for urban l'or
Seoul-Inchon area. Thereupon, it will be el'l'ective in diminution of
petroleum dependability and environmen1al pollution in view of lNG is being
clean energy and in diminution ol air pollution by replacing anthracite
fuel for the use of urban to gaseous lNG.
On the  other hand, because   of LNG being ultra cold liqjuid, it is expected
that industries related using cogeneration should be promoted.
1.4 Principal Influences to the Environment
1.4.1 Natural Environment
1. Wheather
There will be no influence by this project.
- 2-



2. Topography, Geology
It is considered that there would be little influence by this project.
Only there will be some changes of topography of the receiving
reservoir nevigalion clrcdging, of ground site where to cast away of
dredged soil, and ol harbor lacility, and also ol' the stone pit for
building materials for this construction, work.
3.  Ocean Environment
When the project is completed, the warm draining water from existing
Pyongtaek Thermal Power Plant will bc utilized as -sea waler for
vaporizing LNG and for this reason it is considered the ellect ol the
warm draining water will be decreased about 10% and which will give
some elfect of recovering the Ocean environmen1 in Original State.
And at the time of casting away of dredged soil navigation route
dredging work, the amount of Suspended Solids (S.S) would increase
regionally beausc of outflow of mucidy watcr. But this amount will be
about 50mg/l, which is the equivalent amount in bad weather.
4.  Ecological System
So the water temperature will come clown due to this projec1, we expect
that the influence all'ecting to the Ocean ecological System by warm
draining water f'rom Pyongtack 'I'hcrmal Power Plant shouldl be clecreased
a little. And on the vicinity ol the site casting away of the dredged
soil Irom the work place ol navigation route, it is relatively high
dry beach where the various ocean organisms wouldl not survive, and it
is considerecl that the influence will be almost none to the ecologycal
system which caused by the increase of Suspended Solids(S.S), when the
drcdged soil wastled out if lhc cmbankmcnl bc built in advance.
- 3-



5. Fishery Resource
Due to this project, fishery ground casted the dredged soil and the
fishing ground in lhe vicinity of navigalion route (5 cases of direct
influence and 30 cases of indirect influence) will become either cease
to exist or be influenced a little, so it has to be adjusted by
appropriate compensation for this matter.
1.4.2 Living environment
I.  There is  no any particular   inlluence to the utilization ol land, the
nature of the atmosphere, the nature of the soil, and waste clump.
2. Noise, Vibration
The equipments ihat are sources of noise andl vibralion are to be
installated in the building, therefore there will be no influence of
them.
3. Leisure, Scenery
There isn't any particular influence
1.4.3   Socio-economic Environment
1. Population, Industries
Alter the base is constructed population will be increased and
industries will be activated.



2.  Residence
Hence the  residence hall will  he built1 al   ihe  same  lime  of  the
terminal construction, residence cnvironmcnt shall be improved.
3. Traffic
Hence the roads shall be maintained in good order prior to the
construction of the base, the overlancd transportation shall become
more convenient.
1.5   Measures and Counterplans for Decrement of Bad lnfluences to Environment
1.5.1 Counterplans lor Natural Environmenl
Bad  influences   caused  by   implantation   of this   project  is  not
remarkable.  Ilowever,  when dredged soil of navigation route is wasted,
the  amount  of  Suspendecd  Solids  (S.S)  would  increase  because  of
discharged muddy water, and we can solve this problem by building
enbankment and inner ant ierosion work.
And then we will give appropriate compensation for 3 cases of lishery
grounci in the clisposal place of dredgecl soi , ancl 5 cases of navigation
route and its vicinity.
I.5.Z  Counterplans for Living Environment
It should  be considered of  bad influences to   living  environment  by
leakage or LNG gas.
Compared %ith  LPG, weight of lING is lighter and its ignition point is
higher, so LNG has little possibility ol explosion.
- 5 -



As a advancework, it is esscntial to utilize high-safety facilities and
to improve skills of operation management for the purpose of accident
prevention.
Moreover, by the aid of detcctors, alarms, and safety cducations,
accidents can be reduced considerably.
1.5.3  Socio-economic Counterplans
Due to  the accomplishment   ot  this  project,  local  socio-economical
activities will be promoled, therelore counterplans lor bad intluences
are oa no use.
1.6 Conclusion
From now on, we think collectively influences to natural environment,
living environment, and socio-economic environment of our project.
First as for influence to natural environment, considering thc decrement of
bad influence of warm drainage by 10% , it brings some effect of recovering
ecological system.
However, when  dredge(d soil or  navigation route is wasted, Ihe amount    ol
Suspended Solids (S.S) would increase because of discharged muddy water, we
can prevent bad   influences in advance  by building  embankment   and  inner
antierosion work.
And by giving appropriate compensation lo disposing place of dredged soil
and its vicinity fishery ground, we shouldl take special attention not to
incur popular complaints.
Second, bad influences to living environment would be pollution by leakage
of LNG gas.

2.2 Aims and requirments of the Project
Econimic Planing Board has stated in May, 1980. In their long term energy
supply-demand scheme that total energy demand for 1986 will be 59,873,000
tons on the basis ol' conversion into petroleum and this shows 7.14% annual
increase compared with 1980's 39, 568,000(tons (Table 2.2-1).
In this statement the dependency of petroleum has decreased from 62.7% to
49.8% and on the contrary of this, the demand of natural gas has as a new
energy source in line with the extension of atomic energy. The petroleum
takes up an   half of energy  consumption structure.    The   resource  secure
policy  takes    of  the  oil  producing   country,  price   hike  and  biased
distribution of the crudeoil import dealer to middle east country are the
bottleneck in oil secure in the future. Thereupon it is one of urgently
required energy policy to reduce the oil dependency by adopting substitute
energy.
The supply-demand status of the urban l'uel which is directly coupled with
the national life shows that 70% of national life are rely on the fuel of
anthracite coal and production increase rate of coal become dull to show of
annual 1.2% against 4.4% of annual increasing in the supply-demand of the
fuel. It is required to convert the urban fuel to the gas as a reducing
policy measure of urban pollution and convenience sale to use as home fuel
being accompanied with national income increase in addition to the above
tact.
The natural gas is evenly scattered in the world and not only buried pretty
amount in the underground but also it, keeps stability particulary in use as
-10-



Non-pollution and high calory encrgy and rclatively the price has kept in
stable comparing with other energy and the term of LNG supply is longer
period than 20 years. Therefore it become necessary to import LNG in order
to convert urban home fuel to Gas which is enable us of long term and
stable secure of it and materialize policy of oil restriction. Hence our
country is yet in poor of performance record of LNG use and it is
impossible practically to create large quantities of demand of the urban
fuel all at once. As a first step of measure we decide to import annually
1,500,000 tons ol   LNG and use  most of   them  as  a  luel   lor  the  power
generation and in line with it build up the foundation for the gasfication
of the urban luel aiming to import 3,000,000 tons annually which is
economic unit and as a second step of measure we import additional
1,500,000 tons of LNG annually to benefit to use as home fuel in
Seoul-Inchon area and fuel as power generation as well.
LNG is need as a luel for general industry purpose in addition to power
generation and urban home fuel LNG has not only usefulness as for raw
materials of chemical industry where to utilize methane of LNG's staple
ingredient, but also anticipated it's increase of supply-demand as a fuel
for reactors, furnaces, boilers of large capacity in chemical industries
and iron and steel mills in the sence of settlement of SOx problems which
arousing from the fuel system of traditional coal and heavy fuel without
doubt. And also LNG is expected lo promole ihe relaled indusiry with the
liquified separation of Air, ultracold warehouse and, Power Generation
utilizing coldheat which is industry utilizing cogeneration etfectively at
heatexchanger in the vaporization process by about-160 °C of ultracold
liquid.

2.4 Project Effect
The natural gas has been used during last 20-30 years in various field as a
raw materials for chemical industries or as a fuel for electric power
producing industries and home as a relatively new energy source and the
amount of, their consumption has come to occupy 19% of World's primary
energy. On the other hand, we are expecting the following effects are
promising on lNG Project carrying out by our country.
1. Conversion of Fuel
As we have stated in the paragraph of the necessity of project, from
1984 we will substilute annually 1,400,000 tons of heavy fuel by
imported LNG  on Plyongtaek  'Ihermal  l'ower  and  from  1987  substitute
annually 2,550,000 tons of power producing fuel including Inchon
Thermal Power, by LNG.
On the other hand, in order to mcet thriving demand of LNG as town gas
as energy source of promising urban fuel oil, LNG including LPG will
become to be supplied to 43% of total households in Seoul-Inchon area
due to the schedule of annual LNG supply of 500,000 tons from 1987 and
1,086,000 tons from 1991.
The curtailment effects will he as shown in the following table (2.4-1)
because of the utilization of LNG as substitute luel of Petroleum and
Coal.

2. Use for General Industry
In  the   respects   of  points  that  l.NG  is  clean  energy  and  good
combustibility, LNG will be utilized ellectively as fuel oil for
general Industry and prospected in lull ol promise as raw material of
chemical compounds due to high methanc crutent in LNG - in addition to
these the correlated industry u11ilizing LNG's cryogenic will be
thriving as stated previously.
3. Protection of cnvironment
The sulfur oxides and dusts in exhaust gas from large boilers and
industrial purpose boilers usiing Bunker- C heavy fuel oil are not only
polluting atmosphere but also leaking oil and suspended particles cause
water pollution. Besides the exhaust gas of anthracite coal used as
urban luel oil Irom cr-owded towns by resident will cause not only air
pollution but also dangerous to be poisoned by gas. When LNG is to use
as substitute fuel oil, it will become not only anti air pollution but
also reduce the cause of watcr pollulion because of their rerining
process prior to liquefaction to remove alomost nearly the hydrogen
suIride and organic sulfide.
2.5  Selection Rcason of LNG Receiving Terminal
Korea Engineering Co., Ltd. being commissioned Government Survey work to
implement basic survey for site selection regarding construction of LNG
Receiving Terminal reviewed in comparison with proposed site of the
vicinity of Inchon Yool-do, Torido the vicinity of Pyontaek Thermal Power
- 25 -



Plant and the vicinity of Karorim Gulf. Among these sites, the vicinity of
Pyongtaek Thermal Plant was selected as most suitable site and this was
fixed at the ecomic minister's council in Feb. 1981 and the reason of this
site selection as noted in the followings.
1.  The big  and delinite demanding    inslitution ol Pyongtaec Ihermal Plant
is adjacent to it.
2. The effective utilizalion of warm diainage is possible and it can be
treated of the boil off gas in low pressure due to the thermal power
plant is adjacent.
3.  It is   possible to start construction work in the shortest time because
of vacant lot adjacent to lPyontacc thermal power plant as for the use
of LNG Receiving Terminal.
4.  The Icngth   of expensive  pipeline   to  Pyontacc   thermal  powcr  plant
require shortest and there are none of the problems to make use of
Power and Water.
5.  The exisling   facilities of seawater   intake and   loading/unloading   of
construction materials and equipmen1s are available.
6. The tide current flow will be Ifeble comparing with other sea area due
to the tide enbankmen1 becn conslruclcd( by inner side.

We have  advantages as above   but on the contrary we have disadvantages too
such as required   dredging work on the navigation route for transport ships
which is near of Bang-do and Ne-do. Thc schedule of the dredging work is
to start f'rom the first part ol' 1982 al'ter the engineering of dredging work
for navigation route by the end of 1981.
2.6  The characteristics of LNG project,
In LNG project, thcre arc charactcristics difl'crcnt from fucls of pctroleum
oil such as crude oil, hleavy fuel oil, and Naphtha and'they are as noted in
the followings.
l. The importation of l.NG is going through 1hc procedure of closed system
consistently from gethering of Natural gas - Liquefaction - Vapori-
zation - Consumplion and it has character to be out on production at
order basis because of the supplier and demand of it being decided at
the beginning stage.
2.  11 iFs required the special and sophisticated technique in the building
of  tramsporting   ship,   construction  of   receiving   reservoir   and
liquefaction terminal because of [.NG is cryogenic fluid of - 162 'C.
3.  It is   recluired huge capitals  to buildl various f'acilities ranging from
liquefying to receiving special technique, materials and facilities,
and also LNG project is large in scale.
-27 -



4. The purchasing contract term of LNG is normally 20-25 years of long
term and we have a critical condition to follow that ol receiving
invariable amounl annually thru it is cnergy of high rigidity in
nature.  Therefore it is required to secure stabic demander who receive
and consumc invariabily t1hc largc amouni of I.NG - in thc Iongtcrm.
5.  In order   to manage consistanily  l.NG project in  the  longtcrm   It  is
required of cblaborating technical managemcnt and controlling schedule
in  systematic   linking   with  each  factor   such   as   liquefaction,
transportation, receiving andl consuming that are project components.

3. PRESENT CONDITION OF ENVIRONMENT
3.1 Natural Environment
3.1.1   Climate
1. Climate Outline
Korea belongs to the middele lalitudinal zone and belongs to zone
of westerly wind, and in this country very variable in the climate
as it located betwecn thc Asia and the lPacific occan. In winter
season cold and dry wind from the north and north west blows,
according to the air pressure distribution of west high and east
low type. In summer season hot and humid wind from the south blows
in spring and fall season. There is no fixed direction of wind and
the power of wind is mild bul sometimes blows tempest. Northwest
wind in winter scason is eminently stonger than south wind in the
summer season, especially wind ol west coast in Korea is stronger
compared with that of east coast.
2. Seasonal Climate
(1) Spring Scason (March, April and May)
As siberia high air pressure, cold and dry continental air
group, which expanded strongly in winter season is weaker and
weaker, south and southwest winter often appears in April and
May because mobile high pressure otten passes.
- 29 -



(2) Summer Season (June, July and August)
As a continental high air pressure is sharply weaker and North
pacific high air pressure develops, high temperature and damp
south or southeast seasonal wind blows and a rain front moves
north direction so a rainy season starts from the end of June
or the biginning of July.
Form the end of July a rain front retreats and sultriness
continues Meanwhile air temperature sharply increased to the
highest temperature all around the year.
(3) Fall Season (Scptember, October and November)
As north pacific high air pressure retreats and a continental
high air pressure develops gradually to mobile. high air
pressure, a clear climate appears in this season. Northwest
or North seasonal wind blows eminently and typoon appears
considerably often.
(4) Winter Season (December, January and Feburary)
Northwest seasonal wind transports cold and dry air of siberia
air group to our country, it is very cold and dry in this
season, when this air group is weaker warm weather appears so
there is a alternation of three cold days and four warm days
as a seasonal characteriztic.
3. Climate Characteristics
According to climate observatory informations on Asan (latitute
360 47'N, longitute 1260 59'E) over the eight, years (1972-1979) of
-30 -



thc central meteorological officc, Climate characteristics of Asan
area is as follows.
(1)  Air pressure
Annual average   air pressure of   asan area  is  1016.9mb.    In
winter scason Air pressurc appears higher (December: 1025.3mb
and January :   1025.5mb) and wind velocity is high by force of
a high difference   horizontal air pressure.    In summer season
low air pressure   (July :  1007.1mb)  and   low  wind  velocity
appears to the contrary.

(2) Air temperature
Annual average air temperature of Asan area is 11.6°C and it
is comparatively warm   in spring season   meanwhile there is   a
big difference between   the highest air   temperature in summer
from the   lowest   air  temperature   in winter.    Annual   air
temperature difference is 27.3°C (lowest -2.3°C in January and
highest    25.0°C   in   July).     According   to   observatory
informations from 1972 to 1979, the extreme highest air
temperature was recorded dated July 20 1972 (35.3°C) and the
extreme lowest air temperature was recorded Dated January 24
1974 (-21.40C).
Annual average   frosl day ol  Asan area are   116 days among the
rest 77days belongs to Dccember, January and February.
(3)  Relativc Humidity
Annual average   relative humidity is   69% and   especially   in
rainy season reaches   to 76-81% annual    foggy  days  of   Asan.
(33days) are relatively   fewer than that   those of Incheon and
foggy days happen mainly in rainy season.
(4)  Amount of lPrecipitation
Annual amount of precipitation is as much as 1225.4mm and
approximately 54%    of that and   peak of is concentrated on in
June and July.    There is  sometimes   a  big  flood   in  rainy
season.
- 33 -



(5) Wind direction and velocity
Northwest wind prevails gradually from when pacific high air
pressure retrcats in Scptember to March next year. Appearance
possibility of calm   wind slower than  0.3m/sec is 3.54%    and
that of strong wind faster than 5.Smlsec is 24.7%. There are
much winds faster than 5.5m/sec in winter and spring season
and its possibility   is approximately 6.0%.     Annual  average
wind velocity is 3.7mlsec and it is at its strongest 4.4mlsec
in spring and at its weakest 3.1m/sec in summer.
(6) Other extraordinary climate
Over the last twenty years, number of typhoon invaded our
country is approxilmately 24 and it happened generally in July
and August.   Typhoon happened at   August 8   1962,  when  OPAL
landed throuth Ong-Jin peninsular its central air pressure was
989mb, its maximum velocity was WSW 21.7m and it continued
under the average velocity laster than lOm/sec for 8hours.
3.1.2   Geographical feature and nature of the soil
A geographical features and the nature of the soil of this land was
investigated  according    to  investigation  method    and  category
mentioned-belows.
(i)  Influential range   of this land  was established within 16km radius
from the center of this land (hereinafter called as "Central Area")
The establishment of a radius 16km should be proper to LNG base
-34-



construction, its danger and pollution load should be lower than
those of a atomic power plant.
(ii) Geographical feature of Central Area is Classitied into two parts
for convenicncc's sakc, that is land part and sea part. In this
part land part is mainly expressed and sea part will be expressed
later. Land part is classified into coast sand hill, alluvial flat
district, hilly distict, mountainous district and reservoir etc.
and then they are investigated. (Figure 3.1.2-1 and Table 3.1.2-1)
(iii) Investigation method was based on every kinds of references and
informations available and it was added and amended after a field
survey. Efficient work for investigation was performed during a
short period becausc an air photo was considerably correspondent to
the results of a field survey.
l. Topography
Central Area locates the central west coast side and it is
surrounded with the west face Yellow Sea, South face Asan day, East
face the provine of Pyeong-tack and North face Namyang tide
embankment.    Central Area is   mainly composed of  many   low  hilly
districts and alluvial districts etc. in consideration of all land
of Korea. Meanwhile a Coastline is rias which is complicate and
various type. From the land to submarine a gentle slope is formed
to a continental shelf. Ilowever there is a very sharp slope at the
border between the land and the sea. However there are many sharp
slopes at the border between the land and sea, especially in case
-35 -



of residual layer at the border of the land mainly because the
residual layer of this area belongs to precambrian layer and there
is a big range of tide. When the land part of this central area is
expressed in more details, it belongs to low districts within Korea
as mentioned-above and there arc no high mountains, there are only
dispersed mountains independently if any for cxample southeast face
22 km away.    Sulin mountain (363m)   and KoJong mountain   (205.8m),
Northeast face 23km away Roobong mountain (252m) arc only existing
when the center of this central area is considered. Except those
mountains there is no mountains higher than 200m within radius 20km
from lhe center.    The mounlains of   ceniral Area is  consisting of
mainly low mauntains and hilly districs around lOOm above sea
level, there is a only one small river named Moomyungchun.
In the central Area only Balanchun is flows into the Namyant-Ho, in
the area far more than 16km from the center Jinwichun and
Ansungchun are flowing into Asanmanho, Sapkyuochun is flowing into
Sapkyoho. Total distributed area of Ililly districts and mountain
area is 1.68% (13.50 km 2) compared to total area of central region
and 2.77% compared to only land part of central Area. (Refcr to
figure 3.1.2-1, 2 and Table 3.1.2-1) Area ratio of the sea part to
the land part is approximately 4:6, when the area of reservoir is
contained in the sea area, Area ratio is increasing by 3% to
4.3:5.7. Geographical feature of the land part could be classified
in  the area order   as  follows.   Low   hilly  area  (159.2   km 2),
alluvial flat area   (118.65 km 2),   alluvial  area   between  valley
(115.25 km 2), (39.25 km 2) reservoir (25.25 km 2), mountain bottom
layer (15km 2) and mountainous area (13.5 km 2), coast
-36 -



sandhill (0.65   km 2) and  othcrs   (0.25  km 2).   Low   hilly  area
occupies the main portion of type high land and it is corroded and
weathered severely because its startum mainly belongs to pre-cambic
era. Alluvial district is distributed by the lorm of type or plain
land.
It is accumulated stratrum ol sand particles which is transported
by water transport action and in principle it accompanies river and
brook etc.but type land could be easily coriroded and weathered to
alluvial district so alluvial district develops well and the
distributed   area reachs upto   233.9 km 2 (29.08%  qf total central
area and 48.03% ol' the land part).
Diluvial flateau is a convex type topography, and similar to low
hill area. But it is quite diflerent [rom low hill area that soils
property is fine   grain and soil   particles are combined compactly.
Covered area of diluvial tlateau 39.25km 2.
Over the last decade, Namyang-lake, Asan-13ay and Sapkyuchun tide
embankmen1 have been compleled an(I this results in the enlargement
of the land part and the reduction of the sea part to the contray.
The area ol reservoir is 25.25 km 2 (5. 19% compared to the land
part).   The base of   a mountain is   formed at the high mountainous
district and its area of central area is very small (15 km 2).
The area of hilly district and mountainous district totally sums
upto 13.50 km 2,   coast sandhill area   is 0.65 km 2   and others  is
0.25 km 2
-37 -



2. Geology
Suhsangun stratum is distributed largely and then the next one is
Kyunggi gneiss complex stratum. 'They belongs to to pre-cambic era.
They also belongs to schist andl gneiss which are formed by
metamorphism. The next one is alluvial layer which belongs to the
l'ourth era and is formed by weathering and erosion of the stratum.
In general the thickness of this stratum is thin hul there is a
place around the river mouth having a thickness of a stratum more
than 30m Alluvial stratum is mainly composedl ol' a small granules.

On the other sicde, diameter ol Asan gulf mooring site is about 2km,
depth ol it is 11-20m, and property ol sea bottom soils is sand or
rock. Entrance of main navigalion route is Pung-Island which
locates in northwestern ol same 13ay, the distance is about 40km,
width is about 2-4km, depth is 10-30m, but northern route is
interrupted reclamation rocky Lone 0of eastern Pang-island.
2. Wave
According to observatory inlormalions ol waves lor a year (July
1980 to May 1981) main wave clirection is NW. The possibility of
Wave height lower   than 0. 5m is  approximately  65%   in  December,
September to February except l)ecember (80-90% ), March, April and
June (95%) and    May, July and  August (100%).    The frequencies of
wave, which have wave heighl higher than l.Om ancl 2.Om are 1.2 %
and 0.3% respectively,    they happens september to July.   Meanwhile
happening days ol wave which have the height higher than l.Om is
approximately 20 days   during fall and  winter season.   Since there
isn't long-term investigation, we cannot mention about hanges of
coast line. Neverlheless, we know at present the fact that due to
the construction work of Namyan-l.ake. Asan-Lake. Sap-gyo-Lake, the
velocity of tide flow, that is, tide quantity) was decreased. It
cause accumulation phenomena ol clay on sand bar in the Bay. And,
it was cleared up that central sedimenis in ihe Bay was movecl and
increased by comparison of a maritime figure about with old one.

Observatory maximum wave is IlJ3= 2.64m and TY3= 4.5sec, Design Wave
considering 50  years is iHY3=  2.82m and IY3=  6.5sec.  (Asan  bay
Harbor survey, Junc 1981 Minisiry of Construction)
3. Tide
Tide of Asan bay is very consistent every days that have
11' + Hlo
1 =            = 0.17 and happcnes high and low cvery hall day.
Hm + Hs
The average intervals ol the llood and thc cbb ticle are 4hr 23min
and lOhr 35min respectively aftcr thc moon passcs the merdion.
These are faster by 5mins than that of Incheon respectively. There
is a little ditt'erence comparecl with Incheon as tar as high -flood
(795.4cm), avcrage  (573.2cm)  and  ebb  (357cm)  tidal  range  are
concerned.   Average sea surlace  is the lowest in February and the
highest in Augusl and   lheir  highlt diiicrence  is  arouncd 40cm.
Maximum highest and  Minimum sea level  by typhoon are 1003.8cm and
-123.36cm respeclively when  a relapse of  l00years is  considered.
Tide  levels at Asan  -bay are shown in Figure 3.1.3-2 llarmonic and
nonharmonic constants ol' tides at Nomigag are shown in Table
3. 1.3-3.  Those of Asan bay ancd Incheon are shown in Table 3. 1.3-4

4. Tidal Current
Present Condilion of Tidal Curreni al Asan Bay
Charts ot tidal current are shown in figure 3.1.3-11 - 3.1.3.13
according   to thc observation  ol tidal current.    of Asan-Bay  The
tidal  current arouncl Nomigag Shows ovcr and down tide flow happens
every half a day. over ticle starts at 0.2hr al'ter ebb and reaches
to maximum velocity(90-125cmlsec) happens al 3.2hr after ebb, down
lide  starts   at   0.3hr  bel'ore  floocl  and    maxi'mum  velocity
(90-130cmisec) happen at 3.3hr alter I'lood. Main current have a
trends towards Nomigag.    Niaximum velocity at middlc and ncap tidal
peroid comparecd with that ol spring lidlal period are al the rate of
0.70 and 0.40 respectively.

(l) Water Temperature
The water lemperature of Asan bay ranges from 2.8 lo 26.5 °C.
The diffecrcnces of %atcr temperaturc at surlace and inner layer
are around 0.3 °C in winter season and around 1.0 °C in summer
season.
According   to   continuous  record  ol   uater   temperature  at
Pyeongtack  coal lired power   plant water temperature   SOm away
from the eliluent higher than the influent by 2.7 °C in August
and by 1.9 °C in September.
According to horizontal distribution chart of water temperature
(Fig. 3.1.3-14. 15) influential area of the elfluent considler-
ing 1.0 °C increase is 1.5Km lor away.
Surface temperalure   at the end  of August ranges   from 25.4 to
26.9 °C, at the effluent (point S-2) ancl (point S-3) it shows a
little higher temperature 26.2 to 26.9 °C compared to other
area and at other points it shows similiar range 25.4 to
25.8 °C.
Meanwhile the   Aater temperature of  6m away from   the surface.
There is no big diflerence all over the points and it ranges
from 25. 2 to 25. 8 °C.
The bottom temperature shows a smaller difference and it ranges
Irom 25.0 to 25.3 'C.
The horizontal and vert ical disIribuL ion of water temperature
around the ellluent and a lidelancl are higher by around I "C
at surface and 0.3 °C at sea hollom when comparecl to those of
main waterway.

However the surface water temperature and the sea bottom tem-
peraturc of main watcrway arc 25.6 °C and 25.2 °C respectively,

(2) Salinity
Surface salinity of Asan bay at the cnd of' august '81 it shows
incrcasing trcnd from Namyang-Lake to outsidle sea, that is, S2
(23.49), S4( 27. 65). SI( 28. 01) and S.5( 29. 09).
Around Namyang-Lake, there is smaller s.alinity (23.3-25.8%) as the
river water flows into there and the salinily shos.s higher and
higher tov.ards oulsicle sea.
The density is shown is 'I'ahle 3. 1.3-15.
(it of  the front sicde  of  Namyang-l.ake  and  a  ticleland  are
compara-  tively low vertical clistribulion   of  1,4.3-15. I and
17.0-16.3  respectively,  il   has  a   high   stability   when
considering  the  surlace  and  botlom  ol main    waterway  are
17.6-18.8 and 18.6-18.8.   In summary at  the west face of main
waterway it has  a horizontal  and  vertical   uniformity  about
water temperature and salinity as a consequence of' welI mixing.
But at the front side ol Namyang-Lakc and a tidelan(d the mix ol
the water temperature and salinity is under progress because of
warm  eflluent of' Pycong-  lack 'I'hermal llower lPlant ancd a fresh
watcr of Namyang-Lake flouing into there.

(3) Chemical Oxygen Dcmand (COD)
COD of surface sea watcr ranges from 0.8 to 5.6 mg/I all the
year round. At thc main waterway (CO) ranges Irom 1.6 to 2.0
mg/l which is comparatively low and at the coast and a tideland
ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 mgIl which is comparatively high.
(4) pH
pil value ot surface sea water ranges Irom 7.8 to 8.4 all around
the year. There is no big dillerence at all arcas. According
to the record ot the end of august '81 it shows similiar to the
pH value of normal sea water (7.7-8.3) and a littlc bit higher
at the effluent whilc at the main waterway lowest value is shown
(7.7).
(5) Dissolved Oyygen (DO)
Dissolved oxygen ot the surlace sea water ranges Irom 5.8 to
6. 0, it shows saluralcd stale.
(6) Oil
The average concentration of oil contents at surface seawater
ranges from 0.8 to 5.6mg and at the main waterway, it ranges
from 1.6 to 2.0 mg/l which is very low and at the coast and a
tideland it ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 mg/i which is comparatively
high.
(7) Suspended Solids (SS)
SS of surface sea water ranges 10.0 to 60.0 mg/i throughout the
year  and   regional   annual   averagc  ranges   20  lo  37  mg/i.
Accordcing to observalory data at ihe end of August. '81, il shows
-85 -



the lowest 6.78 mg/l at the Iront side of' el'l'luent and the
highest 8.42 mg/l at the licicland. In ihe winlcr season it may
be incrased to 100 mg/I.
(8) Clarity
According to observatory data at the end of August '81 Clarity
range 1.0 to 1.4m which is very turbid and turbidity ranges 0.2
to 0.5 ppm.
(9) Nitrate
Nitrate of   surface sea water is comparatively high at the 1'ront
side of Namyang-Ho   and low at the main waterway.   In general it
ranges 1.74 to 5.76 pg-at/l
(10) Phosphate
Phosphate ranges 2.16 to 4.78 pg-at/l at surl'ace sea %a1er andl
the average is 3.20 pg-at/Il.
There is   a little ditlerence  between the Iront   side ol Namyang-llo
and main waterway as tar as chemical and physical characleristics
arc concerned, and those water qualities are within the range of
normal sea water.
At the Iront side ot' Namyang-llo it has much nutrition and its
temperature is high while at the main %alerway if has comparatively
small nutritive substance compared to the Iront sicle of Namyang-llo.
Water quality is within the range ol environmental standard value pH
(7.8-8.3). COD (lower than 3 mg/I) and DO (higher than 5.0 mg/I)

Asan bay which is typical bay in wesi coast in Korca lake charac-
teristics of river-valley area and forms a cology system influenced
comparatively strongly  by  the ocean.    Mcanwhile  it  is  a very
important as a spawning and a breeding place ol the 1 ish andl the
Crustacea. There is a increasing trencd ol culturing industry's
port ion.
1.  Intertidal Organisms
Representative  species   ol  Inlertiidal  Organisms  are  Chthamius
chal lengari, Balanus amphitrite, Crassostrea gigas ancd hydroides
ezoensis.   There   are  not many    species  and  present  existing
quantities.
2.  Submarine Organisms
Submarine Organisms is consist of mainly Annelida Polychacta of
Pcr i nerc is vancaus i ca I ci ra dent at a, andl '. nunl i a ce c.  Al t hc I ron1
side is Hanjinkak   there  is  a  big  production  ot edible Tapis

3.  Algae
Only Enteromorpha Conpressa ancd E.Limza are shown sometimes and
there is generally no algae growth on the many rocks, Gracilaria
'erruessa, Gymnogongrus  Fabellilormis and Sargassum  \'hunbergil are
not found, that is a specialty appeared in the %cst coast.
4.  Swimming Area
Among the I ishes there are 'I'ongue I sh. Mackerel, ('ommon sea bass.
Goby, MluIlet, Ilisha  elongala  and  big  eved  herring  etc,  other
octopus in Mollusca and shrimn (large) in crustacea.

1.  Mineral Resources
Underground resources are mainly distribuled at Dang,jingun. Number
of mine is 103 all together, but among then only 13 are operated
(12.6% ).
There is no metal mine, kaloine is mined as a nonmetal mine Granite
which is deposited richly at Asangun and there are many stones and
gravels deposited at many places
2. Forest Resources
In this area the need Icaved Irec is mainly distributed (Table     3.1.6)

3. Fishery Resources
A breeding fishery is prospcrous as thc tidelancl develops largely,
shell occupies 81.5%    ol the total  production,  next  one   is  lish
(7.5%) and   Crustacca   (8.4%).    In  the  beach  of  Asan  bay   and
Hwasungoon fishery resources all opulent meanwhile extremely poor at
Asangun because fishing   workers arc Iransferred to other occupations
Fisheries is this  area arc vcry   poor and thc  culturc is  main   job
because the good   fishery larm is  not lorme(l wilh lhc reason lor the
strong tidal current.

3.2.1 Land Exploitation
When land Exploitation is investigated the category and investigation
method as   mcntioneci above clause  3.1.2 are used.   Exploitation  of
land is separately investigaled lor a sea, a sandhill, a rice field,
f ield (including orchard)),  a  %%oodland,  a  Reservoir,  avillage,  a
saltfarm, a damp land ancd others (Reler to Figure 3.2. 1-1 ancl Table
3.2.1-1)
In the  larger order lor landl e\ploilation, there can be specified as
101 Iows.
A rice  lancd ( 178,47km 2), a  woodlIand ( 160,5 km 2)  a  fielcl ancd  a

Water quality of Asan-Lakc and Namyang-Lake can bc passed as potable
and industrial water resources accorciing to the decision of two
choices, to use for potabc, or to usecd lor inclustrial purpose.
Sample collected at September 10 '81 was requestecl for the experiment
potable possibility to Kycongi-Do llealth Institute. The results are
shown in Table 3.2.3-2,3.
The results of experimenl for inclusirial waler is shown Table 3.2.3-4
Asan-Lake water is used as industrial water for Pyeongtaek 'Ihermal
Power Plant because 'I'hcrc are much salt in Namyang7lake watcr up to

3. Analysis ol Pollution Sources
There arc two pollution sources, thal is Artificial ones (Industrial
waste  water   ancl  sewage  elc)  ancl natural   ones  (corrosion  and
weathering etc). There is no industrial %asle waler because only
Pyungtack Coal Firedl Power Plant e\is1s in this area and lhere is no
big problem because sea%age is casily sell-purilied.    So the effluent
of' water treatmenl and cooling ualcr coal lired power plant were
investigatcd.
(9)  Efrluent of water treatment
1) Slucdge cilluent irom coagulation and settlcmcnt tank.
2)  El I luenl conlaining suspended solidis producedl (luring back
washing
3)  Acid ancl alkali el Iluenl produced cluring backwashing
ion-exchanger.
These  eft'luent   (daily   average   300-400'Ton)   were   stored    in
neutralization tank and Coagulation, settlement and neutralization
were performed to dlischarge inlo Ihe sea water. The cluanlity and
cluality are summarizedl in 'I'able 3.2.3-S.

3. 2. 4  Soi I
This report put on emphasis on the understanding ol dlistributed area by
every soil  and their characteristics  to their sorts  and  distributed
states.  In surveying soils distributed on this site, oulline soil map,
detail soil  map and descriplion  on  soil-series  were  based  on  and
conplemented to revise lhrough reconnaissance ;
Where oulline soil map shows general aspects ol soil's formalion F'actor
such as geology, climate, topography, loromdtion period andl plants
which had been obtained from aerial pholograph data by decoding, detail
soil  map  shows   soil-scrics,  soil  type,   and  soil  phase,  while
clescription on soil-series lei us kno9 cross seclion of soil-series and
analysis data.
Survey was conlined within around   16km of radius from the site center
to the reason ot explanation al 3.1.2.
'I'hough  soil  map will  be   properly  appended  to   explain  detail
soil-series, soil-series  in soil map was too detaily   devided  to  be
illegible  their reducluedC size  and so the  soil map was omitled lo the

Soil classify with it's distributed topography in a rather small region
where climate, plants, geology and lormation are alive in their
condition.
ii) Distributed condition of soil-scrics can be easily understood in
association with topographical classilication map and description at

Generals of Soil around the Sit.c
Total survey area ol 804.25km 2has land area ol 487km 2 and sea land of
317.25km 2.
Almost all of site area composes precambrian perio(d of format.ion deeply
weathered through long period, so Ihe surlace rocks are mainly composed
of highly weathered gneiss and schist.
I'here are alomost all ol low-hill area, valley area and flat area where
in prominent part of low-hill and depression part ol valley and flat
area. The bed rock easily weathered to fine grain has been highly
weathered to have line grain-in soil texture. 'There in low-high area
mainly comprised of prominent part being mainly red-yellow podzolic
soils has its characteristics as following: Soils drains well and its
layer highly weathered is deep except low-hill area.
There are A,B,C and D laycrs, in soil, and their devision are clearly
identified ancl their structures are well developted, but erosion
partially reaches lo Ihe bottom of B layer.
This erosion has been gradually proceedecl through long time and so is
considered to have not any probolem.
- 118 -



In depression part of valley area and flat arca, soil gradients had
been flowed to form alluvial layer and mainly reprcsented to lower
humic grey soils.
These soils usually and poor drain capacity have tine grains through
deep layer.
Generally alluvial laycr companies rivcrs or water channels, the
prominent parts in the site area is so highly weathered that erosion
has developed alluvial layers in the sile area wilhoul any rever.
There are vallcy alluvium, river alluvium and sea complex alluvium in
alluvial layer, silt content in sea complex alluvium locatedl at the
lowest layer is getling larger lo go to ihe beach side.
L.ilhosols being sometimes seen at ihe low hill, hill and mountainous
area among prominent parts are mainly so distributed at steep areas
that the soil has good drain condilion, thin laycr and conlains coarse
grains.
Regosols located at the foot of low-hill, hill or mountainous arca are
mainly comprised at the sediment layer made by alluvial and alluvial
movement.
The soil has average depth and its lormation was not, considered not so
old or new but gradually proceeded for the long time and its color
shows brown or red brown. And alluvial soils, saline soils, planosols
and sand beach and sand dune are partially distributed.

In case of writing the characteristecs of Soils-series, we quoted the
Characteristecs   of Typical Soils  by Soils-series that   had been examined,
classified, and maked by the office of Rural Development.
(1) Kongdok-series
Kongdok-series belongs to low humic gray soils and it has Apg layer
of gray or dark gray silty clay loam and has cambic Bg layer. Cg
layer begins at the depth ot 50cm- 70cm from the surl'ace of' ground
and it has peaty mincral layer which is more than 50cm in depth.
'I'his soils-series covers over valley area, valley ,alluvium layer ot
sub-flat area, and border ot' river alluvium layer and river & sea
complexed area.
Drainage of the soil is poor,, ancd soils property of this is silty
clay loam whose silt and clay (<(0.05mm) is below than 80% in A, B
layer.
Its covered  area is 7.12km 2   an(d occupies 1.46%   ol  this  site.
Soils reaction is Pll 4.5-5.5 and organic matter content is 3 -5%
in A, B  layer but C   layer has no  less  than   10^-30%   of  peaty
mineral layer.
(2) Kimje Siries
Kimje series   belongs to low  humic gray soils and it has Apg layer
of grayish brown very l'ine sandy claycy and loamy soils and has Bg
layer of very iine sandy clayey soils ancl Cg layer of greenish gray
very fine loamy sandy soils. And this layer comes out. in the depth
of 50cm- 70cm and it has peat layer less than 20cm in depth.
This Soils covers over river andi sca complexed area and its area is
about 18.45km 2(3.79%)
-122 -



Dranage of soils is a bit poor.   And as for soil property silt and clay
(<0.05mm) is  more than 85%,    B layer is plcnly ol clay   (<0.002   mm)
amount ot  60%.   A, C layer is plenty of silt (morc than 50%) and its
clay is less than 35%. Soils reaction is to the extent of Pi-I 5.0-6.1
And organic matter conlent is excepl for peat layer, 2% or so in A,B
layer, and 0.5% or so below peat layer in C laycr.
(3) Mam-gyong series
Man-gyong series is similar to Kimjc series, so we will explaine
differences only.   Topography,  slope, soil cirainage,  geology, and
names of great  soil group is just the same of kimje series, but it
locates in beach  so that soil   property is dificrent.   Ancl it  is
particular  that very fine   sand is  plenty,  as  silt content    is
60- 70%.
Soils reaction is relatively high Pl exce:pt for A layer (about PH
5) on account that subterranean water is alflfected by sea water. PH
7-8 in B layer, a little more than Pll 8 in C layer, and organic
matter content is less than 1.5%.
Coverecd area  is considerably broacd and occupies aboul  5.87%    ol
central area ol site.
(4) F'u-yong series
Pu-yong series  belongs to lo%   humic gray soils and layer consists
of Apg layer ol grayish brown very l'ine sandy loamy soils, and Btg
layer of gray  or clark gray  spotted very fine  sandy clayey soils,
and Cg layer  ol very lfine  sancly clayey soils.  Ihis soils covers
over river and sea complexed alluvium layer and its area is
broaciest ol central area of site up to 11.93% (58.08koM).
- 123 -



Soil drainage is a bit poor ancl as for soil property, it is fine grain
soils and silt content is 50% -60%, and clay is to the extent of
25% -47%.
Soil reaction is at surface soil Pl' 6.4 and as the depth increases PH
riscs all the more.
Organic material weight is about 2.5% Irom surlace soil to underground
in depth of 40cm, but less than 1% in lower layer.
(5) Songiong series
Songjong scrics belongs to red-yellow podzolic soils. And A layer
of brown scrics   loamy soils, Bc   layer of red-ycllow series clayey
loamy soils, and C layer forms thick layer with soil property of
sandy loamy soils   which is saprolite   of   red-yellow  acidic   rock
system.
This soils is largely developed in rcsidual layer, but it covers in
the vicinity   of site over   residual layer of hill, and its area is
30.55km (6.27%).
Slope ot surface is range of 7-30%, and on excessive slopes, cases
exl)osed to the lower part ol B layer by severe weathering is found
frequently.
Soil drainage is good, and it is common case that C layer contains
rock fragment to the e\tent ol 3-8%.
Soil reaction ot Pll 4.8-5.1 degree is representative vlauc and
organic metters is 4% in layer, but since It decreases as down to
B layer and C laycr, it precipitates to less than 1% at B3 layer.
--124-



(6) Osan series
Osan series belongs to red-yellow podzolic soils andi it l'orms soils
section with A layer which contains 25-30% of gravel cambic B
layer which conlains 7-15% of gravel, and C layer which is consist
of conglomeritic sandy loamy soils mixed with red-yellow and brown
series. 'I'his soils generally covers over hill to mountain area,
but by the reason that the vicinity of site is plenty of hills,
this soils covers over low hill or hill largely, and its area
reaches   to 32.37km' (6.65%).   Because   this  soils  was   made  in
residual layer of granitic gneiss, weathering of bed rock is
severe.    So layer of  soil is very   thick  counting   in  saprolite
layer.
Since slope of surface is 15% -60% , places %asted out on account
of severe erosion is lound frequently, and drain condition of soil
is satisfactory.
Soil reaction   is PH 5.4-5.8   lhrough all  ol'  lhe  layer,  organic
matter content is around 2%, and gradually decreases as descend
into lower layer, about 0. 2% in U2 layer.
(7) Okchon series
Okchon series belongs to low humic gray soils. And then, Apg layer
of grayish brown series loamy soils, Bg layer ol dark gray series
fine sandy loamy soils with a bil, of' FeCO 3(iron carbonate) spots,
and Cg layer of dark gray series fine sandy loamy soils with a bit
of FeCo 3 forms section of this soils.
This soils developed Irom alluvium layer located in valley area, so
drain condition of soils is not satislactory, and covered area
reaches lo 29. 2km (6%).
-125-



Slope of surface is around 0-7% , but there is no influence of erosion
on account of alluvial area.
Soil reaction is less than pll 5, and organic matter content is around
3% in the all layer.
(8) Yong-ji series
Yong-ji series is one ot a int.ermediate type soils of alluvial
soils and red-yellow podzolic soils. In Apg layer ol grayish brown
series fine sandy loamy soils and in cambic B layer of yellowish
brown series fine sandy crayey loamy soils there is gray spots.
And, the   seclion of soils  or c layer is composed of black, brown,
gray spots, and ol grayish brown very line sandy soils.
This soils locates in upper part of valley area, and drain
condition of soils is somewhat satisfactory, covered area is kmi
(9.38% ), and its bed rock is alluvium layer.
Soil reaction is P1l 5.9-6.5 anci organic matter content is 2.4% in
surface soils, which (Jecreases gradually up to 1% in basic layer.
(9) Won-gok series
Won-gok series belongs t.o regosols, and section of soils consists
of AP layer of brown or dark brown very fine sandy loamy soils,
cambic B layer of yellowish brown series very fine sandy clayey
loamy soils, and ol C layer which is yellowish red or dark
red-yellow claycy soils.    This soils covers   over  lower  part  of
convex area, upper part ol concave area, which is initial part of
bottom area ol mountain and valley area.
-126 -



Covered area   is 46. 05km (9.46%), ancl then slope of' surl'ace is 2% or
15%. But since this is sediment arca, there is no erosion.
Soil reaction is PH 4.5 or so in A layer, around PlI 5.2 in dccper
layer.
(10) Chisan series
Chisan series belogns to loN% hlumic gray soil. There is yellowish
brown and yellowish red spots in AP'g layer ol' dark grayish brown
loamy soils.
Cg layer   consists ol mixed   with spots on   dark gray loamy soils.
Bed rock of these is valley alluvial layer, and covers over
central area of the valley mostly, and covered ared is 27.08kmn
(5.56%).    Slpc of surface is 2-15%, but there is no influence of
erosion by the reason that the property ol this area is alluvial.
Soil drainage is not so satisf'actory. Soil reaction is about pH1
5.1 - 6.5.
(11) Others
Relatively littile important series are omittecd in this project
outline. Confer to 'I'able 3.2.4-1, ancd we finish to explicate.

4. Soils Pollution
Soils consists of weathering materials ol' rock, animal or plant's
soluble material, and water or gas lhat. contains variable substances.
Therefore,   if   hazardous  substances   alfecting   organisms  by    bad
influences, through the process ol transmission, dif'fusion, dilution,
and precipitation convcrls that substances into not harmful substances,
that is, passes purilication.
Soils pollution can bc clevidcd into two classcs of direct pollution and
indirect pollution.
By the  time,   the  main  subiect  of   pollution  sourcc  is  hazardous
substances (harml'ul substances f'or organic systems which is produced in
the result of' human aclivity.
Direct pollution is thc casc that human brings hazardous substance into
contact with   soils directly,  inclirect  pollution  is  the  case  that
pollution sourse contained in air or water Ilows in soils.
Since there   are few comanics handling harmful things, direct pollution
which is caused by human mistakes is not d serious matter.
Indirect pollution   is caused by  pol lt Iion olF primarily  air or waIer,
but as air pollution and watler pollution has not been mentioned
seriously, it is necessary ihat we should investigate the nature of
environment, ecological system ol' this area, living environmcnt, which
are responsibilities that means conscience ol manager.
If the extent of' polltion is very small, purilication ot soils will aid
us slowly. LNG is gas state, so wc shouldJ look into possibility of air
pollution specially.

3.2.5   Waste
In this area, there is not a place or lactory producing incdustrial
waste at present.
3.2.6   Noise, Vibration, Nasty smell
Identification of noise is generally "unwilling sound", but there is no
source which  producing noise provoking psychological sense of human in
this area.
Though there are noises of operation by Pyongtaek Thermoelectric Power
Plant  isolated 1'rom  residence  geographically,  on  account of   its
location ancl sound effect by site separation, it cloes not transmit out
of plant shell.
We can classify source of noise in Thermoclectric Power Plant by FD Fan
(installed outside  of building), Boiler Turbin,   Building,  and  Main
transformer.                                     I
In Pyongtaek Thermoelectric Power Plant, for the purpose of surveying
noise lcvel ol the plant, seiectecl measuring point in 7 place, and
measure monthly.
Noise level  measured Irom January to June in '81 is described in 'Table
3.2.6-1.  In this 'I'able, the heighest  level point  is  back  door of
ol'tice  of conslrucl ion work  neighboring Fl) FAN, noise level is 41 NRN
in average.
There are no new f'actory or company entering in this area since '79 and
no particular  increase of traffic.   So it is considered that quoted
data is not surpassed.
Point of measure ancl noise level measuredl is as chart 3.2.6-1 and Table

possession rate seems to bc causecl by low ratc of urbanization.
3.3.4   Trattic
Distance from Chunan-intcrchangc of' Scoul-Pusan llighAay to Asan- Bay
area is 25km.
As for railroad, it is 20km distance Irom l'yongtack. Asan-Bay arca is
the startig point of 38'th National Road, and Inchon-Kunsan westcoast
highspeed road will be go through Asan-Dikc. Thercfore, though it is
inconvenient at present, it leaves much room for improvement.
In this area, total distance of roadis is 1,484 km, and pavement ratio
is no more than 15.5%. Compared with 48.4% ol National ratio, it
proves bad road status of this area.

4. INFLUENCE ON ENVIRONMENT
4.1 Natural Environmcnt
4.1.1 Weather
Weather change duc to construction of the LNG base is not expected.
4.1.2  Topography and Gcology
A signilicant change in topography and geology due to proposed project is
not expected, but some minor change in topography such as the base site
for the facilitics, the sea lane to be dredged, the disposal area for the
dredged soils, the port facilities, and the quarry for construction
aggrcgates.
The base site and the disposal area will be filled with dredged soils
from the bottom of the proposed sea lane and ship turning area, and the
details are tabulated in Table 4.1.2-1.

4.1.3 Oceanic Environment
Oceanic environmental change due to the proposed project would be the sea
bed 1opography,   the depth and/or  suspended substances of Ihe sea waler,
etc., and the details are followed.
1) Sea-bed topography
UJpon completion of' the filling works on lhe LNG base site and the
reclaimed land of the disposal site, some modification of the water
ways of the   area is expected.  1Bccause the width   and depth of  the
water ways are in relation of the quantity of fresh water, their size
would be same as present. 'I'hus moclification ol' the water ways to
reach the equilibrium section will be continued for some period after
filling works.
Since a  ship turning area (diameter of 900m) in the inport and a new
sea lane (Length ot about 30km ancl width of' 400m) in outport are
planned to be constructed in the tuturc, ihe sea bed will bc dredged
up to the level of-14.Om from the present level that ranged between -
4.Om and +20.Om.    Expected amount of   the soils to  be  ciredged  and
abancdonecl are 1abulaled in 'I'abIe 4. 1.3-1.

Remark : The soil amounl lo be disposed is incrcased to 30% from the
dredgecl soil.
2) Watcr tempcraturc
A major lactor in the change ol' water quality due 'to the proposed
project is a dIrop in the water temperature. The amount of the sea
water for lNG vaporization is as l'ollows :
For Low pressure      90 T LNGIll x 40 T SW/T LNG  =    3,600  T/H
3,600 T/ll x 3 I'umps        =   10,800  T/H
For Hligh Pressure    5,100 T/ H x 4 P'umps        =   20,400  T/H
I'otal                             =   31,200  TI/H
8.67 m 31 sec
- 145 -



The sea water for LNG vaporization is cooled down at a rate of 4 C
when discharged. The total amount of the warm water discharged from
the Pyungtek Thermoelectric l'ower Slation woulci be 4 generator Units
including additional 2 Units to be completed in March 1992. Total
amount of the warm waetr dIischarged from 2 and 4 units is computed as
follow :
Present         6,417 m 3/sec x 2 each \ 2 units = 25,670 m 31sec
Future          6,417 m 3/sec x 2 each x 4 units = 51,340 m 31sec
The temperature dilference between the discharged watcr and the local
sea water   would be assumed to be approximately 8 C.   Thus, a drop of
water temperature is expecteci when the cool water discharged from the
LNG Plant is mixed lo the warm waler dischargecd from the Pyungtek
Thermoelectric Power Station, i.e., the total hcat amount of the warm
water from the Power Slation is
51.34 m 3/sec x 8 C,
and the total heat loss of the cool water from the LNG Plant is
8.67 m 31sec x (-4 C),
thus, the resulting temperature increase is computed as follow
151.34 m 3/sec - (8.67m 3/sec x 4/8)1 x 8 C
= 47.00 m 3/sec x 8 C
- 146 -



The water temperature increased by the discharged water from the
Power Station will be lowered about 8.5 % due to the cool water
discharged from lhe l.NG Planl, which reduces had influence on the
oceanic envirionment.
For determining the area (Al) ol which surface water temperature is
increased more than I C duc to the amount Q of warm watcr with "Od
higher temperature than the local water temperature, Sinden proposed
an empirical equation as follow :
Log Al = 1,226 log Ocl. 0 + 3,686
The diffused area obtained from the above equation for each case is
tabulated in Tahle 4.1.3-2.
Table 4.1.3-2 Diffused Area ol the l)ischarged Warm Water

The diffused area of the warm water discharged from 2 units of
Pyungtek Power Station is computed dS 3.33 km 2which is slight less
than the surface area 3.9Km 'of the small bay in front of the Namyang
Lake during the neap tide and the high tide water period.
147 --



The diflused  area becomes 7.77 Km 2lor operation ol 4 units and 6.97
Km 2for operation ol   4 units and  LNG  pinat,  which   indicated  10%
reduction of the diffused area by operalion of the LNG planl.
As conclusion, the installation of the LNG plant reduces bad
influence caused by the warm waler (lischarge(l from the Pyunglek Power
Station by reducing about 10% of the diffused area of warm water
having I C higher temperature than the local water temperature.
3)  Suspended substances
The amount of the suspended substances in the water along the major
water ways around Ahsan L3ay is relatively high as estimated to 10 -50
mg/I. During the filling %ork on the base site and disposal site by
transportation ol sea bed soils %ith a pump dredging barge, the
amount of the suspended substances would be increased temporary at a
certain area due to discharging the muddy water, but the amount would
be limited to 50 mg/l which is the same amount during.
Since the  size of soil   parlicles at botlom of' the ship turning area
and sea lane is mainly ranged between fine and coarse sands, i.e.,
0.10± 0.30 mm in diameler, the amount    ol  clay  lo  be  suspended
during discharging the dredge(d soils wouldl be small.
4.1.4  Ecosystem
Total amount   ol the discharged  water Irom the  LNG plant is   relatively
small (4.34 m 3/sec, 4C clecrease) comparing to that from the Pyungtek
Power Station (51.34 m 3/sec lor 4 units, 8 C increase). Even though the
water temperature gives an influence on a biota as well as growth of
oceanic leves, it is not expected to change of an ecosystem by increasing
ol I C in the water lemperalure.
-148 -



Thus no physical, chemical, and thermal inf'luence to the lives are
expected by provicling the cool waler from the vaporization facilities.
Especially for the thermal influencc, as previously mentioned, the cool
water reduces bad influence induced by the warm water discharged from the
Pyungtek Power Station by reducing 10% of the diffused area.
The amount. of suspended substances clue to disposal of the soils dredged
from the sea lane of outport and bay, is expected the amount of 50 mg/l,
which is a similar amouni (luring al shallow parl of' lhc Ahsan bay. Thus
the ecosystem would not be influenced due to the suspended substances.
4.1.5 Natural Resources
Upon conducting   the lNG project, no natural resources will be influenced
except, the fishery resources.
Major influences are that a few fishery places to be closed due to
lilling l'or the base site and disposal site, and the amount of catch to
be reduced due to increasing of suspended substances during discharging the
dredged soils.
As shown in Table 3.1.5-1, three fishery places will be completely
closed, two l'ishery places in the sea lane ares will be partially
damaged, and thirty fishery places will be indirectly influenced.

4.2 Living Environment
4.2.1 Land Use
Generally, no environmental iniluence on the land use due to LNG project
is expecled, cxccpt the area dircc1ly rclatecd to the lNG plant such as
adjacent area lo the LNG lacilities, quarry area, new road, site
clearance area etc.
4.2.2  Air Quality
Since the fuel of boiler is planned lo be replaced with lNG, no S02 is
anticipated, and amount   ol NOx would  be   limited  to  maximum   100  ppm
hecause ol' lhe low NOx burner lo be employed.
4.2.3 Water Environment
Not applicable.
4.2.4 Soil Conclilion
Generally, no   environmental iniluence on   the soil condition  due to LNG
project is expected, except the area directly related to the LNG plant
such as acljacent. area lo the l.NG Iacililies, quarry area, new road, sile
clearance area etc.

4.2.6 Noise, Vibration, and Stench
Even though there are major sources of noise and vibration such as ORV
(Open Rack Vaporizer), boiler, air compressor, sea water pump, gas
sending pipe etc., all those are placed in the building and thus only a
minor iniluence is expected.
4.2.7 Leisure and Scenery
Not applicable.
4.2.8  LNG Characteristics and Prevention of Pollution
I) Characteristics of LNG
Natural gas contains a varying amount of carbonic acid gas, hycirogen
sulfide, moisture elc. depending on the gas well. Because the carbonic
acid   gas   and  hydrogen  sulfide  among   inpurilies  can  corrode   the
facilities ancl the moisture can be a cause of an accident by freezing
during process, those impurities arc removed during the refinement of
LNG.
During the liquefaction process of the natural gas to produce the LNG,
uncompressable gas such as nitrogen which has lower boiling point than
methane,  and   hydrocarbon   which   is  heavier  than  the  methan,   are
separaled. As the resull, lhe concentration of the methane in the LNG
is very high and thus the characteristics of LNG can be considered as
same as the characteristics ol the liquefied methane for convenience.
--151 -



The LNG has a boiling point of about -162 C under atmospheric pressure.
It has no corrodability due to scparation of impurities and does not
produce scale on the surface of the thermo-transferring plate in the
thermo-transformer. In casc of vaporization following the leakage of
LNG, the LNG is slightly hcavier than air at the extremely low
lemperature (below -110 C), bul it becomes lighter than air by
increasing temperature. Thus there is a rare possibility to explode by
concentration of LNG at lower place like as propane gas.
Since the LNG has a blue frame without smoke and does not produce
oxidized sulfide when it is burned, it is called a cl,ean energy with
high safety.
For reference, the chemical composilion ol Ihe Indonesian LNG to be
imported by Government is consist ol melhane 86.96%, ethane 8.40%,
propanc 3.66%, bulanc 0.92%, and nilrogen (1.05%. Some charactcristics
of methane which is a major component of LNG, and propane and butane
which are major componenis of' LPG are labulated in 'I'able 4.2.8-1.

2) Prevention of Pollution
Since the LNG does not produce oxidized sulfide, dust, and suspended
substances as well as the nilrogen oxi(le which is ancd issue today, the
air pollution can be significantly reduced by using lING as the
generating luel.
- 153 -



Further more if the urban fuels of coal and the industrial fuel of oil
are substituted with LNG, the water pollution source such as ash, dust,
leaked oil besides the harmful gases, would reduced, which is good for
the environmental preservalion.
Based on the literatures, the discharged quantity of the pollutants from
the LNG and other luels is compared in 'I'able 4.2.8-2

4.3 Social and Economical Environment
4.3.1 Population
T'otal man-days  required wouldi be  aboul 700,000 for   the construction of
the LNG Plant and the employee ol' 120 will reside at site for operation.
The rural population uouIcl not be clecreased by the proposed project.
4.3.2   Industry
Inronworks shops and ship repair factories as the related industry are
expected and the following second and thircl industries will be increased.
4.3.3  Habilation
Because of a sudden increase of population for construction, there would
be some housing problems during the construction, but the houses l'or the
employee to be constructed will provide better livint space.

5. Reduction Plan AND Countermeasure for Bad Inlfluence
5.1 Natural Environment
5.1.1 Weather Condition
No wcather change is expected dLIe to the LNG project, and thus any
reduction plan for the ba(d inlluence on environment is not necessary.
5.1.2  Topography and Geology
No bad influence on topography and gelogy is expectecd due to the LNG
project.
5.1.3  Oceanic Environment
Bad influence on lhe oceanic cnvironment caused by the warm waler
discharged from the Pyungtek Power Station will be recluced at a ratio of
10 IA by  the cool water  clischarged form the  LNG Plant.  It, however, is
required to install the revetment and inner lilter on the embankment to
prevent an overflow   of the mudciy  water during discharging  the  dredged
soils.
5.1.4  Ecosystem
Since bad influence onthe oceanic environment caused by the warm water
discharged irom the Pyungtek Poser Station will be reduced at a ratio of
10 % by  the cool water   discharged from the LNG 1l3nat, no countermeasure
is requirecd to reduce an influence on the ecosystem. Ilowever, the amount
ot the suspended   substances should be   reduced to protect  any change of
the ecosystem by installation of the revetment and inner filter on the
embankment.

5.l.5 Natural Resources
As a countermeasure to minimize the bad influence on the fishery
resources, the revetment and inner filter on the embankment is required.
Upon completion of' the LNG planl, no more bad influence on the fishery
resources would be expected.
5.2 Living Environment
5.2.1 Land Use
A significant changc in the land use is not .anticipated, but a
countermeasure to prevenl a cold-weather damage to the corps along the
LNG pipe line installed at the farm land is required. For this measure,
the pipe line should be placed at least l.Om below the ground surface.
5.2.2  Diffusion of Gas and Prevention of D)isasters
As mentioned previously, the lNG is very effective to prevent the
pollution, but because of the cxtremely low temperature of the LNG, the
construction materials l'or the plant should be carcfully sclected and
also  some   high  construction   technology  is  required.    Further  more
prevention measure against to the fire and the loss of lives by leakage
of the LNG, should bc pcrfectly set. T'he sal'ety may bc kept up through
the training l'or a skilil'ul operation and f'or a prevention of' disaster.
These perfect prevention measure against to the disaster would reduce the
fear and Ihe damage of lhc adjacent resident.
-158 -



1) Diffusion of gas
If the LNG which is liquefied at a extremely low temperature of -162 °C
under an atmospheric pressure, is leaked on the ground surface, it will
be immediately evaporated due to 1) a conducted heat from the ground
surface, 2) a convected heat of air, and 3) a cmitted heat from the sun.
The vaporized gas of low temperature will condense the moisture in the
air by showing a while cloud which will be diffused into the air by the
wind.
Because the vaporized gas at a room lemperature has a half weight of
air, it is easily dilfused. llowever, the gas is heayier than air at a
low tempcrature (-110 °C). thus it sprcads out on the ground surface
immediately afgter   leakage.   Iherelore, 1he  lNG facilities   should  be
dlesigned to have an anti-fire measurc by considering 1) spread of LNG
surface, 2) gasification condition of I.NG, 3) diffusion behavior of gas,
4) characteristics ot combustion and extinction.
Since the   dliffusion of gas  is depend not only on the weather condition
such as the air temperature, the wind velocity, and the gas temperaturc,
but also on the geometry of the ground surface and the thermal capacity,
the correct estimation   of the dillusion   condlition is pretty difficult.
The  simulation   test  of  LNG   leakage  to  understand   its  diffusion
character is now   under perlorming in several countries, and some of the
condition has been understood.
-159 -



Because the 5 % concentration of the cliffused l,NG as a lower limit of
ignition is in the white cloud, thus the range of safety for the leakage
is clear which is lhe characlerislics ol lhe vaporized l.NG. When 1he
diffused gas is ignited by an ignition source which may be a cause of
fire, it is   burned with a  yellowish   red  frame.   Thus,   in  the  LNG
facilities, the air tight measure is required to prevent a gas leakage
into the closed space in the building.
And by employing the boil off gas system, the inner pressure of the gas
storage tank should be kept a liltle higher than the almospheric
pressure so that no air could Icak inlo the tank.
2) Prevention measure of disaster
(I) Basic policy
First of   all, the basic  policy on Ihe   prevention of disaster is the
prevention an accident. before it happens, and if it, happened, it
should be minimized and recovered quickly so that it cannot give a
serious influence to outside. Followings are the basic prevention
measure adopted commonly.
a) Employing the facility type with high salety
b) Perfection on the facilities including dtesign and construction
c) Installation   of   prevention   lacilitics  considering   the  charac-
teristics of LNG which is and extremely low temperature and
combustible   liquelied   gas,  by   improvement   of   technology  for
operation and maintenance etc.
- 160 -



i) Prevention ol accident belore happens
Basic countermeasure to prevent an accident before it happens is as
follow :
- Establishment of a perl'ect restoration system
- Establishment ol a perfect operation system
ii) Minimizing accident
Basic countermeasure to minimize and restore rapidly for the happened
acciclent is as follow :
- Early discovery of abnormal condition
- Rapid Irealment after discovering the acciclent.
i.e., rapid recover of abnormal conclition and prevention of the
expansion of the condition to the other part
2) Countermeasure facility for abnormal event
(I) Early discovery ol' abnormal evenl
In order for early cliscovery of an abnormal evenl, the monitoring
system such as a low temperature indicator, a combustible gas
indicalor, and a high temperature indicator l'or ignition, should be
established.   'I'hose e(luipmenl i.s (lescribedl in follow ing
- 161 -



i) Equipment for gas leakage indicator and warning
In order for early discovery ol the LNG leakage, this equipemtn is
installed on thc LNG storage tank, intakc facility, pump facility,
etc. The contact combustive type and the semicon(luct type may be
used. The standard warning level is 25% of the lower limit of
explosion.
ii) Equipment lor low temperature inclicalion and warning
In order to aware the lNG leakage at early stage ancl to complete
the gas leakage   indicalor, lhis equipmenl   is  inslalled  in  the
licluid collecling trench and sump in lhe embankment. The type of
indicator is thermoelectric or gas expansion type.
iii) Equipment lor fire in(licator and warning
This is installed for indication ol' frame during the combustion of
vaporized gas. The high temperature indicator with thermoelectric
type may be used.
(2) Treatment facility aftcr discovery ot abnormal event
In order  to minimize the   leakage amount ol  LNG, the liquid   in  the
storage tank should be rapidly transported to the safe place and the
place of leakage should be blocked for separation from other place.
Further more, a liquid capturing dike and an antivaporization facility
such as a high foam producer are required as a countermeasure against
to a large amount of leakage.
-162



The fixed type of a fire extinguishing power ejector and a high foam
producing lacility may he used in combination.
For the piping facility, it is basically same as the st.orage tank, but
the  blockage   by  valves  is  acicditionally  attempted.  And  a  fire
extinguishing power ejectlr to re(luce  the Irame in case of combustion
on the vaporized gas, is installed.
For the purpose of minimizing ol the hazardous surface area due to the
vaporized gas of the LNG leakage, ihe water curtain is installecd.   The
water curtdin will restrain a horizontal spreading ol' gas andl allow
the upward diffusion   of the gas.   'I'hose are the  firsJ step  of  the
prevention against to the abnormal evcnl.
The second   step of' the  measure may be  divi(decd into two  categories.
One is the prot.ecltion of' t.he lacilities 1'rom high temperature, i.e.,
an installation   of  a coldl waler  sprinkler on the storage tank.  The
other is the prolection of the lacilit.ies I'rom low temperature. Some
ol the facilities such as the rool of storage tank, piping rack, and
other lacilities macde  by a carbon  steel, are very   brittie at a   low
temperature. 'I'hus, a protection cover against to a low temperature is
required for those facilities.
- 163 -



(3) Central control system
The central control systcm has lunclions lor prevention and warning by
analyzing all the information collected through several types of
indicators installcd at thc facilities. The system consists of a
warning indicating part, an emergency shut-oil control part, and an
answer-back indicating part, and its major facilities are as follow
i) Abnormal indicator
Combustible  gas    indicator,  low  temperature   inclicalor,   high
temperature indicator : as described previously.
ii) Monitoring facility (industrial TV)
It %ill be installed to monitor all the storage tank area.
iii) Emergency paging facilities
a) An exclusive line or wireless phone as a paging facility between
Ihe storage  tank area and   the central control  center, will be
installed for an emergency communication.
b) A siren or a broadcast system lor emergency announcement to
cover all work area, will be required.
iv) Signal conversion and communication lacility Because a common
thermometer used lor a high or low temperature indicator and other
facility for early discovery are generally based on the analogue
indication, the signal conversion and warning facilities are
installed lor  compleltion.  These inlormalion  is processed  by  a
micro-computer with a multi communication facility in the control
center.
-164-



v) Emergency shut-off
a) An emergency shut-off will be installed in the pipe line near
by the storage tank in case of emergency.
b) The shut-otf should be worked by hand as well as by remote
control syslem.
c) In order to prevent an overtlow of the storage tank, a liquid
level indicator will be installed, and the shut-olt should be
operatedl immedliately aler  lhe  warning  sign.
d) Both the   remolte conlrol and  hand operation  ot  the  shut-off
should be possible during an interruption ol' electric power by
an earlhqluake or other disasler.
vi) Control of tire extinction lacility
a) Both the   remote  control  and  hand  operation   tor  the  tire
e\tingusihing   powder  ejeclor  and  1he   high  foam  producing
lacility should be possible.
b) Both the   remote control and  t.he hand operation  of the  water
curtain ancl sprinkler system should be possible.
ii) Others
A disply syslem such as CR1' is required in the central control
center for visal   check ol  information  on   (lemand  and  for  the
simulation of all the system at the same time.
- 165 -



3) Security education and training
A regular education and training program on the security may be required
against to an emergency case. An active attcndancc on the regional
training for   the disasler prevenlion under government conlrol, is highly
encouraged. The edlucalion and training on the employce are for the
purposes of a skilllul operalion through a fully understanding of the
facilities as well as the characterislics ol LNG. Both education and
practice for the prevention and extinction ol the fire may be regularly
performed. It may be required to organize an adequate prevention team
and emergency connecting level for a given location apd a size of a
disasler and   may  need  a  regular  practice   lor  emergency.    In  real
practice, folowing should bc included.
(I) Practical training for fire cxtinction
i) Rapid  fire   extinction   by  using  a  water   curtain  and  a  fire
extinguishing power ejeclor.
ii) Approach to the shut-off controller by protecting the frame with a
water curlain.
iii) Measure on the size and magnitude ol the lire source compounded with
a lcaked liquid and vaporized gas.
(2) Mock Training
i) Countcrmcasurc for a mock event on the plant, and an order and
report to the persons in a relevanl position.
- 166 -



(3) Disposition training
i) Report of the fire and cmergency mobilizat ion wilh necessary eqjuip-

(4) Direction and communication lraining
i) Direction ol' director basecd on the judgmcnnt for a given situation.
ii) Oral and wireless communication lor the direction.
(5) Assessment of training
i) The overall  Iraining conducled( regularly is assessed to improve the

7. Overall Assessment and Conclusion
7.1 Natural applicable
7.1.1 Weather
No weather change is expected by the proposed project.
7.1.2  Topography and Geology
Only few change of topography and geology is cxpccted by the proposed
project at a limited area such as the base site to be cleared, the sea
lane to be dredged, the port lacilities to be installed, and the quarry
for the construction materials. Especially for ihe reclaimed area, the
revetment and inner filter on the embankment are expected in advance.
7.1.3  Oceanic Environment
Since the difference in lidal level to Ahsan Bay is large as a maximum 8m
and its velocity is also high as a maximum 125 cm per second during the
major tidal period, the sea water will be %cll mixed ul) in the Bay. The
cooling water used for the l'yungtek Power Station will be discharged at a
rate of 51.34 mUscc (for 4 unit operation), at temperature of 8 C higher
than the local sea water, thus it increases the water temperature to I C
on the surface area of approximtely 7 kW. By construction of the LNG
base, a part of the warm waler (8.67 m31sec) from the power station is
cooled down about   4 C, so   lhat the bad  iniluence by ihe   warm water is
decreased about 10% in terms of the surface area of sea water.
Because of the high wave due to the high tidal velocity in the Ahsan Bay
during winter season, the amount of suspended substances in the water is
pretty high as 10 to 50 mg/i along the main sea lane. Further more, the
amount of suspended substances would be increased temporary by dredging
- 172 -



the bottom of the proposed sea lane and ship turning area, and by
overflowing of muddy water from the   disposal area of the dredgedl soils,
but the amount would be limitedl to 50mglI because the soils constist of
fine to coarse sands of 0.10 to 0.3 mm in diameter. The bad influence
can be decreased  by installing the   revetment and inner  tilter  on  the
embankment in adivanced lo disposal the dredged soils.
7.1.4  Ecosystem
The oceanic biota of the Ahsan B3ay shows a characteristics of a estuary
biota, and their existiing quantily is reIalively poor.
Because the  bad intluence ol   the warm water discharged lorm the   power
station is reduced about 10%, the inf'luence on the ecosystem is also
decreased proportionally and thus the fishery product would be increased
with time.
7. 1.5 Fishery Resource
A five  fishery placess will   be closed  due  to  filling  works on   the
disposal site  of the dredged   soils and some damage is expected   on the
nearby 30 fishery  places.  An adecluate  compensation for  those  fishery
places is required.
7.2 Living Environment
7. 2. 1 Land Use
Useful land such as the vase sile and lhe disposal area will he created
by the proposed project, and some modification on topography and a minor
change in the land use relation to the project such as the new road and
housing site etc., are expected.
7. 2.2  Noise, Vibration, and Stench  _173 -



Since the noise and vibration sources are principally placed in the
builclings, almost no inrluence is expeclecl.
7.2.3 LNG
The air pollution around the Ahsan Bay can be remarkably reduced by
replacting the fuel from oil to LNG lor the Pyungtek llower Station, since
the LNG is a clean energy.
Although the ignition temperature ol the LNG is high as 537 C, and it has
a minor chance to slay at low place because the vaporized gas is lighter
than ther air, the danger of' fire is still existing.
Thus, the safety should be maintained by using the high safety facilities
and  by    improving  lhe  maintenance   technique.   Furlher   more,   the
installation of the abnormal indicator and warning equipment as %ell as
the security education, are rcquired lo minimize a damage from the
unexpected event.
7.3 Social and Economical Environment
The social and economical environment of the region would be improved by
the population increase and the activation of the industries related to the
LNG base. A rapid clevelopmenl of the region is expected through the
housing for the resident employee and the expansion ol the transportation
system.

8. Relation the Other Business and Other Law
8.1 Reservation for Industry Basc
According to the "Development Promotion Law for Industry Base (Law Number
2657)", the gas   supplying lacilily is   included in the  definition of   the
industry  base development business   in Articlc 2   of the same law, and the
development area can bc reserved by Ministcr of Construction by obtaining
approval of President.
Therefore, it is necessary to reserve the proposed area as the industry
development base for clriving the project.
8.2  Compensation for Fishery Right
In Article 10 of the same law, it is specilied to follow the "Special Law
on the Land Expropriation For Public Purpose And The Loss Compensation (Law
Number 2847)" for dealing with 1he expropriated land with in the area
reserved for industry development.
8.3  LNG Facilities
According to Article 16 of the "Law ol the Gas 13usiness (Law Number 3133)",
the  construction    plan  for  the  gas   supplying  facility  described   in
accordance with the standard defined by thc "Law of Energy and Resources",
should have an approval of a provincial governor, and an inspection of
completion by the governor is also required upon completion of the facility
construction prior to operalion.
