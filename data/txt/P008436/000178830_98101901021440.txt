HUNGARY - INDUSTRIAL ENERGY DIVERSIFICATION AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        The Government of Hungary (the Government) has requested Bank
financing for an Industrial Energy Diversification and Conservation Project
(the Project) consisting of an integrated package of investments, studies,
institution building measures and technological assistance directed towards
the diversification and conservation of industrial energy use.   The main
objectives of the Project are to improve the efficiency and competitiveness
of the major domestic energy-consuming industries, to reduce Hungary's
energy import costs, both by reducing industrial energy consumption and by
a more intensive use of domestic energy resources, and to promote develop-
ment of appropriate policies, technologies and institutional arrangements
for a balanced development of the country's energy rationalization program.
1.02         The Project consists of four complementary components:   (a)
provision of energy monitoring equipment, training abroad and technical
assistance to strengthen the capabilities of relevant institutions for the
preparation of a detailed long-term program for industrial energy diversi-
fication and conservation and for carrying out energy diversification and
conservation activities; (b) support for 62 identified small industrial
energy projects through credits from the Energy Rationalization Facility of
the National Bank of Hungary (NBH); (c) support for four major Energy
Diversification and Conservation Programs (substituting indigenous coal for
heating oil and imported coking coal, substituting natural gas for oil
products, substituting coal for oil in the alumina industry and energy
diversification and conservation in the petroleum refining industry); and
(d) technology development to support the transfer of modern foreign
technologies for the production of coal products and for burning coal
without deleterious environmental effects. Physical implementation of the
main components of the Project will begin in June 1983 and be completed by
December 1987.
1.03      The Government attaches the highest priority to energy diversifi-
cation and conservation, since domestic energy supplies fall far short of
domestic requirements and a significant proportion of the import bill
arises from imports of crude oil and natural gas.  This first Bank project
in Hungary includes specific features for reducing the cost and unit con-
sumption of energy in the country's industrial sector by carrying out ener-
gy conservation investments, by supporting the substitution of indigenous
coal and gas for more expensive petroleum products obtained from imported
crude oil, by transferring foreign technologies for better utilization of
coal and petroleum products, and by strengthening the institutions engaged
in energy diversification and conservation. The proposed project fits well
within the strategy for Bank lending to Hungary, since it addresses the
four major country needs and objectives that are considered to provide
legitimate criteria for Bank lending to Hungary, i.e.: (a) plant upgrading
and technology transfer; (b) export generation; (c) energy production and
conservation; and (d) institutional reform and technical assistance.
1.04        The financing requirements of the Project, including physical
contingencies, price escalation, and interest during construction, are
estimated at  US$309.6 million.   Foreign exchange costs are estimated at



-2-
US$157 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$109 million would cover about
35% of total financing requirements and 69% of foreign exchange costs.
The balance of US$200.6 million (or about 65% of total financing required)
will  be  provided  from  internally  generated  funds  of  the  project
enterprises, from Government resources and from resources of the National
Bank of Hungary (NBH) and of the State Development Bank (SDB).
1.05       The proposed Project was appraised in November 1982 by Mr. D.A.
Caplin (Chief), Ms. D. Babelon, and Messrs. R. Heath, H. Hendriks and J.J.
Mulckhuyse  of the  Industry  Department.    Messrs.  H.S.  Kohli  (Industry
Department), K. Ahmed (EMENA), and S.O. Hassan (Legal) also assisted in the
appraisal of the Project.
II. ENERGY RESOURCE BASE
A. Introduction
2.01      Hungary consumes about 30 million tons of oil equivalent (TOE) of
primary energy per year. Since 1970, the dependence on imported energy has
increased steadily. Although the country produces natural gas, coal (lig-
nite, brown coal and bituminous coal) and crude petroleum, about 52% of its
total primary energy supply was imported in 1981, including 80% of the
petroleum consumed, 40% of natural gas requirements, and 26% of secondary
electrical energy consumed. Most energy imports come from the USSR.
2.02        Primary energy consumption increased from 23.5 million TOE in
1970 to a peak level of 32.9 million TOE in 1979, an average annual growth
rate of 3.8%. Total energy imports increased from 7.3% of total imports in
1970 to 15.1% in 1981.  Although those energy imports from the USSR which
are settled in non-convertible currencies carry favorable terms (para
4.10), an increasing proportion of energy imports from Socialist as well as
non-Socialist countries--reaching 33% in 1979--have been settled in con-
vertible currencies and at world prices. Those imports contributed to the
serious balance of payment difficulties  in the late  1970s.   Strenuous
efforts have been made since then to reduce the size of the energy import
bill. Among the measures taken are programs to increase domestic energy
production, including nuclear power generation (the first unit came into
operation at the end of 1982), increasing exploration and exploitation of
other indigenous fuel sources (low quality coal, gas and oil), and a vigo-
rous policy encouraging energy conservation and substitution of indigenous
fuels for imported petroleum.
2.03      As a result of the above measures, primary energy consumption de-
clined in 1980 and 1981 and now stands at about 30 million TOE, about 9%
below the 1979 level. Crude oil imports were reduced from 9.6 million tons
in 1979 to 7.8 million tons in 1981, a reduction of 20%, and energy imports
in convertible currencies were reduced from 33% of the total energy import
bill in 1979 to 26% in 1982. The level of energy consumption is planned to
remain stable until 1985 but after that, as immediate possibilities for
reducing energy consumption are mostly exploited, and as the economy
resumes growth, domestic primary energy consumption is expected to rise
again and reach about 33 million TOE per year by 1990.

4-
2.05       Total primary energy consumption is expected to increase slowly
over the decade 1980-90 at an average rate of about 1.4% per year (compared
to 3.8% between 1970-79).   In addition, as a result of current efforts
towards fuel diversification, the relative proportion of imported and indi-
genous fuels will change significantly by 1990; the share of imported ener-
gy is expected to drop from about 52% of total energy supplies in 1980 to
about 46% by 1990, although in absolute terms, imports would rise slightly
over the decade 1980-90. Imports of crude oil and petroleum products will
decline until 1985 as a result of energy conservation and diversification
measures; after 1985, the effects of further energy conservation measures
will be offset by the installation of major new industrial plants and
increased consumption in the communal and household sector. Coal will con-
tinue to be the major indigenous fuel, with production increasing over the
decade at ar. average rate of 1.7% per year. Although imports of electrici-
ty are planned to increase from the 1980 level of 1.86 million TOE to 2.55
million TOE in 1985, thereafter electricity imports are planned to be sta-
bilized with the commissioning of the Paks nuclear power station which, by
1990, is projected to provide 2.94 million TOE per year, or 8% of total
energy consumption. 2/  Projections of production and consumption of oil
products indicate that, during the period 1985-90, Hungary will remain a
net importer of naphtha, gasoline and gas oil and will be a net exporter of
fuel oil (Project File, Reference A).
C. Final Energy Consumption Pattern
2.06      Hungary's current primary energy consumption of about 30 million
TOE per year represents an annual per capita consumption of 2.7 TOE; final
energy consumption 3/ amounted in 1981 to 23.6 million TOE, equivalent to
a per capita consumption of 2.2 TOE. This is much higher than the average
per capita energy consumption of middle income developing countries (about
0.6 TOE).   The following table summarizes the breakdown of final energy
consumption by sector and fuel type. Details are shown in Annex 2-1.
2/   Electricity imports and electricity generated by the nuclear power
station are shown as the equivalent energy that would have been used
in Hungarian power stations.
3/   The difference between total primary and final energy consumption is
accounted for principally by conversion losses.

a/   Including about I million TOE of naphtha used as petrochemical feed-
stock.
b/   Includes small private businesses.
2.07         Manufacturing industry and mining accounts for about half of
total final energy consumption, while the communal and household sector
consumes about 29%. Solid fuels (coal, coke and briquettes), which account
for about 19% of total final consumption, are, together with petroleum
products, the major energy sources for the household and communal sector.
Petroleum products account for one-third of total energy consumption; the
major  petroleum  product  used  is  gas  oil which  is not  only used  for
transport (diesel) but also as heating oil in the household and communal
sector.   The substitution of gas oil by solid fuels and natural gas is a
major element of the Government's energy policy.   Natural gas, purchased
heat  and  electricity  are  the  main  energy  sources  used  by  industry,
accounting for two-thirds of industrial energy consumption. Virtually all
the purchased heat is generated either at power stations or in centralized
steam raising facilities in urban and industrial areas and is piped to
industrial,  communal and domestic users in the locality.   About 26% of
electricity delivered to the Hungarian system is imported, about 38% is
generated domestically using natural gas or heavy fuel oil, and the
remaining 36% is generated from domestic coal and lignite.   About 91% of
gross imports of electricity are from the USSR.
D.  Domestic Energy Reserves, Supply and Imports
2.08         The principal domestic energy sources in Hungary are coal,
natural gas and oil.   Firewood, agricultural waste, geothermal water and
hydropower are also utilized but account for less than 5% of total energy

consumption.    A  nuclear  power  station,  which  is  planned  to  consist
eventually of four 440 MW units, is now being completed; the first unit
came on stream in December 1982.   The coal, natural gas, oil products,
electricity and refining subsectors are briefly discussed below.  The orga-
nizational structure of the energy sector is discussed in Chapter V.
2.09        Coal.   Total mineable coal reserves amount to about 4 billion
tons (which should be sufficient to satisfy domestic demand for about 100
years at current consumption levels), of which 2.6 billion tons (65%) are
lignite and 0.9 billion tons (22%) brown coal. These reserves are located
mainly in the hills running across Northern Hungary (Map IBRD 16881). Most
of the lignite is suitable only for burning in power stations adjacent to
the mines.   The brown coals (mainly of Eocene origin) have high ash and
sulphur contents, with calorific values between 2,500 to 6,000 Kcal!kg.
Current plans are to increase coal production from the present level of 26
million tpy to about 30 million tpy by 1990, to satisfy the demand from
industrial and communal users and households who are switching over from
oil. While no new coal-fired power stations are planned as yet, the plans
for the later phases of the installation of nuclear power capacity are cur-
rently under review and it is possible that plans for additional coal-fired
power stations will be re-introduced.
2.10        The quality of run-of-mine coal has been declining.   However,
despite rising costs and the low quality of output, the production of coal
and lignite remains economic.   Coal production is below mining capacity
because the mines currently are not capable of producing the higher quality
coal required by communal and household users. To remedy this situation, a
program of renovation and extension of coal washing and briquetting capaci-
ties has been initiated.  The 1985 target aims at meeting 50% of communal
and household heating requirements with coal, compared to 33% at present.
One of the Project's components will support various elements of this pro-
gram (para 6.14). Provided that the quality of coal destined for communal
and household use can be improved, Hungary's indigenous coal production is
sufficient  to meet  domestic  demand,  except  for  coking coal,  coke  and
anthracite, destined mainly for the metallurgical industry, of which 2.2
million tons were imported in 1981.
2.11          Gas.   Proven and recoverable  reserves of natural gas are
estimated at about 125 billion normal cubic meters (m3) (113 million TOE),
of which 94 billion m3 (85 million TOE) are pipeline grade. The remainder
is of lower quality, consisting of methane with up co 60% of C02 and nitro-
gen.   A program of deep drilling is being undertaken  to discover new
reserves and there are good chances that considerable additions to the
reserves will be achieved.   Current production of natural gas is about 6
billion m3 per year (5.4 million TOE) and production is planned to remain
around this level for at least the next 15 years.  The production cost of
natural gas is estimated at US$17.5 per 1,000 m3 (equivalent to about
US$0.85 per million Btu).  This is far below Western European prices and
indeed well below the price at which Hungary imports gas from Council for
Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries; it is therefore economically
very attractive.   Hungary has supplied about 60% of its domestic gas
requirements and imported the remaining 40% from CMEA countries, mainly the
USSR. In addition to domestic natural gas, which yields mainly methane but
also some LPG, additional quantities of LPG and town gas are produced from
naphtha  reformers.    It  i4S  planned  to  convert  the  remaining  naphtha



-7-
reformers to natural gas, which is more economical and will enable naphtha-
imports to be reduced.  In 1983, imports of gas from the USSR will drop as
the output of the first stage of the nuclear power plant (para 2.13)
replaces thermal generation based on gas.  The first priority attached by
the Government for the use of natural gas is inthe chemical industry (for
ammonia and fertilizer production); the second priority is as a substitute
for gas oil and light fuel oil in industrial, communal and household uses.
Remaining quartities would be used  for electricity generation.    Since
seasonal demand and supply are not in balance, underground storage
facilities are being developed.
2.12      Crude Oil.  Exploitable reserves of crude oil are estimated to be
between 15-20 million tons, with current production of 2.0 million tpy
(40,000 bbl/day) representing about 20% of domestic requirements, with
almost all the remainder (7.8 million tpy) being imported from the USSR.
Most Hlungarian crude oil is a light, low sulphur crude similar to Nigerian
or Libyan crude, which commanded a price in the international market of
about US$270 per ton in mid-1982; production costs of Hungarian crude lie
between US$50-US$70 per ton (US$7.0-US$9.5 per barrel), making domestic
production economic, even compared with prices paid for crude imports from
the USSR (para 4.10). The low ratio of reserves to current production has
stimulated new exploration activity, but the geological structures remain-
ing to be drilled are small and complex. Enhanced recovery of oil reserves
is being contemplated.   The current Five-Year Plan calls for discovery of
an additional 60 million tons of oil and gas, but it is uncertain whether
this target will be achieved.
2.13       Electricity.   Domestic power stations supply only about 74% of
Hungary's electrical energy requirements, the rest being imported primarily
from the USSR.   Total installed generating capacity is 5,400 MW.   All
aspects of the electric power industry are handled by the Hungarian
Electric Power Trust (MVMT) which consists of 22 enterprises and owns 97
percent of the generating capacity.   The remaining 3 percent are captive
plants  operated  by  large  industrial  enterprises.    MVMT  also  supplies
process steam for industry and district heating systems.   There are 47
power stations, of which half burn lignite or coal (producing 48% of gross
domestically generated electrical energy in 1981) and half burn fuel oil or
natural gas (producing 52% of domestically generated gross electrical
energy).   Most of the latter are dual fired, using natural gas in the
summer and fuel oil in the winter when more natural gas is required for
communal and domestic heating.   Coal-fired stations are run to meet base
load demand, with fuel oil being used as far as possible for peak loads.
Hungary's transmission network is connected with all neighboring countries
(Yugoslavia, Austria, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the USSR);
imports and exports of electricity are more or less in balance with these
countries with the exception of the USSR.  As mentioned in pararaph 2.08,
the first unit of the Paks nuclear power station was commissioned in
December 1982.  All four units are planned to be operational by 1987 and
will replace in part power generated from oil and gas-fired power
stations, depending on gas imports from the USSR.
E. Petroleum Refining
2.14       Domestic and imported crude oil is refined by the National Oil
and Gas Trust (OKGT) in four refineries with a distillation capacity of



-8
13.5 million tpy.  The largest refinery (Danube Refinery, DKV) is located
at Szazhalombatta, south of Budapest, with a capacity of 8.5 million tpy
(Map IBRD 16881).  The Komarom Refinery is located at Szony (capacity 1.5
million tpy), the Zala Refinery at Zalaegerszeg (0.5 million tpy) and the
Tisza Refinery at Leninvaros (3.0 million tpy).  Details of capacities of
individual units at the four refineries are given in Annex 2-2.  The Zala
refinery uses as feedstock a heavy asphaltic oil and is basically an
asphalt unit. As a result of recent decreases in the demand for petroleum
products, refinery capacity utilization has fallen to 65%. The Government,
therefore, plans to close the Komarom refinery and shut down a distillation
unit at DKV to bring total national capacity down to 10.5 million tpy.
2.15        Technologically, all the refineries are relatively simple with
very little secondary conversion capacity.  As a result, yields of distil-
late products are relatively low, e.g., 18.5% gasoline and naphtha and 36%
gas oil (diesel oil and special light fuel oil)..  Considerable imbalance
exists between domestic demand and supply patterns of refined petroleum
products; while the refineries produce gasoline (including naphtha), gas
oil, and heavy fuel oil in the proportion of 1:1.4:1.5, the domestic demand
pattern is in the ratio of 1:1.8:1.2.   Consequently,  Hungary is a net
importer of high-value distillate products and a net exporter of low value
fuel oil. Because the dermand for distillate products exceeds the existing
crude refinery capacity, a fluid catalytic cracker is being erected, which
will process up to 1 million tpy of vacuum gas oil into mainly gasoline and
light cycle oil. In addition, to convert the surplus production of vacuum
distillation residue into a usable heavy fuel oil with a low sulphur con-
tent, a visbreaker unit of 700,000 tpy capacity is being planned, the
installation of which will be supported by the Project (para 6.23).  It is
projected that refinery throughput will be maintained at a constant level
of about 9 million tpy of crude until 1990, while residual fuel oil will
decrease from the present level of 40% of refinery output to about 30%.
Refinery balances for the period up to 1990 are given in the Project File,
Reference B.   Finally, the Hungarian refineries, as in the case of most
refineries elsewhere, were erected at a time when petroleum prices were low
and are not designed to maximize energy efficiency; there is consequently
considerable scope for retrofitting in order to improve energy recovery.
Part of the refinery component of the Project will support improvements in
this respect (para 6.24).
III. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Industrial Structure and Growth
3.01       The industrial sector (excluding construction) generates about
one-third of GDP, accounts for three quarters of merchandise exports and
employs 33% of the labor force. Industrial growth has been the engine of
GDP growth in the last twenty years.   Between 1970 and 1978, the gross
value of industrial production increased at an average of 6.1% per year (in
constant prices), but growth slowed down to 4.8% in 1979 and declined to
1% in real terms in 1980, reflecting the severe cutbacks in the Hungarian
economy at the end of the 1970s.  In 1981, the sector recovered somewhat,
with the gross value of industrial production slightly surpassing the 1979
level.



-9 -
3.02        Hungary possesses few natural industrial raw material resources
except for some deposits of bauxite and considerable quantities of lignite
and brown coal, as well as relatively small reserves of iron ore. However,
all are of modest quality.   The country also possesses small reserves of
petroleum and more of natural gas.  Hungary, therefore, must rely heavily
on imported raw material inputs for its industries. Hungary's drive toward
industrialization after the Second World War concentrated on basic indus-
try. Mining, metallurgy and electricity production together accounted for
over 40% of industrial investment through the 1950s.  Metallurgy accounted
for 16% of the gross output of the manufacturing industry: associated down-
stream operations, such as iron and steel fabricated products, machinery,
electrical equipment and vehicle manufacture, contributed about 18%, light
industry about 23%, and the food industry about 33%, an indication of the
still preeminent position of agriculture in the economy in the 1950s.
3.03        In the thirty-year period from 1950 to 1980, industrial output
grew at an average rate of 7% per year although in the mid-1970s, indus-
trial growth slowed down because of labor shortages, rising energy prices
and increased difficulties in exporting to convertible currency areas (para
3.06).   Considerable changes occurred in the industrial  structure.   The
share of the high technology industries, such as chemicals, telecommunica-
tions and vacuum tube technology equipment, and electrical engineering,
increased to the detriment of the more traditional industries--mining,
metallurgy, and textiles.  Changes in the structure of industry by subsec-
tors between 1970 and 1481 are summarized in Annex 3.   The table below
shows the gross value of production of the main industrial subsectors in
1981.

3.04       Engineering, chemicals and the food industry are the predominant
subsectors  today.   Within engineering and  chemicals,  there is a strong
tendency towards specialization.   For example,  the vehicle industry has
specialized in bus assembly and is a major supplisr to both Eastern and
Western Europe.   Hungary is the fifth largest electric lamp manufacturer
in the world.   In the chemical industry, which in general utilizes high
technology, the pharmaceutical industry (the most research-intensive of all



- 10 -
the chemical sub-branches) has exhibited the greatest growth (13.5% per
annum in the last decade), although petrochemicals have also become
important.
B. Constraints on Industrial Efficienrcy
3.05       Due to changing economic conditions, both internal and external,
several problems relating to industrial structure have arisen. During the
early stages of industrialization, many manufacturing facilities were
designed on the basis of plentiful availability of low-cost raw materials,
energy and labor.   All these factors are now in short supply and more
costly. There are shortages of capacity for the production of energy, raw
materials, and industrial intermediates. Hungary has to import significant
quantities of industrial intermediates and semi-finished products from hard
currency areas in order to fulfill its program of finished high technology
products to other CMEA countries.
3.06        The current economic situation and lack of growth in Western
markets, coupled with overcapacity in many industries, makes export market-
ing difficult in these areas. The tendency towards protectionism in these
markets, and the difficulties in obtaining necessary approvals for transfer
of some modern technologies, have added to Hungary's problems in maintain-
ing profitable exports to hard currency areas~ Hungary's terms of trade
have deteriorated, and the range and quality of manufactured products are
generally not appropriate for further penetration into developed countries
markets. By the late 1970s, the product composition in industry was too
wide for efficient production runs. A major reason for this was that even
when new capacities were introduced, the older, inefficient production
units continued to be operated, and produced obsolete  products.  In addi-
tion, the rate of adoption of new industrial product innovations was too
low for Hungary to maintain its competitive position, particularly in
Western markets.
3.07        The current economic situation in Hungary, with its attendant
liquidity problems, has forced the Government to limit sharply industrial
investments. While some large-scale, state-supported projects such as the
fluid catalytic cracker and the nuclear power plant, which were started
before the current economic difficulties, are being completed, the plans
for later phases of these developments are under review and may be post-
poned. Support for new industrial investments is virtually restricted to
energy rationalization, materials savings and export promotion projects.
Even within these three areas, it has been decided to delay most of the
larger projects until after 1985 and to concentrate on smaller projects
with short pay-out periods and high economic rates of return. Considering
the current resource constraints and the need to restructure the existing
production facilities, the current investment policy to discourage new
large projects is appropriate.
C. Industrial Policies
3.08       With a limited domestic market, Hungarian industry must look to
export markets to maintain growth. The main thrust of Government policy to
eliminate the constraints described previously is to carry out a major
restructuring of the sector to align domestic production costs and prices
with those obtained in international markets.   There are several elements



- 11 -
in this adjustment process. First, there is a continuing adjustment of the
institutional framework for planning, financing and managing productive
activities through decentralized, incentive-driven, market-oriented enter-
prises, with central planning being applied only to large infrastructure
type investments and to projects of national importance.  The enterprises
themselves now initiate new capital investment, while central authorities
restrict their intervention to determining policy, incentives and the
institutional framework under which the enterprises operate. For instance,
the National Bank of Hungary and the State Development Bank grant credit on
a priority basis for financing investments in the field of export promo-
tion, energy conservation and rationalization and materials savings. Simi-
larly, most industrial (producer) prices have been decontrolled, with
mainly energy prices fixed centrally to influence industrial energy users
to economize in the use of fuels and to switch to cheaper, indigenous fuels
(para. 4.11).
3.09       Second, there is a selective shift in the pattern of investment
to reflect Hungary's comparative advantage in certain industrial branches,
in domestic energy sources and in agriculture. Within specific industries,
restructuring is being carried out by introducing new technologies to im-
prove product quality and to reduce energy and production costs. Coopera-
tive agreements with Western European companies have been established in
the machine tools, electronics components and pharmaceutical industries,
and a major rehabilitation of the textile industry has been substantially
completed. This restructuring is particularly important in export-oriented
enterprises to increase their competitiveness.   Another aspect of indus-
trial restructuring is to encourage investment in higher technology indus-
tries, where Hungarian scientific developments and a cheap but highly
skilled labor force can provide comparative advantages in export markets.
This is being implemented through several central development programs for
specified industries where value added is high and for which comparative
advantages are perceived (e.g., pharmaceuticals, plant protection chemi-
cals, aluminium fabrication and electronics) There is increased emphasis
in these industries on domestic technological innovation, transfer of
foreign technology, and technical and industrial cooperation with Western
European countries.   The programs  for investments in industrial energy
conservation (Chapter IV), materials savings and export promotion are an
integral part of this policy.  The Export Credit Promotion Facility of the
National Bank of Hungary (NBH) already accounts for 50% of all NBH invest-
ment credits and is planned to reach 60% over the 1981-85 period.
3.10      Third, the Government is encouraging competition among industrial
enterprises. One element of this policy was the break-up in the late 1970s
of most of the large industrial trusts, which concentrated the majority of
the industrial plants into a limited number of units.   Support is being
given to the setting up of small enterprises which can provide
intermediates, spare parts and services to the larger enterprises operating
in various  industrial subsectors.   The foreign trade enterprises, which
formerly held effective monopolies for selling specific types of goods in
export markets are also being subjected to competition since many domestic
enterprises have been authorized to set up their own export marketing
organizations to provide a closer link between producers and overseas
consumers.

IV. INDUSTRIAL ENERGY CONSERVATION
A. Introduction
4.01      A major thrust of the Government's strategy in the energy sector
is to reduce overall energy consumption and to substitute indigenous energy
sources for imported hydrocarbons wherever economic.   Energy conservation
and diversification in the industrial sector is the central piece of this
strategy.    This  strategy also  supports,  as  discussed  in the previous
chapter, the efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and growth.
B. Industrial Energy Consumption
4.02       Industry consumes about half of the final energy used in Hungary
(Annex 2-1).   In the period 1975-81,  industrial consumption of energy
increased from 9.9 million TOE per year to 11.6 million TOE, an average
rate of growth of 2.6% per year, while industrial output rose at 4.3% per
year.   It is estimated that savings of over 1 million TOE in industrial
energy were achieved without significant investments by improvements in
housekeeping of industrial plants.
4.03        The table below compares industrial energy consumption in 1975
and 1981.

a/ Energy consumption in the chemical subsector includes about 1 million
TOE of naphtha used as petrochemical feedstock.
The chemical, metallurgical and building materials subsectors are the major
consumers, together accounting for 73% of industrial consumption.   In all
these industries, plants were erected at a time when petroleum was cheap
and the design of many of these units did not aim at minimization of energy
consumption.   In many cases the plants were designed to burn fuel oil



- 13 -
rather than coal or gas; conversion of fuel oil-based heating and steam-
raising equipment to use cheaper indigenous fuels can provide high economic
returns.    Energy  conservation measures  combined  with  the erection of
secondary processing facilities in the oil refining industry will lead to a
better balance between the refinery output pattern and domestic demand
(para 2.15), with resultant savings in the balance of payments by reducing
imports of both crude oil and expensive petroleum products.
C. Potential for Industrial Energy Conservation
4.04       While the structure of the Hungarian industry has a major impact
on its overall energy intensity, the industrial sector continues to consume
a relatively high proportion of energy compared to similar industrial faci-
lities elsewhere, indicating that considerable further savings can be
achieved through energy conservation. Energy consumption in the refinery,
fertilizer and metallurgical industries is particularly high. In the fer-
tilizer industry, for instance, energy consumption in two of the industry's
three ammonia producing facilities is so high that replacing them by
modern, energy efficient units could save about 250,000 TOE per year, or
40% of current energy consumption in these plants.   In the third one,
savings  of 25% can be achieved.   In steel making,  energy consumption
accounts for 30% of direct operating costs compared to 11% in the USA and
Japan. Energy consumption in the most energy-intensive stage of aluminium
production--alumina smelting--is 15% higher than comparable plants abroad.
Overall, preliminary estimates indicate that at least 15% of total indus-
trial energy consumption could be saved by the introduction of modern
techniques and retrofitting existing facilities. In addition, considerable
scope exists for switching energy consumers from using petroleum products
obtained mainly from imported crude oil to cleaper indigenous fuels such as
coal and natural gas.  The major constraints in executing such a program
are the shortage of finance (para 3.07) and lack of necessary know-how at
the plant level.
D. Energy Plans and Policies.
4.05      The Government's objectives in the energy/industry sector are to:
(a) reduce overall energy consumption to the maximum extent possible; (b)
develop indigenous energy resources to the extent that it is economic to do
so; (c) substitute indigenously produced fuels (coal, natural gas, and
electric power) for imported liquid petroleum; (d) modify the product
pattern obtained in refining of crude oil, so that it is more congruent
with the demand pattern of the Hungarian economy; and (e) improve the
competitiveness of Hungarian industry at the same time.
4.06        The Government plans to increase coal production by about 10%
over the next decade, although indicated reserves could support a larger
development.    Financial  and  manpower  constraints  preclude  a  greater
increase, but the overriding consideration is that no new coal-fired power
stations had been considered since the Paks nuclear power station has been
regarded by the Hungarian authorities as the sole source for extra generat-
ing capacity required until 1990.   Whether this is the optimal policy to
pursue at this time is not clear;   the Hungarian authorities are now
reviewing this issue.  Increased coal use in the household and industrial
sector has been constrained by the poor quality of local resources and the
lack of technology to use it economically and without excessive pollution.



- 14 -
The Project would help overcome this constraint.   Exploration for oil is
being actively pursued with a view to meeting the somewhat ambitious 5-year
target of discovering an extra 60 million tons of recoverable reserves and
so is exploration for gas.   The Bank is discussing with the Hungarian
authorities possible assistance in this sector.
4.07       As stated in paras 2.15, the refinery industry is being restruc-
tured to improve its efficiency and to better balance the supply and demand
of petroleum products. The net effect of the refinery industry restructur-
ing program will be to reduce the total amount of crude oil imported and
processed and to increase the quantities of much needed distillate
products, by converting part of the excess residual fuel oil. Even after
the completion of this program, middle distillates are likely to be
imported.
4.08      The Government has made funds available, either through the State
budget or through an Energy Rationalization Facility operated by NBH, to
implement a variety of energy conservation and interfuel substitution
projects (e.g. installation of efficient industrial equipment and household
appliances, boilers, etc.). Also, in addition, some major projects within
industry, including the erection of a catalytic cracker, refinery retrofit-
ting, and modification of the control systems of the electric power network
have been undertaken,  with support  from the State budget.   The Energy
Rationalization Facility, which is aimed primarily at supporting small
investments in industry and agriculture, is of particular interest. About
600 small projects have so far received assistance from this Facility since
its inception in early 1981, with a total cost of about Ft 11 billion
(US$300 million).   Another Ft 4 billion (US$110 million) have been allo-
cated to the Facility for the remaining 2 years of the present 5-year plan
period  ending  in  1985.    However,  the  current  shortage  of  financial
resources in Hungary (particularly of foreign exchange for the importation
of specialized equipment), has raised uncertainties about the future level
of implementation of this priority program, and the Project would provide
support for the Facility by financing imported equipment: and licenses
required (para 6.09).
E.   Institutional Aspects
4.09       An Energy Economy Authority has been set up within the Ministry
of Tndustry to promote and oversee the implementation of an industrywide
energy conservation program. The Authority is the direct responsibility of
the Secretary of State for Energy in the Ministry.   Two institutions work
under  the aegis  of  the Eaergy Economy Authority:    the Energy Economy
Institute (EGI), which is a R&D engineering institute developing new sys-
tems and equipment for energy conservation, and the Energy Supervision
Institute (AEEF), which is responsible for supervision of energy audits,
inspection of equipment, and technical approval of energy saving projects.
These institutions are discussed in more detail in Chapter V.
F.    Pricing and Incentives
4.10         Import prices of crude oil and natural gas  from the CMEA
countries are still only about a third of world market prices.   These
prices move according to an average of world market prices for the past
five years, converted at the transferable ruble rate (the so-called



- 15 -
Bucharest formula). However, the cost of these imports is expected to con-
tinue  to  rise  because:    (a)  quantities  available  under  the  Bucharest
Formula are limited to their 1981 level and quantities in excess of this
quota have to be imported at world prices and scttled in convertible cur-
rency; imports in excess of the quota are expected to increase significant-
ly after 1985, due to the projected growth in energy demand after that
date; and (b) the five-year price average on which the Bucharest Formula is
based should increase by about one third between 1981 and 1985.   Two sets
of internal prices for fuel users are in force in Hungary.  Producer prices
(ex-mine and ex-refinery) are those paid by the productive sector (industry
and agriculture), and consumer prices are those paid by households.
Comparative energy prices--domestic and international--are presented in
Annex 4 and summarized below.

4.11        Producer prices for most petroleum products are comparalble with
international priceS, except for gasoline, which is sold at about 507 over
international prices.  It is the intention of the Hungarian authorities to
maintain these prices at least at parity with world market price levels.
Producer prices for natural gas and coal are set at levels to encourage
industry to switch from petroleum fuels to coal and gas, and are therefore
set at levels below prices of international equivalents delivered in
Hungary.   In addition, central authorities allocate the appropriate fuel
(energy  carrier)  to  a particular  user  if he  is not  influenced by the
pricing structure to switch to the desired energy carrier.  In setting the
producer prices of solid fuels at levels which encourage the switchover
from petroleum products, the Hungarian authorities appear to have overesti-
mated the inducements needed and have kept producer prices too low. Prices



-  16
of solid fuels are insufficient for some mines and briquette manufacturers
to cover costs of production and obtain a reasonable return on capital.
The Bank has discussed this issue with the Hungarian authorities.   The
Energy Economy Authority has recommended an increase in these prices, which
could be done while preserving the inducement to current users of petroleum
products  to switch to solid  fuels.    Under  the  terms  of  the  Standby
Agreement with the IMF, the Government has agreed to reduce subsidies,
including those on energy, to producers as well as consumers.   Complete
elimination of energy subsidies is expected by the end of 1987.  Further
discussions on this subject will take place during the review of the coun-
try's energy sector, planned in late 1983.   Since these pricing policies
are affecting some of the enterprises involved in the Project, assurances
were obtained that the Government will, through price revisions, equity
injections or other appropriate measures, maintain all Project enterprises
in a healthy financial position, as indicated in para 5.06.
4.12       As a matter of social policy, consumer prices for energy (with
the exception of gasoline) are subsidized. The relative pricing structure
is set to encourage householders to switch from heating oil to gas, coal,
or briquettes.   An added measure for this switchover is the cessation of
production of oil stoves and their spare parts, and the production of new
models for domestic heaters utilizing coal and briquettes. The question of
the adequacy of consumer prices needs to be examined in the context of the
overall price structure in the country.  The Bank will further pursue this
matter in connection with the review of the country's energy sector (para
4.11) and through its general economic dialogue.   Furthermore, as stated
above, under the IMF Standby Agreement, the Government has agreed to reduce
consumer subsidies, including those on energy, the elimination of which has
been planned for the end of 1987.
V. MAJOR INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT
A.   Introduction
5.01        This chapter discusses the overall financial condition of the
major institutions which, in addition to individual beneficiaries under the
Energy Rationalization Facility and the equipment conversion part of the
interfuel substitution/gas component, will be involved in the execution of
the Project. The financial analysis of the subprojects themselves is dis-
cussed in Chapter VIII.  As stated earlier, the Project consists of four
major components, the responsibility for which is distributed to the
following institutions:

MVMT                                5.02
5.02         The Energy Economy Authority forms part of the Ministry of
Industry and reports to the Secretary of State for Energy (para 4.09). The
NBH and SDB are the principal Hungarian banks.   The Ministry of Industry
oversees all energy producers in Hungary, including the coal mines, refin-
eries and OKGT for the production of oil and gas and the Hungarian Electric
Power Trust (MVMT) which owns and operates virtually all of the country's
generating capacity  (para 2.13).   All the enterprises involved in the
Project are state enterprises.   The Ministry of Industry appoints their
general manager and deputy general manager and ensures that the enterprises
are operated according to the orientation and targets of the national
economic plan and sectoral policies.   State enterprises are independently
managed in all other aspects of their organization, personnel management
and policies, technological development, investment planning, procurement,
pricing (except for energy), sales, business policies, commercial and other
functions which are normally associated with the operations of an
enterprise.



5.03        OKGT and MAT are two of the few remaining trusts in Hingarian
industry.   Trusts are legal entities which consist of a group of state
enterprises.   Trusts are managed by a General Manager (appointed by the
Ministry of Industry), assisted by a Board of Directors constituted by the
directors of the trust enterprises.   These directors are appointed by the
General Manager. Although the enterprises have a separate legal existence
and prepare their own financial statements, all their profits and deprecia-
tion are centralized by the trust, which may also transfer funds from one
enterprise to another. Taxes are calculated on aggregated profits and paid
by the trust, which also centralizes marketing, planning and investment
decisions, sets internal transfer prices and pays off debts, the constitut-
ing enterprises are therefore effectively operating divisions of the trust.
5.04      In addition to the m,1anagement supervision and control carried out
by the sector ministries, all enterprises and SDB are subject to financial
auditing by the General Control Directorate of the Ministry of Finance,
and, for specific government programs, quality control hy ad hoc supervi-
sion conmissions.   The General Control Directorate carries out on-site,
in-depth audits of each enterprise normally once every second year, in
addition to routine review of the financial statements of all enterprises
which are received  three times a year.   These audits  focus on whether
financial statements reflect the real position of the enterprise, compli-
ance with domestic accounting regulations, the constitution of proper funds
and their use, and proper calculations and payment of taxes.  NBT- accounts
are audited by independent certified public accountants.
5.05        Although formally independent in their investment decisions and
financial management, the use by state enterprises of their internal cash
generation is restricted by several central regulations, including: (a)
taxes on profits, including municipal taxes of 15% of gross profit before
taxes and a general profit tax of 45% of gross profit net of municipal
taxes; (b) a compulsory reserve fund for 20% of the balance, which must be
maintained in a low-interest bearing account in NBRF, but wbich,  -th bT H
approval, can be drawn on to cover losses, increase working capital and pav
off debts; and (c) return of 40% of depreciation allowances to the national
budget. Borrowers from the State Development Bank receive a more favorable
treatment since the enterprises are allowed to deduct principal payments
from profits before taxes and, if necessary, allocate all of their
depreciation to debt repayment (40% of the balance is then returned to the
central budget).
5.06        In these circumstances,  local financial institutions consider
that the most meaningful measure of an enterprise's financial health is its
capacity to cover its costs and repay its debt and always base their credit
decisions on the projected cash flow of the enterprise.  Since some of the
major enterprises are likely to face cash flow problems unless the Govern-
ment takes measures to help them meet their commitments, such as reschedul-
ing of their debt or of their future investment program, equity injections,
revised pricing policies, permitting access to their depreciation allow-
ances or other appropriate means.   OKGT, MAT and the four coal mining
companies have agreed to maintain a debt equity ratio no higher than 65/35
and a current ratio of at least 1.3.  OKGT and Nograd, Mecsek and Oroszlany
Coal Mining Companies have agreed to maintain a debt service coverage ratio
of at least 1.5.  MAT has agreed to maintain a debt service coverage ratio



19  -
of at least 1.0 until December 31, 1986 and of at least 1.5 thereafter: and
Tatabanya Coal Mining Company of at least 1.0 until December 31, 195 and
at least 1.5 thereafter.   In addition, the Covernment has agreed to take
all necessary measures to enable the companies to meet their obligations
and, for MAT and Tatabanya Coal Mining Company, to inform the Rank of their
plans by aareed dates (paras 5.25 and 5.30).
B. The Energy Economy Authority
5.07       As mentioned in para 4.09, the main institution responsible for
energy diversification and conservation is the Fnergy Economy Authority of
the Ministry of Industry.   This is essentially a policy making body, but
two institutes,  responsible  for implementation,  report  to it:   (a) the
Energy Economy Institute (EGI), which is primarily a research, development
and engineering institute, with a total staff of about 700, and works main-
ly in the field of design of steam raising facilities, power plants and
waste heat utilization, and (b) the Energy Supervision Institute (AFFF),
which is responsible for overseeing energy auditing, appraising technical
aspects of energy diversification and conservation projects and monitoring
proiect implementation, as well as other functions such as safety inspec-
tions.  AEEF has five offices in the country and laboratory facilities in
Budapest.   The  total manpower of AFEF is 250 people,  of which  60 are
located in the five district offices and 26 in the laboratory in Budapest.
About 150 are in the safety inspection division.   Sixty percent have an
academic degree.  An energy supervision division in AFFF was founded after
the increase in energy prices in 1975.  Its task is one of supervision of
energy  use  and  more  lately  the  monitoring  of  conservation  projects.
Because of a shortage of qualified staff and lack of modern energy monitor-
ing equipment, AEEF is not as effective as it could be in fulfilling these
functions.  Other industrial institutes (also under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Industry), such as the Central Institute for 'Nining nevelopment
(KBFI), the Chemical Engineering Institute (VECYTERV) and similar groups
deal with the design of energy diversification and conservation pro4ects clt
enterprises within the subsector in which they operate.  Many of the pro-
jects  designed  by  the  institutes  have not  been implemented  because  of
shortage of resources.   There is a clear need  to coordinate  the energy
diversification and conservation activities of these institutes and to
assign priorities for implementation of potential projects.  Resources are
currently allocated from the center virtually on a first-come, first-served
basis (while ensuring that projects selected for support have high economic
rates of return) without an overall view about their relatLve priorities
and impact.   Assistance to overcome these shortcomings will be provided
under the proposed Project (para 6.03).
C.   The National Bank of Hungary
5.08        The National Bank of Hungary (NRM) was formed as a Joint state
company in. 1924 but since 1967, it has been fully state-owned. In addition
to its functions as the Central Bank of Hungary, it is also a commercial as
well as a development bank, providing short- and medium-tern working capi-
tal and investment credit to creditworthy enterprises and cooperatives for
profitable activities consistent with the national plan.   NBH has a total
staff of about 6,400, including abcut 2,760 at headquarters in Budapest and
3,630 in its 19 regional and 71 local offices.  It is managed by a Board of



20  -
Management consisting of a president and five vice presidents appointed by
the Council of Ministers, 6 managing directors appointed by the president
and non-executive members elected by officials of the Ministry of Finance,
acting as representatives of the State as the shareholder.
5.09       At the end of 1981, NBH had assets totalling Ft 599.7 billion
(about US$15 billion), over 80% of which consisted of outstanding loans to
banks and enterprises.   Liabilities  consisted  essentially of fixed and
sight deposits from banks and enterprises, who are required to maintain
their banking accounts with NBH, including all their reserves (para 5.05).
Profits have fluctuated between Ft 9.8 billion and Ft 13.5 billion (US$240
million to US$340 million) a year over the past four years.  NBH financial
statements for the period 1978-81 are presented in Annex 5-1. Total fund-
ing for the Project from NNBE's own resources would total about US$73.4
million, equivalent to only 0.5% of the total 1981 portfolio and annual
disbursements about 6% of annual profits, assuming project funds are
disbursed over five years. NBH has assigned high priority to financing of
investments included in the Project and is not expected to have any
difficulty in financing its share.   Assurances were obtained from the
Government and NBH that the latter will provide its share of financing
promptly to project beneficiaries.
5.10       While coordination and monitcring of the Energy Rationalization
Facility of NBH is the responsibility of a small unit directly under the
Managing Director for Industry, appraisal and supervision is distributed
among the various credit departments of NBH.  These departments, however,
have delegated the technical appraisal and supervision tc the Energy Super-
vision Institute (AEEF).  These arrangements are considered satisfactory.
Borrowing enterprises are required to present quarterly financial state-
ments (including a balance sheet, income statement and statement of
retained earnings) and all invoices and other evidence of payments required
for disbursements and investment control. NBH staff also perform physical
inspections, normally quarterly and, Lor large investments, sometimes
monthly.   Defaulting enterprises are charged a 6% interest penalty per
annum when in arrears.
D.   The State Development Bank
5.L1         The State Development Bank (SDB) is a financial institution
dependent on the Ministry of Finance which primarily finances large indus-
trial, infrastructure and social investments initiated by the State, and
also acts as the State fiscal agent for State budget funds intended as
equity contributions to these investments. The SDB has also financed some
productive investments (via State equity) initiated by enterprises requir-
ing medium- or long-tern financing.   In recent years, equity for invest-
ments initiated by the State as well as enterprises to almost all produc-
tive sectors have been substantially cut back and replaced by loans. In
1981, State equity represented 39% of State initiated-investments and only
6% of enterprise initiated-investments.
5.12      The SDB is managed by a President and a General Manager appointed
by the Minister of Finance. They are supported by an Advisory Board, the
members of which are appointed by the Minister of Finance, the President of
the Planning Office, the President cf NBH and the President of the National
Savings Bank.  SDB has a total staff of about 630, including about 240 at



- 21 -
headquarters in Budapest and the remaining 390 in four regional offices
located in Pecs, Miskolc, Szeged and Veszprem.   SDB has a large staff of
qualified engineers, economists and project analysts at headquarters as
well as in the regional offices, conducts its own technical and economic
analysis of prospective projects and closely follows up all aspects of
their implementation. The SDB's Division of Mining and Energy Is responsi-
ble for preparing, reviewing, coordinating and supervising the implementa-
tion of the subproject proposed under the Project for substituting natural
gas for oil and will work closely with OKGT (para 5.31) in the implementa-
tion of this activity.
5.13       SDB's total assets as of December 31, 1981 amounted to Ft 228.7
billion (about US$5.7 billion), over 50% of which were outstanding loans
for public  investments.   Liabilities,  which account  for  75% of  total
assets, were constituted essentially by deposits and loans received from
banks (especially loans from NBH).  Profits amounted to Ft 2.4 billion in
1980 and 1981 (about US$60 million).   SDB is expected to contribute about
US$62.6 million out of its own resources to some of the coal and the gas
substitution subprojects (about 1% of its loan portfolio and about 20% of
profits each year assuming these funds are disbursed over five years) and
to channel Government equity contributions to the relevant project benefi-
ciaries (Chapter VIII).   Satisfactory assurances have been obtained from
the Government and SDB that the latter will provide its share of financing
promptly to project beneficiaries.   Summarized balance sheets of SDB for
1980 and 1981 are presented in Annex 5-2.
E.   The Coal Mining Companies
5.14      Coal mining was formerly the responsibility of a Coal Trust, but,
in January 1981, it was dissolved and independent mining enterprises have
been  installed  in  its  place.    Coal  prices,  however,  are set by  the
Government.   The Central Institute for Mining Development  (KBFI), which
reports to the Ministry of Industry, carries out research and development
work for coal production and utilization as well as engineering, contract-
ing and project supervision for projects in the coal mining industry.
5.15       Four enterprises will be responsible for the coal components of
the Project: (a) Nograd Coal Mining Company (coarse coal washing); (b)
Mecsek Coal Mining Company (coking coal and briquettes); (c) Oroszlany Coal
Mining Company (coarse coal air separation); and (d) Tatabanya Coal Mining
Company (fine coal washing).   These enterprises produce about 10 million
tpy of coal and cover all of the country's black coal and about half of the
country's brown coal production. Complete financial information for these
enterprises is available only since 1981, when the Coal Trust was dis-
solved.
5.16        Nograd Coal Mining Company.   The Nograd Coal Mining Company
currently produces about 1.1 million tens of brown coal per year from 4
underground mines and 2 small open pits. Future investment programs center
around the opening up of a new central coal field, for which sinking of an
inclined shaft has just begun. Production from this new shaft will permit
the closing of less efficient, older shafts.   No significant increase in
total coal production is therefore envisaged. The enterprise derives about
45% of its total sales from non-mining activities, principally the manufac-
ture of mining equipment, wood processing and construction.

5.17        Summarized financial data for the enterprise are shown in Annex
5-3.  More detailed financial statements and company projections are avail-
able in the Project File, Reference C.   As part of the Coal Trust, the
company recorded pretax losses rising from Ft 22 million in 1978 to Ft 339
million in 1980.   Since  the Coal Trust was dissolved,  the enterprise's
financial situation has improved and it has been able to generate small
pretax profits of Ft 8 million and Ft 13 million, in 199l and 1982, respec-
tively.   Results, however, were heavily influenced by the setting up of
producer prices which, for some of the mines, do not cover production costs
(para 8.02). Nevertheless, because of overall low indebtedness and profits
from other cperations, for the past three quarters of 1982, the enterprise
had a very comfortable current ratio of 3.4, a debt equity ratio of onlv
5/95 and a debt service coverage ratio of more than 8.
5.18        Project-generated fixed assets would represent about 47% of the
company's 1982 net fixed assets and 28% of total assets.  Since the enter-
prise has few debts at present, it should be in a position to contribute a
portion of its internal cash generation to the Project (about Ft 60
million, or about 15% of total Project costs).  Financial projections pre-
pared by the enterprise for the period 1982-90, which include the Prolect
as well as other planned investments, show that it should he able to pro-
vide this contribution without arawing on its reserves, and sustain asso-
ciated debt service payments.   The debt equity ratio is not expected  to
increase above 50/50 nor the current ratio to decrease below 2.5.  T'e de,-t
service coverage ratio should remain above 1.5 during the period, except
perhaps in 1986 and 1987 when it might fall to 1.2 unless proper measures
are taken.  As stated in para 5.06, the Government and the enterprise have
agreed that appropriate measures (such as revised prices, equity injections
or other measures) will be taken that will permit the enterprise to
maintain a debt/equity ratio at or below 65/35, a debt service coverage at
or above 1.5 and a current ratio at or above 1.3.
5.19         Mecsek Coal Mining Company.   The Mecsek Coal Mining C'ompanv,
together with the associated Komlo Coal Mining Company, currently produces
about 3.0 million tons of black coal per year and also owns the vwagvmanyok
briquetting plant, which produces about 0.2 million tons of briquettes per
year.   The coal is mined from 5 underground mines and one small open nit.
Summayized financial  information  is shown in Annex 5-4.   More  detailerd
financial statements and company projections are available in the Prolect
File, Reference C. The enterprise, which derives 90% of its revenues from
the sale of coal and briquettes, has consistently made pretax Drofits since
the breakup of the Coal Trust; pretax profits stood at Ft 38 million in
1981  but  are  expected  to be higher  in 1982.   At the end of 1992, the
current ratio was estimated at 3.2, debt/equity ratio was Q/91 and the debt
service coverage ratio was a healthy 2.6.
5.20       Mecsek Coal Mining Company will he in charge of implementing the
coking coal flotation and the coal briquetting subpro-jects, totalling Ft
1.5 billion  (including  contingencies).   Total  project  investments would
account for 37% of the company's 1982 net fixed assets and 26% of its total
assets. It is expected that the enterprise would contribute Pt 234 million
to both projects from its internal cash generation between 1982 and 1985.



- 23 -
5.21      Following the Government's decision to develop black coal mining,
the Mecsek Coal Mining Company is planning, in addition to the Project, to
embark on a large investment program, with maior expenditures between 1986
and 1990.  This program, which, besides the Project investments, is aimed
at modernizing existing operations and improving product quality, would
increase the company's net fixed assets fivefold between 19R2 and 19QO.
The enterprise expects that about 50% of this program will be financed
through State equity contributions, through STB or directly from the
national budget, so that the long-term debt to equity ratio is expected to
remain within reasonable limits (below 50/50).   The current ratio is not
expected to decrease below 2.0.  The debt service coverage ratio, however,
might fall slightly below 1.5 between 1986 and 1990 if the financing of the
present investment program is as planned by the enterprise, unless proper
measures are taken. The Government and the enterprise have agreed that, as
stated in para 5.06, approoriate measures will be taken by the Government
or the enterprise to enable the enterprise to maintain a long-term
debt/equity ratio at or below 65/35, a debt service coverage at or ahove
1.5 and a current ratio at or above 1.3.
5.22      Oroszlany Coal Mining Company.  The Oroszlany Coal Mining Companv
currently produces about 3.1 million tons per year of brown coal from 3
underground mines.   One of them is the new,  efficient Markushegy mine,
which is scheduled to increase total production by 50% by 1985-86 and
double it by 1990.  Summarized financial information is presented in Annex
5-5. Further details and company projections are available in the Project
File, Reference C.  The enterprise, which derives about 85% of its revenues
from coal sales, showed a pretax profit of Ft 120 million in 1981 and of Ft
107 million in the first three quarters of 1982.  While the current ratio
of 4.8 and debt service coverage ratio of 1.6 were satisfactory in 1982,
the debt/equity ratio stood at 71/29.   Although the enterprise has shown
profits during the past few years, debt service payments on its heavy lonR-
term debt somewhat constrained its liquidity in 1981.  The company expects
to reduce its long term debt/equity ratio to slightly below 70/30 dur.4ng
the period 1983-84 and to less than 55/45 between 19R5 and 1q90.   The
current  ratio  is expected  to remain high  (above 3.0) during the whole
period.   The debt service coverage ratio, however, will remain somewhat
tight, at between 1.3 and 1.5 during most of the period 1982-88, unless
part of the debt can be rescheduled or the enterprise is allowed to use
part of the centralized depreciation to meet its debt payments should it be
faced with liquidity problems.  As stated in para 5.06, the Government and
the enterprise have agreed that appropriate measures will be taken to main-
tain a long-term debt/equity  ratio at or below  65/35,  a debt  service
coverage ratio at or above 1.5 and a current ratio at or above 1.3.
5.23        The Project investment in fixed assets represents only about 7%
of the enterprise's 1982 net fixed assets.  Although it might have to draw
on its reserves to do so, the enterprise would contribute about 10T of
total Project costs (Ft 34.5 million) out of its own resources over the
period  1982-85.    Given  the  company's  already heavy  debt  service,  the
Government has agreed that it will put up the required equity if the enter-
prise were to be unable to generate enough cash to contribute the required
equity out of its own resources.

5.24      Tatabanya Coal Mining Company.  The Tatabanya Coal Mining Company
currently produces about 2.5 million tons of brown coal per year. Due to
nearing depletion of the original Tatabanya coal basin, mining activities
are now moving further to the East, where two mines are already located.
This geographical relocation constitutes the major part of the company's
future investment program. Coal mining contributes about 45% of the enter-
prise's revenues, the other 55% being derived from a machine factory and
engineering services specialized in the manufacturing of mining and some
coal preparation equipment and treatment,of industrial plant effluents.
5.25        The company's financial position, summarized in Annex 5-6, has
steadily worsened over the past five years, due to depletion of old mines,
deteriorating quality of run-of-mine coai and production costs (the highest
in Hungary) which are barely covered by Government-fixed producer prices
(para 8.02).    Substantial losses of Ft 115 million were recorded during
the first three quarters of 1982. The debt/equity ratio has also deterio-
rated and stood at 76/24 in 1982. Although the above-mentioned geographi-
cal relocation of mining activities should eventually improve financial
results, company projections do not offer a better picture for the immedi-
ate future.   With negligible profits,  the enterprise can only hope to
finance its substantial investment program by eroding its equity base and
further increasing its long-term debt. The long-term debt to equity ratio
is projected at over 80/20 until 1988 and the debt service coverage ratio
will remain below 1.2 throughout the period (below 1.5 should the company
be allowed to retain 100% of depreciation).   Although total Project costs
(Ft 408 million) represent only about 6% of the company's 1982 fixed
assets, the company cannot be expected to contribute any meaningful share
of Project costs out of its own resources.   It is clear that financial
restructuring of the enterprise will be necessary.  For this purpose: (a)
the company has agreed to reach and subsequently maintain a debt/equity
ratio no higher than 65/35, a current ratio of at least 1.3 and a debt
service coverage ratio of at least 1.0 until December 31, 1985 and of at
least 1.5 subsequently; (b) the Government has agreed to: (i) inform the
Bank by September 1, 1983 and 1984 of the measures to be taken to enable
the company to comply with these obligations during the years 1984 and
1985; (ii) no later than December 1, 1984, prepare and furnish to the Bank
for comments a plan comprising the measures to enable the company to comply
with its obligations in 1986 and subsequently; and (iii) cause this plan to
be carried out no later than December 31, 1985.
F. The Hungarian Aluminium Corporation
5.26       Although mining of Hungarian bauxite started about 50 years ago,
the real development of an aluminium industry based on local bauxite
resources was initiated only after the Second World War.   The Hungarian
Aluminium Corporation (MAT) was founded in 1963 and controls all sections
of the industry, ranging from geological exploration and mining of bauxite
to the manufacturing of finished products. MAT employs 21,000 workers and
comprises 16 enterprises (Annex 5-7), including 3 mines, 3 alumina plants-
--one of which is Almasfuzito (Map IBRD 16881), the Project plant--2 alumi-
nium semi-finished products plants, 2 finished products plants and a
factory producing process equipment for the aluminium industry.  The mines



- 25 -
produce about 3 million tpy of bauxite, of which about 2 million tons are
locally transformed into 850,000 tons of alumina, the remainder of the
bauxite being exported.  MAT has been facing problems associated with the
low quality of the bauxite, but considerable development work over many
years in Hungary has led to improvements in bauxite processing and the
quality and production cost of alumina today are estimated to be
competitive with  international  levels.    This  is  consistent with Bank
experience elsewhere, where countries with bauxite resources have exhibited
a comparative advantage in alumina production and exports, based on
efficient operations.
5.27       Energy conservation projects are being undertaken in the mining
and alumina production stage which should allow the country to remain com-
petitive in these two stages of the industry. Total production of alumina
is 850,000 tons per year, 700,000 tons of which are exported, mostly to the
USSR.   The remainder is smelted locally into 75,000 tons of aluminium
metal. This stage is highly energy intensive, requiring in the most modern
plants almost 13,000 kWh per ton of aluminium.   About 31% of Hungary's
aluminium metal requirements are produced in smelters which were built over
30 years ago and consume 15,000 kWh per ton of aluminium.   The remaining
69% of aluminium metal requirements (165,000 tons) is supplied by the USSR
using part of the alumina exported from Hungary. This arrangement has been
of benefit to Hungary in that the USSR supplies the energy required for
transforming alumina into aluminium rather than Hungary.   Two MAT enter-
prises are engaged in the fabrication and conversion of aluminium metal
into higher value sheets, semi-finished products and specialized aluminium
products.   The fabrication plants utilize modern technology and supply
domestic and export requirements.   Hungary's share of total world produc-
tion of high-value aluminium products is several times higher than her
share of world production of alumina.   This strategy of concentrating on
the production and export of higher-value products instead of the very com-
petitive aluminium metal ingots markets, is designed to exploit Hungary's
competitive advantage in this industry, and is considered appropriate.
5.28       Summarized financial data for MAT are shown in Annex 5-8.  More
detailed financial statements and company projections are available in the
Project File, Reference C.   Sales rose from Ft 27.6 billion in 1978 to
Ft 41.1 billion in 1981, although after-tax profits declined in the same
period from Ft 1.6 billion to Ft 0.9 billion. In the first three quarters
of 1982, the debt/equity ratio of 34/66 and the current ratio of 2.4 were
satisfactory. However, the debt service coverage ratio (based on retained
internal cash generation) had declined from a relatively comfortable level
of about 2.0, which had been maintained since 1978, to 1.2, due to the
worldwide recession in the aluminium industry resuleing in lower prices for
exports (in 1981, exports accounted for 61% of total sales, including over
25% to convertible currency areas).
5.29       Although MAT was still recording profits during the first three
quarters of 1982, low aluminium prices are expected to continue to affect
the profitability of MAT at least during 1983 and 1984.  Projections pre-
pared by MAT show that during the years 1983-86, stagnating prices,
combined with debt payments coming due on substantial investments made
prior to 1982 for reconstruction, modernization and capacity increases in



- 26 -
three of the semi-finished and finished products plants, will make it very
difficult for MAT to meet its obligations, even if it is allowed to draw
from all its reserves and to retain all of the depreciation (para 5.05).
The debt service coverage ratio (including total depreciation) is expected
to be close to or below 1.0 during the years 1983-1986.   The debt/equity
ratio remains relatively unaffected, below 50/50, but the current ratio,
2.8  in  1981,  would  decrease  substantially,  to  about  1.5  in  1987.
Discussions are being held within the Government for possible writing off
or rescheduling of MAT debts.
5.30       Although the Project investment would only represent about 5% of
MAT's total net fixed assets in 1982, MAT's poor financial situation makes
any contribution from its own resources virtually impossible. The Govern-
ment will therefore have Lo put up the required equity (para 8.10).
Regarding MAT's overall financial condition, the following agreements have
been reached: (a) MAT has agreed to maintain a debt/equity ratio no higher
than 65/35, a current ratio of at least 1.3 and a debt service coverage
ratio  of at  least  1.0 until  December  31,  1986  and  of  at  least  1.5
subsequently; (b) the Government has agreed to: (i) inform the Bank by
September 1, 1983, 1984 and 1985 of the measures to be taken to enable the
company to comply with these obligations during the years 1984, 1985 and
1986,  respectively;  (ii)  no  later  than  December  1,  1985,  prepare  and
furnish to the Bank for comments a plan comprising the measures which will
enable the company to comply with its obligations in 1987 and subsequently;
and (iii) cause this plan to be carried out no later than December 31,
1986.
G.   The National Oil and Gas Trust
5.31         The National  1l1 and Gas Trust  (OKGT) is charged with the
operation of the oil and gas industry.  OKGT consists of 24 enterprises
(Annex 5-9) covering a comprehensive range of activities in the industry,
including exploration and production of both oil and gas, crude oil refiin-
ing, petroleum products marketing, gas transportation and supply, design
and fabrication of pipelines and specialized equipment, and research and
development. Supervision of OKGT's operations is exercised by the National
Planning Office and the Energy Economy Authority of the Ministry r,f
Industry. The decision-making structure of OKGT is highly centralized; all
major projects are designed, evaluated and financed by the central organi-
zation.   Both the central organization and the constituent companies have
able managerial and technical staff.   OKGT employs in total about 50,000C
workers.
5.32       Consolidated financial statements and key financial indicators
for OKGT are presented in Annex 5-10.  More detailed financial statements
and company projections are available in the Project File, Reference C. In
1981, the debt/equity ratio was 24/76, the current ratio was 3.0 and the
debt service coverage ratio (based on retained internal cash generation)



- 27 -
was 1.1, rising to 1.3 for the first 9 months of 1982.  Total costs of the
refinery and gas conversion subprojeccs are estimated to amount to about 3%
of OKGT's net fixed assets _. 1982.   Projections for future years show
that, while in 1983 OKGT may have to draw on its reserves to finance
on-going investment programs, from 1984 to 1.986, it will be in a position
to generate sufficient resources to finance the required equity under the
Project  (Ft 441.2 million).   The Project and other planned investment
programs are nct expected to change in any significant way the debt/equity
ratio and the current ratio which should remain below 25/75 and above 2.5,
respectively, during the period 1983 to 1990.   The debt service coverage
ratio (including reserves in internal cash generation) is expected to
remain around 1.3 in 1983 and to rise above 1.5 subsequently.
VI. THE PROJECT
A. Overall Project Objectives
6.01        The various components of the Project represent an integrated
approach to meeting the challenges facing the Hungarian economy in its
industrial energy conservation effortE.   The Project will lead to direct
savings in energy consumption and provide a comprehensive approach to ener-
gy diversification activities. As opportunities are identified for switch-
ing consumption away from imported petroleum based fuels, an adequate
supply must be assured of natural gas and coal of the requisite quality (as
well as the equipment needed to utilize these fuels).  At the same time,
the refineries' operations must be restructured to utilize economically the
heavier petroleum fuels rendered surplus as a result of the switch-over to
other domestic fuels.
6.02       The Project will consist of fodr complementary components:  (a)
institution building; (b) support for the Energy Rationalization Facility
of the National Bank of Hungary (NBH); (c) support for four major programs
for energy diversification and conservation, i.e., substitution of coal for
heating oil and imported coking coal, substitution of natural gas for oil,
energy rationalization in the alumina industry, and energy diversification
and conservation in the petroleum refining industry; and (d) technology
development. These components are described below.
B. Institution Building Component
6.03          Objectives and Description.   The Project will support the
strengthening of the Energy Economy Authority (EAA)' and the strengthening
and reorganization of the Energy Supervision Institute (AEEF) (para 5.07)
necessary for the successful formulatioa and implementation of a national
industr'al energy conservation program.   This objective will be achieved
through the establishment within these institutions of two special groups
with functions described in the following paragraphs.
6.04        Within the Energy Economy Authority, a small group of highly
competent senior experts will be designated to initiate, coordinate and
supervise energy conservation subsector s>-dies necessary for the detailed
formulation of the long-term Program for Industrial Energy Diversification
and Conservation, which will be used by the relevant government authorities



- 28 -
for setting priorities and investment allo"ations for industrial energy
diversificatior, and conservation in the next 5-year Plan.   Two subsector
reviews, petroleum refining and the iron and steel industry, would be
afforded priority under the Project.   These two studies would be carried
out by existing competent Hungarian consulting agencies and institutes
specialized in the relevant subsectors (para 5.07), in cooperation with
foreign consultants financed under the Bank loan.   Studies for the other
industrial subsectors will be carried out by other competent Hungarian
institutes and agencies.
6.05        Within AEEF, an energy conservation center will be created to
take the lead in implementing government programs and coordinating all
agencies involved in industrial energy conservation and diversification
activities.   More specifically,  this center will  (a) organize,  over a
period of at least three years, promotional campaigns to motivate the
interest of industrial users in energy conservation and diversification;
(b) organize training programs for the staff of AEEF and other specialized
agencies and for engineers, energy coordinators and energy managers at the
enterprise level, in cooperation with existing specialized technical insti-
tutions and universities; (c) organize and/or help provide interested
enterprises with technical assistance and specialized advisory services on
the technical aspects of energy conservation, including energy audits, and
assist them in the preparation of economically-viable investment programs;
(d) continue to promote awareness of existing financial channels and to
appraise, help select and supervise subprojects for the NBH facility and
for any other financial sources; and (e) in close association with other
specialized  agencies,   initiate  research  and  development  on  energy
conservation technologies and the execution of demonstration projects.
6.06         The creation of this center will require the hiring of six
specialists,  including:   three chemical engineers experienced in energy
conservation who will, with the assistance of foreign consultants financed
under the Bank loan and a few of the most qualified mechanical and electri-
cal engineers of AEEF, establish and manage the technical assistance and
energy auditing programs; one training specialist; and two communications
specialists.   Other qualified staff are available within AEEF but will
require training in energy conservation methods. Furthermore, an internal
reorganization of AEEF will be required, since the functions and staffing
of the energy conservation center will need to be clearly separated from
those associated with AEEF's task as authority for the supervision of steam
raising facilities and electrical equipment.
6.07     The Project will finance the cost of the subsector studies and of
the necessary organizational, promotional and technical expertise required
to set up the energy conservation center, training programs in Hungary and
abroad for the staff of the Energy Authority, AEEF and other institutes,
and of enterprises, and the provision for the existing AEEF laboratory of
modern equipment required for monitoring energy use.  The Bank loan would
finance: (a) the cost, estimated at US$400,000, of foreign consultants, to
be selected according to Bank guidelines, required for the subsector
studies, the introduction of energy auditing methods and any other exper-
tise referred to above not available in Hungary; (b) training abroad of
energy audit engineers of AEEF, other institutes and manufacturing firms;
(c) study trips abroad for the senior staff of the Energy Economy Authority



- 29 -
in countries with experience in energy conservation programs; and (d)
measuring equipment not available in Hungary.   The total cost of this
institution-building component is estimated at US$1.8 million (without
contingencies) and the foreign exchange component at US$1.1 million, of
which US$0.5 million would be for measuring equipment.    A breakdown of
cost estimates by categories of expenditures is presented in Annex 7-1.
Detailed estimates are available in the Project File, Reference D.
6.08         Implementation and Schedule.   The selection, contracting and
provision of operational support to foreign consultants will be the respon-
sibility of the Energy Economy Authority for those required for the sub-
sector studies (para 6.04), and of AEEF for those required for setting up
the energy conservation center (para 6.06).  The selection of consultants
to help in the setting up of the energy conservation center and in the
preparation of the subsector studies will be completed by the end of 1983.
The Program for Industrial Energy Diversification and Conservation,
including the subsector studies, will be completed by November 1984 and the
energy conservation center will be fully established by March 1985.   A
detailed schedule is available in the Project File,   Reference D and is
summarized in Annex 6-1. Assurances were obtained from the Government that
it will make timely arrangements to (a) designate qualified staff to
initiate, coordinate, carry out and supervise the subsector studies
referred to in para 6.04 and to act as counterparts to the foreign
consultants referred to in the same paragraph; and (b) adequately staff the
energy conservation center to enable it to carry out its functions (para
6.05).
C. The Energy Rationalization Facility (NBH) Component
6.09    Objectives and Description.  The Project will provide financing for
the continuation of the industrial energy rationalization program financed
under the NBH Energy Rationalization Facility (para 4.08).  A total of 62
subprojects have been identified as suitable for consideration for financ-
ing under the Project. Twenty subprojects have been screened on technical,
economic and financial grounds by the Hungarian authorities and selected by
the Bank for financing under the Project (Project File, Reference E). The
remaining 42 stubprcjects have been identified and are being reviewed by
NBH; NBH has agreed to furnish the necessary information on these subpro-
jects to the Bank for review by December 31, 1983.  The list of subprojects
(Annex 6-2) contains both small and large subprojects from all sections of
industry. Some 53 subDrojects involve investments in waste heat recovery,
small process improvements which lower energy consumption, and energy
diversification through the substitution of petroleum-based fuels and elec-
tricity with natural gas and domestic coal. These investments have a total
capital cost of about US$88 million and require about US$24 million of
directly-imported equipment.   A further 9 subprojects will produce energy
conservation equipment, insulation materials and domestic coal stoves which
will replace oil burning units as part of the program for fuel diversifica-
tion.   The capital investments in these subprojects amount to a total of
about US$30 miUlion, including direct foreign exchange costs of US$10
million, which, when added to the direct foreign exchange requiremenlts of
the other 53 subprojects, total US$34 million for all 62 subprojects. The
proposed Bank loan will finance the direct foreign expenditures of the
selected subprojects.



- 30 -
6.10       Between about US$29 million and US$33.5 million of the loan pro-
ceeds,  will be allocated  to the  Energy Rationalization  Facility.   As
discussed in para 6.18 below, the foreign exchange requirement for steam
raising facilities at the Almasfuzito alumina plant will depend on the
technology selected.   If the technology with the lower foreign exchange
requirement is selected, then the foreign exchange savings (estimated at
US$4.5 million, including contingencies and price escalation) would be
raallocated to increase the Energy Rationalization Facility allocation from
US$29 million at present (Annex 7-1) to about US$33.5 million and
additional subprojects, included in the list of 62 identified subprojects,
will receive Bank financing.
6.11       Implementation and Schedule.  Most of the subprojects are small
and can be satisfactorily implemented by the enterprises concerned.   The
larger subprojects are not technically complex and can be implemented using
local engineering and construction companies.  In order to ensure that the
appropriate implementation arrangements are made and to monitor implementa-
tion programs, EGI, a qualified institution, has been appointed as imple-
mentation supervisory agency for all the subprojects receiving Bank finan-
cing via the Energy Rationalization Facility. EGI will also act as foreign
procurement coordinator to ensure that all procurement carried out under
the Bank loan is in accordance with Bank guidelines and also to consolidate
similar requirements from the various subprojects financed by the Bank into
packages large enough for ICB.  The major implementation steps are summa-
rized in Annex 6-1.  It is expected that implementation of this component
will commence in July 1983 and that by June 1985, 50% of the subprojects
will be completed with the remainder completed by June 1986.
D. Four Major Programs for Energy Diversification and Conservation
1. Overall Description
6.12      An integrated energy diversification and conservation program has
been launched to replace petroleum products used by industry, communal
users and households with natural gas or coal, as appropriate.  The first
three components outlined below address different aspects of this program.
The fourth component involves: (a) modifications in the refineries neces-
sary to alter production pattern in response to the decreased demand for
fuel oil arising from national energy conservation and diversification
programs; and (b) refinery industry energy conservation measures.
2. Program for Substitution of Indigenous Coal for
Heating Oil and Imported Coking Coal
6.13         Objectives and Description.   As mentioned in para 2.10, the
Government has initiated a program of renovation and extension of coal
washing and briquetting capacities to allow the conversion of about 50% of
domestic and communal heating equipment from gas oil to coal and to
substitute  for  imported  coking  coal.         This  program  will  cover  a
run-of-mine production of about 7.9 million tons per year (representing
about 60% of the country's current production of brown and black coal),
from which currently only about 1.8 million tons of high quality coal, 1.4
million tons of coarse coal and 0.2 million tons each of coking coal and
briquettes, are recovered.   The program will, in addition to maintaining



- 31 -
the production and improving the quality of the higher quality coal already
recovered, improve the quality of an additional 1.2 million tpy of run-of-
mine coal.   These improvements,  together with additional production of
upgraded coals and the output of the briquetting plant (which would other-
wise gradually cease operation), would result annually in the replacement
with coal of about 650,000 TOE of gas oil and some fuel oil, and 0.18
million tons of imported coking coal.   There is a ready market for the
additional washed coal and briquettes and existing distribution channels
will be used to bring the coal to the consumers.
6.14       The Project will finance the installation of four coal washing
and  one  briquetting  plant.    Specifically,  these  treatment  facilities
consist of:  (a) a new coarse coal washing plant in Nagybatony, for the
Nograd Coal Mining Company; (b) a new coal fines washing plant, to be added
to an existing coarse coal washing plant run by the Tatabanya Coal Mining
Company in Tatabanya; (c) an air separation unit to be added to the
existing handpicking and dry-screening facilities of the Oroszlany Coal
Mining Company; (d) the replacement and expansion of the Nagymanyok
briquetting plant run by the Mecsek Coal Mining Company in Pecs; and (e)
coking coal fines flotation equipment and improvements to the existing
washing plant of the Mecsek Coal Mining Company in Pecs.  A breakdown of
capital costs is provided in Annex 7-1.   A detailed description of the
scope of work is given in Project File, Reference F.  The Bank loan would
finance the direct foreign expenditures of such installations, amounting to
US$14.6 million (including contingencies and price escalation).
6.15        Implementation and Schedule.  The mining companies involved in
the subprojects have their own planning and engineering staff, who have
already completed the initial engineering, including the process flow
sheets and layout plans.   In addition, the Central Institute for Mining
Development (KBFI), which maintains an experienced engineering department,
will provide technical assistance to the companies in reviewing designs and
carrying out detailed engineering. Details of the implementation schedule
are shown in Annex 6-1. Implementation commenced in January 1983 with the
start of detailed engineering; completion of all the subprojects is planned
for December 1986.
6.16        Environmental Effects.   The program overall will replace low
sulphur petroleum products with a higher sulphur fuel (2-3% Sulphur) so
that on a national basis there will be some increase in sulphur oxides
released to the atmosphere.   Quality and use of the coal will, however,
comply with national  environmental  regulations  (Annex  6-3),  which  are
satisfactory to the Bank and are strictly enforced so that the adverse
effect on air quality is minimized at acceptable levels. For future exten-
sions of this program, targetted for heavily populated areas, sulphur
dioxide abatement systems will be required.   This need is being addressed
under the Technology Development component (para 6.27).  Waste fines from
the subprojects will be disposed of in the existing facilities which are
satisfactory  for  this  purpose.    Assurances  were  obtained  from  the
Government and the Project Entities that they will ensure that the project
facilities will be designed, built and operated with due regard to
appropriate safety norms and ecological and environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank.

3. Program for Substitution of Coal for Oil in the Alumina Industry
6.17        Objectives and Description.  As mentioned earlier, Hungary is a
major world producer of alumina, with production based on domestic bauxite,
one of the few large mineral resources of the country (para 5.26).   The
processing of bauxite into alumina is energy intensive due to the consider-
able quantities of steam required.   It is imperative to reduce the unit
energy costs in order to improve the competitiveness of this major indus-
try.  This will be accomplished under this Project component by the substi-
tution of coal for oil as the major energy source in alumina processing.
In the Almasfuzito alumina plant, process steam (900,000 tons per year) and
45% of the electricity consumed are presently generated by a heavy fuel
oil-fired boiler and generator set, using 72,000 tpy of heavy fuel oil.
The Project will finance the cost of replacing this boiler by a coal-fired
boiler  using  about  240,000  tpy of  low grade  brown  coal  from a nearby
mine.    In addition,  a new  turbogenerator  of  17 MW  capacity  will  be
installed under the Project to improve the overall efficiency by cogenera-
tion of electricity, which will increase onsite power generation of elec-
tricity  to about  98  GWh/per  year,  or  80%  of  total  consumption.         A
breakdown of project costs is provided in Annex 7-1.
6.18        Technology Selection.   Two alternative technologies are being
considered.  One is a conventional boiler using pulverized coal; the other
alternative is a variant of fluidized bed boilers developed only recently
in the USA and Western Europe. Only three industrial scale units using the
fluidized bed technology are on stream in Finland and FRG and one in the
USA, all three of a size similar to that required under the Project.
Although more expensive than conventional boilers, the fluidized bed
combustion technology appears to have the following advantages:  (a) lower
air pollution; (b) efficient burning of low-grade coal; (c) easy adaptation
to varying coal grades; and (d) longer on-stream time.  Given these advan-
tages, suppliers of fluidized bed boilers will be invited to submit bids
for  the  steam  raising  facilities  as well  as  suppliers  of  conventional
boilers.   Evaluation of technically acceptable bids will be on economic
grounds only, but in the event that a fluidized bed boiler is judged to he
the most economic choice, or a conventional boiler of a design which has
not been run using coal of the type employed in Almasfuzito (para 6.28), a
satisfactory large-scale combustion trial with the specific Hungarian coal
to be utilized at Almasfuzito will be carried out before bid award.
6.19        Implementation and Schedule.  In order for a timely decision to
be made as to which technology should be employed, international competi-
tive bidding  (ICB)  procedures  were  initiated  in February  1983 for  the
equipment.  The coal combustion trial (para 6.28), which could be necessary
before the final bid award can be made, would likely take place only by
September 1983.  It is expected that boiler and turbogenerator set instal-
lations will be completed and in operation by December 1986.  Details, of
the implementation schedule are given in Annex 6-1.   EGI, in addition to
the necessary design work, will also be responsible for construction and
erection supervision.   EGI is experienced and well qualified in this type
of work.

4.   Program for Substitution of Natural Gas for Oil
6.20       Objectives and Description.  Many public institutions and house-
holds use gas oil for heating purposes.   A high proportion of industrial
enterprises and district heating units use light and heavy fuel oils as an
energy source.   This subproject is the 1983-87 time. slice of a long-term
program for substitution of natural gas for petroleum products in Hungary
by extending the natural gas supply system to areas close to the existing
system  that have high consumption of petroleum products.   Part of the
natural gas currently used for power generation (3 billion m3 per year)
will be diverted to the program and, in the initial years, replaced in the
power stations by low-grade natural gas which would be too expensive t3
upgrade to pipeline quality. The Project will cover some 0.33 billion m
per year (260,000 TOE per year) of natural gas out of a total of 2 billion
m3 per year that it is planned to be diverted from power station use.
6.21       The Project will finance the cost of:  (a) the connection of ten
small towns and 16 small industrial users to the main natural fas supply
line, for a total estimated annual gas use of 200 million m , and the
laying of distribution systems within the towns to connect 116 small
enterprises; (b) the conversion of the oil burning systems to natural gas
of all of the identified 132 consumers; (c) the connection to the main gas
supply line and the laying of distribution systems (but excluding
connectioni to, and replacement of, consumers' equipment) required to bring
an additional 72 million m to other major consumers who are currently
being identified; and (d) the connection of the town of Sopron to the main
natural gas line for the purpose of converting the town's gas system frow.
the reforming of naphtha and LPG (approximately 22,000 tpy in 1985) to the
reforming of natural gas, as well as the direct connection to the natural
gas system and the conversion of oil burning systems of 20 industrial
enterprises for an estimated gas use of 40 million m  per year.   It  s
estimated that approximately 56,000 households will also eventually be
connected to the new distribution systems installed in this stage; these
connections, however, are not part of the Project. Further details on the
component are available in the Project File, Reference G.  A breakdownl of
capital costs financed under the Project is provided in Annex 7-1.
6.22        Implementation and Schedule.   The subproject will be the joint
responsibility of SDB and OKGT.   The construction of the gas supply and
distribution systems will be the responsibility of OKGT and will be hardled
by OKGT as a normal gas supply project through its pipeline engineering
company (OLAJTERV) and its regional gas supply companies (Map IBRD l6881).)
The OKGT companies concerned are well experienced in this type of WOrk and
have an efficient implementation organization.  SDB will be responsible for
ensuring that the necessary inside connections and burner conversions of
the final gas users are carried out on time.  SDB is currently  providing
financing for the conversion of natural gas appliances of industrial and
commercial consumers.   The selection,  preparation,  and appraisal of the
subprojects for the identified gas users was the responsibility of SDB's
Division of Mining and Energy.   Competing communities and groups of users
were requested to prepare detailed proposals out of which SDB selected
those projects with the shortest economic pay-back periods, which were
closest to the main lines and showed the most advanced degree of prepara-
tion and  coordination  among users  for phasing  of implementation.    In



- 34 -
coordination with the design offices of OKGT and its distributing
companies, SDB's engineering staff has reviewed the technical feasibility
of the proposed distribution networks as well as the individual invest-
ments, carried out the economic and financial analysis of the subprojects
and determined the financing plan with the users according to their capaci-
ty to repay and to contribute equity out of their own resources. SDB will
onlend Bank loan proceeds and will require firm implementation plans from
the consumers.   SDB will subsequently monitor implementation through the
Mining  and  Energy  Unit  of  its  Industry  Department  and  its  Regional
Directorates,  which have the necessary expertise.   Details  of project
implementation are shown in Annex 6-1.    Implementation of the Project
commenced in January 1983 with the start of detailed design work and route
surveys and will be completed by December 1987.
5.   Program for Energy Diversification and Conservation in the
Petroleum Refining Industry
6.23       Objectives and Description.  As detailed in para 2.15, a fluid
catalytic cracker (FCC) with a vacuum gas oil throughput of up to 1 million
tpy is being installed at the Danube Refinery (DKV), and is scheduled to
start up in mid-1984.   However, the feedstock for this unit is currently
used as blending stock for the production of fuel oil from high viscosity
vacuum residue.  The start up of the FCC unit will thus result in a reduc-
tion in fuel oil availability and an increase in the amount of vacuum resi-
due; this material would usually be disposed of in an adjacent power plant
which is designed for burning vacuum residue. However, as the first unit
of the Paks nuclear power plant reaches full operation around 1984, the
capacity utilization of the oil burning power plant will be considerably
reduced,  virtually eliminating  its demand  for vacuum residue.    It  is
unlikely that this surplus can be disposed of economically.    The Project
will finance the cost of installing a visbreaker unit, which will convert
700,000 tpy of vacuum residue into 685,000 tpy of usable heavy fuel oil.
The unit will be built adjacent to the 1.5 million tpy atmospheric crude
distillation unit built in 1975 which is now to be shut down.  In order to
reduce costs, many major items of the crude unit will be modified for use
in the visbreaker unit; these items have been identified and are listed in
Project File, Reference H. The present utility supply systems and support
services are adequate and no expansion of these is necessary for the vis-
breaker unit.   A total of 23 additional employees will be required to
operate the visbreaker unit; experienced technicians will be assigned to
the unit and their places filled by promotion and new recruits.  A break-
down of capital costs is provided in Annex 7-1.
6.24      The DKV refinery consists of three atmospheric and vacuum distil-
lation trains constructed over the period 1965-75 with additional process-
ing units (catalytic reformers, gas oil desulphurization and C4/C5 isomeri-
zation) added during the period 1973-79. The design basis for most of the
refinery was to stress simplicity. As a result, the refinery has high fuel
consumption levels and lacks control systems in many areas to optimize fuel
consumption within the performance levels attainable with the existing
equipment.  Although an energy audit and conservation study, to be carried
out under the institution-building component (para 6.04), will be needed to
define a comprehensive investment program, the refinery engineering staff
have already identified a number of energy conservation investments which



- 35 -
will be financed under the Project. These include: modernization of tube
furnaces, process modifications, new heat exchangers and insulation,
improvements in steam heating systems and a control system for electric
power consumption. Projected savings from these measures are estimated at
84,000 TOE per year.  More details on these measures are available in the
Project File, Reference H.  A breakdown of capital costs is provided in
Annex 7-1.
6.25        Implementation and Schedule.   OKGT will select, in accordance
with Bank guidelines, contract and provide operational support to a quali-
fied foreign engineering firm, to carry out the design, foreign procure-
ment, construction supervision and start up of the visbreaker subproject.
The cost of such contracts is estimated at about US$2.1 million.   It is
expected that OLAJTERV, which is the refinery engineering company in the
OKGT Group, will be subcontracted by the selected design company to carry
out some detailed design, local procurement and local erection contract-
ing. OLAJTERV has worked on all the refinery expansion projects in Hungary
and is capable of undertaking the work assigned for the visbreaker unit.
The energy conservation measures will be implemented by the refinery
project team which is responsible for refinery modifications, including the
FCC unit under construction, and the visbreaker. This project team has 20
staff, including financial control staff and engineers, experienced and
well organized for project supervisory work.   The overall implementation
schedule for the visbreaker is shown in Annex 6-1; overall completion is
estimated for July 1986, 36 months after the date of effectiveness of the
engineering contract in July 1983.   Execution of the energy conservation
investments will be scheduled during plant annual shutdowns and are planned
to be completed by December 1987.
6.26       Environmental Aspects.  Hydrogen sulphide generated by the vis-
breaker will be recovered as elemental sulphur.   The small quantities of
contaminated water formed will be treated in the existing waste treatment
system, which is adequate, before discharge into the Danube.
E. Technology Development Component
6.27       This component comprises three elements:  (a) a coal combustion
trial for the alumina plant steam raising equipment; (b) a fluidized bed
pilot plant; and (c) development of a process for the production of brown
coal coke in rotary kilns.  It is expected that installation of all equip-
ment required will be complete by December 1985.  Detailed capital costs
are shown in Annex 7-1.  An implementation schedule is presented in Annex
6-1.
1. Coal Combustion Trial for Alumina Plant Steam Raising Equipment
6.28      As discussed in para 6.18, a combustion trial using the Hungarian
coal to be utilized in the new steam raising equipment at Almasfuzito must
be carried  out during  the selection and procurement  procedures.    The
Hungarian authorities have agreed that, if the lowest evaluated bid is
either a fluidized bed boiler or a conventional boiler of a design which
has not been run using coal of the type to be employed at Almasfuzito, then
a large scale combustion test must be successfully completed prior to
contract award.  Bank support would cover the foreign exchange costs for



- 36 -
shipping the coal and other agreed expenditures of such a test. EGI will
be responsible for the implementation of the tests.
2. Fluidized Bed Boiler Pilot Plant
6.29         As part of the strategy of switching petroleum consumers to
cheaper, indigenous fuels, it is intended to replace some 50 oil-burning
boiler units (for district heating and other uses) in urban areas, by coal
burning boilers. It is planned to utilize for this purpose the new fluid-
ized bed technology, developed abroad, since air pollution can be consider-
ably reduced with this technology, enabling indigenous high sulphur, low-
quality coals to be used in urban locations. Although valuable experience
could be gained if this technology is adopted for the steam raising facili-
ties at the Almasfuzito alumina plant, it will not be possible to use those
facilities for experimentation with different coals and under different
operating conditions, particularly as regards pollution minimization when
using high sulphur coals.   Further, most of the boilers which are to be
switched to coal utilization are considerably smaller than both the
Almasfuzito units and the plants operating abroad; new designs will there-
fore have to be made for these smaller sizes. To establish optimal design
and operating conditions (including pollution minimization) for different
locations and coals, the Project will finance the installation of a fluid-
ized bed boiler pilot plant.   The design of the fluidized bed pilot plant
is not yet finalized and will depend on detailed technical discussions to
be carried out with experienced manufacturers.   The plant will be located
in Gyor in an existing coal/oil power station operated by the Hungarian
Electric Power Trust (MVMT), which will own the plant.   The Government,
through the Energy Economy Authority, will determine the coal testing
program and retain overall supervision and control of the plant, but
procurement, installation and operation will be the responsibility of
NVMT.   The Bank would finance the equipment imports and cost of foreign
licenses.
3. Production of Brown Coal Coke in Rotary Kilns
6.30       Demand for coke in Hungary amounts to 2.2 million tpy, of which
domestic production covers only 40%. The potential for increase in produc-
tion of metallurgical coke from domestic bituminous coal is limited in
Hungary, but technologies are now available abroad to produce brown coal-
based char which could meet that part of the demand not requiring coke of a
high compressive strength, for instance in the making of iron ore sinter
and  other  electro-metallurgical  applications,  for  use  in  industrial
boilers, and in the manufacturing of coke briquettes to supply hoaseholds
with non-polluting low volatile fuels.  As part of the Hungarian program of
development of brown coal-based char, the rotary kiln process has been
selected because several kilns now utilized for cement production at
Tatabanya will be closed down in the near future and will then be available
for brown coal coking.   A French coal mining company is operating this
process successfully in the Lorraine area.   The Project would finance a
processing test of Hiungarian coal in facilities abroad, the preparation of
engineering and techno-economic studies (about 15 man-months, for a total
of about US$200,000), foreign licenses, and, if justified from the results
of the test and the studies, the modification of one of Tatabanya's semi-
industrial scale rotary kilns. KBFI will be responsible for implementation
of the tests, the techno-economic study and the kiln conversion.



-  37  -
F. Overall Project Coordination
6.31      The Government has agreed to maintain a coordination office, with
the responsibility of overall coordination and evaluation of the Project,
which will be directly responsible to the Secretary of State for Energy of
the Ministry of Industry (para 4.09).   Its main functions will be (a) to
bring to the attention of proper authorities all matters related to the
Project requiring high level policy decisions; (b) to oversee the prepara-
tion and signing Qf all subsidiary agreements referred to in para 7.06; (c)
to ensure timely selection and appointment of the engineering agencies
responsible for implementation supervision and procurement referred to in
para 7.11; (d) to provide overall supervision of procurement and implemen-
tation; (e) to help the executing entities in the preparation of disburse-
ment applications and in the interpretation of Bank guidelines for procure-
ment and selection of consultants; (f) to ensure timely preparation of, and
consolidate, progress and audit reports referred to in paras 8.15 to 8.17,
before forwarding to the Bank; (g) to evaluate overall Project impact and
be responsible for the preparation of the Project Completion Report; and
(h) generally to act as a liaison between the Bank and the executing enti-
ties.    The  key  staff  of  this  coordination  office  has  already  been
appointed, and the office formally established.
VII. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost Estimates
7.01         Total financing required for the Project, including working
capital, physical contingencies and price escalation, interest during con-
struction and the front-end fee (0.25%) is estimated at US$310 million.
The foreign exchange component amounts to US$157 million, of which US$109
million represent direct expenditures in convertible currencies (direct
foreign exchange) and about US$48 million represent indirect foreign
exchange outlays (of which about US$25 milion are estimated to be in cur-
rencies of  Bank member countries).   The detailed estimates by Project
components are shown on the next page.
7.02         Base cost estimates are derived from vendors' quotations for
major equipment, using historical factors for estimating total installed
costs.    Costs  were  converted  into  US$  at  Ft  40 per US$.   Physical
contingencies  are  estimated  at  10%  of  total  installed  costs.    Price
escalation for foreign costs are based on forecasts of international
inflation of 8% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986; price
escalationi for local costs are based on forecasts of domestic inflation of
8.5% in 1983, 8.0% in 1984, 7.5% in 1985 and 7.0% in 1986. Interest during
construction is financed by SDB on subloans made from its own resources and
was estimated assuming   grace periods of between 3 and 4 years for the
relevant components and SDB's standard rate of 13%.   Import duties on
foreign equipment and materials, totalling US$13.8 million, including
contingencies, are included in total costs.
7.03       An estimated 200 man-months of foreign consultant services will
be financed under the loan for a total base cost (excluding contingencies)

of US$2.7 million, including US$2.1 million for the visbreaker (para 6.25),
US$0.4 million for the institution-building component (para 6.07) and
US$0.2 million for the technology development component (para 6.30).  The
average cost of consultant services for foreign consultants is estimated at
US$13,500 per man-month including per diem, travel and other reimbursable
costs. For local consultancy services not financed under the loan, a rate
of US$6,000 per man-month has been used.  The Project File, Reference D,
contains detailed assumptions on manpower, travel, and subsistence expenses
for the institution-building component.   A breakdown of capital costs by
components and categories of expenditure is given in Annex 7-1.
B. Financing Plan
7.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$109 million would cover about 35% of
total estimated financing requirements, 69% of total foreign exchange
requirements and 100% of the estimated direct convertible currency require-
ments. The Government will carry the foreign exchange risk. The financing
plan is summarized in the table on page 40. Although the financing plan is
complete, the Government has expressed interest in seeking cofinancing for
the Project utilizing the new Bank cofinancing scheme. The amount and tim-
ing of cofinancing will depend on market conditions and other funds being
raised by Hungary in the capital market.  It is likely that cofinancing of
about US$100 million equivalent will be sought.

a!  Fluidized bed boiler option - financing for the conventional boiler
would include:  IBRD:   US$12.7 million; equity: US$2.7 million; NBH:
US$6.9 million; for a total installed cost (including contingencies) of
US$22.3 million.
7.05        Beneficiaries are expected to contribute 10% to 20% of total
project costs from their own resources, with the exception of MAT and the
Oroszlany and Tatabanya Coal Mining Companies, which are not expected to be
in a position to contribute any share.   The balance of equity required
will be put up by the Government. For the Energy Rationalization Facility,
it is expected that Government equity (through SDB) would amount to about
10% of total costs.  Assurances have been obtained that the above equity
contributions will be made by the enterprises and/or the Government.  In
addition, the six major enterprises involved in the interfuel substitution



-  41  -
components would be required to maintain the financial ratios on their
overall operations which are indicated in para 5.06.   More details on
financing  shares  are provided  in Chapter VIII.   For the  institution
building and technology development components, the balance of funds
required will be provided by the Government from the national budget and,
for part of the cost of the pilot fluidized bed boiler, by MVMT.  For the
other components, the balance will be financed from long-term loans
received by the beneficiaries from either NBH (Oroszlany, Mecsek/Nagymanyok
briquetting plant, MAT, OKGT/DKV refinery and the Energy Rationalization
Facility), or SDB (Nagybatony, Tatabanya, Mecsek/coking coal plant, OKGT
for the interfuel substitution/gas component and MVMT for the pilot fluid-
ized bed boiler plant) .  The Government has agreed that it will provide
necessary funds and other resources to complete the Project in a timely
manner, including the provision of working capital and any other expendi-
tures needed to bring the facilities to steady levels of operation.
7.06       Onlending Arrangements.  The Bank loan would be extended to the
Hungarian People's Republic.    With the exception of funds allocated to
institutional strengthening and technological development (apart from the
pilot fluidized bed boiler), the proceeds of the loan would be relent by
the Borrower to OKGT, MAT, the four coal companies, MVMT, NBH and SDB. In
order to regulate the flow of resources from the various sources to the
beneficiaries and set the respective obligations of the various entities, a
series of agreements listed further below and summarized in the following

(a)  a loan agreement between the Bank and the Hungarian People's
Republic;
(b)  project agreements between the Bank and:   (i) NBH for the
Energy Rationalization Facility component; (ii) OKGT for the
refinery and interfuel substitution/gas components; (iii)
SDB for the interfuel substitution/gas component; (iv) MAT
for the alumina industry component; and (v) the four coal
mining  companies   for  the   interfuel  substitution/coal
component.
(c)  subsidiary loan agreements between the Republic of Hungary
and: (i) NBH for the Energy Rationalization Facility; (ii)
OKGT for the refinery industry and interfuel substitution/
gas components; (iii) SDB for the interfuel substitution/gas
component; (iv) the four coal mining enterprises for the
interfuel substitution/coal subprojects; (v) MVMT for the
pilot fluidized bed boiler; and (vi) MAT for the alumina
industry boiler.
(d)  sub-subloan  agreements  between:  (i)  NBH and  the  Energy
Rationalization Facility sub-borrowers; and (ii) SDB and gas
consumers for equipment conversion and connections within
the interfuel substitution/gas component.
7.07        Signature of the agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, listed
under section ((c) (i) to (v)) of the previous paragraph will be a
condition of effectiveness.   Signature of the agreements, satisfactory to
the Bank, listed under sections ((c) (vi)) and (d) of the previous
paragraph will be a condition of disbursement under each of the
corresponding subprojects.
7.08        Lending Terms and Conditions.   The proceeds of the Bank loan,
with the possible exception of the alumina industry and interfuel substitu-
tion/ gas subprojects, will finance direct imports only. All proceeds of
the Bank loan under the Energy Rationalization Facility, the interfuel sub-
stitution components and the pilot fluidized bed boiler, will be relent to
the ultimate beneficiaries at a rate not lower than 14%, which includes the
Bank lending rate, a premium of 10% of that rate (equalization fee) arid a
spread estimated to be sufficient to cover the foreign exchange risk (which
will be borne by the Government).  This rate would not be reduced without
the prior approval of the Bank, and the new rate would be based on the same
principles which were used to determine the 14% rate. The proceeds of the
Bank loan will be relent at the same terms as the Bank loan (15 years,
including three years of grace) except to the beneficiaries of the Energy
Rationalization Facility.  For these, Bank loan proceeds, as well as the
domestic credit portions made available to them by NBH from its own
resources, will carry the same maturities and grace periods as established
for similar investments in the Credit Policy Guidelines of the National
Bank of Hungary. These guidelines, which are revised annually and approved
by the Council of Ministers, set all credit policies for the Hungarian
Banking  System.    AccordIng  to  the  latest  Guidelines  (Circular  No.
17/1982-18), the maximum term applicable to investments for energy rationa-
lization (including the production of materials used for such purposes) is
12 years from the start of operation (10 years for SDB).  Maturities and



- 43 -
grace periods are determined for each subloan within these limits aceording
to the economic life of the investment and cash flow requirements. For the
other components, maturities and grace periods on domestic credit portions
financed from NBH and SDB's own resources will also be set in accordance
with the Credit Policy Guidelines. Interest rates charged on the domestic
subloans are set at 14% per annum for NBH (13% for SDB). However, sub-bor-
rowers from the NBH Energy Rationalization Facility benefit from a 45%
ex-post interest rebate on this locally-financed portion if, one year after
the start of operations, they can demonstrate that the originally set
energy conservation targets have been reached.   For them, the effective
interest rate is thus 7.7% per annum.  The blended interest rate paid by
the beneficiaries of the Energy Rationalization Facility for both IBRD
and local financing would then be between 10% and 10.5%, i.e., above the
projected domestic inflation rates of 8.5% in 1983, 8% in 1984, 7.5Z in
1985 and 7% in 1986.   The Government has agreed to review annually the
adequacy of the interest rates applicable to the NBH Energy Rationalization
Facility loans and to adjust these rates to maintain a positive spread over
the rate of inflation. All other beneficiaries would pay the standard NBH
and SDB rates (14% and 13%, respectively) on the domestic portion of their
subloans.   Assurances have been obtained that subloans to the Project
beneficiaries necessary to carry out the Project will be on terms and
conditions as set out above.
C. Procurement
7.09      All services (para 6.08, 6.25 and 6.30), equipment and materials
to be financed under the Bank loan will be procured in accordance with Bank
consultants and procurement guidelines. International competitive bidding
(ICB) will be used for equipment and materials purchases, except for pro-
prietary and critical equipment and orders for small items of a value equi-
valent to US$100,000 or less, which will be procured under limited interna-
tional tendering from qualified suppliers from at least three eligible
countries.   The aggregate of such contracts under the Bank loan procured
under the above exceptions to ICB procedures will not exceed US$11.0
million equivalent.   Equipment and services not financed by the Bank will
be procured under prevailing local procedures which are acceptable.
7.10       With the possible exception of the steam raising facilities for
the Alamasfuzito alumina plant and some equipment for the interfuel substi-
tution/gas component, the proceeds of the Bank loan will be used only to
finance imported equipment, goods and services to be supplied from sources
eligible under the Bank Guidelines. Hence, only foreign suppliers will be
invited to bid.   In the case of the steam raising facilities at the
Almasfuzito alumina plant, if the new fluidized bed technology is selected,
the loan proceeds would be used for the procurement from foreign engineer-
ing companies of licenses and know-how, and specialized equipment which
cannot be manufactured in Hungary.   If the more conventional pulverized
coal technology is adopted, then competent Hungarian suppliers exist who
can provide both technology and equipment and have already successfully
competed in foreign markets for similar equipment; they would be eligible
to bid and would qualify for the standard margin of preference of 15% or
the amount of the customs duty of a non-exempt importer, whichever is
lower.   Similar arrangements would apply for the procurement of steel
pipes, letdown stations, gas burners, instrumentation and valves for the
interfuel substitution/gas component.



-  44  -
7.11         Since this is the first Bank project in Hungary and a large
number of enterprises are involved in the Project, the Hungarian authori-
ties have agreed to appoint, for each subproject, a competent engineering/
consultancy group to coordinate each subproject (particularly for the N117
Energy Rationalization Facility), to assist in bid packaging and evaluation
and to ensure that Bank guidelines are adhered to.  These groups would he
responsible for the preparation of technical specifications and technical
and economic evaluation criteria in the bidding documents and would carrv
out the technical and economic evaluation of the proposals.  The designated
foreign trade enterprises, which normally handle all imports of equipment
in Hungary (para 3.10), would prepare and evaluate commercial terms in hid-
ding documents and proposals and, jointly with the engineering group, make
recommendations for award.   They would then handle formal contract award
and subsequent commercial arrangements with the selected suppliers.
Assurances in this respect were obtained from the Covernment.
D. Disbursements
7.12       Allocation and disbursement of the Bank loan proceeds will he as
follows:
Allocation of Bank Loan Proceeds
(US$ million)
1.   Engineering and licensing,             78.4         100% of foreign
equipment, material and                             expenditures.
spare parts, consultant
services and training
2.   Alumina plant boiler:                  15.5         100% of foreign expen-
engineering and license,                            ditures  and  iOn,/  of
equipment and spare parts                           local expenditures
(ex-factory cost)
3.   Interfuel substitution/gas:                         100% of foreign expen-
steel pipes, letdown stations,                      ditures and 100% of
gas burners, valves and                             local expenditures
instrumentation                         3.9         (ex-factory cost)
4.   IJnallocated                           10.9
5.   Front-end fee                           0.3
Total                           109.0
7.13       In order to avoid delays in the implementation of the Project,
the Government has requested that the Bank consider retroactive financing
of foreign exchange costs for the coal processing tests for the production
of brown coal coke in rotary kilns (US$0.2 million) and down payments for
linear polyethylene granules to enable gas pipe fabrication to begin as
soon as possible  (US$2.9 million).   An amount of UTS$3.1 million is thus
proposed to be financed retroactively.



- 45 -
7.14        The Loan is expected to be disbursed over 5 Rank fiscal years,
starting in FY84.   The expected disbursement schedule (Annex 7-2) is con-
sistent with the implementation schedule presented in Annex 6-1 and with
the average profile for IBRD loans and IDA credits in the refining
fertilizer and other chemicals subsector.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
8.01        The overall present and projected financial condition of the
participating enterprises is discussed in Chapter V, including relevant
assurances obtained at negotiations (para 5.06). This section is therefore
limited to the financial analysis of the subprojects.   Income statements
and statements of sources and applications of funds were projected for each
subproject  and are shown in Annex 8.   Projections were made in current
terms, assuming that costs would increase at the same rate as projected
domestic inflation and benefits at the same rate as projected bv the Bank
for the respective energy carriers.   The following sections discuss the
Project financial results for each one of the major project components.
Details on each subproject financed under the N3H Energy Rationalization
Facility are available in the Project File, Reference E.  All the selected
subprojects will be financially viable.
B. Interfuel Substitution/Coal for Oil and Imported Coking Coal
8.02        Cost and Revenues.   Although only coal preparation operations
will be financed under the Project, total average financial costs, includ-
ing mining costs, and prices for the output of the five coal mining and
preparation  operations  are  summarized  on  the  next  page.    The  wide
fluctuations in financial costs per ton of output are largely attributed to
differences in average mining costs, which vary from TTSS17.5 per ton of
run-of-mine coal in Oroszlany to US$30 per ton in Tatahanya.   Producer
prices  for  the  types  of  coal  produced  under  the Project  are,  on an
equivalent calorific basis, 30% to 53% below prices which would be paid for
coal imported from the UJS or Australia.   As previously mentioned  (para
2.10), all current coal mining operations are economic, but the setting up
of producer prices substantially below economic levels has contrihuted to
the poor financial performance of the Nograd and Tatabanya Coal Mining
Companies (paras 5.17 and 5.25).

8.03        Financial Rates of Return.   In 19P2 constant prices,  internal
financial rates of return calculated on incremental costs (excluding depre-
ciation and interest) and benefits of the five coal. preparation subprojects
are estimated as follows:
Coal Preparation Subprojects

Mecsek Coking Coal Flotation                 28
Low coal producer prices and associated narrow margins between prices of
prepared and unprepared coal results in a marginal financial rate of return
for the Nagybatony subproject, although it shows an excellent economic rate
of return (para 9.11).   Nevertheless,  the subproject will generate addi-
tional profits for the enterprise as long as substantial equity is

enterprise and the Government (para 8.05).
8.04       Financial Projections.  Assuming that the price structure remains
as it is today, and that equity is contributed towards meeting the cost of
the subprojects in the amounts specified in para 8.05 below, incremental
costs, sales, pretax profits and internal cash generation expected from the
subprojects at full operation in 1987, in current terms, are summarized

For these subprojects as well as for the other interfuel substitution
subprojects, the amount of equity contributions and terms of subloans were
calculated to permit a projected debt service coverage ratio on project-re-
lated operations of at least 1.5, which is consistent with the debt service
coverage ratio required on their entire operations (paras 5.06 and 7.05).
While the enterprises have agreed to take primary responsibility for con-
tributing the required equity out of their own resources, the Government
has agreed to make the necessary budgetary allocations should their overall
financial position not permit them to do so.  As evidenced in the above
tables, unless coal producer prices are increased in real terms, equity
will be required to cover a substantial part of total costs for the
Nagybatony subproject.  The largest part of such equity is expected to be
put up by the Government since the enterprise is not in a position to con-
tribute large amounts out of its own resources (para 5.18). The Government
is also expected to contribute the whole equity required for the Oroszlany
and Tatabanya subprojects to avoid straining any further the projected cash
flow oi the enterprises (paras 5.23 and 5.25).
C. Interfuel Substitution/Alumina Industry
8.06      Costs, Revenues and Financial Rates of Return.  Financial savings
derived from this component are generated essentially from switching away
from 72,000 tpy of fuel oil, valued at Ft 6,400 per ton in 1982 constant
prices (US$160/ton) and some power, to 251,000 tpy of low-grade coal,
valued at Ft 900 per ton (US$22.5/ton).   The internal financial rate of
return,  in constant  prices,  is  estimated  at  25%  for  the  conventional
boiler.
8.07       Financial Projections.  Projected financial results, in current
terms, are summarized below:
Alumina Plant Boiler (Conventional)
Summarized Financial Projections - 1986-90
(in millions of current TTSS)
1986    1988    1990

Tlternal Cash Oeneration          3.9      5.8     7.8
For  the  conventional  boiler,  with  equity  amounting  to  1?%  of  total
financing required (US$2.7 million), MAT is expected to be in a position to
repay the World Bank portion of the subloan (UTS$12.7 million) at the
standard terms and the NBH portion (US$6.9 million) within 9 years
(including 3.5 years of grace), while maintaining a debt service coverage
ratio on Project-related operations at or above 1.5.   Because  of MAT's
financial condition (para 5.30), the Government is expected to contribute
the  required  equity.    The  extent  to which  financial  results  of  the
fluidized bed boiler would differ from those of the conventional boiler



- 49 -
cannot be assessed at this stage since the extent of lower downtimes and
efficient use of lower grade coals (para 6.18) has not been quantified.
These factors as well as their financial implications will be fully
assessed as part of the selection and procurement procedures for the
boiler.
D. Interfuel Substitution/Gas for Oil
8.08       Costs, Revenues and Financial Rate of Return.  Incremental sales
will be derived by OKGT from switching distribution of natural gas from
power stations, which are currently charged Ft 3.5 per m3 (US$ 0.09
per/m3), ts industrial users, who are on average charged Ft 4.3 per m3 (US$
0.11 per/m ). Additional maintenance and administrative costs incurred in
distributing this gas to these new users are small and have therefore been
neglected.   The internal fiTnancial rate of return in constant prices is
estimated at 18% for OKGT.
8.09      Financial Projections.  Projected financial results are presented
below for the part of the component under OKGT's responsibility.
Interfuel Substitution/Gas for Oil
Summarized Financial Projections--OKGT - 1986-90

Profit Before Taxes              1.8          7.5        11.7
Internal Cash Generation         4.3         9.3         11.3
These projections are based on the assumption that prices of natural gas
charged to power stations as well as industrial users will continue to
increase at the same rate as world ftel oil prices.
8.10       With equity amounting to 15% of total Project costs (including
contingencies), or about US$6.4 million, OKGT is expected to be in a
position to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 or above on
Project-related operations.    It is expected that OKGT will provide the
required equity out of its own resources and that part of it will be
derived from resources generated by the Project between 1984 and 1987.
Subloans for the remaining 75% would include the Bank portion (US$12.2
million) and SDB's (US$24.3 million, including capitalized interest during
construction). The repayment period for the local portion of the SDB loan
is estimated at 14 years, including 3.5 years of grace.
E.   Refinery Industry/Energy Diversification and Conservation
8.11       Costs, Revenues and Financial Rates of Return.  The visbreaker
will produce fuel oil, currently valued at Ft 6,400 per ton (US$150) ex-re-
finery, versus Ft 5,360 (US$134) for the vacuum residue used as a feed-
stock.  The visbreaker will also produce small quantities of gasoline and
diesel oil.  The energy conservation measures will principally reduce DKV's
consumption of fuel oil, natural gas (valued at Ft 4.3 per m3, or US$0.11



- 50 -
per m3), steam (at Ft 456 per ton, US$11.4 per ton) and power (at Ft 1.2
per kWh, or US$ 0.03 per kWh), at negligible incremental operating costs.
In constant prices, the internal financial rate of return is estimated at
40% for the visbreaker as well as the energy conservation measures.
8.12       Financial Projections.  In current terms, financial results are
projected as follows:
Refinery Industry
Projected Financial Results - 1986-90

Incremental Sales (or savings)  114.6   197.6   249.5    8.5   15.5   18.7
Incremental Operating Costs         108.5   185.7   216.7       -       -       -

Internal Cash Generation              2.3      4.8    14.9    2.8    6.2    8.1
8.13       For the visbreaker as well as the energy conservation investments
in the DKV7 refinery, projected retained profits and depreciation generated
are such that financing is possible without much contribution from OKGT's
own internal resources.   With about US$2 million  in the  form  of equity
contributed by OKGT out of its own resources, OKGT is expected to be able
to repay the Bank portion (US$9.4 million) at the same terms as the Bank
loan and the NBH portion (US$8.8 million), within eleven years (including
four years of grace), while maintaining a debt service coverage ratio on
Project-related  operations of 1.5 or more.   For the energy  conservation
investments, a similar ratio is projected with an equity, also contributed
by OKGT out of its own resources, of about US$2.6 million and subloans for
the balance to be repaid at Bank standard terms for the Bank portion
(US$11.8 million) and, for the portion financed out of NBH's own resources
(US$11.4 million), within eleven years, including four years of grace. It
is estimated that OKGT will have sufficient resources to finance these
equity contributions as well as interest during construction.
F. Financial Covenants and Reporting and Auditing Requirements
8.14          As  stated  in  para  5.06,  satisfactory  assurances  have  been
obtained that the Government and the six major enterprises involved in the
interfuel substitution components (the four coal mining companies, MAT and
OKGT), will, through appropriate equity contributions, pricing policies or
other financial measures, maintain a long term debt/equity ratio at or
below 65/35, a debt service coverage ratio at or above 1.5, and a current
ratio at or above 1.3.   For Tatabanya Coal Mining Company and MAT, the
obligation to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 will
become effective on December 31, 1985 and December 31, 1986, respectively,
until which dates they will maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at
least 1.0 (paras 5.25 and 5.30).



- 51 -
8.15       Each one of the six major companies (OKGT, MAT and the four coal
mining companies) will submit to the Bank quarterly Project progress and
procurement status reports within three weeks after the end of each quar-
ter, including updated implementation and disbursement schedules, on each
one of the subprojects under their responsibility.   NBH, for the Energy
Rationalization Facility, and SDB, for the gas consumers connections and
equipment conversion part of the gas substitution subproject, will submit
such reports quarterly within 45 days after the end of each quarter. MVMT,
EGI, KBFI, AEEF and EEA will also submit such reports on their respective
parts of the institution-building and technology development components.
In addition, OKGT, MAT and the four coal mining companies will submit
quarterly financial statements to the Bank. For the Energy Rationalization
Facility and the gas connections and equipment conversion part referred to
above, NBH and SDB will retain financial statements of beneficiaries for
Bank review during supervision missions. Finally, within four months after
the closing date, the six companies, NBH and SDB, under the overall
responsibility of the Project coordination office in the Ministry of
Industry (para 6.31) will prepare and furnish to the Bank a completion
report on the Project dealing with its implementation, initial operation
and the costs and benefits derived and expected to be derived.
8.16        All Project beneficiaries, NBH, SDB, EEA, AEEF, EGI, ZBFI and
MVMT will keep separate project accounts.   OKGT, MAT and each one of the
four coal mining companies will, within four months of the end of the
fiscal year, submit to the Bank short form annual audit reports on their
financial performance, overall as well as under the Project, audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, consistent in scope and
content with Bank guidelines. EEA, AEEF, EGI, KBFI, and MVMT, NBH and SDB
will also submit short form annual audit reports on Project-related
operations.
G. Major Risks
8.17       There are two main project risks.   First, because of the high
level of taxation on enterprises and low prices, several of the Project
entities could face cash flow problems. Therefore, as stated in para 5.O6,
assurances were obtained from the Hungarian authorities that a.ppropriate
measures will be taken to maintain debt/equity and current ratios, and the
debt service coverage at financially prudent levels.   Second,  the main
Project risk derives from the multi-component nature of the Project.  The
Project is complex in design, ambitious in E zope and involves several
diverse  institutions.    Special  Project  coordination  arrangements  have
therefore been instituted (paras 6.31 and 7.11).   Substantial monitoring
and supervision on the part of Bank staff is considered necessary and is
planned for.  Since this is the first Bank project in Hungary, the effort
is considered justified.
8.18      The technical risks associated with the physical investments are
considered moderate since, with the possible exception of the steam raising
facilities at Almasfuzito, they utilize proven technologies.   In the case
of the steam raising facilities at Almasfuzito, risks will be reduced
since, if the novel, fluidized bed boiler technology is selected, a full-
scale combustion test must be carried out in an existing fluidized bed unit
designed by the selected supplier, with the type of coal to be used for the



- 52 -
Project, before a final decision is taken to adopt this technology. Except
for the coal preparation subprojects which have a ready market for their
output, virtually all the projects are aimed at the reduction of energy
costs on existing installations and do not involve increases in production
or sales; they therefore do not create any additional market risks.
IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
9.01        The Project is expected to save about 240,600 TOE per year by
1987 and to substitute an additional 1.8 million TOE per year with cheaper
fuels (coal and gas). Quantities of fuels saved or substituted under each
component are shown in Annex 9-1.   Economic prices for fuels were computed
from international prices charged in the world convertible currency trade,
since imports into Hungary from CMEA countries at prices determined under
the Bucharest formula are limited in quantities for crude oil, natural gas
and coal, and all imports in excess of such quotas have to be paid for in
hard currencies and at world prices.  With respect to fuel oil saved, it
has been assumed in the base case that such fuel oil would be exported at
the margin (para 2.05). However, in light of uncertainties about the fuel
oil trade balance, alternative estimates, based on imported fuel oil, are
presented as sensitivity.   It is expected that Hungary will remain a net
importer of gas oil, gasoline and naphtha and the economic value of these
products is based on their cif import cost.
9.02        Economic capital costs were derived after eliminating taxes and
import duties, price contingencies and interest during construction from
the  financial  capital  costs  given  in  Chapter  VII.    The  cost  of
institutional support to the NBH Energy Rationalization Facility was
included.  Because the benefits of the technology development component are
difficult to quantify, its costs, amounting to US$6.8 million, or 3% of
total base costs, were excluded from the economic analysis. A summary of
the incremental net benefit streams for each project component is presented
in Annex 9-2.
B. Economic Prices of Fuels
9.03         Petroleum Products.   Prices for fuel oil, gas oil, naphtha,
gasoline and vacuum residue are based on average European prices (FOB
Rotterdam,  projected  as  shown below),  to which  transport  costs  to  the
Hungarian border and from there to base storage were added to derive
factory/consumer gate values.   Calculations are detailed in Annex 9-3 and
summarized below:

9.04      Natural gas.  The economic value of natural gas was estimated on
fuel oil equivalent  basis,  under the assumption that fuel oil would be
exported.   Resulting prices for 1982 are shown below, including alterna-
tives estimates based on imported fuel oil equivalent:

Prices of future years, in 1982 constant terms, were projected at the same
rates as fuel oil prices (Annex 9-4).
9.05      Coking Coal.  Coking coal was imported from FRG in 1982 at US$110
per ton ex-German mine,  or about US$130 landed in Hungary.   Since this
price appears unusually high, the economic price is derived from CIF prices
of imported coking coal in Europe (US$80 to US$85 per ton), equivalent to
about US$105 per ton, at Hungarian mine.   Since international prices of
metallurgical coal are depressed at the moment, a price higher by US$10, or
US$115 per ton, has been used in the economic analysis after 1986.
C. Calculation of Benefits for Major Components
9.06         Interfuel Substitution/Coal for Oil and Imported Coking Coal.
Four of the subprojects which constitute this component are part of an
integrated program to convert households, commeicial and industrial users
from the use of liquid fuels based on imported crude oil to the use of



-  54  -
indigenous coal upgraded under the Project. About 650,000 TOE per year of
gas oil and some fuel oil used by households and small industrial users
will thus be replaced under the Project.  In addition, 183,000 TOE per year
of imported coking coal used by the steel industry will be replaced with
domestic coking coal produced under the Project.  Much of the coal being
upgraded under the Project is currently a low calorific value, untradable
coal with a high ash content which can only be burnt in power plants.
Without the Project, this coal is valued at its marginal mining cost, which
is estimated at US$21.5 per ton (assuming that additional quantities of
such coal would be mined to replace those being diverted to the coal
improvement program).   This assumption is reasonable since the coal mines
have the required capacity (the Project will divert about 1.0 million tons
of coal from power plant use or only 4% of the country's production of
brown coal and lignite in 1980) and since it is cheaper for the economy to
use this type of fuel in the power plants than any other type.  Average
marginal mining and preparation costs (including depreciation in prepara-
tion costs) are estimated at about US$24 per ton for coal ex-mine with an
average calorific value of 3,730 kcal per kg.  On an equivalent calorific
basis, the Project coals would cost about US$38 per ton of coal with a
calorific value of 6,000 kcal per kg.  Even allowing for some discount for
the inconvenience of a higher ash content (which varies between 10% and 25%
for Project coals, versus about 10% for the average international coal),
this cost remains substantially below the estimated cost of imported coal.
Finally, since the incremental output of better quality coal from the
Project investments is expected to be used by households, communal and
small industrial users in replacement for gas oil, the cost of converting
their equipment from gas oil to coal, estimated at an average of US$250 per
ton of coal equivalent,  was  included  among  the  economic  costs  of  the
Project.   For 1987, net economic savings for this component are estimated
at US$109 million in 1982 dollars.
9.07      Interfuel Substitution/Alumina Industry.  The fuel oil and power
saved under this component, equivalent to about 80,000 TOE per year, by
replacing the existing boiler with a coal-based boiler, were valued at
prices of exported fuel oil (or equivalent).  By 1988, the value of these
savings  will  amount  to US$8 million  per  year  in  1982  dollars.    The
replacement coal, which is a low calorific value, run-of-mine, untradable
coal, was valued at its marginal mining cost (US$21.5 per ton in 1982),
projected in the future acccording to trends estimated by the Bank for
coal.  For the fluidized bed boiler, the impact of possible lower downtimes
and use of lower grade coals (para 6.18) and the extent to which they would
compensate for higher capital costs cannot be quantified at this stage.
They will be fully assessed as part of the procurement and selection
procedures for the boiler.
9.08       Interfuel Substitution/Gas for Oil.  This Project component will
substitute natural gas for about 259,000 TOE per year of gas oil, fuel oil,
naphtha and small  quantities  of coke  and LPG.   The  economic  price of
natural  gas  was  derived  from  its  exported  fuel  oil  equivalent.    Net
benefits are d'erived from:   (i) a proportion of the Project  gas users
switching away from high value gas oil and naphtha;  and (ii) from a modest
increase in efficiency (5% for gas oil-based and 7.5% for fuel oil-based
equipment).   Costs include all costs of conversion,  including main pipes,
consumer connections and equipment to be replaced.  Since the Project does



- 55 -
not finance consumer connections for part of the Project (para 6.21),
conversion costs were estimated from average costs for the rest of the
network (US$92 per thousand m3). By 1988, net economic savings will amount
to US$17 million per year in 1982 dollars.
9.09       Refinery Industry/Energy Diversification and Conservation.  The
proposed visbreaker will produce the equivalent of 640,000 TOE per year of
fuel oil from vacuum residue which would otherwise be in excess supply and
have to be exported at a substantial penalty.  The economic value of the
fuel oil produced in 1987 would be US$128 million, expressed in 1982
dollars.    The  economic  value  of the residue  feedstock would be US$98
million in that year.   The energy conservation investments in the Danube
refinery would result in savings of about 84,000 TOE per year of steam,
fuel oil, power and natural gas, which have all been valued in terms of
their fuel oil equivalent.   For 1987, these net savings are estimated at
US$12 million in 1982 dollars.
9.10        Energy Rationalization Facility.  As shown in Annex 9-1, the
benefits from this component are essentially derived from direct savings of
fuel oil, gas oil, gasoline, natural gas and power (about 183,400 TOE per
year). Substitution investments (of natural gas and power for about 20,400
TOE of fuel oil and gas oil) account for about one-third of total Project
costs for the component. For 1987, net economic savings for this component
are estimated at US$34 million in 1982 dollars.   All 62 subprojects are
expected to show economic rates of return of at least 20%.
D. Economic Rates of Return and Net Present Values
9.11        The economic rates of return are presented in the table below.
The aggregate net present value, assuming a 12% opportunity cost of capi-
tal, is estimated at about US$757 million.   The share of the various
components is shown below:

9.12      Energy conservation and substitution projects by their nature
tend to result in high economic benefits with small investments, since many
such investments aim at upgrading surplus low-value products or substitu-
tion of high value fuels with low-value alternatives. For example, the
high economic rates of return obtained on the four sub-projects aiming at
substituting coal for petroleum fuels (items I (a) to (d) above) are
attributed to the combination of two sets of benefits: (a) the benefits of
using coal (whose economic value is estimated at US$3 per million Btu if
imported) to substitute for imported gas oil (with an economic value of
US$7.6 per million Btu) at relatively low investment costs of converting
oil-fired equipment to use coal; and (b) the benefits of upgrading low
value domestic coal (estimated ex-mines at US$1.5 per million Btu) to the
equivalent of imported coal (US$3.0 per million Btu) through low-cost coal
preparation under the Project.  Since the petroleum fuel substitution in
theory could b achieved using imported coal, alternative economic rates of
return were also estimated valuing the Project output at the equivalent of



-  57  -
imported coal.  On this basis, the sub-projects would have economic rates
of return ranging, in their extremes, between 30% for the Nograd coal
preparation and 65% for the Oroszlany coarse coal washing subprojects.
E. Sensitivity Analysis
9.13      It can be observed from results of a series of tests presented in
Annex 9-5 that the economic rate of return of the Project components is not
very sensitive to any reasonable changes in costs or benefits assumptions.
All the components remain economically justified under the various
assumptions tested.   With respect to prices of petroleum products, it is
not  expected  that  the  recent  decrease  in  crude  oil  prices  will
significantly affect the economic rates of return since:   (a) no benefits
are expected from the Project prior to 1985; and (b) from 1985 onwards,
prices of crudeoil are expected to regain their previously projected levels
and therefore those shown in para 9.04.  In any case, results presented in
Annex 9-5 show that the various Project components are not sensitive to
decreases in either fuel oil or gas oil prices, since even the interfuel
substitution/gas  component,  the  least  favorable  case,  would  still  be
economically viable should prices of gas oil be 25% lower in real terms
than projected over the forecast period.  The visbreaker subproject is very
insensitive to changes (either decreases or increases) in fuel oil prices
since prices of fuel oil and of vacuum residue, the main cost component,
are expected to change in proportion.   Similarly,  for the Mecsek coking
coal subproject, prices of run-of-mine and steam coals, the main cost
elements, and of metallurgical coal have generally exhibited similar trends
in the past. The internal rate of return on this subproject would still be
equal to 16% should all coal prices decrease by 20% in real terms.
F. Foreign Exchange Savings
9.14       Net foreign exchange savings in convertible currencies prior to
repayment of the foreign exchange debt incurred in convertible currencies
under the Project are estimated at about US$271 million per year at Project
completion (1988). When net savings of imported power and natural gas from
CMEA countries, as a result of the Project, are added, total savings are
estimated at the equivalent of US$299 million per year (at international
prices).  The breakdown of net foreign exchange savings by components (in
1982 constant prices) is shown below:
Annual Net Foreign Exchange Savings
Non-CMEA        CMEA
Countries    Countries        Total
(US$ million)
Coal preparation sub-projects         210.5            -          210.5
Alumina industry                       12.0            2.1         14.1
Interfuel substitution/gas a/          13.5            -           13.5
Refinery industry                      11.3           0.7          12.0
Energy Rationalization Facility        23.3          25.4          48.7
Total                         270.6          28.2         298.8
a/ After deducting the value of natural gas, estimated at exported
fuel oil equivalent.



-  58  -
Since the total foreign exchange cost of the Project is estimated at TTS$134
million  excluding  price  escalation   (UJS$94  million   in  convertible
currencies), the Project has a very quick foreign exchange pay-back period.
G.   Other Benefits and Policy Measures
9.15         The Project will generate substantial economic benefits and
foreign  exchange  savings  through  components  which  include  physical
investments aimed at cost savings, both by substitution of about 1.8
million TOE per year of cheaper fuels for more expensive ones and by
reduction in energy consumption of about 240,600 TOE per year.   Besides
these physical investments, considerable non-quantifiable benefits are
expected   to  accrue  through  the  institution-building  and  technical
assistance  components:    (a)  from  the  strengthening  of  the  country's
institutional  capabilities  in  identifying,  implementing  and  monitoring
energy conservationmeasures at plant level in the industrial sector as well
as providing an effective training vehicle in energy audits; and (b)
through support for industry-wide studies which will identify energy
conservation potential in the major energy consuming subsectors. This will
facilitate the detailed formulation of the energy conservation program to
be used by the National Planning Office and other agencies of the Pungarian
Government in determining priorities for allocating investment and other
resources  in  the  next  five-year  plan  and  beyond.    The  technology
development component is aimed at transfer of new technologies to assist
Hungary in utilizing indigenous coals of low quality in existing operating
units  for  the  production  of  coke  (which  otherwise  would  have  to  be
imported) and in the development of a wide range of pollution-minimizing
boilers using indigenous coal for district heating and other communal and
industrial purposes.
9.16       During the course of appraisal, the Bank maintained an intensive
dialogue with Government authorities regarding the adequacy of the interest
rates on subloans of the NBTI Energy Rationalization Facility.  As a result
of these discussions, the Government has agreed that the Bank-financed
portion of each subloan would be relent at a rate of 14%.  For the domesti-
cally financed portion, the arguments of the mission regarding the lack of
justification for interest rate rebates for energy rationalization subpro-
jects were recognized and the Government has agreed to review annually the
adequacy of the interest rates applicable to the MER Energy Rationalization
Facility and adjust them to maintain a positive spread over the rate of
inflation.  The mission also discussed with the Energy Authority -the need
to review the pricing of solid fuels. As mentioned, (para 4.11) the Fnergy
Economy Authority has recommended an increase in producer prices.  TTTnder
the terms of the IMF Standby Agreement, the Government has agreed to reduce
subsidies, including those on energy, to producers as well as consumers and
plans to eliminate energy-related  subsidies by 1987  (para 4.11).   This
matter will be followed up during the forthcoming energv sector review
mission.   Finally, the financial covenants required for the major Project
beneficiaries (para 5.06, 5.25 and 5.30) should coatribute to the financial
restructuring of several of them and maintain all in a financial condition
consistent with their increasing market orientation.
