HATCH                                                                        Page 4
0.1 Background
Union Miniere (UM) is a multinational ccmpany with headquarters in Belgium, which specialises
in the production of non-ferrous metals. The company is interested in acquiring a majority
shareholding in the MDK JS Company, which is one of the Bulgarian State owned companies
given priority for privatisation. MDK operates a copper smelter/refinery complex located close to
the town of Pirdop in Bulgaria.
Prior to final negotiations with the Privatisation Agency and submission of a non-binding offer,
Union Mini&re was permitted access to MDK to carry out a preliminary due diligence. Hatch
Associates Limited (Hatch), an international consultancy specialising in metallurgical and
environmental engineering,  was appointed by Union Miniere to perform  a preliminary
environmental assessment of the MDK operations and the site. This was carried out during a
site inspection in the week commencing 23 March 1997; the findings of the assessment were
documented in a Hatch report entitled Preliminary Environmental Review of the MDK Copper
Smelter.
Following submission of an offer for MDK, Union Miniere was selected as the Preferred Investor
by the Bulgarian Privatisation Agency on 9 June 1997. Under the terms of the Privatisation
Agency, Union Miniere was allowed a period of 2 to 3 months to complete the due diligence.
Hatch was subsequently retained by Union Miniere to complete a full environmental assessment
of MDK during the period of exclusivity.
0.2 Objectives, Terms of Reference
The preliminary investigation highlighted several areas of non-compliance and potential liability
which require further investigation. These are summarised as follows:
Air emissions
- emissions of sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide from the 120 metre stack exceed
maximum acceptable values
- emissions of dust from the 325 metre stack exceed maximum acceptable concentrations
- measurements in the town of Pirdop and Zlatitsa indicate that fugitive emissions from the
smelter operation and open storage areas on the MDK site contribute to poor air quality in
these regions.

Waste-water
site drainage waters which influx an important river system frequently exceed maximum
acceptable concentration limits for heavy metals and may also be contaminated with
suspended solids and oil
acidic process waste streams are treated by a simple lime neutralisation which is not
considered Best Available Techniques (BAT). Treated water is always in excess of
maximum acceptable concentration limits for a number of substances. Furthermore a
hazardous calcium arsenite/sulphate sludge is produced which requires safe disposal.
Solid waste disposal
a large pond used for settling the calcium arsenite sludge is full and there are doubts
concerning its stability in the short and long term
altemative safe sites are required for disposal of the calcium arsenite sludge
the slag tailings pond, located above the village of Pirdop, is almost full and its physical
stability under certain conditions is not known
solid waste of varying compositions, contaminated used equipment and disused structures
are on the site and will ultimately require removal to a secure deposit
there is a potential for soil and groundwater contamination as a result of seepage from the
slag dumps and other contaminrated storage areas.
The general objectives of the full environmental assessment are to:
assess the extent of environmental pollution resulting from previous operations at MDK
evaluate the current situation with respect to air emissions, liquid effluents and storage of
solid waste materials
As far as the historical soil contamination and waste disposal is concemed : provide an
indication of the technologies, equipment or remediation work required to bring MDK's
operations into compliance with Bulgarian and draft European BAT standards (Osparcom).
The costs and schedule for implementation are to be estimated
An emission reduction planning is presented in this report for air and liquid effluents.
A waste management system is proposed for the production and safe disposal of waste.

The general scope of work and methodology for the EIA was submitted to and approved by the
Ministry of Environment at a Plenary Meeting at the Ministry of Environment on 26 June 1997.
In order to complete the work in the scheduled time period, and because of the requirement for
specialised equipment, Hatch has engaged a Bulgarian Company, Engineering Service Sofia
Ltd (ESS). This company provides technical experts in various fields to carry out measurements
and analysis of emissions from the site and to perform geotechnical survey work. ESS and its
experts are approved by the Ministry of Environment.
Under the terms of the privatisation programme, the Bulgarian State will retain responsibility for
the historical pollution both on the site and in the surrounding region. The World Bank has a
provisional agreement with the Bulgarian Government that financial assistance, in the form of a
loan to the Bulgarian Government, may be available to aid the remedial work.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
1.1 Company Details
The address of the company under assessment is:
MDK Copper Smelter & Refinery J.S. Company
2070 Pirdop
Bulgaria
Telephone number:   7181 57 17
The Executive Director is Mr Alexander Alexandrov.
MDK JS Company is 100% owned by the Bulgarian State
1.2 History of the Facility
Construction of copper smelting facilities at the site near Pirdop commenced in 1956 and the
plant was commissioned in 1958. The initial plant treated copper ore and concentrate from local
mines using a process consisting of:
- fluidised bed roasting
=- electric furnace smelting
reverberatory fumace converting.
The facilities included a sulphuric acid plant and an electrorefinery together with auxiliary plants
for services such as steam and oxygen.
During the mid 1960s the capacity of the plant was increased with the addition of a roasting
furnace with a hearth area of 25m2 and a 6 electrode, electric arc fumace and two new acid
plants. The refinery was also expanded to give a capacity of 64 000 tonnes per year cathode
copper.
Between 1967 and 1987 further improvements were carried out with the installation of an
effluent treatment plant, a new sulphuric acid plant and the slag flotation process.
The smelting process was completely revised in the mid 1 980s with the installation of
Outokumpu flash smelting technology and Pierce Smith converters. This facility, which is
installed in the north-west part of the site was commissioned in 1987. A list of the major
production and auxiliary units is given in Table 1.2-1.

Air separation plant                      1
Slag crushing and flotation plant        I
Former planned improvements by MDK, include the installation of a new double contact, double
absorption sulphuric acid plant and a new copper electrorefinery. Foundations for these were
completed, but lack of money prevented installation of the equipment.
The old facilities which occupy the south east area of the site were not removed after the
installation of the flash smelting process. The buildings and equipment are in various stages of
decay and are contaminated with process and waste materials.
The Outokumpu furnace has never operated at its full design capacity due to:
- shortage of suitable feed material
' insufficient sulphuric acid plant capacity.

Union Mini6re - EIA of MDK Smelter
HArCH                                                                         Page 13
1.4 Description of the Region Affected by the Facility
The MDK Smelter complex occupies a site in the central part of Bulgaria within the valley of two
rivers, the Zlatishka and the Pirdopska. The valley, which runs in an approximate east-west
direction, is about 29 km long and 4 km wide. It is surrounded by mountains of the Balkan
Range to the North and Hills of the Sredna Gora Range to the south. The altitude of the site is
between about 700 and 750 metres above sea level and the surrounding hills rise to a height of
up to 1500 metres.
The area is located about 85km east of the capital city, Sofia and 270 km west of the Black Sea.
A map of the region showing the location of the area in relation to Sofia is given in Figure 1.4-1.
The MDK site occupies an area on the north slope of the valley between the confluence of the
rivers Zlatishka and Pirdopska. The Pirdopska then joins the River Topolnitza which flows in a
Southerly direction towards the Plovdiv region. This is an important river system with respect to
the population and agriculture in the farmlands of central Bulgaria.

The region is served by the sub-Balkan railway track which passes through the southern
perimeter of MDK and has stations in Pirdop and Zlatitsa. Spurs into the MDK site are used for
receiving raw materials and dispatching finished copper and sulphuric acid by rail.
Highways connect the region with the capital city Sofia in the west, Plovdiv and Smolyon in the
south and Oriahove on the Danube in the north.
There is a plentiful supply of industrial water from the Duchantzi dam reservoir which regulates
the flow of the Topolnitza to the north east of the site. The dam is owned and maintained by
MDK and has a capacity of 11 million cubic metres.

services
Brief descriptions of the process and equipment of each unit operation are given in the following
sections.
2.1. 1 Raw Material Receipt, Handling and Storage
Copper sulphide concentrates are received by truck from local mines at Assarel Medet and
Elatzite. The concentrates contains typically 20 percent copper and 30 percent sulphur.
Imported concentrates are purchased via intemational trading companies or treated under
tolling contracts. This material is received in Bulgaria at unloading facilities at a Black Sea port
and transferred to MDK by rail transport.
Concentrates, which contain about 10 to 15 percent moisture, are stored either in dedicated
buildings or in open storage areas.
2.1.2 Feed Preparation
Prior to smelting, different concentrates are blended to form a charge which provides as
consistent as possible feed to the flash smelting furnace. The feedstock, which comprises
concentrates, flux materials and recycled copper materials, must be dried to a moisture content
of approximately 0.2 percent before it is suitable for charging to the smelting furnace.

Drying is carried out in two rotary kilns. Each kiln is 34 metres long by 3.4 metres diameter and
heated by heavy oil burners with capacity of 72 kg oil per hour. The capacity of each kiln is
approximately 70 tonnes per hour of dry concentrate assuming on initial moisture content of 11
percent.
Off-gases from the kilns are cleaned in Lurgi electrostatic precipitators, one for each kiln, each
having a cleaning capacity of 72 000 Nm3 per hour.
2.1.3 Flash Smelting
Dry concentrate together with silica flux, recycled precipitator dusts and converter slag are fed
by conveyors to the feed hoppers of the flash furnace. From the hoppers, the charge material is
fed to the bumers in the reaction shaft of the Outokumpu flash furnace. Design parameters of
the fumace are as follows:
Capacity                    120 tonnes per hour concentrate
Concentrate burners         4
Reaction shaft              8.23 metre high x 7 metre diameter
Settler                     26.95 x 8.7 metre
Uptake                       10.4 metre high x 5.2 metre diameter
In the reaction shaft, concentrates react with oxygen enriched air and are partially oxidised to
copper matte with a grade of about 50 percent copper, 23 percent sulphur. Part of the iron
sulphide is oxidised and combines with gangue components and fluxes to form a slag with a
copper content of 1 to 2 percent. Sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide are gaseous products of
the oxidation reaction. The exothermic reaction provides sufficient energy to melt the matte and
slag which fall into the furnace settler where the two phases separate and are tapped from the
fumace.
Slag is tapped into ladles and transported by rail to cooling pits; matte is tapped into transfer
ladles and carried by overhead travelling crane to the converter furnaces.
Off-gases from the fumace are cooled and partially cleaned in a waste-heat boiler which cools
the gases from about 13000C to 4000C. Some particulate matter is also removed from the gas
stream during passage through the waste heat boiler . After cooling the gas stream passes
through two large electrostatic precipitators, connected in parallel, where further removal of
particulate matter takes place. The gas stream then enters the sulphuric acid plants where
remaining fumes and dust are removed by wet scrubbing techniques and sulphur dioxide is
converted to sulphuric acid.
Dust and fume collected in the waste heat boiler and electrostatic precipitators are recycled to
the furnace charge for resmelting.

2.1.4 Conversion of Matte to Blister Copper
Copper matte tapped from the flash smelting furnace is transferred by ladle using overhead
travelling crane to the converter section. Conversion is carried out in one of three Peirce-Smith
converters each having the following design parameters:
Capacity             80-140 tonnes blister copper
Length               9.20 metres
Diameter            3.92 metres
Number of tuyeres    48
Matte is poured from the transfer ladles into the mouth of the converters; flux , scrap and revert
materials are charged in a similar manner. Air, enriched with oxygen, is blown through the
tuy&res which project through the side of the converter and are submerged in the melt. The
copper/iron matte, is oxidised in two stages by the air to form slag, blister copper metal, and
sulphur dioxide gas. Under typical operation one furnace is in the charging cycle whilst the
other is in the air blowing mode, so that the flow of SO2 laden gas from the converter section is
as constant as possible. The third converter is either under maintenance or on stand-by.
After completion of the air blow, the molten copper is poured from the converter into transfer
ladles. Copper is transferred by overhead crane to the anode furnaces.
Off-gases from the converter contain particulate matter and sulphur dioxide gas. The gas
stream is partially cooled in a waste heat boiler and then particulate matter is removed using two
Lurgi electrostatic precipitators connected in parallel. The gas stream then passes to the
sulphuric acid plant for final cleaning and SO2 removal.
2.1.5 Copper Refining and Anode Casting
The crude copper from the converter section is poured into one of two anode furnaces for
further refining. Each anode fumace has the following parameters:
Capacity        250 tonnes copper
Length           9.12 metre
Diameter        3.22 metre
Bumer           1200 kg/hour oil
In the anode furnace, the remaining sulphur in the copper is removed by air blowing, followed by
a reduction with oil.
The crude copper, which at this stage contains metallic impurities such as nickel, cobalt, arsenic
and precious metals is then cast into anodes on a casting wheel. The average weight of the
anodes is 250 kg each.

2.1.6 Electrolytic Refining
Final refining of the copper is carried out in an electrorefinery with a capacity of 50 000 to 60 000
tonnes per year.  The copper refinery contains 766 electrolytic cells, through which an
electrolyte of copper sulphate/sulphuric acid is circulated. Copper anodes and cathode starter
sheets (thin sheets of pure copper) are placed in these cells. Electrical current passing through
the cells results in dissolution of copper from the anode and deposition of pure copper onto the
cathode. Some impurity elements in the anode, such as nickel, cobalt, iron and arsenic,
dissolve in the electrolyte whilst others which include precious metals are insoluble and remain
as a slime settled in the cells.
After a period of time in the cells, when the anode has corroded to a pre-required thickness, the
anodes and cathodes are removed. The cathodes are washed to remove entrained electrolyte
and then strapped into bundles for sale. The spent anodes are scrubbed to remove the
precious metal slime and then returned to the converter furnaces for remelting. Precious metal
slimes are treated for recovery of gold and silver.
2.1. 7 Precious Metals Refinery
Gold and silver are recovered from the anode slime using a hydrometallurgical process. The
slimes are first leached in hot sulphuric acid to dissolve copper. The leach residue containing
precious metals is roasted to volatilise selenium and then melted in an electric arc furnace. The
precious metal bullion is subject to fire refining before casting into anodes. Pure silver and gold
are recovered in a two stage electrorefining process.
2.1.8 Slag Treatment
The slag from the flash smelting furnace is transported in ladles by rail to the slag treatment
area. The slag is poured into pits and cooled by spraying with water. The cooled slag is then
broken up and treated in a benefication process which involves milling to a fine particle size
followed by a flotationiconcentration process to recover a copper concentrate.
The slag copper concentrate is retumed to the flash fumace charge; fayalite tailings from the
flotation process, which now contain less than 1 percent copper, are pumped to large settling
ponds. The fayalite consist mainly of iron oxides and iron silicates and other gangue materials.
Although some of the production is sold to the cement industry, the remainder is transported by
truck to a tailings pond at the Elatzite mine.
2.1.9 Sulphuric Acid
Sulphuric acid is produced from sulphur dioxide formed in the flash smelting and conversion
process. There are two Russian designed acid plants:
No. 1 is a single contact/ single absorption plant
- No. 2 is a double contact /double absorption plant

Under normal operation all of the gas stream from the smelting furnace together with a portion of
the converter gas are treated in No 2 Acid Plant; the balance of the converter gas is treated in
No.1 Acid Plant.
The process of making sulphuric acid from sulphur dioxide involves the following sections:
a wet scrubbing section where the gas stream is cooled and remaining particulate matter
and metallic fumes are removed in spray towers. This is followed by further treatment in wet
electrostatic precipitators to remove sulphur trioxide.
- drying the saturated gas in a counter current flow of sulphuric acid
-  catalytic oxidation of sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide using vanadium pentoxide based
catalyst beds
absorption of sulphur trioxide from the gas stream by water in a circulating flow of sulphuric
acid
- removal of entrained sulphuric acid by mist eliminators prior to discharge of the tail gas to
the atmosphere via a stack
The produced sulphuric acid is pumped to a storage comprising eight, 5000 m3 tanks in a
bunded enclosure. There are facilities for loading sulphuric acid into rail tankers for dispatch to
customers.
A weak acid slurry produced in the gas cooling/cleaning section of the acid plant is treated to
neutralise the acid and remove arsenic and heavy metals.
2.1.10 Waste Water Cleaning
Waste acidic liquors arise from:
- the gas cooling/cleaning sections of the sulphuric acid plants
> the copper electrorefinery and the precious metals refinery where the accumulation of
impurities is controlled by bleeding a portion of the electrolytes from their respective circuits
Milk of lime produced in a lime slaking plant is added to the combined acid effluent to control the
pH at a value of about 11. Mixing is carried out by air sparging in a series of rectangular tanks.
The resultant slurry which contains a mixture of precipitated calcium sulphate, calcium arsenate
and heavy metal oxides is discharged to a large settling pond. Here the solids settle out and
the clarified liquor is decanted via an overflow weir into a channel which leads to the Pirdopska
River.
2.1.11 Services
2.1.11.1 Steam
The plant requirement for steam is provided by the waste heat boilers connected to the flash
smelting furnace and the converter furnaces. In winter months these are supplemented by five

oil fired boilers with a capacity of 12 000 kg/hour steam. In summer only one boiler is normally
in operation.
2.1.11.2 Oxygen
Oxygen with a purity of 96.5%, is produced by a fractional distillation technique using turbines to
compress the gas. The plant supplies compressed air as well as oxygen required for the
smelting and converting process. Some oxygen is also bottled for sale to customers.
2.2 Raw Materials
The main feed for the smelter consists of copper sulphided concentrates from domestic and
overseas sources. Local mines which supply concentrates include:
- Panagurski Medni Mini
- Medet
Ellatzite
- Majaravo
The total quantity of concentrates treated in 1996 was 454 483 tonnes.
Other feed materials include silica sand, and copper scrap. Limestone is used to prepare milk of
lime for neutralisation of acidic waste water.
2.3 Major Power Sources
The sources and approximate annual consumption of energy are:
electricity        210 000 Mwhr
heavy fuel oil     35 000 to 40 000 tonnes
-  propane            1 200 tonnes
The heavy oil, contains 3 to 3.5 % sulphur.
2.4 Water Supply and Consumption
Industrial Water is supplied by a 800mm diameter pipeline from the Dushantzi reservoir, which is
approximately 12 km north of the MDK site. The dam is owned and maintained by MDK. The
maximum water demand is about 400 litres per second (1440 m3 per hour)and is used as
process water and as cooling water for the smelter, acid plant and oxygen plant.
Potable water is supplied from another small reservoir fed by the rivers Slavska and Sanar Dere.
The average usage is 1411 m3 per day.
Water for make-up in the waste heat and utility boilers is demineralised in an ion exchange unit
having a maximum capacity of 80 cubic metres per hour.

3. REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
3.1 Structure of Environmental Management
The environmental management in MDK is a responsibility of the managing director. Reporting
directly to him is the manager of the Environmental Protection department.
This department is sub-divided into two sectors; air protection, and water and soil protection.
Each sector includes a laboratory and is led by a specialist. The Technical and emissions gas
analysis laboratory is managed by a chemist and employs 6 technicians. The Water and solid
products' analysis laboratory is managed by the water and solid products' specialist, and has a
personnel of 3.
3.2 Legislative Requirements for Environmental Protection

Pursuant to Order No. C13-14-4-3 dd. 27.10.1997, the Director of Regional Environment
Inspection Office (REIO) imposed a 157 082 leva/month sanction for overnorm pollution of the
rivers Pirdopska, Sanar Dere and Kisselo Dere.  This penalty has been in force since
10.12.1996 and is still being paid. Its update is pending in view of the new sanctions' amounts
tied up with the country's minimum wage.
3.4.3 Soil
There are no sanctions.
3.5 Investments for Environmental Protection
MDK's environmental investments for 1996 totals 100 million leva. It is impossible to quote
precise figures on these types of investments for the period 1990-1995 due to prevailing
inflationary processes.
3.6 Annual Expenses for Environmental Protection
Environmental expenses include all requirements for repair and maintenance of the
environmental protection facilities, environmental monitoring equipment, as well as all pre-
feasibility studies concerning environmental protection. The relevant facilities are:
sulphuric acid plants and the 2.ESPs for de-dusting after the drying furnaces are registered
as final air treatment facilities
-  the lime neutralisation effluents' treatment station, the small lagoons, slime pond, and the
sanitary waters treatment station are all considered as waste waters' treatment facilities.
It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the costs associated with environmental protection.
3.7 Public Complaints Concerning Operation of the Facility
The communities of Pirdop and Zlatitsa have not filed any complaints, staged protests, or sent
signals for blast pollution resulting from the entity's operation since 1995.
Data on the health status of the area's population is provided in Section 4.1 and 5.1.

3.8 Industrial Emergencies and Response Plans
The following major environmental incidents have been reported:
- June 28th, 1988. As a result of failure of the absorber in the No 2 sulphuric acid plant, a fog
of sulphuric acid was emitted from the 120-metre stack for 10 minutes. The emission fell on
the town of Zlatitsa. Children from the northern part of Zlatitsa had to be evacuated. There
were no casualties.
- The town councils of Pirdop and Zlatitsa submitted an official letter saying there was
increased gaseous emissions from MDK just prior to the plant's shutdown in June 1994
April, 1992. Following a leakage of mono-hydrate sulphuric acid from the old reservoir, the
river of Topolnitza was polluted as a result of which all fish were dead, all the way up to the
inlet of the Topolnitza dam.
May, 1994. While decanting a sulphuric acid tank, the river of Topolnitza was once again
polluted, although this time the fish were not affected.
MDK has developed emergency action plans for all situations that could damage elements of
the environment. These plans were drafted jointly by the"Citizens' Protection Service" and the
environmental department.
In 1997 the plan 'Instruction for air protection from ovemorm pollution with impurities resulting
from MDK's operating activity" was implemented and commissioned. The instruction deals with
technology and emergency occurrences which could generate blast ejections of impurities into
the atmosphere, as well as procedures for staff to follow in order to eliminate the repercussions.

4.       CHARACTERISTICS   OF   POLLUTANTS   AND   ASSESSMENT   OF
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
4.1 Air
MDK operates a complex technological process for recovering copper and by-products from a
variety of copper ores and concentrates. The combination of the processes involved, and the
potentially harmful nature of the materials treated, results in the release of gaseous and
particulate material into the atmosphere. Management and control of these releases is therefore
a high priority so that operation of the facility does not lead to environmental damage of the
ecosystem.
In order to assess the potential impact of atmospheric emissions from MDK it is necessary to
understand:
- the current state of the air and meteorological conditions which influence the impact of
releases
- the sources of emissions to air from MDK
- the nature of control systems employed to prevent or minimise release to air, their suitability
and effectiveness
- the methods used for monitoring emissions inside and outside the plant
the Bulgarian environmental legislation regulations that MDK must conform to and how these
regulations compare to standards and guidelines used in other jurisdictions or those
recommended by international investment banks
4.1.1 Climate and Meteorological Data
The Zlatitsa-Pirdop valley lies within-the European continental climatic zone. However the local
climate is influenced by its geographical setting in a deep valley within two mountain ranges.

4.1.1.4 Rainfall
The area is typified by rainfall throughout the year with an annual average of 617mm. However,
the proportion of rainfall in the summer months from May to August is greater than the rest of the
year, with an average of 300mm.
Snow cover in the region lasts from 60 to 80 days, primarily in the months of January and
February, and reaches depths of 700mm
4.1.1.5 Air Quality in the Region of MDK(
The characteristics of the local meteoroligical conditions are important to the impact of
emissions from MDK on the region. Of particular relevance are:
- the prevailing directions of the wind which direct the emissions towards the local urban
centres
- the prolonged periods of calm weather which prevents efficient dispersal of emissions
In addition the location within the valley surrounded by mountains leads to temperature inversion
phenomena and air recirculation effects which also hinder dispersal of emissions.
The location of Pirdop and Zlatitsa relative to the MDK site together with the prevailant weather
conditions make them susceptable to emissions from the plant. Ambient air monitoring in Pirdop
and Zlatitsa indicate that the concentrations of sulphur dioxide, sulphuric acid aerosols, dust and
hydogen sulphide in the atmosphere have frequently exceeded the accceptable standards
according to Bulgarian law. This is discussed further in Section 4.1.3.

4.1.2 Sources of Emissions
Air emissions from MDK are classified into the following groups:
- controlled emissions of process gas
- uncontrolled emissions of process gas
- fugitive emissions
Controlled emissions comprise process off-gas streams which are subject to some form of
abatement prior to discharge to atmosphere via either the 325 m stack or the 120 m stack.
Uncontrolled air emissions comprise process emissions that are captured at source but then
discharged to atmosphere without any prior cleaning or treatment via the high stacks.
Emissions that result from process operations, material handling and material storage that are
released directly to the atmosphere without any prior cleaning or treatment are defined as
fugitive emissions.
A simplified flowsheet showing the sources and routes of air emissions from the processes is
given in Figure 4.1-2. Descriptions and characteristics of each point source and the control
techniques used to minimise release of pollutants are given in the following sections.
4.1.2.1 Controlled Emissions
Controlled emissions consist of the treated process gas streams from the following operations:
- flash smelting fumace
- converter furnace
- concentrate dryer
Brief descriptions of these units and their operations are provided in a previous chapter.
4.1.2.1.1 Flash Smelting Furnace
Off-gas generated by the flash smelting process contains suspended particulate matter,
metallurgical fume and gaseous substances, in particular sulphur dioxide. A typical flow rate
and off-gas composition for the flash furnace operating at a concentrate flow rate of 60 to 80 tph
is:
Volume Flow Rate     60,000   Nm3/hr
Sulphur dioxide, SO2   15 - 20   %vol
Sulphur trioxide, S03   0.5 -2.0  %vol
Oxygen, 02           1.2      %vol
Carbon dioxide       6,5      %vol

4. 1.2.1.2 Converting furnace
Off-gas from the converter furnace is collected in water cooled hood arrangements and carried
in ducts to the common inlet plenum of a waste heat boiler.  Typical characteristics of the
converter gas are:
Volume Flow Rate      60,000  Nm 3/hr
Dust                    15    mg/Nm3
Sulphur dioxide, SO2    5 - 8   %vol
4.1.2.1.3 Concentrate Dryer
The off-gas from the concentrate dryer contains particulate matter and products of oil
combustion. Sulphur dioxide is present due to the high sulphur content (:3%) of the oil. For the
dryer operating at a concentrate feed rate of 60 to 80 tonnes per hour, the typical characteristics
of the off-gas are:
Volume Flow Rate       70 000    Nm3/hr
Dust                  50 - 300   mg/Nm3
Sulphur dioxide, SO2    0.2 -0.6   %vol
4.1.2.2 Uncontrolled Air Emissions
The following uncontrolled emission sources have been identified at MDK:
- Flash Fumace Matte and Slag Tapping
Emissions generated from matte and slag tapping operations are collected in a
secondary fume system consisting of a local tap hole hood, covered launder and ladle
hood. Once collected, the fume is vented to the atmosphere via the 325 m stack. This
fume contains low levels of SO2 and dust, and is well below the specified emission limits.
- Peirce-Smith Converter Charging and Tapping
The converters are equipped with secondary hoods to capture charging and tapping
emissions. However, these hoods provide no apparent fume control due to inadequate
exhaust flow rate. Any fume collected by the secondary hoods is exhausted to the
atmosphere via the 325 m stack.
- Anode Furnace Emissions
Emissions from the anode furnace are vented directly to the atmosphere via the 325 m
stack. The composition and flow rate of the off-gas stream will vary significantly over the
complete cycle of the furnace (oxidation, reduction, and heating). The S02 concentration
in the off-gas can be significant during the oxidation cycle. There are facilities to recycle
a portion of the anode fumace gas stream to the dryers, but are not in regular use.

Utility Steam Boilers
Combustion emissions from the oil fired boilers are vented directly to the atmosphere via
the 325 m stack. Typically two boilers producing 12.5 tph steam at 0.6 MPa pressure
are fired in the winter months only. Sulphur dioxide will be present in the off-gas stream
due to the high sulphur content of the oil. The typical gas volume and composition from
one boiler are:
Volume         13 500   Nm3/hr
SO2            3000      mgl Nm3
NO2            318       mg/ Nm3
> Flash Fumace Emergency Stack
During abnormal furnace operating conditions it may be required to vent gases directly to
the atmosphere for a short time period via a local stack at the furnace area. Any gas
released during this period will be high in sulphur oxides, and will have a significant
impact on the local ambient air quality.
4.1.2.3 Fugitive Emissions
The impact of fugitive emissions on ambient air quality can be highly significant because of the
height at which they are released and the relatively slow rate of dispersion. The following major
fugitive emission sources have been identified at MDK:
- Flash Fumace Waste Heat Boiler
Leakage of flash furnace off-gas from the waste heat boiler directly to the atmosphere is
estimated to be the largest single source of fugitive emissions from furnace operations.
The SO2 and dust content of the off-gas will be high.
- Flash Furnace Reaction Shaft
Leakage of gas from the reaction shaft is emitted into the smelter and is released into the
atmosphere primarily through the ladle aisle roof vent. The flow rate of this emission
source is estimated to be 20 000 to 30 000 m3/hr, and will contain a high percentage of
S02 gas. Considerable dilution will occur prior to being released to the atmosphere.
- Peirce-Smith Converter Charging and Tapping
Emissions generated during charging and tapping operations are released into the ladle
aisle and vented from the smelter building through the roof vent. These emissions are
released on an intermittent basis that typically lasts from 2 to 4 minutes, with the number
of emission periods per day dependent on the production rate. The flow rate at the roof
vent is estimated to be between 150 000 to 250 000 m3/hr, and the principal pollutants
will be dust and S02.

.- Peirce-Smith Converter Slag Transfer to Slag Pots
Emissions released during transfer of converter slag from the ladle to the slag pots are
released directly into the smelter and are vented to the atmosphere via the ladle aisle
roof vent. The quantity of S02 gas and dust in this emission stream is small.
- Anode Furnace Fugitive Emissions
Anode furnace fugitive emissions arise from charging and tapping operations, plus
puffing of gases from the furnace mouth during reduction, oxidation and holding periods.
The contribution of this emission source to the overall smelter emission release rate is
small.
- Smelter Slag Pile
Small quantities of dust and fume are released from the slag pile in the smelter when
lades are emptied and when the slag is being loaded into charge boats with a front end
loader. The overall contribution to the total smelter emission rate is small. The potential
for hydrogen suiphide production exists during water cooling of the slag pile.
= Material Handling
Airbome dust emissions are generated during the handling, transport, and mixing of dry
materials in open areas.  These fugitive emission sources cannot be accurately
quantified.
- Waste Material Storage
Open storage areas for tailings produced at the flotation plant and calcium arsenate
residues are a source of wind borne dust emissions.
4.1.3 Facilities for Control and Monitoring
4.1.3.1 Flash Fumace Off-Gas Control
An induced draft fan extracts the off-gas from the fumace via an uptake duct and into a complex
system designed to cool and clean the gas prior to release into the atmosphere. The gas
handling system consists of:
- A waste heat boiler for gas cooling and preliminary dust collection
- Two hot gas electrostatic precipitators operating in parallel for removal of particulate matter
-  A double contact, double absorption and a single contact, single absorption sulphuric acid
plants that convert sulphur dioxide into concentrated sulphuric acid.  The acid plants
comprise several discreet stages:

Under the present operating regime, the double contact, double absorption acid plant treats all
off-gas until it reaches capacity. Surplus gas is treated in the single contact, single absorption
acid plant.
The design parameters of the major items of control equipment are:

4.1.3.2 Converter Off-Gas Control
The converter off-gas is treated in a similar manner to the flash fumace off-gas. That is, after
passing through a waste heat boiler and two electrostatic precipitators operating in parallel, the
converter off-gas is combined with the flash fumace off-gas, treated in the acid plant, and
discharged via the 120m stack.

4.1 3.3 Concentrate Dryer Off-Gas Control
Two Lurgi electrostatic precipitators are installed (one for each dryer) to capture the dust prior to
discharge via the 325 metre stack. There is no control of the sulphur dioxide component in the
gas stream.
The design parameters for each of the electrostatic precipitators are:
Flow capacity                72,000 Nm3/hr
Inlet dust loading          50 to 200 g/Nm3
Outlet dust concentration    150 mg/Nm3
Cleaning efficiency         99.5 %
4.1.3.4 Status of Emission Control Equipment
Flash Fumace Precipitators
The furnace is currently operating at a feed rate considerably lower than the design capacity.
One consequence of this is that the off-gas volume is approximately 50 percent of the design
rating of the downstream gas handling system. The problems associated with this lower than
design flow include:
long residence time in the boiler
- overcooling of the gas
sulphur trioxide formation due to catalytic oxidation of sulphur trioxide
Sulphur trioxide concentrations in the boiler exit gas have been measured recently at 2 to 3
percent. Such levels together with overcooling of the gas stream create serious problems in the
electrostatic precipitator due to acid condensation and formation of sulphate deposits on the
electrode surfaces. This leads to loss of cleaning efficiency and exit gases containing several
grammes per cubic metre of dust compared with the design expectation of SOmgm3. Although
the dust is subsequently captured in the sulphuric acid plant the additional dust loading and high

quantity of neutralised sludge for disposal.

One of the precipitators has recently been substantially modified in an attempt to alleviate these
problems. The modification involved conversion from 3 to 5 fields and the installation of new
electrodes. However it will not been possible to assess the impact of these modifications until
the plant has run consistently following the recent maintenance shutdown.
Converter Fumace Precipitators
The dust removal efficiency of the electrostatic precipitators associated with the Peirce Smith
converters is also less than the design rating due to similar reasons explained above albeit to a
lesser extent.
Concentrate Dryer Precipitators
Typical dust concentrations in the precipitator exit gas are several hundred mg per cubic metre
compared with a design rating of 150 mg/im3 and an emission requirement of only 20mg/m3.
Although the preipitators are not achieving the design cleaning efficiency even under optimum
conditions they are unable to meet the requirements of environmental legislation.
Sulphuric Acid Plants
Measurements at MDK indicate that the double contact acid plant is operating with an efficiency
near to the design and that the sulphur dioxide concentration in the tail gas is less than the
required standard.
The single contact plant is unable to meet the emission criteria and the sulphur dioxide level in
the tail gas exceeds the standards by a factor of approximately six.
The current operating regime of the smelter results in a low grade of matte produced. Thus the
blowing time required in the converters is longer than ideal for correct sequencing. It is normal
smelter operating practice to operate with only one converter blowing at a time. However it is
understood that occasionally two converters are in the blowing cycle simultaneously. Under
these circumstances the combined gas volume capacity of the acid plants is insufficient to
handle the total gas flow from the smelter and the converters.
The average tail gas compositions from the acid plants in 1995 and 1996 were:

Stack Emissions
The tail gases from each acid plant and the combined gas stream entering the 120 metre stack
are monitored continuously for sulphur dioxide using Hartmann Braun instrumentation. Results
are plotted continuously on chart recorders in the acid plant control room and also logged by
computer which is programmed to interpret the results as instantaneous, hourly or 24 hourly
averages. These measurements are supplemented by chemical analyses carried out three
times per day on each acid plant tail gas and on the inlet gases so that the conversion
efficiencies can be monitored.
Gas compositions of the furnace precipitator outlet gas are measured several times each day
to assist process control in the furnace as well as the acid plants.
The combined gas stream from uncontrolled emissions prior to entering the 325 metre stack is
monitored for dust, suphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides twice per week.
Ambient Air Quality
Monitoring of the sulphur dioxide concentration in the ambient air is carried out by automatic
monitoring stations located in the towns of Pirdop and Zlatitsa. The instruments, which use a
UV fluorescence technique, are owned by MOK. The average concentration is measured over
15 minute periods and the results are transmitted directly to the computer centre at MDK where
they can be presented as 30 minute or 24 hour and monthy averages.
4.1.4 Assessment of the Impact of Air Emissions on the Environment and Human Health
4.1.4.1 Point Source Emissions: 120 and 325 m Stacks
Annual emissions of sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide from the 120 metre stack during the
period 1991 to 1996 are given in Table 4.1.4-1.

As shown, the emissions of sulphur dioxide exceed the acceptable limits by a high margin. This
is due to the inherent low conversion efficiency of the single contact acid plant.

(1) - Maximum Acceptable Concentration
Emissions of dust from the stack are a factor of 6 to 12 times above the regulatory limit of 20
mg/Nm3. Up to 1996, SO2 emissions were within the MAC of 3000 mg/Nm3. In 1996 the
maximum acceptable concentration was reduced to 800 mg/Nm3; since then the sulphur dioxide
emission has been above the standard.
Although emissions from the 325 metre stack are in excess of the limit values for these
parameters the impact on the surrounding area is not considered significant in view of the height
of release point. Dispersion analysis carried out previously predicts that the maximum ground
level concentrations resulting from this emission point are:
- 0.3035 mg/m3 sulphur dioxide at a distance of 1906 metres
- 0.009 mg/m3 dust at a distance of 2141 metres
Emissions from the 120metre stack have a more significant impact on the local environment
under certain weather conditions. This was witnessed during the plant assessment when the
plume from the stack was observed to be falling towards ground level close to the plant
4.1.4.2 Fugitive Emissions
Windborne dust emissions from the surface of the slag tailings pond pose a significant
environmental risk particularly to the town of Pirdop whose perimeters are adjacent to the slag
treatment area. Fugitive emissions from the fumace operations are also significant. Ambient air
quality measurements carried out during the assessment revealed the following:

These are above above the maximum acceptable limits for ambient air.
4.1.4.3 Ambient Air Quality in Pirdop and Zlatitsa
The pollution of air by dust and sulphur dioxide in Pirdop and Zlatitsa is caused by emissions
from:
> industrial sources
- domestic fuel burning
- vehicles
Domestic heating is a significant source of sulphur dioxide in winter months.  However,
monitoring data suggests that MDK is the principal emitter of sulphur dioxide and particulate
matter, as will be demonstrated by the following results.
Emissions from the smelter and wind blown dust from dry storage areas are difficult to quantify.
An indirect assessment of these emissions can be gained by measurement of dust and gaseous
substances in the atmosphere in the region of MDK.
Air quality in the Pirdop-Zlatitsa region is monitored at four sites. Two are located in Zlatitsa,
approximately 1500 metres west of MDK; and two are located in Pirdop, approximately 1500
metres north east of MDK. Up until 1994 there was only one monitoring station in each town.
The results of the air monitoring for the last 10 years are given in the Interstitial Report,
Environmental Assessment of the Impact of Emissions of MDK Pirdop on soils in the Region
Pirdop-Zlatitsa, Section 4. Annual average concentrations of dust, sulphur dioxide, sulphuric
acid and arsenic for the last 10 years are presented graphically and are included in the
Technical Support Document - Air Emission. The annual average concentration of hydrogen
sulphide in the period 1992 to 1996 is also presented in this document.
The results of the air monitoring programme in comparison with Bulgarian criteria are
summarised below:
Dust
Between 1986 and 1996 the average dust concentration was frequently in excess of the
maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) in both Pirdop and Zlatitsa. The highest recorded
concentrations were in 1990 and 1991 when the annual concentrations exceeded the MAC by a
factor of approximately 3. Since this period there appears to have been a general decrease in
dust levels. In 1995 and 1996 one station in Pirdop recorded values slightly in excess of MAC

whereas the other was approximately half of the MAC. A similar pattern was observed in
Zlatitsa in this period.
Sulphur Dioxide
The annual average sulphur dioxide concentrations in Pirdop and Zlatitsa were significantly
above the MAC in the period 1986 to 1996. The highest recorded concentration was in 1991
when the level in Zlatitsa was more than 10 times the MAC; in Pirdop in the same period the
average concentration of sulphur dioxide was more than 8 times the MAC. In preceding years
the concentrations were between 6 and 8 times the MAC. The high values in 1991 were
attributed to the intermittent operation of the fumace and frequent venting of fumace off-gas via
the emergency stack.
Since 1993 there appears to have been a general decline in the annual average sulphur dioxide
concentrations both in Pirdop and Zlatitsa. In 1996 the annual average concentrations in
Zlatitsa were approximately 0.1 mg/m3 and 0.06 mg/m3 (compared with a MAC value of 0.05). In
Pirdop one monitoring station recorded levels slightly above the MAC whereas the second
station was approximately half the MAC. However, 24 hour average concentrations for all four
stations were exceeded frequently in 1996; the highest instantaneous level being 14 times
above the MAC. The standards were exceeded on 23% of the days. The results for the period
1992 to 1996 are given in Table 4.1.4-3.

The annual distribution of ambient sulphur dioxide concentration shows peak concentrations
during the winter months of January to March. Minimum values are associated with the summer
period. The high average sulphur dioxide levels in winter are attributable partly to burning of
high sulphur fuels in the urban areas of Pirdop and Zlatitsa. The very low levels recorded during
June and July coincide with MDK's annual shutdown.
Sulphuric Acid Aerosol
This parameter was measured at two stations, one in Pirdop and one in Zlatitsa, for the period
1986 to 1996. The average annual concentrations measured over this period were reasonably
consistent between 0.3 and 0.5 mg/im3. However, in 1994 the annual average rose to above 0.8
mg/im3 at the Zlatitsa station.
Hydrogen Sulphide
In general there has been a steady decline in hydrogen sulphide at both monitoring locations
since 1992. In 1996 the hydrogen sulphide concentration was approximately 1.5 times the MAC
of 0.008 mg/mr3 compared with 16 times greater than the MAC in 1992. Measurements during
the course of 1996 do not indicate any significant seasonal variations, although the annual peak
was recorded on August coinciding with increased production at MDK.
Nitrogen Dioxide
Measurements in Pirdop and Zlatitsa show that annual average values of nitrogen dioxide are
well below the MAC value. Furthermore, there were no instances of short term (30 minute)
concentrations recorded.
Arsenic
Ambient arsenic concentrations were measured at Pirdop and Zlatitsa in the period 1986 to
1996. The highest annual averages were recorded in 1995 and 1996 at about 0.0016 mg/m3 in
Zlatitsa.
4.1.4.4 Impact Assessment
The air monitoring programme carried out during the last decade has revealed that average
levels of suspended particulate matter and sulphur dioxide are in excess of the maximum
acceptable concentration permitted by Bulgarian environmental legislation. The concentrations
of these substances have also exceeded European Union (EU), World Health Organisation
(WHO) and US EPA limit or guideline values. These are compared with Bulgarian standards in
Tables 4.1.4-4 and for dust and Table 4.1.4-5 for sulphur dioxide.  In general, Bulgarian
standards are compatible with limit and guideline values recommended by these organisations.

To assess the state of health df-the population in the area around the MDK and of the
employees in the plant itself, data from the municipal hospital and the environmental impact
assessment studies were used. The annual reports of the Ministry of Health were used to
obtain morbidity in the country as a whole. The following is a summary of the findings from
source reference (2).
The inhabitants of Pirdop, Zlatitsa and Chelophech, as well as the employees, are exposed to
direct, indirect and cumulative impact of the emissions from processes in the plant.
Measurements for pollution of air, soil and water prove the presence of toxic chemical
compounds and dust in quantities exceeding the permissible concentrations. The last extensive
study carried out by the NCHMEH in 1990 showed increase of the arsenic content in the nails,
hairs and urine of the examined adults and children. The levels of cadmium and, in a lesser
degree, of lead and zinc in their blood were also shown to be increased. A change in white
blood cells count (eosiinophilia) was found in the blood of children suggesting possible allergic
diseases. The prescence of these substances has the potential to impact the health of the
population.

In view of the environmental pollution recorded it was anticipated that higher morbidity would
occur in the region. Examination of patients over 15 years of age during the 1992-1996 period
showed the incidence of common diseases, of the population, as listed in Table 4.1.4-7, to be
similar or somewhat smaller that the population of the whole community.
According to data from the municipality hospital, a higher incidence of tuberculosis, malignant
neoplasms, pulmonary and renal diseases is estimated. Lung diseases in the region of Pirdop,
Zlatitsa and Chelopech are less than the mean for the country. The reason is that acute
respiratory diseases in the country as a whole are higher than in the region due to epidemic
"bursts" of influenza and other acute viral respiratory diseases. The closeness of the region to
Sofia, where major national hospitals and health-care centres are found, allows patients to be
offered qualified medical service. In spite of their overall lesser incidence as compared to the
mean for the country, some respiratory diseases tend to become more frequent in the region.

The frequency of Neoplastic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, brain artery and other Central
Nervous System diseases are similar in the region to the country as a whole. The registered
diseases among production workers do not differ significantly in number from the mean values
for the region. In fact, brain artery and reoplastic diseases are less common although ulcers,
especially duodenal ulcer are more common.

4.2 Waters
4.2.1 Characteristics of Surface Water
The main region under the influence of environmental emissions form the MDK smelter is the
Pirdop-Ziatitsa valley. The valley consists of arable farms including pastures and meadows with
a totai land area of 8500 ha. Major centres of population are at the villages of Pirdop, Zlatitsa,
Mirkavo, Anton and Chelopech. The area under assessment contains part of an important
mining industry that includes ore mining, ore beneficiation and metallurgical processes. These
industries play an important role in the economy of the region, but are also the main source of
industrial pollution in the Pirdop-Zlatitsa valley.
The combination of geological setting, climatic effects and proximity to the site is highly
significant with respect to the environmental impact of water emissions from MDK on the Pirdop
Zlatitsa region.
4.2. 1. 1 Surface Water System and Groundwater Hydrology
The Zlatitsa-Pirdop area is situated in the catchment area of the Topolnitza river, which rises in
the Sredna Gora range and flows southwards towards the Plovdiv plain. Major tributaries which
influx the Topolnitza are the Pirdopska, Zlatishka and Chelopechka which arise in the southem
slopes of the Balkan mountain range. The surface water system is illustrated on Figure 1.3-2
and the schematic map of local streams is Figure 4.2-1.
The Zlatishka and Pirdopska rivers are of particular relevance since they receive waste waters
from the MDK site and then flow through the towns Pirdop and Zlatitsa. These two rivers run
east and west of the MDK plant, respectively. At the plant, the rivers are fed by surface waters
of water catch basins with areas of 39 km2 and 73 kM2, respectively. After the Zlatishka and
Pirdopska the rivers Chlopechka, Tzarkvenishka, Selska and Mirkovska join the Topolnitza
River. The flow of the Topolnitza is regulated by a dam south of the town of Porbrene. The dam
provides a reservoir of water which is used for irrigation in the important agricultural region of the
Plovdiv plain.
The slope of the natural ground ranges from 3 to 5% in the plant and is underlain by alluvial soils
consisting of mixtures of clays, silt, sands and gravels. These soils have high clay content at
near the surface and become more silty and sandy with depth. The groundwater was observed
to be 8 to 10 m below the ground surface with the surface clay providing a cap over the
groundwater.

4.2.1.2 Water Resources, Quantitative and Qualitative Characteristics
Rain water and relatively neutral MDK plant wastewater are collected in any one of three
streams and are discharged untreated into either the Pirdopska or the Zlatitsa Rivers. Drain
water from the eastern 50 hectares and surface water from the slag treatment process and slag
storage areas flow into the Kiselo Dere stream at an average flow rate of 40 litres/second (I/s).
Drainage from the western part of the plant, which includes the production areas, flows into the
Sanar Dere channel at a flow rate of 110 I/s. The Kiselo Dere empties into the Pirdopska River
while the Sanar Dere feeds the Zlatishka River. The pH and the concentrations of sulphate,
electrical conductivity and heavy metals such as copper and arsenic in the Sanar Dere, Kiselo
Dere and the slime lagoon channel that decants water from the acid plant effluent treatment
plant that flow into the Pirdopska River frequently exceed Bulgarian Regulation No. 7 standards.
These streams also contain a substantial concentration of suspended solids while the drainage
water flowing into the Sanar Dere has been found to be contaminated with oil. Sanctions have
been applied against MDK for continuously exceeding the environmental standards established
by the govemment.
According to a study made by the Bulgarian Ministry of the Environment and Water in 1995,
MDK used 12,065,000 cubic metres of water from the Dushantzi Dam for production purposes
(i.e. an average of 380 IVs). Another 51,200 cubic metres (i.e. average 1.6 Is) were extracted
from the Slavtzi and Sanar Dere for drinking water. Although there is no reported shortage of
drinking water supply at present, water usage by MDK is an issue that must be considered since
adequate clean water supply for drinking and irrigation represents a potential future problem for
the region.  The drinking water supply network and treatment plants are in need of
modemization. Some towns, such as Zlatitsa, do not have waste water treatment facilities.
As the main consumer of water, MDK should consider implementation of intermediate and long-
term measures to control and optimize water usage by adopting improved water treatment
methods, as well as reuse and recycling of water wherever technically and economically
feasible. This will result in an increased supply of clean drinking water for the towns of Pirdop
and Zlatitza. In addition to this, the banks of the rivers Slavska and Koru Dere must be
reinforced to prevent further erosion, which greatly contributes to the total dissolved and
suspended solids in the rivers.
The flow characteristics of the Topolnitza and its tributaries vary considerably according to the
season. Furthermore the flow of the Topolnitza is regulated by the Dushantzi dam, which is
used to supply "industrial water" to MDK. The mean perennial water discharge of the Topolnitza
and the relevant tributaries are given in Table 4.2.-1.
The peak flow of the rivers occurs in March and April and the lowest in August and September.
Liquid effluent discharges from MDK and the towns of Zlatitsa and Pirdop guarantees minimum
flow of 100 - 150 I/s and 50 - 60 I/s for the Pirdopska and Zlatishka respectively. The average
relative contributions of these tributaries to the total flow of the Topolnitza are 12 to 15 percent

on the water quality of the Topolnitza river.

4.2.1.3 Receiving Waters Categories
The Regional Environmental Inspectorate is responsible for maintaining the water quality
objectives for the river systems influenced by discharges from MDK. According to Ordinance
No. 7, Darzhaven Vestrick 96/86, the receiving waters are classified as follows:
Sanar Dere:                              Category II
Kiselo Dere:                             Category II

All rivers downstream of MDK to the Topolnitza Dam are classified as Category l1l. The
concentration limits for waters corresponding to these categories are listed in Table 4.2-2.
It is significant that the Topoinitza River prior to the inflow of the Pirdopska River is classified as
Category IlIl because of pollution with sulphates and heavy metals, in particular copper, lead and
zinc. These contaminants originate from the Medet tailings pond sited a few kilometers
upstream of the influx of the Pirdopska.

4.2.2 Sources of Waste Water Discharge from MDK
There are three primary waste effluent streams discharging from MDK. These are sanitary
waste water, surface drainage water, and liquid effluent from the neutralization plant. The
sanitary waste stream is discharged into the Pirdopka River upon being biologically treated and
neutralized if need be. At present, the drainage water flows untreated into the Kiselo Dere or
Sanar Dere, which empty into the Pirdopska and Zlatishka Rivers, respectively.  These
untreated effluent streams have been found to contain large concentrations of suspended solids
and hazardous wastes, such as sulphates and arsenic. Many of these pollutants are picked up
from the slag treatment and storage areas.

A survey of all key water users and water discharge points was conducted at the MDK site
during the period July 23-26, 1997. This period was selected for sampling after the smelter and
acid plants were restarted on July 8-10, 1997, allowing about 2 weeks for the process to
stabilize and the concentrations in the various water streams to become more representative of
steady state. During this 3-day sampling and monitoring period, composite water samples were
taken from each of the twenty four sample points three times per day at 6-hour intervals. The
composite sampling from each of-the 24 points was repeated on the following day to allow not
only for shift-to-shift variability but also for day-to-day variability in the flow and concentrations.
The samples from each day were blended for each location and analysed separately for each of
the two days at an MEW - approved laboratory in Sofia, as well as at MDK's laboratory.
Furthermore, single 2-day composite samples from each sample point were also prepared and
analysed in a Canadian ISO - certified environmental laboratory. The following acidic effluents
were audited:
4.2.2.1 Acidic Process Effluents
A primary environmental concern at MDK is the arsenic laden 'weak acid" Process Effluent
which combines the following acidic streams (see Appendix B - Figure 6.2.2.1):
- Acid plant No. 1 quench tower effluent
- Acid plant No. 1 wet electrostatic precipitator (ESP) effluent
- Acid plant No. 2 quench tower effluent
- Acid plant No. 2 wet ESP effluent

The above effluents have a combined flowrate of approximately 80 - 100 m31h (22 - 27 Us),
almost 50 - 60 m3/h (14 - 17 Uis) originates from the smelter gas cooling and cleaning equipment
immediately upstream of the acid plants. The"weak acid' thus produced has a pH in the range
0.5-1.0 and a sulphuric acid concentration in the range 2.5% - 4.5%, with an averaae of
approximately 3.0%, a TSS of approximately 250 mg/L , cadmium 0.8 mg/L, copper 55 mg/L,
lead 33 ppm and zinc of approximately 7 ppm.
As shown in - Figure 4.2-2, the acid plant effluents are mixed with the acidic effluents from the
Electrolytic Copper Refinery, the Precious Metal Refinery and spent regenerant from the ion
exchange columns to make up a total of approximately 80 - 100 m3/h (i.e. 22 - 27 fs) of mixed
acidic effluent having approximately the following composition which was determined during the
recent site survey:
pH: 0.8; TSS: 170 mg/L; H2SO4: 2.5%; arsenic: 43 mg/L, copper 18 mg/L; iron 24 mg/L; lead 5.3
mgfL; manganese 0.3 mg/L; selenium 5.3 mg/L and zinc 1.8 mg/L.
Although the acid concentrations are realistic, the above analyses of the mixed"weak Acid"
show relatively low concentrations of arsenic and copper, reflecting possibly unsteady process
operation during the brief site survey conducted on July 23 - 26, 1997. A more extensive survey
of the effluents from the MDK plant should therefore be conducted in the future.  Any
observations and conclusions drawn in this report will, however, reflect the long-term and
historical characteristics of the water Which has been documented in the referenced reports.
This "weak acid" effluent is currently processed in a neutralization treatment plant followed by
settling of solids in the "Slime Lagoon". The clarified liquid is allowed to overflow into the
Pirdopska River, while the solids gradually fill the lagoon.
Based on the recent data, the clarified water discharged from the"Slime Lagoon" had a flowrate
of 23 Ips (i.e. 83 m3/hr), a pH of approximately 11.8 and an electrical conductivity of 3900S/cm
(see Appendix B - Water Analyses). The treated process effluent also had a total dissolved
solids (TDS) of 2800 mg/L, a total suspended solids (TSS) of 55 mgIL, fluoride 8.0 mg/L, a
sulfate concentration of 1600 mg/L, an arsenic concentration of 0.03 mg/L, copper 0.12 mg/L,
lead 0.078 mg/L, manganese < 0.005 mg/L, cadmium 0.003 mg/L, total chromium 0.006 mg/L,
molybdenum 0.45 mg/L, nickel < 0.01, selenium 0.85 mg/L, silver <0.01 mg/L, and zinc 0.021
mg/L.

Based on the above analyses, the treated process effluent was out of compliance with the
emission standards of category Ilil with respect to pH, electrical conductivity, TDS, sulphate and
selenium.
In past measurements, arsenic concentrations in the range 1 - 5 mg/L have been observed,
which are typical of the quality obtained from the current treatment method. As explained
above, the lower arsenic concentration obtained in the effluent during the recent site survey may
be due to unsteady process conditions upstream of the effluent treatment plant.
Detailed analyses of all process-effluent streams before and after neutralization are provided in
Appendix B for reference.
4.2.2.2 Treated Sanitary Wastewater
Sanitary wastewater produced at MDK is treated biologically in a two step process. Once
treated, the water is mixed with treated process waste streams and ultimately ends up flowing
into the Pirdopska River.  Alternatively, if the continuous pH monitoring indicates acidic
conditions in the treated sanitary waste stream, it is diverted to the lime neutralization plant
along with other acidic process streams. Although in relatively good repair, this wastewater
treatment plant (WWVTP) is of insufficient capacity for current loads.
In the MDK site survey conducted during the period July 23 - 26, 1997, the following
measurements were made:
- Flowrate: 9 I/s (32,4 m3/h)
- Quality: Treated effluent met all concentration limits for Ordinance No. 7, Category IlIl and
Category 11, except for selenium (0.35 mg/L vs. 0.01 mg/L under Category II and l1l)
4.2.2.3 Other Production Effluents
In addition to the above process effluent, process non-contact cooling water (i.e. from cooling
towers) is directed to the Sanar Dere Channel which flows into the Zlatishka River. Flowrates of
these streams measured during the recent survey (July 23 - 26, 1997) were reported earlier in
Table 4.2.-1.
4.2.2.4 Surface Run-off From 'Old" Eastem Part of the Plant
Rain water and drainage from the eastern 50 hectares flows into the Kiselo Dere stream at an
average flow rate of approximately 40 I/s. In the recent MDK site environmental survey, a flow
rate of 84 Us was determined in the Kiselo Dere. The Kiselo Dere flows into the Pirdopska
River. The concentrations of copper and arsenic frequently exceed the standard for the Kiselo
Dere (Category 11 Surface Water). These streams also contain a substantial concentration of
suspended solids. Sanctions have been charged against MDK for continuously exceeding the
environmental standards established by the government.

During the recent site survey, the concentrations of most parameters were found to be in
compliance with Category IlIl concentration limits, except for TSS (77 mg/L vs. 50 mg/L for
Category II and 100 mg/L for Category ill), copper (2.2 mg/L vs. 0.5 mg/L for Category ll) and
iron (21 mg/L vs. 5 mg/L).
4.2.2.5 Slag Flotation
To enhance the overall metals recovery from the smelter, flash furnace and converter slags are
treated in a slag flotation recovery system. The slag is treated by milling and flotation to
concentrate valuable metals, thus increasing recovery. The tailings of the process are pumped
as a slurry into a retention basin where water is recovered and recycled. According to a recent
SNC study, the current rate of deposition of total tails is 350 000 tpa. It is estimated that over
the 15 year life of the concentrator 4-5 million tonnes of tails have been deposited, with a total
volume of 3-4 million cubic meters. The allocated area for the basins has almost reached its full
capacity.
4.2.3 Treatment Facilities and Techniques for Monitoring and Control
4.2.3.1 Existing Acidic Effluent Treatment Process
In the existing "process effluent" treatment plant at MDK, the equalized acidic effluent is
neutralized with approximately 15-20 m3/hr (4.2 I/s) of lime containing approximately 5-15%
calcium hydroxide. The neutralization takes place in a 3-chamber interconnected in-ground
neutralization pool, with agitation provided by as many as seven air spargers in each of the
three chambers. The pH is controlled at approximately 12 using a single pH control unit located
in the second neutralization reaction chamber.
The overall dimensions of the neutralisation train are: 24 m x 4 m x 3 m, giving a liquid retention
time > 1.5 hours. Although this retention time is adequate, mixing and pH control are not done
efficiently, resulting in potentially excessive chemical usage and relatively poor water quality.
The mixed neutralized slurry has a flowrate of approximately 100 m3/h and contains mainly
calcium arsenite, calcium arsenate, copper arsenate, iron hydroxide, zinc hydroxide and other
metal compounds. The following specific concentrations were obtained from actual analysis of
the influent and the neutralized slurry obtained during the recent environmental assessment
conducted on July 23 - 26, 1997:
Equalised "Weak Acid" Effluent from the Plant Before Treatment:
pH: 0.8; electrical conductivity: 95000 pS/cm, TSS: 170 mg/L; sulphate: 25000 mg/L; fluoride 1.7

0.21 mg/L; copper 25 mg/L; iron 38 mg/L; lead 4.3 mg/L; manganese 1.5 mg/L; nickel 0.74
mg/L, selenium 3.5 mg/L, titanium 0.95 mg/L and zinc 1.4 mg/L.
This effluent overflows directly into a large lagoon (i.e. The Blue Lagoon) where the solids settle
and the supernatant overflows into a small creek which eventually pours into the Pirdopska
river. The 'Blue Lagoon" is almost full with inorganic sediment accumulated during the past few
years.
In addition to poor design of the neutralization plant, the following problems were identified:
-  The effluent is supersaturated with solids including calcium sulphate (i.e. gypsum) which
deposit along the path of effluent flow to the river.
- The pH of the effluent (i.e. 12) is too high for discharge. A pH in the range 6-9 would be
acceptable based on Bulgarian and Osparcom legislation.
Because of the high pH and intimate exposure of the neutralized effluent to the ambient air,
absorption of CO2 takes place. The reaction of excess lime and calcium arsenite/arsenate
solids with carbon dioxide produces calcium carbonate (i.e. limestone) and soluble
arsenous/arsenic acid, respectively. While the former provides an unsightly appearance
(bluish/greenish deposits of calcium carbonate caused by presence of copper and possibly
nickel compounds), the latter results in the introduction of "hazardous" soluble arsenic into
the receiving waters.
Amphoteric heavy metals such as zinc will be solubilized at the high pH of 12.
- Because of inefficient clarification, suspended solids are carried over into the outflow canal
or creek resulting in further deposition of hazardous compounds including calcium
carbonate, calcium sulphate, calcium and copper arsenate, etc.
4.2.3.2 Techniques for Monitoring and Control
The pH of the neutralized effluent from the neutralization plant is automatically controlled and
monitored continuously by MDK personnel. Since this is a single pH control system, its
accuracy is limited. However, the large 'alkali' Slime Lagoon provides a buffer in case of
malfunction in the pH control system.
While incidents relating to the acid plant mal-function in the past resulted in direct discharge of
strong acid into the river system, containment and automatic diversion of the acid flow to
standby tanks will prevent occurrence of such events in the future.
MDK has a reasonably well-equipped central laboratory which is capable of conducting most of
the chemical analyses reported earlier, including:

pH, TDS, TSS, acidity, metals using ICP and various anions by titration and colourimetric
methods.
MDK conducts the following analyses on a regular basis:
- Copper, arsenic and sulphuric acid on acidic effluents twice per week.
- Copper, arsenic, iron, nickel, sulphate and dissolved solids in the treated water entering
Pirdopska River, daily.
- pH, copper and arsenic in site drainage entering Sanar Dere and Kiselo Dere, daily.
- Arsenic in the Topolnitza River at the village of Petrich, daily.
In addition, the Regional Environmental Inspectorate monitors the Topolnita River and its
tributaries at various points on a monthly basis. While Regulation 7 specifies that water
sampling to be conducted in the receiving water, after the water flowrate has stabilized (i.e. at
the Topolnitza River), the Inspectorate actually conducts sampling on the three water channels
from the MDK plant (i.e. Main Process Effluent Channel, Sanar Dere Channel and Kiselo Dere
Channel). Although the Sanar Dere and Kiselo Dere are classified as, Category II surface
waters and the Slime Pond channel are classified as Category IlIl, all penalties imposed with
respect to violation on pH, conductivity, sulphate, copper, arsenic, manganese, etc. are
calculated using the less stringent Category IlIl criteria. In any case, it is recommended that the
sampling points for the purpose of computing penalties be moved downstream close to the
points where the Zlatishka River and the Pirdopska River meet and pour into the Topolnitza
River.
4.2.4 Characteristics of Treatment Plant Sludge
The insoluble solids formed as a result of neutralization of the acidic effluents deposit in the
Slime Lagoon compact over a period of time, resulting in a "thickened sludge or cake". The
density of the solid varies with depth. The settled sludge consists approximately of the following
main components (100% solids basis):
Ca: 20%; As: 10%; S04: 50 - 60 %; oxygen, Mg, Si, Fe, Cu, Zn: balance.
MDK does not carry out any further treatment of the sludge. The Slime Lagoon is nearly full of
solids which have settled and accumulated over a long period of time.
4.2.5 Assessment of the Impact of Water Pollution on the Environment and Human
Health
The quantity and quality of water leaving the MDK site has a significant impact on the water
quality in the Topolnitza river and its tributaries in the Pirdop-Zlatitsa region. Indirect factors

affecting the water quality of the river system include pollution from the atmosphere via rainfall
and run-off from contaminated soils. The concentrations of dissolved substances, sulphate,
arsenic and copper have exceeded the maximum acceptable values over a long period, often by
a considerable amount.
Over the past two decades the environment surrounding MDK has suffered the impact of
increased industrialization and anthropogenation, although the former has played a far more
significant role. In 1970 the average concentration of dissolved substances in the Topolnitsa
River at Poibrene was 150 - 300 mglL, the pH was between 6.5 and 8.0, the sulphate
concentration was 30 - 70 mglL, the total hardness 6 - 10 mg eq/L, and the oxigen concentration
was on average between 3 and 6 mg 021L.
Between 1970 and 1987 MDK increased production levels while the surrounding area became
more densely populated. Waste treatment technology did not advance significantly during this
period and consequently, the level of pollution increased. At Poibrene, the concentration of
dissolved substances increased to 300 - 500 mg/L, the pH reached 8.5, while the hardness rose
to 10 - 16 mgeqlL. Toxic substances, such as arsenic and copper, had already exceeded the
maximum acceptable concentration (MAC).
Beyond 1987 new facilities were added to MDK and the first stage of its reconstruction and
modernization were realized. This added a greater stress on the local environment, as did the
load of increased urbanization. The Zlatishka river now registers a concentration of dissolved
substances at 1500 mg/L, a pH between 10 and 11, and a sulphate concentration of 100 - 200
mg/L. Arsenic and copper concentrations registered at 5 to 10 times their MAC values.
A study to determine the sources df pollution in the Topolnitza river and the impact on water
quality has been in progress since 1989. This involved regular sampling of the Topolnitza at
several points and also its tributaries in the Pirdop-Zlatitsa region.
These sample points are identified in Figure 4.2-3 and described as follows:
1.-  Topolnitza prior to the inlet of the Pirdopska
2.-  Topolnitza after the inlet of the Pirdopska
3. -  Zlatishka prior to the inlet of the Pirdopska
4. -  Pirdopska prior to the inlet of the Ziatishka
5. -  Pirdopska prior to its inlet into the Topolnitza.

The results of sampling at these positions with respect to heavy metals and minerals content are
detailed in the PHARE project report (Reference No. 2, Section 0.4). A brief summary of these
results is displayed in Table 4.2.5.
A direct correlation of water quality in the Topoinitza with influx of polluted water from the MDK
site via the Pirdopska river is not possible because of indirect influences. The results indicate
that the Topolnitza is contaminated with minerals and heavy metals (copper, zinc, cobalt and
manganese) prior to the junction with the Pirdopska and hence before the influence of MDK.
This is primarily due to discharge from the Medet mine tailings pond.
However, the Pirdopska river downstream of the discharge points from MDK shows the
increased presence of copper, manganese, iron and arsenic and has a high alkaliinity (pH 11).
These along with the Medet tailings pond discharge contribute to the total pollution load in the
Topolnitza. MDK is a major source of arsenic found in the Pirdopska, Zlatishka and Topolnitza
rivers.
Studies in the late 1980's showed arsenic at elevated levels, (in excess of 100 mg/litre). The
Topolnitza river at the village of Petrich had an arsenic content of 7 mg/litre. The waters from
the Topolnitza are an important source of irrigation for agricultural land along its length and for
the Plovdiv plain. As a result of the high levels of arsenic in the waters, treatment of high
arsenic Chelopech ore was prohibited at MDK in 1989. Although the water quality, in terms of
arsenic, has improved since then it is understood that arsenic in sediments in the Topolnitza and
its reservoir is still unacceptably high. Use of the reservoir water for irrigation is stopped when
the volume falls below a critical level.
The effect of arsenic and other heavy metals on health is discussed in Section 4.4.
4.2.6 Groundwater
The effect of solid wastes on the groundwater is discussed in Section 4.6B to provide an

4.3.1 Production of solid wastes
Production information available for 1996 shows the following major solid wastes produced at
MDK:

The fayalite tailings (tailings) and calcium-arsenite slimes (slimes) are stored in earth
containments located east and south of the plant as shown on Drawing 90579-002.
The solid wastes, their production and properties are discussed in Section 4.3.3.
At the present time MDK has not obtained a permit(s) for treatment of hazardous wastes and the
deposition sites have not been authorized in accordance with legislation (see Section 6.1.3).
4.3.2 Historic Operation
Since the start of MDK operation in 1958, the plant has produced large quantities of wastes,
has undergone many technological changes and has been subjected to similar changes in
environmental regulations. As a result the present plant site contains large quantities of solid
wastes that is located in piles, within abandoned buildings, buried and contained within earth
embankments.
Solid wastes at the MDK plant have been evaluated by three organizations:
1. Rudmetallurg Project JSCo. carried out an extensive inventory study to characterize,
qualitatively and quantitatively, the solid wastes on the MDK plant site that was reported on
October 1996 (Reference 5)
2. PHARE Project - Section 14 - Solid Wastes in the Region of Pirdop-MDK, Analyses of their
Type, Quantity, Quality and Accumulation Effects, April 1997. ( Reference 2)

The following is a combined summary of these studies.
4.3.3 Existing Solid Wastes and Materials
Since 1958 MDK has produced large quantities of solid wastes that have been largely stored on
the plants properties. PHARE project (2) simplified these wastes into seven major categories
that are given on Table 4.3-2. The locations of the three largest storage areas for solid wastes
are shown on Drawing 90579-002.

The seven major categories of solid wastes are discussed in the following sections:
4.3.3.1 Process Categories of Solid Wastes
Slag was deposited between 1958 and 1988 in a large mound of 11 ha containing 6.3 million
tonnes of material. The slag contains high values of arsenic, copper and zinc.
The material is a copper smelting discard slag that consists primarily of fayalite (iron silicate).
The iron and silicon oxides constitute about 87 to 88% of the total weight. Small quantities of
base and alkali materials provide some neutralizing effect but the lime and magnesia are likely
wholly or mostly combined as silicate or not otherwise readily available because they are
dispersed internally in large chunks of the cooled slag.
The average results of chemical analyses of three samples of the slag are given in Table 4.3-3.

The levels of sulphur and copper are relatively high for discard slag. Some copper would be
present as oxides, but a large part as copper sulphide. Some of the sulphur would be combined
with iron and the other base metals present.
The dissolution is likely to be slow because of the coarse nature of the slag and the usually slow
kinetics of acid formation. However, because some toxic elements are present, it is necessary
to minimize the exposure of the slag to water and oxygen.
To confirm that the slag is not creating a serious risk on ground water contamination, leachate
testing according to EPA standards was conducted on the three samples and compared to
Bulgarian Ministry Guidelines (Reference 16). The range and average results of significant
parameters of the three samples are summarized on Table 4.3-4.

Fayalite tailings were deposited between 1988 and 1996 within a dyked area north of the
existing flotation plant. It is estimated that this area contains about 1.9 million tonnes of fayalite
tailings that contain low quantities of arsenic, copper and zinc.
In the initial years of operation all the tailings were stored in the large tailings pond just north of
the flotation plant. However, once it neared its capacity, a second small pond was constructed
for the purpose of dewatering the tailings slurry and sending the tailings offsite. In 1996, about
80,000 tonnes of the tailings were sold to the cement industry and the remainder was trucked to
the tailings pond at the Elatzite Mine, approximately 12 km from MDK.
The fayalite tailings are the discard fraction from the flotation plant which recovers quantities of
copper and other metals from the slag as a sulphide concentrate. The process involves
crushing of the fractured slag and removing the additional copper and heavy metals by means of
flotation using heavy medium. The resulting waste, fayalite tailings are pumped in a slurry form
into tailings ponds where the solids settle. The excess water is pumped back into the flotation
plant.
The tailings are a finely ground material consisting of about 10 percent of sand sized particles
and the remaining coarse to fine silt. Particle sized distribution of the tailings is given in Table
4.3-5.

It is assumed that the fayalite tailings have potentially less toxicity than the slag since their origin
is a slag which has undergone further treatment.
Calcium-arsenite slimes (slimes) have been produced since 1958 and deposited in a slime
pond south of the plant and in small lagoons located just south of the electrolysis plant. The
main storage area was the slime pond. However, when the slime pond reached several times
the design capacity, the small lagoons were used as a temporary storage until the slime pond
capacity was increased by raising the perimeter dam crest. Because of the small capacity of the
small lagoons, the slimes were excavated to provide additional storage capacity and the slimes
were deposited at several locations, with the main locations being:
- buried east of the small lagoons,
- concrete wall enclosure west of the electrolysis plant and
- north edge of the gIime pond

In the slime pond, the slimes have a near liquid consistency, whereas, the slimes in the small
lagoons, after several years of drying, are in a solid form best described as a soft earth. Main
contaminants of the slimes are gypsum, calcium arsenite, heavy metal, oxides and sulphates.

Union Miniere - EIA of MDK Smelter
HATCH                                                                       Page 73
The ore that was smelted previously from the Chelopetch Mine contains relatively high contents
of arsenic and gold. Some of this gold has been precipitated into the slime. There has been an
interest in the past to recover the gold from the slimes and possibly use the profits from the gold
to pay for the reclaimation of the existing slime pond. Aside of the environmental problems that
would be posed in the gold recovery process, there had not been an accurate evaluation on the
concentration of the gold in the siime pond until this year, documented in the work by
Rudmetallurg and the PHARE Project.
The PHARE Project (Reference 2) reported gold concentration in the range of 5 to 15 g/t and an
average of 7 g/t. The work recently completed by Rudmetallurg showed that the concentration
of gold varied with depth from 0.3 gft near the surface to 6.6 g/t at maximum depth of 12 m.
Considering that the largest volume of slimes are near the surface because of the geometry of
the pond depression, it is reasonable to assume that the average gold concentration is about 2
g/t. At this concentration is not economical to extract the gold and pay for the slime pond
reclaimation.
Converter furnace dust (CFD) is the only covered waste storage area at the plant.
Toxicologically the most hazardous waste with high contents of toxic metals including (As, Cd,
Cu, Pb, Se, Sb, Zn) and high sulphate and acidity. Human exposure (inhalation, skin contact) is
made possible by the fine dust particle characteristics of the waste, and represents an extreme
potential hazard. This material is recovered from the converter fumace electrostatic precipitator
and contains significant amounts of copper which ideally should be recovered by recycling back
to the smelting process. However, it also contains substantial amounts of impurities which may
be detrimental to the finished copper product.   Many copper smelters operate a
hydrometallurgical process to remove these impurities and recover the copper in a form suitable
for recycling.
4.3.3.2 Miscellaneous Old Equipment and Materials
Electrolysis tubs in various stage of demolition, located mainly west of the electrolysis plant and
to lesser extent in the east part of MDK site. High levels of Cu, sulphates, As and Pb are
present. Chemical analysis of the tubs is given in Table 4.3-8:

Other solid wastes that are found in smaller quantities on the plant are:
Linings and deposits for the roasting plant, gas pipelines and stack. The toxicity and potential
hazards rank it second to the CFD. High levels of toxic metals (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Se, Sb) and
sulphates together with high acidity (- 1,5 pH in leachate) are the main characteristics of this
material. Its potential risk is enhanced by the fine-grained nature of waste (dust potential).
Process additives and media. Relatively heterogeneous material consisting of; deteriorated lime
(still useable for neutralization when needed), Rasching rings (As, Cu, Pb, sulphates), spent
vanadium pentoxide catalyst from the contact acid plant (V, C, sulphates, acid reaction).
Heavy oil contaminated earth in bermed containment areas and underground storage tanks,
pipes and within decommissioned transformers and hydraulic gears.
Plant debris and soils contaminated by metals and/or oil, spread all over the entire plant area.
The oil contamination traces are mainly found in the former heavy oil area systems.
Insulation materials consisting of- glass fibres, cement-asbestos. These are located mainly at
the north side of the old metallurgy and sulphuric acid production building. Preliminary
separation prior to disposal is necessary. The material has been impacted by Cu, As and
sulphate.  The metal toxicological effects are accompanied by the carcinogenic effects of
asbestos in its dust particles.
Steel scrap and process equipment. This material can be managed using standard recycling
techniques, although the cleaning of the material and linings may still pose a heaith and safety
concem.
4.3.3.3 Abandoned Buildings.
A large portion of the southern part of the MDK is covered with abandoned, and some collapsed
buildings that will have to be demolished and removed as early as possible. While these
buildings take up valuable space, the main detriment of these buildings is that precipitation
soaking these structures produces contaminated water, both surface and groundwater. Drawing
90579-101 shows the general location of the abandoned buildings.
Some.of the major abandoned buildings and structures are:
> old smelter complex
- old acid plant
old training centre
unfinished water treatment plant
old heavy fuel storage area containing surface and buried tanks

The clean-up of the MDK main plant area will require the removal of the buildings and also the
cleaning of any heavily contaminated surface soils. Table 4.3-9 provides an estimate of the
major categories of wastes that will have to be removed from the MDK plant site.

PHARE Project Conclusions
The above study concluded the following:
1) Prevent soil and air contamination by dust produced by wind erosion of the old fayalite
tailings pond.
2) The slime pond has limited capacity to store additional calcium-arsenite. Should investigate
improved technology for treating effluents from acid plant.
3) Present methods of storing electrolysis tubs do not confirm to hazardous waste storage
guidelines. Provide facility for storing/disposing this product to meet the hazardous waste
storage requirements.
4) Spent vanadium catalyst shall be stored in a designed facility.
5) Wastes from production buildings shall be sorted, assessed and classified in categories.
Process/dispose of these wastes safely.

6) Most of the landfills and storage areas for solid waste have not been licensed and do not
meet requirements for safe storage and therefore are sources for releasing and
accumulating of wastes in the region of the plant.
7) A more detailed assessment of dangerous water and soil contamination with toxic soluble
components of solid wastes requires leachate testing.
4.3.4 Assessment of Solid Waste Handling and Disposal Facilities
The handling and storage of solid wastes at MDK does not comply with Bulgarian and
International regulations nor with common international copper smelter practices. UM/Hatch are
in general agreement with the PHARE Report conclusions.
The following are highlights of our assessments:
I1) Fayalite Tailings The main risk associated with the tailings is due to the very fine particles
that have no cohesion. As a result, this material has a great potential for wind erosion when
dry with the dust settling on surrounding land. The settled dust is not a desirable material
because it contains elevated arsenic and heavy metals that are not acceptable for
agricultural and residential areas. As discussed in Section 4.1, dust from this source
frequently contributes to the higher than permissible levels of heavy metals in the air in
Pirdop and Zlatitsa.
2) Slime Pond The existing slime pond is filled to capacity and the perimeter dam has
marginally stability. The slime has only about 0.5 m freeboard left (distance between the
pond water level and dam crest) which is marginal for a pond containing hazardous slimes.
The pond has experienced past seepages through the dam section and these are again
occurring. The seepages are an unsafe phenomenon because the seepage areas can
enlarge with time and the thus lowers the stability of the dam. Finally, the slimes are in a
near liquid state. Any instability of the dam would result in the majority of the enclosed
slimes to run into the Topolnitsa River.
3) Solid Waste Piles The material in many of the waste piles scattered around the MDK plant
are hazardous.  Precipitation falling on these piles causes contaminated water to
contaminate adjacent streams, the underlying soil and the groundwater.  Soil and
groundwater contaminations are discussed in section 4.6.
4) Old Fuel Storage Area The old fuel storage area contains large puddles of oil and diesel fuel
that have flowed out of broken steel and concrete storage tanks.  Most of the tanks,
including underground tanks, have remnant fuel and the soil in the whole area is
contaminated from fuel spills. Presently the contamination of soil and groundwater by
petroleum is limited. However, with time this will increase.
PR90579 Rev. 0. 9510e                                                 PR. DOT, Rev. 3. 9SS

5) Abandoned Buildings A large portion of the southern part of the plant is covered with
abandoned buildings, with several of them in a collapsed state. The building materials and
remnant equipment is contaminated by dust and the buildings contain remnants of copper,
lead, etc. by-products. Precipitation penetrating the collapsed buildings causes hazardous
wastes to contaminate surface waters, underlying soils and groundwater.
4.3.4.1 Assessemnet of the Impact on Environment and Human Health
The large quantities of contaminated and some hazardous solid wastes are producing an impact
on the environment and human health as follows:
- Storing contaminated solid wastes on natural ground causes the underlying ground to
become ever more deeply contaminated
- Precipitation falling on the contaminated solid wastes and abandoned buildings causes the
contaminants to be spread widely through surface water and groundwater
-Wind born dust from the uncovered portion of the fayalite tailings pond and from other
contaminated areas is polluting the atmosphere and the land and buildings in neighbouring
towns and agricultural areas.
Each of the above is a potential risk to the health of the population and the ecosystem.
4.4 Toxic and Other Dangerous Substances
4.4.1 Toxic Substances
The characteristics and chemical composition of raw materials, products and waste materials
from the production activities together with various waste materials found within and around
MDK have been described in the previous sections. These indicate the presence of a variety of
toxic substances
The toxic effects of the relevant substances on human health and the ecosystem are described
below:
Vanadium and Vanadium pentoxide
Human Health Effects
Inhalation
Workplace exposure to vanadium and vanadium compounds could lead to irritation of the
respiratory tract, nausea and pigmentation of the mucous membranes.
Skin and eye
Contact dermatitis and conjunctivitis may occur after exposure to Vanadium dust.
PR90579 Rev. 0. 95/08                                              PR.OT. Rev. 396105

Carcinogenicity
There is no evidence that Vanadium poses a risk to carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic
effects.
The main daily maximum admissible norm for the general population amounts to 0.002 mglm3.
Ecotoxicological Effects
Vanadium and Vanadium pentoxide have moderate ecotoxicological effects on the aquatic
environment. Appropriate and relevant toxicity data for the terrestrial environment are generally
lacking.
Cadmium
Human Health Effects
Inhalation
LC50 inhalation, rabbit: 45 mgIm3/4 h (Cd dust) - reference: Fielder & Dale, 1983. Toxicity Rev.
7. Health & Safety Executive, HMSO, London. Inhalation of Cd in workplace conditions may
lead to severe irritation of the airways followed by dyspnoea, cough and cyanosis. Symptoms of
metal smelters fever may occur, such as: cough, headache, dizziness, weakness, chills, fever,
chest pains and shortness of breath. The symptoms can be preceeded by a latent period. In
severe cases fatal chemical pneumonia have been described after extreme high exposure
conditions.
Ingestion
LD50 oral, rat : 2330 mg/kg (Ref. Fielder & Dale, 1983. Toxicity Rev. 7. Health & Safety
Executive, HMSO, London). Ingestion results in nausea, vomiting, headache and abdominal
cramps.
The main exposure source of Cd for the general population is through the food chain in
particular the consumption of vegetables. Smoking doubles the average intake.
The main daily maximum admissible norm for the general population is 0.00002 mg/iM3.
Skin
Cadmium fumes can be irritating to mucous membranes.
Eyes
Cadmium fumes are irritating for the eyes.

Chronic Toxicity
Prolonged environmental or workplace exposure may cause effects on the kidneys resulting in
proteinuria and kidney dysfunction. Obstructive airways disease and pulmonary fibrosis have
only been described in workers exposed to Cd dust or fume for prolonged periods. Some
deaths due to emphysema have been reported in workers repeatedly exposed to very high
levels of Cd fume.
Carcinogenicity
Cadmium metal has not been classified by the EU, as a carcinogen.
Cadmiumoxide has been classified by the EU, as a carcinogen category 2 (may cause cancer
by inhalation).
Irmitation/Sensitisation
Cd dust can be irritating for eyes, nose and throat.
Ecotoxicological Effects
The soluble Cd ion is considered as ecotoxic for the environment; especially algae are sensitive
to bio-available Cd exposure.
The transformation rate of insoluble Cd forms (incl. Cd metal) towards soluble ions, is however
rather slow.
Lead
Human Health Effects
Inhalation/lngestion
LC50 inhalation and LD50 oral data on rats, for Pb metal powder are not available.
Over-exposure in workplace conditions through inhalation and/or ingestion of Pb containing
dusts or fume may result in loss of appetite, anaemia, malaise, insomnia, headache, irritability,
muscle and joint pains, muscle weakness, gastritis and liver changes. Heavy exposure to
certain specific lead compounds such as Pb acetate and Pb phosphate has been associated
with decreased fertility and increased abortion of pregnant women.
Skin
No irritation or skin sensitisation has been reported.
Eyes
No eye irritation has been reported.

Chronic Toxicity
Prolonged workplace or environmental inhalation or ingestion of high concentrations of lead dust
(or fume) may cause impaired neurotransmission and immune system function and may
increase systolic blood pressure. Kidney damage has only be reported by workers in these
circumstances.
Irrftation/Sensitisation
No skin sensitisation or irritation has been reported.
The main exposure sources of Pb for the general population is food. However, uptake of dust
via pica behaviour could contribute up to 50% of the Pb uptake of small children. The main daily
and mean annual maximum admissible norm for the general population is 0.001 mg/M3.
Ecotoxicological Effects
There is a general lack of appropriate and relevant toxicity data on Pb. Studies on Pb salts
however show that the soluble Pb ion could cause moderate ecotoxic effects to organisms of
different Taxonomic and Throfic levels.
The transformation rate of insoluble Pb forms (incl. Pb metal) is very slow.
Copper
Human Health Effects
Inhalation
Inhalation of Cu oxide fumes in workplace conditions may cause metal fume fever characterised
by chills, fever, aching muscles, dryness and metal taste, headaches, sneezing, nausea and
irritation of nose and trachea.
Ingestion
Oral TDLo human: 0.120 mg/kg.
Ingestion of Cu containing dusts under extreme high workplace conditions may irritate the
intestinal tract.
Skin
Copper fumes can be irritating to skin and mucous membranes.
Eyes
Copper fumes are irritating for the eyes.

Chronic Toxicity
Prolonged exposure in workplace conditions may lead to hemolysis, absence of urination,
hypertension and convulsions, kidney and liver damage.
Irnitation/Sensitisation
Possibility of: - eye irritation
- irritation of skin and mucous membranes
- irritation of the intestinal tract if swallowed.
The main daily maximum admissible norm for the general population is 0.01 mg/M3.
Ecotoxicological Effects
The soluble Cu ion has shown to be ecotoxic in the aquatic ecosystem, in particular-for fish and
algae. The terrestrial toxicity of bio-available copper is moderate. Vertebrates are generally not
very sensitive towards Cu exposure with the specific exception of sheep, which are highly
sensitive for Cu through oral intake.
The transformation rate of insoluble Cu forms (incl. massive Cu) to bio-available Cu is very slow.
Arsenic
Human Health Effects
Inhalation
Dust or fume inhalation under workplace conditions may cause severe irritation of the lungs,
upper respiratory tract or a perforated nasal septum. Systemic arsenic poisoning may occur
with symptoms of weight loss, nausea, diarrhoea, weakness, loss of appetite and skin lesions.
Ingestion
LD50 oral rat: 763 mg/kg. Arsenic is harmful by ingestion.
Severe irritation of lining of stomach and intestines may occur. Ingestion of arsenic may cause
also arsenic poisoning and gastrointestinal disorders.
Skin
Dust or fume may cause severe irritation, dermatitis or contact dermatitis.
Eyes
Severe irritation of the eyes or conjunctivitis may occur.

Chronic Toxicity
Damage to liver, kidneys and nervous system occurred in the past after severe workplace
exposure to As.
Carcinogenicity
Arsenic has been ciassified by IARC as group 1 carcinogen. Group 1: the agent is carcinogenic
to humans.
IrTitation/Sensitisation
Severe irritation of eyes and skin may occur.
The main daily maximum admissible norm for the general population is 0.003 mg/m3.
Ecotoxicological Effects
Arsenic has moderate ecotoxic effects on the aquatic ecosystem. The transformation rate of
insoluble As forms to bio-available As is, however, rather quick. As in water and sediments can
be removed from these compartments through methylation by bacteria.
4.4.2 Assessment of Influence of Pollution by Dangerous and Toxic Substances on the
Environment and Human Health
The interpretation of the above effects and environmental fate characteristics indicate that
improper storage of dangerous substances at the MDK-AD plant could potentially lead to
exposure of these dangerous substances to the environment and the human population.
However, proper control, packaging and storage conditions could overcome further exposure to
the environment.
4.5 Harmful Physical Factors
Physical factors contributing to the overall environmental pollution of an industrial facility include
noise, vibration, and radiation. At MDK, the only physical factor with the potential to contribute
to the environmental pollution generated from the smelter is noise.
4,5.1 Noise
Noise is generated on a continuous basis by process and related auxiliary equipment (e.g., fans
and pumps), and on an intermittent basis by vehicle traffic transporting material in and around
the facility at MDK.
Typical of other copper smelters, noise generated from the operation of process equipment at
MDK is not excessive and is further attenuated by building structures. Process equipment is not
a source of environmental pollution at MDK. Auxiliary equipment located outside of production

Union Miniere - EIA of MDK( Smelter
HATCH                                                                         Page 83
buildings are a potential source of noise pollution, and for MDK, this is limited to fans and pumps
used to transport process gases and liquids.
The fans and pumps currently in use at MDK are designed for low pressure, high volume flows,
and as a result do not generate excessive noise levels. This is validated by noise level
measurements along the border of the smelter as reported in the Phare Report. The measured
noise levels did not exceed 60 dBA, and the maximum admissible noise levels for industrial
areas is 70 dBA (Sate Gazette No. 87/1972 and No. 16/1975).
Noise generated from vehicle traffic in an around the MDK smelter also has the potential to
contribute to the overall environmental pollution generated by the smelter.  However, the
intermittent nature of this noise source minimises its overall impact as is demonstrated by the
measured data. The localised, short term effect of noise generated by truck traffic can be
minimised by proper maintenance of truck exhaust systems and routing that avoids populated
areas.
4.5.2 Radioactive Contamination
There is no known radioactive contamination at the MDK smelter, as verified by UM.
4.6 Soils
4.6.1 Areas Within the Facility
The MDK plant site is heavily contaminated from nearly 40 years of operation that started in
1958. The contamination is the result of operation of the smelter, acid and electrolysis plants,
deposition of hazardous wastes within the plant and various stage of collapse of abandoned
structures. An overview of the contaminated areas is shown on Drawing 90579-002.
In an overall visual assessment of the plant, 15 areas were identified to be potentially
contaminated. The level of contamination for these areas was investigated by means of
sampling solid waste materials on the surface, surface soil sampling, test pits and drill holes.
Representative samples of wastes, suspected contaminated soils and water were submitted for
chemical analyses. The following areas were investigated in detail:
- abandoned heavy fuel area
- abandoned smelter area
- abandoned sulphuric acid area
- small lagoons
electrolysis plant
> hydrochloric acid tanks
copper sulphate plant
> miscellaneous solid waste piles.

The contamination different areas is illustrated on selected photographs given in Appendix A
and on Drawings 90579-002 and 90579-005 in Appendix B.
The environmental assessment was performed in a staged approach as given below.
Visual Assessment
The plant was visually inspected to determined potentially contaminated areas which would
require a more detailed evaluation. This assessment was made based on the current
operations and the management of toxic materials. The assessment focused on the old part
of the plant, especially in areas around abandoned buildings, as these were the most likely
areas to be heavily impacted.
- Waste Piles
During the visual assessment of the site, 15 piles of solid materials were found. Samples of
these wastes were collected for chemical analyses to determined their level of
contamination, if any. Management options for these materials could then be assessed
based on the level of impact. The analysis undertaken included pH, selected metals and
anions and/or total petroleum hydrocarbons (petroleum), as appropriate.
- Surface Soil
In areas with evidence of surface soil contamination, soil samples were collected and
chemically analysed for metals and hydrocarbons.
- Test Pits
In heavily contaminated areas, test pits were excavated to depth of 3 m.  The soil
stratigraphy and contamination were visually examined and samples were taken at 1 m
intervals for chemical analyses. A total of 10 test pits were excavated.
- Drill Holes
Twenty-two drill holes were advanced on the plant site to determine the soil stratigraphy,
depth of contamination, and groundwater level. In each drill hole, soil samples were
selected for chemical analyses. Water samples were also collected to determine water
quality. In 6 drill holes, pumping tests were performed to determined the hydraulic
conductivity of the overburden material.
Twenty-one of the drill holes were advanced to depths ranging from 6 to 20.5 m. The final
depth advanced was decided in the field based on the level of contamination encountered in
each drill hole. One drill hole was advanced to 30 m to locate the bedrock surface as
bedrock was not encountered in the first 21 drill holes at the plant site. None of the drill
holes at the plant site encountered bedrock, including the 30 m deep hole.

The locations of the test pits and drill holes are shown on Drawing 90579 -101.
4.6.1.1 Chemical Analyses
Soil, water, and waste samples were sent to a laboratory for chemical analyses. Two suites of
chemical analyses were selected for the soil and waste samples analysed:
determination of moisture content (reported as %solids), As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, Zn, and
pH
- determination moisture content and petroleum hydrocarbons concentrations.
Samples were also analysed to determine the Sb, Se, chlorides and nitrates concentration, if
necessary.
The drilling and laboratory chemical testing was managed ESS Engineering Service Sofia Ltd.
The chemical testing for the drill hole samples and water samples from piezometers was
performed by Laboratory Geological Investigations Ltd., Sofia. The laboratory is authorised
under:
Geotechnical Investigations    No. 83 - N/30.07.1996
Petroleum and Coal Geology No. 82 - N/30.07.1996
The protocols from drilling and the results from the chemical testing of soil and groundwater
testing are given in Technical Support Document 7.
Chemical testing of solid wastes, which also had been conducted by Rudmetall Project in
October 1996 (Reference 5), surface and test pit samples was conducted by Hatch. These
results are summarised in this report and given in detail in Technical Support Document 3.
The results from chemical tests of soil samples are discussed under major plant areas below.

Notes: * criteria for organics (non soluble)
For the assessment of the soil quality, the Belgium criteria were preferred over the Bulgarian
criteria. Bulgarian criteria are based on agricultural land use and do not provide criteria for the
assessment and remediation of an industrial site. Belgium criteria are risk based criteria for the
remediation and clean-up of industrial properties, and are similar in magnitude to soil criteria for
industrial sites elsewhere in the world and were determined based on the protection of human
health for the site and surrounding areas. Criteria for the Netherlands and Canadian clean-up
criteria are also provided for comparison.

Bulgaria does not currently have groundwater criteria applicable for the assessment or
remediation of a site. Surface water criteria do exist and are applied to the surface water
receptors of the runoff (Category II Criterion) and effluent discharges (Category III Criterion)
from the site. These criteria are not discharge quality but rather receptor quality criteria.
The groundwater assessment was completed by comparing the groundwater analytical results
to the Belgium  groundwater criteria.  These criteria are designed for the protection of
groundwater resources and potential human use. As indicated on Table 4.6.1.2-2, the Belgium
groundwater criteria are generally more stringent than both the Bulgaria Category II and
Category IlIl surface water criteria.
4.6.1.3 Soil Contamination Assessment
4.6.1.3.1 Soil Overburden
The 22 drill holes advanced to a maximum depth of 30 m did not encounter bedrock. The soils
were found to be irregularly stratified clays, clayey silts to silts, sandy clays and sand layers with
varying of gravel and boulder content [to 70%]. The heterogeneity of the stratigraphy is the
result of the alluvial origin of the material.
Generally the soil has a high silt and clay content at the surface and becomes coarser with
depth. At about 5 to 7 m the soils become sandy and gravelly and contain a small percentage of
fines. The coarse material below 6 m depth contain silt and clay layers.
Bedrock was encountered at a depth of 11 m below ground surface at the slime lagoon, about
600 m south west of the plant. The presence of bedrock at these depths indicates that the plant
is located over an area where the bedrock is depressed.
4.6.1.3.2 Abandoned Fuel Area
A large abandoned fuel storage area covering about 25,000 m2 is located in the central westem
portion of the plant. The abandoned fuel area contains a number of abandoned oil storage
tanks and is heavily impacted with spilt fuel oil. There are several pools of oil and the tanks
contain residual fuel oil. The depth and volume of these residuals are unknown. The major fuel
tanks and contaminated areas are shown on Drawing 90579-003 and are listed below:
- 4 steel above ground tanks: two with 400 m3 and two with 1,000 m3 capacities
- 4 concrete round tanks, partially buried, each with 350 m3 capacity,
- Concrete rectangular tank with total estimated capacity of 3,000 m3,
- remnants of an old fuel storage area
remnants of two railroad sidings, and
- 2 above ground tanks with a 45 m3 capacity south of the main storage area.

The above steel and concrete tanks are in various stages of demolition. Two of the steel tanks
are partially collapsed and the round tanks were decommissioned by punching holes into the
sides.
Fuelling areas are visibly contaminated by oil leakage which occurred during the handling of
fuel.
The extend of the fuel contamination was determined by visual inspection and using a
hydrocarbon vapour analyser. The purpose of the analyser was to determine the extent of
underground fuel contamination.
In summary, this area contains abandoned fuel tanks that have not been completely drained.
Many have been ruptured resulting in ponded fuel beside the tanks. Results from the soil gas
probing and soil and groundwater testing show the following:
all surface samples having visible fuel contamination had petroleum hydrocarbon contents
above criteria
hydrocarbon vapour probing show the area of fuel contamination to be extensive.
two tests pits dug to a depth of 3 m beside the heavily contaminated areas due to fuel
transfer activities show the contamination to be limited to less than 1 m depth based on the
analytical results from samples collected at depths of 1, 2 and 3 m
> in areas within the tank containments where ponded fuel is present, the depth of
contamination is anticipated to be deeper.
drill holes show the contamination to be limited to the near surface soils
4.6.1.3.3 Abandoned Smelter Complex
An abandoned smelter complex is located in the south central part of the plant; just north of the
administration building. This complex consists of several buildings with a total size of about 60
by 300 m. The complex is in great disrepair and contains partially filled fumaces, scrap metals,
concentrate and other materials.
The area was evaluated by the following testing:
- hydrocarbon vapour probing
- composite surface soils and waste piles samples at locations L-3,4,5,24-26 and W-37-48.
- a test pit in the south-eastern part of the complex, and
- drill hole is located on the south side of the building, down gradient of the building to
evaluate contamination at depth and groundwater quality as shown on Drawing 90579-103.
In summary, two contamination areas were identified outside and close to the south wall of the
old smelter building.

1. A solid waste pile located at of the building consists of soil mixed with neutralisation sludge.
A composite sample of surface soils from this area had elevated As, Cu, Pb, Sb, and
sulphates. Test pit located in the same area showed high copper and sulphates up to 3 m
depth.
2. A heavy fuel impacted area, about 200 m2 in size, is located by south-westem corner of the
building opposite heavy fuel tanks and mains situated inside of building. The contamination
was evaluated by petroleum vapour probing and soil samples, showed hydrocarbon levels
above criteria.
Inside the building, where furnaces and casting systems are located, there are mixed wastes of
debris, linings and equipment deposits. They all have Cu and sulphate concentrations in the
order of 104 - 105 mg/kg and As, Pb and Sb (102 - 103 mg/kg). The floor sweepings have a
petroleum hydrocarbon concentration of about 5000 mg/kg.
The inside of the northern section of the smelter building are partially decommissioned blowers,
filters and pipelines for transferring the roasting gas to the old sulphuric acid plant. Various
waste piles were sampled and analysed. Among them were masonry and deposits of the main
structure, solid waste piles, linings and gas pipe deposits and insulation material, glass fibres
and cement asbestos). The linings and pipeline deposits showed high acidity of 1,4 pH and had
the highest contamination levels for As, Cd, Pb, Sb, Zn, and sulphates. Similar, yet lower
concentrations occurred in other samples. The soil around the dry filters showed high levels of
As, Cu, Pb, and sulphates.
Drill hole shows the highest concentration of Cu at 11.2 m.
4.6.1.3.4 Abandoned Sulphuric Acid Area
The abandoned sulphuric acid plant covers and area of about 5 ha. It consists of several
structures and the overall area contains three solid wastes piles. The structures within this area
mostly collapsed and are heavy contaminated with acid.
Three solid waste deposits within this area are:
Deposit I is located in the middle of old sulphuric acid production plant - the wastes mainly
contain old stack demolition materials of about 600 tonnes of fly dust, 10 tonnes of scrap and
700 tonnes of debris and contaminated linings.
Deposit II is also located in the middle of old sulphuric acid production plant - consisting of about
200 tonnes of scrap and 50 tonnes of debris.

Deposit IlIl is also located in middle of old sulphuric acid production plant consisting of about
700 tonnes of used Rasching rings.
In summary, chemical analyses of representative samples shows the abandoned smelter
complex to be heavily contaminated. Typical contamination observed at this complex is as
follows:
- Soil along the railroad siding dividing the old acid plant and old smelter (L-27 through 30) is
heavily contaminated by metals; with maximum values being: As (9 000), Cu (20 000), Pb
(30 000), Sb (1 200), sulphates (100 000) mg/kg and hydrocarbons up to 3 000 mg/kg. The
soil pH ranges from 4.7 to 2.8.
- Lower levels of contamination in the soil and debris were found at the northern boundary of
the smelter. The prevailing pollutants are petroleum hydrocarbons (up to 4 500 mg/kg) and
suiphates (up to 100 000 mg/kg). The metals concentrations are below the criteria values.
Between buildings metal concentrations are elevated, with high hydrocarbons and
sulphates. Soil pH in samples range between 3.2 and 3.8.
- A composite soil sample (L-20) from north of cooling towers is neutral with elevated As, Cu,
Pb and sulphates concentrations.
- Soil samples taken along the southern edge of sulphuric acid tanks contain elevated
sulphates up to 10 000mg/kg.
- Debris, equipment residue and deposits of this area contain copper sulphates and vanadium
up to about 3 000 mg/kg, probably from the contact reactor fillings.
> Other waste types found in this area are linings of decommissioned equipment, demolished
stack, roasting gas tubes and absorption towers filling (Rasching rings. High As, Cd, Cu, Pb,
Sb and Se was found in the gas tubes. Rasching rings contain high Cu, Pb, As, and Sb at
levels of hundreds of mglkg. The pH of all samples ranged between 1,7 and 1,1.
- The most potentially hazardous waste is converter dust in a pile. The toxic elements Cd,
Cu, Pb, Se, Sb, and Zn range from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of mg/kg.
- Samples from Drill Hole 12 show elevated concentrations of Cu, Pb and As in samples at 2
m and 5 m depths.
4.6.1.3.5 Small Lagoon Area
The small lagoon area is located in the south-west comer of the plant and consists of three
lagoons, about 40 m by 90 m each, buried residue waste to the east of the lagoons, and a

bermed residue storage area (Drawing 90579-101). The small lagoons are in various stages of
excavation.  Two lagoons are nearly completely excavated and the third lagoon is about half
excavated. The residue was generated from the neutralisation of acidic effluents by adding
lime. The following samples of the lagoons and residue storage areas were collected.
Small Lagoons - south-eastern area of MDK.
3 basins where the slimes were formally deposited, having been removed and deposited in
piles.
Deposit Of Slimes From Small Lagoons - East of small lagoons are about 18 000 tonnes of
slime that are covered with about a 1 m soil cover, representing 6 000 tonnes.
Open Air Deposit Of Concentrate / Lagoon Waste - An area on the west side of MDK that
received excavated residue waste from the small lagoons (35 000 tonnes). Extensive seepage
from this waste is observed at the base of the concrete walls containing the residue. This is
about 11 200 sqm in area, the area is divided in half by a roadway with 65 000 tons of
concentrate in the east part.
In summary, the area is contaminated due to the slimes in the covered landfill together with
spillage during transportation from the small lagoons during excavation. The contamination
extends over the site of the waste water treatment plant.
All samples collected show high soil pH, metals (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Sb, Pb & Zn) and sulphates
contents.
Test pits indicate that the arsenic penetrated the subsoil to at least 3 m depth.
High levels of As, Cd, Ni, Pb, Sb, Zn, Cu and sulphates were found in slime residues and mixed
wastes.  Surrounding soil along the east concrete panel fence, about 15-20m  wide, is
contaminated by seepage and overspills through the fence.
The results from drill holes shown contamination in drill hole PL-2 in 9 m and 13 m (high levels
of As).
4.6.1.3.6 Electrolysis Plant
The electrolysis plant, located in the western section of the facility, is the only plant assessed in
this report that was actively used by MDK. The plant consists of a two story building, about 50
m by 180 m in size. The electrolysis tubs (766 pcs) are located on reinforced concrete structures
which form an elevated deck. The floors are made of acid-resistant floor tiles inclined towards a
central drain pit. The tiles do not cover the area containing plant rail trackage used to transport
copper anodes from the smelter plant.

HATCH                                                                         Page 92
The electrolysis operation produces large seepage of electrolytes and salts. These seepage's
have weakened the concrete structure and have heavily corroded exposed steel. The floors are
to a large extent covered with copper substrate deposits. The electrolyte fluids have penetrated
the underlying soils with the greatest penetration occurring in the transportation area.
Used tubs, about 400 units, are stored west of the electrolysis building. It is estimated that the
tubs represent about 720 tonnes of solid waste material.
The contamination produced by the electrolysis plant has been investigated by means of surface
soils samples and hydrogeological drill holes.
In summary, surface (foundation floor) soil sampled in the south and north side areas of the
building indicate a massive surface contamination of petroleum, As, Cu , Pb and Sb. As the
floor is mostly acid - proof tiled, deeper contamination depends on the floor integrity.
Soil sample taken at the effluent outlet of the electrolyses plant, where spent electrolyte was
being discharged, showed some sulphate and elevated As.
Solid samples from the tubs show the tubs to be high contaminated with As, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and
sulphates. Rainfall has rinsed these tubs and contaminated the underlying soils with metals (As,
Cu, Pb, Sb, Cd, Mn, Ni, V and Zn.)
4.6.1.3.7 Abandoned Hydrochloric Acid Tanks
Four tanks with a capacity of 25 mr each, containing hydrochloric acid, are located north of the
precious metal electrolysis plant. These tanks used to provide hydrochloric acid for the
production of precious metais. However, leakage from the tanks indicates that some contents
remain.
The tanks are constructed from steel plate and are lined inside with PVC material. The tanks
are elevated above the ground resting on concrete columns. The ground surface below the
tanks is lined with acid-resistant masonry.
The steel tanks are heavily corroded, in some places as deep as up to the inner. In one
instance, small acid drips were observed.  The entire ground surface exhibits strong
contamination with hydrochloric acid spills and aggregates of salt.
In summary, the masonry base below the tanks has neutral pH and is not significantly impacted.
Samples of solid waste from below the tanks and a surface soil sample show contamination by
acid leakage and seepage into the ground. Both samples are acidic with a pH range of 2, 1-2, 6

and high chloride content between 7,000 and 39,000 mg/kg. The metals do not exceed the
criteria.
Samples taken from a ramp located on the northern side of the store building show high As, Cu,
Ni, Pb, V and sulphates. The vanadium contamination is likely caused by a V205 contact
catalyzer pile stored nearby.
4.6.1.3.8 Abandoned Copper Sulphate Production Plant
This plant is located directly east of the precious metal electrolysis plant and north of the main
electrolysis plant (1.2.19). This plant is not being used.
The inside of the building is contaminated with copper sulphate deposits on both the plant
machinery and building components. The building contains abandoned machinery, storage
tanks, fumaces, electric motors etc..
In summary, solid wastes and leachate from equipment located in the southem and northem
parts of the building have high Cu, Pb, Cd, and sulphates concentrations, as well as elevated As
and Sb concentrations.
The masonry and mortar plaster on the Northeast side of the building close to the heavy fuel
piping is contaminated with oil and copper sulphate. Flooring is contaminated by deposits
contain copper sulphate and other metals (As, Cu, Pb and Sb). The leachate is highly acid.
4.6.1.3.9 Other Waste Piles
Aside from the contamination found in the previously discussed areas of the plant, the following
contaminated solid waste piles were identified.
Used Vanadium Pentoxide-Contact Catalyzer 11.4
This material is stored inside two buildings (1.1.2, 1.2.20) and several locations inside and
outside of the MDK plant. The catalyzer is stored in 200 litre steel barrels, and in polyethylene or
jute bags. The total quantity of the used catalyzer is 630 tonnes. A composite sample of the
catalyzer was taken and analysed (W-49).
Miscellaneous Solid Waste Piles
1. South-eastem area of MDK - along the rail siding (about 2,500 sqm) there is about 6000
tonnes of contaminated soil and 200 tonnes of scrap.
2. South-eastern area of MDK - 1000 tonnes of soil and debris, 500 tonnes of scrap.
3. South-eastern area of MDK - on the area of about 2000 sqm there is about 1500 tonnes
scrap (steel chips, exchangers, dismantled material), a further 10 tonnes of accumulators

4. South-eastern area of MDK, to the east of building 1.2.20. - 2500 tonnes of scrap and 9000
tonnes of contaminated soil and debris.
5. west of above pile, seven reinforced concrete electrolysis tanks and 100 tonnes of
contaminated soil and debris.
6. Open storage area - eastern area of MDK, on an area of 10800 sqm containing about 350
tonnes of concentrate and metal production waste, occasionally recycled, surrounded by
panel fence, yet wash-outs apparent, namely at the south side.
7. To the east of building 1.2.18. 100 tonnes of furnace lining and slag.
8. To the north of building 1.2.4. Reinforced concrete debris, masonry debris and contaminated
soil, approximately 300 t.
9. Samples from several transformers were collected for PCB testing.
In summary, the study identified the following impacted areas:
Neutralisation sludge, deposited mainly in Southwest part of MDK. Main contaminants are
arsenic, heavy metals and sulphates.
Converter dust in the only covered disposal area at the plant. Toxicologically the most
hazardous waste with high contents of toxic metals including (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Se, Sb, Zn) and
high sulphate and acidity. Human exposure (inhalation, skin contact) is made possibly by the
fine dust particle characteristics of the waste, and represents an extreme potential hazard.
Linings and deposits for the roasting gas pipelines and stack. The toxicity and potential hazards
rank it second to the CFD. High levels of toxic metals (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Se, Sb) and sulphates
together with high acidity (- 1,5 pHi in leachate) are the main characteristics of this material. Its
potential risk is enhanced by the fine-grained nature of waste (dust potential).
Electrolysis tubs in various stage of demolition, located mainly in area and to lesser extent in the
east part of MDK site. High levels of Cu, sulphates, As, Pb are present.
Process additives and media. Relatively heterogeneous material consisting of; deteriorated lime
(still useable for neutralisation when needed), Rasching rings (As, Cu, Pb, sulphates), used
contact catalyzer (V, C, sulphates, acid reaction), heavy oil earth in bermed containment areas
and underground storage tanks, pipes and within decommissioned transformers and hydraulic
gears.
Transformers - No PCB contamination was found in the samples tested.
Plant debris and soils contaminated by metals and/or oil, spread all over the entire plant area.
The oil contamination traces mainly the former fuel oil systems.

Insulation materials - glass fibres, cement-asbestos. Located mainly at the north side of the old
metallurgy and sulphuric acid production building. Preliminary separation prior to disposal is
necessary. The material has been imrDacted by Cu, As and sulphate. The metal toxicological
effects are accompanied by the carcinogenic effects of asbestos in its dust particles.
Steel scrap and process equipment. This material can be managed using standard recycling
techniques, although the cleaning of the material and linings may still pose a health and safety
concern.
4.6.1.4 Buildings and Areas
4.6.1.4.1 Buildings and Areas Currently Used
Electrolysis Plant was described in section 4.5.
- Storage Area - south-western area of MDK. A railway siding runs on the north side of the
storage complex. These buildings are used to store cathodic copper, waste contact material
(V205 catalyst) steel barrels and. perlite.
The northern platform running along all three buildings is heavily contaminated at the
western end with thick deposits of waste.
-- Converter Dust Storage - to the east of the old sulphuric acid area. The building stores 3
000 tonnes of converter dust from the production of copper. The masonry of the building is
heavily damaged.  This waste ranks as highly impacted and should be disposed of
accordingly.

- Old Filling Area - Northeast part of the old H2SO4 acid plant. 2 tanks with a capacity of
approx. 50 m3 are located in the filling area. The tanks contain about 15 m3 of H2SO4. The
filling area is visibly contaminated with H2SO4 resulting from spillages which occurred during
the handling and filling of the H2SO4 tanks.
- The estimated volumes pertinent to the area are about 50 tonnes of scrap and 100 tonnes of
rubble.
> Unused Gas Conduit is located to the west and south of the old sulphuric acid production
plant and to the north of the abandoned smelter area. The gas conduit in question, about
910 m long, is out of operation. It represents 400 tonnes of scrap, 1 600 tonnes of brickwork
and 900 tonnes of dust (10% of the pipe line volume).
Hydrochloric Acid Tanks were described earlier.
4.6.1.4.3 Building Demolition
Various structures are to be demolished as part of the site development. The majority of the
structures to be demolished are reinforced concrete skeletons with brickwork curtain walls.
There are also assembled skeletons, classical brickwork buildings with wooden roof trusses and
steel structures of varying composition. The structures to be demolished are in poor and in
some cases even hazardous condition.
To demolish low story brickwork .and skeleton structures with brickwork curtains, mechanised
demolition methods can be used. The same methods can also be used for high story skeletons,
although blasting technology could be tested for this purpose.  Steel structures must be
demolished using stepwise dismantling and cutting.
Prior to starting demolition activities, all waste and processing equipment in the area must be
removed and power supply disconnected.
4.6.1.4.4 Debris Composition
The resulting debris for all structures except steel structures is expected to have the following
composition:
- 75% building structure debris
- 27% waste

The building structure debris 75% is expected to contain approximately:
- 44% brickwork masonry residuals
- 22% concrete and reinforced concrete residuals
- 7% other materials (hard and light roof coverings, ceramics, chinalporcelains, glass, non-
ferrous metals, wood, asbestos-cement, plastics)
4.6.2 Groundwater
The soil overburden in the plant changes with depth from being clayey soils near the surface
and becoming coarser with depth. The clayey silt to silty clay surface soils provide a partial cap
for the groundwater regime with horizontal groundwater flows confined to the deeper sand and
gravels.
The groundwater surface was observed to be generally about 7 to 8 m below the surface with
the flow being to the south to Southwest towards Topolnitsa River. The hydraulic gradient is
between 0.02 and 0.04. Based on pumping test results of six deep wells, the hydraulic
conductivity of the overburden materials was calculated to range from 5x10 ' up to 6x10-5 m/s.
The groundwater quality at the MDK plant was investigated by the installation of 22 piezometers
at the plant and 10 piezometers in outlying areas of interest, namely, 4 piezometers in the slime
pond, 4 piezometers in the tailings and 2 piezometers in the slag dump for a total of 32
piezometers. Three of the piezometers were installed above the plant, tailings and slag area to
determine the background water quality from above of the plant. One piezometer east of the
slime lagoon and two piezometers south of the lagoon provide some indications of the water
quality below of the plant.
The groundwater quaiity was evaluated against Belgian groundwater criteria applicable to
industrial sites as explained in Section 4.6.3.
4.6.2.1 Plant Area
The impacted groundwater is wide spread across the site with the groundwater at most locations
exceeding the groundwater criteria used for the assessment (Drawing 90579-005). The drawing
outlines the contaminated water areas by isopachs indicating the factor by which the water
quality exceeds the Belgian Water Quality (BWQ) criteria as follows:
- water exceeds BWQ
- water exceeds BWQ by a factor of 10
- water exceeds BWQ by a factor of 100
Seventeen of the 22 piezometers installed within the plant area containing the main production
buildings exceeded the Belgian groundwater quality criteria.  Seventeen of the groundwater
samples exceeded at least one criteria value by more than a factor of 10, while six samples

exceeded at least one criteria by more than a factor of 100. Finally, four of these samples
exceeded the copper criteria by a factor of more than 1 000.
The most heavily impacted groundwater, those which exceed a criteria by more than a factor of
100, are located in the Southwest corner of the site near the abandoned smelter area,
electrolysis workshop, small lagoons and hydrochloric acid storage tanks.
Results of analytical testing from well nests south of the electrolysis plant show that the
groundwater in the deeper, more permeable materials have higher contaminant concentrations
than the shallow groundwater in less permeable soils. This is likely due to dispersion and
transport effects in the higher permeability materials which allows contaminants to spread over
larger areas.
Groundwater samples collected on the upgradient (northern) and eastern portions of the site
have low levels of metals with no or only marginal (<10 times guideline value) exceedances of
criteria values..
Groundwater samples from monitoring wells located along the down gradient edge of the site
have low metal concentrations but do indicate marginal exceedances of criteria values for
copper and cadmium.
While the level of groundwater impact on the site is high, the mass transport of contaminants off-
site is relatively small. It is estimated that the horizontal flow velocity through the soils with
permeability is about 25 m/year.
This rate of migration is considered to be appropriate but conservative given that the copper
contamination identified in the area of the small lagoons and the old smelter area have not yet
been detected at BH-8, approximately 400 metres down gradient. The fact of very slow
migration of the contaminants, possible dilution of the contamination with distance and
absorption of the contamination by the fine grained soils, it is hard to estimate, if or when the
contamination may reach Topolnitsa River.  However, even if the contamination reaches
Topolnitsa River, the slow flow/release of the contaminant into the river, may be difficult to
detect.
However, considering the high groundwater contamination at the plant site, further studies of the
contamination flow and potential effect on Topolnitsa River will have to be evaluated in greater
detail.
The piezometers installed downslope of the slime pond (4), fayalite tailings (4) and slag dump
(2) show that the groundwater is not contaminated according to the Belgian Groundwater
Criteria. Only one element in the 10 water samples had one component, cadmium, elevated
above these criteria.

4.6.3 Adjacent Areas
The main sources of industrial pollution in the Pirdop - Zlatitsa valley are mines, ore dressing
plants and metallurgical activities.  They produce liquid and aerosol wastes containing
substances which have the potential to damage the soil. In respect of this, many investigations
have Deen made on the pollution of the agricultural lands, crops and livestock in the Pirdop-
Zlatitsa valley.  A major study was commissioned in January 1997 by the Ministry of
Environment and funded by the PHARE programme, to assess the impact of emissions from
MDK on soils in the Pirdop Zlatitsa region. An interstitial report of the project which is being
undertaken by the Balkan Science and Education Centre of Ecology and Environment was
issued recently. This is a comprehensive study and is a valuable reference for information
relevant to this section.
The following provides a brief summary of information gathered in this and previous studies, and
in particular the Report on the Environmental Impact Assessment of MDK in Operation by
Pechlivanov Engineering. These studies are also used as the reference source for Section 4.7
Flaura and Fauna.
4.6.3.1 Charactenstics of Soil in the Region
Fluvisols
These are represented by deliuvial and alluvial soils. The delluvial soils occupy the northem
and central parts of the valley and are characterised by a thin layer of humus-accumulation,
under which are delluvial materials. The soil resistance to atmospheric contamination depends
to a high degree on their mechanical composition. Soils with a heavier mechanical composition
are more resistant and have higher absorption properties. Among the other factors which
influence the behaviour of heavy metals in the soil, their mobility and passage into other media,
are the pH and humus contents of the soils. The reactivity of these soils varies from very acid to
slightly -acid and even to neutral. Humus contents are low (1-2 percent) which is a detrimental
factor from the point of view of atmospheric contamination influence. Organic matter contents in
the soil are considerably more efficient than mineral components as an absorber.
The hydro-physical properties of the delluvial soils are characterised by low moisture-retaining
properties and low reserves of useful moisture.
Alluvial soils can be found on the flood plains of the Topinitza, Bunovska, Mirkovska, Pirdopska
and other rivers. Alluvial layers, consisting of gravel, sands, sandy clays, etc., form the humus
accumulating layer of not more then 30 to 40 cm. Humus content in these soils reaches 4 to 5
percent. The pH of the soils is acid to neutral, turning alkaline at depth with pH 8.3.
Luvisols
Luvisols (cinnamon forest soils) have been found over an area of approximately 10 000 decares
on the higher regions of the valley. Their humus layer is thin as a result of the existing erosion

processes and the humus contents are iow (1 to 2 percent). Soil pH varies in depth from acid or
neutral on the surface layers to slightly alkaline at depth where there are carbonates present.
Dystric-Eutric Cambisols
Brown forest soils can be found at altitudes over 800 metres on the mountain slopes. The low
absorption capacity of these soils, their light mechanical composition and their acid reactivity
lead to their low resistance to atmospheric contamination. They are characterised by an
exceptionally thin profile, with a humus depth of 4-5 cm. Humus contents and total nitrogen
contents are comparatively high.
4.6.3.2 Rising Soil Acidity
This occurs as a result of the industrial emissions to the atmosphere; in particular sulphur
oxides, carbon dioxide, chlorine compounds.  The acidity has risen exceptionally in the
contaminated soils, reaching levels at which exchangeable acidity appears, causing plant
toxicity. The control delluvial soils do not show the existence of such acidity levels. The process
of rising acidity is accompanied by the destruction of the clayey structures of montmorilonite and
illite types, while acid degradation of the soils at an alkaline saturation of approximately 10
percent being directed towards the formation of clayey structure of the oxide-hydroxide types.
These last types have an exceptionally low absorption capacity and reduces the buffer
properties of the soil.
The acid emissions do not only effect directly the acidity of the soil, but cause other effects as
well by changing the soil reactivity. First of all, this is the high mobility of the heavy metals in the
soil and the rising quantity of the exchangeable and absorbable forms. Up to 57 percent of the
total copper contents of the soil are in an exchangeable absorbed state, while in non-
contaminated soils these forms of copper contents do not exceed 1-2 percent. The acidity of the
soil causes the release of copper ions as well as other heavy metals. Due to the high mobility of
most elements in acid soils, this causes the soil to lose important macro-elements required for
the normal growth of vegetation. Due to the high mobility of the metals in an acid environment,
the risk of these metals passing into and contaminating other environments (vegetation, ground
waters, lower soil horizons, water reservoirs, etc.) rises sharply.
4.6.3.3 Heavy Metal Contents of the Soils
Copper is the main heavy metal contaminant of both agricultural soils and forest soils. In
Bulgaria the highest accumulation of copper in soils has been found in the Zlatitiza valley with a
value of 2 724 mg/kg. Contamination by other elements,including zinc, lead, arsenic, has also
been established.
In soils where acidity has increased, there is an increase in water soluble metal forms which are
the forms which affect plants the most. The water soluble forms of copper exceed 50 percent,
those of lead exceed 18 percent, those of zinc exceed 12 percent. According to data from the
Ministry of Agriculture, the following maximum values of heavy metal contents have been found:

- copper - 2574 mg/kg (101-fold above the maximum admissible value)
- lead - 628 mg/kg (23-fold above the maximum admissible value)
The total area of soil which is considered to be contaminated by heavy metals and the degree of
contamination is as follows:
- Dangerously contaminated, 54 626 decares, 5-fold in excess of maximum admissible
value(MAV)
- Very strongly contaminated, 45 924 decares, 3 to 5 times MAV
- Strongly contaminated areas, 11 915 decares, 2 to 3 times MAV
- Medium contaminated areas, 4 775 decares, 1 to 2 times MAV
Slightly contaminated areas, 478 decares, higher than normal but below the maximum
admissible value
The above data does not include soils of the forest areas, since precise calculations of their
contaminated areas have not been made. In forest soils the worst contaminant is also copper.
In the 1 to 5 cm soil layer the copper contents are 3 to 4 times higher than those of the
underlying soil. This high degree of accumulation in very acid soil provides conditions for high
mobility of the copper and its transfer to lower strata of the profiles. Lead and zinc are also
contaminants of the soils. The emissions of these heavy metals over decades have led to their
accumulation in the dead forest carpet where values of up to 7 600 mg/kg of copper, 716 mg/kg
of lead and 169 mg/kg of zinc have been found.
The average concentrations of heavy metals in the soils at seven locations in the region are
given in Table 4.6-1. The ratios of these values to the maximum admissible values are shown in
Table 4.6 -2.

On the base of these investigations and surveys it can be established that:
- the total Cu, As, Pb, Zn and Cd content in the surface soil layers from the surveyed part of
the region exceeds not only the mean background values for the country but also the
permissible levels for these elements
= the content of some of the elements in the crops exceeds the permissible levels
the spatial variation of the pH and total forms of Cu, As, Pb, Zn and Cd content in the surface
soil horizons depends not only from MDK atmospheric emissions but from many other
sources
> the water soluble sulphates content in the soils in this region is close to the background
values
From the same investigations and surveys it was assumed that:
- the main route for the crop contamination is atmospheric pollution
- the soil acidification, increase in Cu and As concentration in the soil surface layers and
increase in Pb, Cu, As and Cd concentration in the crops can be connected to MDK
- the increase in Cd, Pb and Zn concentration in the soil surface horizons can be connected
with the proximity of Bimak-AD
- there are some similarities between Pb and Zn, Cu and As soil contamination, and between
Cu and As crop contamination.

4.7 Flora and Fauna
4,7.1 Flora
The forest in the area of MDK is European deciduous forest consisting of oak, hornbeam and
beech according to the height of the land. In the immediate vicinity of MOK, vegetation is mainly
beech and oak plantation and man made conifer plantations. These forests have been strongly
affected for decades by air pollution and other types of anthropogenic activities. A part of the
affected plantation on the Southern ridges of the Balkan Range have been repiaced with more
resistant deciduous species such as acacia, silver linden, red oak. A number of studies have
been undertaken to establish the affected areas and the effects of sulphur dioxide, sulphuric-
acid aerosols and heavy metals aerosols. These studies took into consideration the average
annual concentrations of SO2 adopted by the Economic Commission for Europe, for the tree
species of differing sensitivity: 50 g/m3 - highly sensitive; 80 g/m3 - sensitive; 120 g/m3 - low
sensitivity.
The results of the previous investigations have shown that the impact of gas emissions on the
plants begins with the penetration of polluting substances into the leaves and the supervening
impact on cell processes, after which changes take place in the assimilation organs, due to the
intensive gas-exchange, absorb polluting substances. The observation of various tree species
in the Pirdop area using 19 indices for structural and functional digression shows that the
possibilities for adaptation of the studied tree species have been reduced. Test plants situated
at a considerable distance from the industrial works are affected as well as plants in the vicinity
indicating that that the impact of industrial emissions extends over more distant areas as well as
in the immediate vicinity.
The chemical analyses of leaf samples and common pitch pine needles from investigated test
areas at various distances from MDK (5, 7.5 and 20 km in the direction of Klissura) have shown
that the acidification of the soil and the deposition of heavy metals in it as well as their direct
deposition on the leaves lead to the accumulation of considerable quantities in the foliage. The
greatest accumulation is of copper in the pine needles which is three to eight-fold above the
average values for the area (5 - 8 mg/kg) at 5 and at 7.5 km from from MDK. Concentrations of
copper above the average but considerably lower are established at a distance of 20 km.
(Irrespective of the fact that copper is one of the biogenetic elements, the plants need it in small
quantities: 5 - 20 ppm.) In the investigated tree species at a distance of 7.5 km copper exceeds
20 ppm, reaching 40 - 60 mg/kg. Beside a high copper content, higher values of zinc and
manganese are also noted, the latter being above 2000 mg/kg, exceeding by two to three-fold
the average for the area. The concentration of zinc is up to 80 mg/kg and does not exceed the
toxic levels.
The data provides the basis for discussing the dependence of histological and adaptation
capabilities on the degree of soil pollution. Up to a certain degree of pollution, at 5 to 10 km
from the works, adaptation is related to zeromorphous changes of the epidermis, which correlate

to the considerable growth in the number of leaves. At high degrees of pollution between 2 to 4
km from the works the expansion of the cells in the covering tissue may be indicative of
destructive changes.
Of the indeces examined, current linear growth, number of leaves and their size, investigations
have shown that the most sensitive is the leaf size. In the vicinity of 0.5 to 1 km of MDK is
reduced to 65 percent of the control for the black poplar, to 70 percent for the hawthorn, 76
percent for the acacia, 82 percent for the birch and 90 percent for the spiraea. The same
tendency is established for the tree species in the Kaliman area - at 10 km, but the values are
close to the control. The depressive impact of sulphur dioxide on the growth and the sizes of
the leaves has been frequently noted.
The contents of individual elements in the plant organs depends to a great extent on the
species. The plants of some species have a higher susceptibility to absorbing individual
elements without receiving apparent damages. The quantities of heavy metals in plants are
determined both by their contents in the external environment, and by their selective ability. A
strict correlation between the contents of heavy metals in the plants and in the soil is not always
observed.
The contents of mineral elements in the investigated plants can be graded in an ascending order
in the following succession: Pb - Zn - Mg - K - Fe - Ca. In cases of heavier industrial pollution, a
greater accumulation of Fe and Cu is established from two to five-fold more than in the control.
Differences have been established in the degree of accumulation and is also determined by the
specifics of the plant species.
4.7.2 Fauna
The fauna species in the Pirdop-Zlatitza valley are defined by the predominance of the Mid-
European species. Studies for evaluation of the impact of contamination from MDK on the fauna
started in the 1970s.
Amphibeans and reptiles
Within an area of 7 km2 around MDK, especially to the east and north east, all the amphibian
and reptile species have been exterminated, possibly due to lack of nourishment in the
grassless and eroded terrain. Another important factor causing the extermintion of the
amphibian species in the area around MDK is the change in the characteristics of the local water
reservoirs. These are gradually filling with alluvial materials, becoming more and more shallow
until disappearing.
The established habitats of Rana dalmatina and Hyla arborea are not sufficient to determine the
areas in which these species have not been exterminated, but the data available indicates that
their habitats are within the same areas, as that of the Rana ribidunda. During the reproduction
period, they visit the large water reservoirs in the vicinity of the area contaminated by MDK. The

large numbers of Rana ribidunda, Rana daimatina and similar species near the contaminated
areas to the south and south west of the Combine are due to the formation of swamps. Frogs
are rarely found in the contaminated waters
The populations of Bofo viridis and the rarer brown frog and Triturus cristatus are especially
affected by the contamination of the area. In addition to the lack of nourishment, there has been
a sharp drop in the moisture content of the lowest air layer in the grassless and eroded lands.
The reduction in the population of amphibian and reptile species in the area of the Combine is
the main reason for the disappearance of the yellow water snake.
Insects are represented by a very poor variety of species and no insect eating mammals were
found within 500 m of MDK. As the distance increased some moles were found. Rodents were
found at 3 km from MDK.
Birds
No connection between the direction of nest sites and the location of MDK could be established.
The proximity of MDK does not influence the species composition of the birds. The bird
population of the settlements in the MDK area has also been established to contain a variety of
species. The bird population of the agricultural cultivated lands to the east of Pirdop and to the
west of Zlatitza, as well as to the south of MDK, is typical for this landscape. In the immediate
vicinity of MDK certain species have been observed. The couples nesting nearest to MDK are
in the southern direction (within the affected zone) , where the surviving vegetation reaches the
Combine itself. The affected zone to the north and north east of the Combine is not inhabited.
Fish
Studies have been conducted to 'establish the accumulation of certain heavy metals and toxic
elements in fish. The values for the following heavy metals and metabolically active elements
were established: cadmium, lead, copper, cobalt, nickel, manganese, zinc, magnesium, iron and
strontium.
The lowest concentrations of the studied elements were established in the fish in the Dushatzi
dam reservoir and in the river Topolnitza upstream and downstream of the said reservoir. This
area can be classified as naturally clean and can be used as a basis for comparison with other
areas. The fish in the Topolnitza river upstream of the Jekov Vir dam reservoir and in the same
reservoir do not contain different quantities of accumulated toxic elements. After the inflow of the
Zlatishka and Medetska rivers, which are completely void of life, the situation in the Topolnitza
river becomes much worse. The river is completely void of fish up to the villages of Petritch,
Kayryaka and even up to the village of Poibrene. The fish in the Topolnitza river in the upstream
part of the Topolnitza dam reservoir have been found to contain 2 to 5 times higher
concentrations of toxic elements. The degree of accumulation varies very widely, but the toxic
metal concentrations in the fish species of the higher trophic levels are higher.

Heavy Metal Contents and State of the Populations of the Biologic Indicator Amphibian and
Mammal Species of the MDK Area
Studies on the effect of the industrial contamination by MDK on the fauna in the area of the town
of Pirdop have been conducted mainly be the Institute of Zoology at the Bulgarian Academy of
Science. These studies have been conducted in three stages as described below.
The first stage covers 1973 to 1975. The main results were as follows:
- The negative influence of MDK's emissions was determined in correlation with the prevailing
wind directions on the composition and habitat of amphibian and reptile species in the area.
This influence was established to be specially strong on the population of Bufo viridis and
Triturus cristatus.
- No influence was established on the bird population.
- Studies of mammals have also been conducted, and prior to 1973 the existence of toxicosis
in sheep fed with grass from the Pirdop area was proved. In 1973, changes in certain
biochemical systems and hematological characteristics in white rats which were exposed for
one and three months in the MDK area were established. Higher pathologic changes were
established at the end of the first month in the number of erythrocytes, in haemoglobin and
from cases of reticulocytosis and sozinfilia. After the third month the rats adapted to
conditions.
Studies in 1977 on the population and habitat of rodents and insect eating mammals established
a direct influence of the source of contamination from 300 to 700 m.
The second stage of the investigation was completed in the'1980s. Of the vertebrae species
studied, the average results of heavy metal contents are quoted in the Table 4.7-1 below and
are compared with the measurements obtained in a clean area (Regional Station Steneto in the

nourishment is insects from the dry land. The morphologic and physiologic, haematological and
genetic studies to date on material from the Pirdop region are not sufficient to reach conclusions
on the degree and characteristics of the influence of the MDK emissions on the populations of
the monitored species.
The third stage, which includes the 1994-1996 period, is ongoing.

5. ANALYSIS OF COMPLIANCE AND DEVIATIONS FROM LEGISLATIVE
REQUIREMENTS, RISK ASSESSMENT
5.1 Air
The characteristics of the emissions from the stacks at MDK are discussed in section 4.1.
Section 6.1.1 describes the limiting parameters for air emissions stipulated by Bulgarian
environmental legislation which the company should comply with in the course of the operation
of the smelter. The emission criteria required by other jurisdictions are also provided for
comparison.
In summary:
- emissions of sulphur dioxide from the acid plant stack (120 metre) exceed the maximum
acceptable emission (MAE) by a factor averaging about 400 percent
- emissions of sulphur trioxide are slightly in excess of the MAE by a factor of about 1.2
emissions from the 325 metre stack exceed the MAC for dust by a factor of between 8 and
12 in 1995 and 1996
-- emissions from the 325 metre stack exceed the MAC for sulphur dioxide by a factor
averaging 1.2, although in previous years when the limit was higher the emissions were well
below the standards
In general the emission criteria stipulated by the Bulgarian legislation are comparable to those in
other jurisdictions (e.g. EU-Osparcom BAT).
Although the emissions from the 325 metre stack exceed the limits, it is considered that they are
not sufficient to pose a serious risk- to the environment and the health of the local population in
view of the height of the release point into the atmosphere. Discharge of sulphur dioxide and
sulphur trioxide from the acid plant (120 m stack) have the potential to cause significant impact
on the local environment and population particularly during periods of abnormal operation or
climatic conditions which are unfavourable for efficient dispersal of the stack plume.
Of greater concem are the low level fugitive emissions from the smelter operations and from the
dry waste material storage areas.  These are difficult to quantify but ambient air quality
measurements in Pirdop and Zlatitsa show that concentrations of sulphur dioxide, sulphuric acid
aerosols and dust, frequently exceed the permissible limits by Bulgarian and comparable other
standards. Sulphur dioxide and acid aerosols are known to cause respiratory problems. Dust
from the smelter is likely to contain a range of heavy metals including copper, arsenic, cadmium
and lead, all of which have the potential for harm to human health.

5.2 Water
The MDK copper smelter discharges surface run-off water from various parts of the plant into
two small tributories, viz. the Zlatitsa River and the Pirdopska River. MDK surface water to the
Zlatitsa River comes from the Sanar Dere Channel while the Kiselo Dere Channel pours into the
Pirdopska River.
Process effluents are neutralized, clarified and released into the Pirdopska River after combining
with treated water from the Sanitary Treatment Plant. The Zlatitsa River joins with the Pirdopska
River and then pour into the Topoinitsa River a few kilometers south of the plant.
5.2.1 Discussion of Applicable Legislative Requirements
MDK's treated process effluent entering the Pirdopska River is required to meet Bulgarian
Ministry of Environment and Water's "Flowing Surface Water" quality criteria defined in
Regulation No. 7 of December 1986, Category No. III, as shown in Table 5.2.1. MDK will pay
penalties for any parameters which are out of compliance with Category No. III guidelines. The
penalties are based on the concentration of the parameters in excess of Category IlIl values, as
well as the flowrate of the effluent stream. An example of this calculation for excess arsenic is
given in Technical Support Document 2.
Surface run-off waters from the MDK smelter carried by the Sanar Dere channel and Kiselo
Dere Channel and pouring into the Zlatitsa and Pirdopska Rivers, respectively, must meet
Category No. II criteria, which is substantially more stringent than Category No. Ill. While
Ordinance 7 specifies that water sampling be conducted after the water flowrate has stabilized
(i.e. at the Topolnitza River), the MEW Regional Inspectorate actually conducts sampling on the
three water channels from the MDK plant (i.e. Main Process Effluent Channel, Sanar Dere
Channel and Kiselo Dere Channel). Although the Sanar Dere and Kiselo Dere are classified as
Category II surface waters and the Main Channel is classified as Category Ill, all penalties
imposed with respect to violation on pH, conductivity, sulphate, copper, arsenic, manganese,
etc. are calculated using the less stringent Category Ill criteria. In any case, It is recommended
that the sampling points for the purpose of computing penalties be moved downstream close to
the points where the Zlatishka River and the Pirdopska River meet and pour into the Topolnitza
River.
Guidelines of the Bulgarian MEWVs Regulation No. 7, Category No. Ill are compared in Table
5.2.1 with other countries' Maximum Allowable Concentrations of Pollutants in Effluents, such as
Canada, USA, Japan, Chile, Belgium (Flanders) and EU (current and Draft Osparcom).

Comparison of the maximum allowable pollutant concentrations imposed in various countries
shows the following:
- The pH criteria range of 6-9 is the same for almost all of the countries compared.
- The total suspended solids criteria varies between 50 mg/L and 150 mg/L
- Amongst dissolved solids, the sulphate ion limit is set to 400 mg/L by Bulgarian MEW. This
is lower than the limits set for example in Belgium (2000 mg/L) and in Chile (1000 mg/L).
- The concentration limit for arsenic varies between 0.1 and 0.5, with most countries using a
value of 0.5 mg/L, including canada, US, Japan and Chile. It should be noted that current
Standard Industry Practice used in copper smelters around the world (i.e. with
neutraliazation, clarification and filtration) achieves an arsenic concentration in the treated
effluent in the range 1-5 mg/L.
-  The criteria for copper under Category III is 0.5 mg/L. This is typically achievable by
Standard Industry Practice.
- Cadmium limits vary between 0.01 and 0.3 mg/L, with Bulgarian Category IlIl set at a very
low value of 0.01 mg/L compared to Osparcom (0,08 mg Cd/I as yearly average).
- Lead limits from copper smelters are set by Osparcom at 0.5 mg/L as total lead. This
compares with 0.2 mglL under Bulgarian MEW's Category IlIl and any where between 0.2-
1.0 mg/L in Canada, Belgium, USA, Chile and Japan.
Mercury is controlled by many countries at low concentrations in the range 0.001 - 0.02
mg/L. Category IlIl limit is consistent with Osparcom : 0.02 mg/L.
-- Selenium is not regulated by many countries, although it is known to have significant aquatic
toxicity effects. Bulgarian MEW regulates selenium under Category IlIl at 0.01 mg/L which is
extremely low, and is equal to Canadian Drinking Water Quality Objectives.
5.2.2 Discussion of Compliance and Deviation from Legislative Requirements
Analytical parameters of actual MDK treated process effluent discharged to the Pirdopska River
are also listed in Table 5.2.1 for ease of comparison to regulatory concentration limits.
Comparison of actual MDK's treated effluent composition data from the Blue Lagoon (obtained
from recent on-site sampling during the period July 23 - 26, 1997) with Bulgarian Surface Water
Category IlIl criteria can also be made by reference to Table 5.2.1. This Table shows that most
of the heavy metal concentrations in the treated effluent are below the Category IlIl limits. The
following parameters are out of compliance:
pH (11.8 vs. 6-9); electrical conductivity (3900 vs. 1600 pLS/cm); fluoride (8 vs. 3 mg/L); sulphate
(1600 vs. 400 mg/L) and selenium (0.86 vs. 0.01 mg/L).
In summary, the concentration limit criteria imposed for neutralized process-effluents, based on
immission standards (concentration in the receiving water), are not relevant! The evaluation of
the MDK effluents should be conducted in comparison with emission standards as done in the
EU and other countries.

6. MEASURES
6.1 Limiting Parameters
6.1.1 Air
The limiting parameters which are to be complied with the operating of the facility are set out in
Regulation No 2 on the Maximum Admissable Hazardous Contaminant Levels in Communities
Ambient Air and in the Standard Levels of Permissable Emissions( Cocentrations of Waste
Gases) of Harmful Substances emitted into the Atmosphere.
The following articles of the latter regulation on emission standards are applicable to MDK:
Articles No 13 and 14 apply to emissions of dust-like substances.
The Bulgarian emission standards to air are different for plants commisioned for and after 1992.
The table below compares the Bulgarian standards with the standards given in the European
BAT Osparcom documents for the primary non ferrous metal industry (mg/Nm3)

2. the total emissions for substances from several classes together should not exceed the
standard for the highest category
As indicated in the draft OSPARCOM Decission, existing plants must also meet the standards
within a period of time determined by the national Authorities. Taking Social, technical and
economic factors into account, a minimum transition period of 5 years after the approval of the
decission, is foreseen in this respect.
Article 20 applies to the sectorial standards for the emissions from production processes of
heating capacity from 500kW to 50 MW. At MDK the combustion gases from processes which
burn oil are discharged via the 325 metre stack. The relevant limits are:
- NOx 450 mg/Nm3
-  CO 170 mg/Nm3
- Dust: 50 or 80 mg/Nm3
-  S02: 1000 mglNm3
Article No 24 applies to the sectorial standards for the production of non-ferrous metals and
with respect to MDK emissions from the 325 metre stack:
- dust emissions are limited to 20 mg/Nm3
sulphur dioxide emissions are limited to 800 mg/Nm3
for an oxygen concentration of 12 % in the off gas
Article No 29 applies to the sectorial standards for the production of sulphuric acid and is
relevant to emissions from the 120 metre stack:
- the sulphur dioxide emission should not exceed 2.6 kg per tonne of 100% sulphuric acid
produced
-- sulphur trioxide emissions should not exceed 0.6 kg per tonne of sulphuric acid produced in
existing installations and 120 mg/Nm3 for new plants
For comparison the emission limits of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter set by other
authorities or jurisdictions, are given in Tables 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

6.1.2 Water
6.1.2. 1 Introduction
The MDK copper smelter discharges surface run-off from various parts of the plant into two
small tributories, viz. the Zlatitsa River and the Pirdopska River. MDK surface water to the
Zlatitsa River comes from the Sanar Dere Channel while the Kiselo Dere Channel pours into the
Pirdopska River.
Process effluents are neutralized, clarified and released into the Pirdopska River after
combining with treated water from the Sanitary Treatment Plant. The Zlatitsa River joins with
the Pirdopska River and then pour into the Topolnitsa River a few kilometers south of the plant.
6.1.2.2 Bulgarian Standards
The Bulgarian environmental legislation has not yet developed general or sectorial standards for
the water quality of the emitted effluents.
Regulation No. 7 of December 1986 only gives indices and norms for assessing the quality of
the 'receiving surface waters" (i.e. immision values). These Receiving Water Standards are
summarized in Table 6.1.2.1 below:

Apart from the above Bulgarian Standards for receiving waters, there is no regulation for
maximum allowable concentrations of pollutants in industrial non-ferrous effluent streams, such
as the regulations existing in Canada, USA and Belgium (Flanders).
In Table 6.1.2.2, the standards for the Best Available Techniques (BAT Osparcom) for primary
non-ferrous metal industries are listed and compared with the Belgian (Flanders) effluent
standards.

The above standards appear to be achievable after installation of the new wastewater treatment
plant.
6.1.2.3 Discussion of Applicable Reglatory Criteria
MDK's treated Process Effluents entering the Pirdopska River are required to meet Bulgarian
Ministry of Environment and Water's "Flowing Surface Water" quality criteria defined in
Regulation No. 7, issue 96 of December 1986, Category No. III, as illustrated in Table 6.1.2.1.
PR90579 Rev. 0. 9510                                                      PR.OT, R.. 3. 96M0S

Surface run-off from the MDK smelter carried by the Kiselo Dere and Sanar Dere channels and
pouring into the Pirdopska River and Zlatishka River, respectively, must meet Category No. II
criteria, which are substantially more stringent than Category No. Ill.
6.1.3 Waste
Most of the wastes resulting from the production activities of the company, contain hazardous
substances which have the potential to pollute the environment. At present the company has
not obtained a permit for treatment of hazardous wastes and the depository sites in current use
have not been authorised in accordance with Decree No 153/1993 on the Gathering,
Transportation and Neutralisation of Hazardous Wastes.
With respect to the forthcoming construction of new depository sites as part of the
Environmental Remediation Programme after privatisation, the company must comply with the
provisions of the Environmental Protection Act and Decree No 153/1993 concerning treatment
of hazardous waste.
The authorisation of existing waste depository sites as well as construction of new ones has
three major aspects:
=- determination of the situation of the sites under the procedure set forth in Decree No
153/1993
- approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment of the site by the Minister of the
I Environment
- obtaining a permit for treatment of hazardous wastes
6.2 Short & Long Term Compliance And Remediation Programmes
6.2.1 Programmes for Bringing the Process into Compliance with Legislative
Requirements
6.2.1.1 AirEmissions
UM's first priority for MDK is to stabilise production operations while gradually increasing
production levels. The key to stabilising operations relies on being able to feed the flash furnace
with a uniform blend of high grade concentrate at a consistent feed rate. To achieve this goal,
UM will:
- increase the concentrate storage capacity to 50,000 tonnes, and
- refurbish and upgrade concentrate handing and blending equipment.
By improving the feed, the operation of the smelter will be brought under control, and this will
allow UM to optimise the operations of the furnaces, converters, gas cleaning facilities and acid
plants, and other related equipment.

HATCH                                                                          Page 119
This will allow the operation of the waste heat boiler to be optimised (re-instate the gas recycle
loop) to limit the production of SO3 and prevent overcooling of the off-gas. Higher flow rates and
a reduction in the SO3 content of the off-gas stream will improve the cleaning efficiency of the
ESPs, which in turn has a positive impact on the acid plant efficiency.
Similarly the use of higher grade copper concentrate as feed to the smelter will produce a higher
grade of matte. The time required for blowing the matte in the converters will be reduced thus
allowing correct sequenceing of the converter, which will improve the sulphuric acid plants
efficiency.
Stabilising operations will have a significant, positive impact on reducing the air emissions
released from the smelter. By ensuring optimal operation of equipment, fugitive emissions
released will also be minimized.
In addition to stabilising operations, several specific investment programmes have been
identified to bring air emissions from the MDK smelter into compliance with legislative
requirements. In the following sections, the proposed programmes are described in general
terms followed by a planning strategy for reducing air emissions.
6.2.1.1.1 Fugitive Emissions from Fumace Operations
Fugitive emission sources from furnace operations were detailed in Section 4.1.2.3. As part of
UM's strategy to stabilise operations, fugitive emissions will be largely eliminated by redesigning
the gas flows, optimizing ductwork, fansytem and hooding and minimize leakage.
6.2.1.1.2 Drying Furnace Emission Control
The poor performance of the concentrate dryer ESPs is a principal factor in the high dust
concentrations currently being emitted to the atmosphere via the 325 m  stack.  Dust
concentrations in excess of 1200 mg/Nm3 have been measured at the outlet of the dryer ESPs.
To help reduce the dust emission levels to the legislative requirement of 20 mg/Nm3, the ESPs
have to be decommissioned and replaced with a fabric filter baghouses. This option is under.
study by UM. The current design flow rate two dryers operating is 144,000 Nm3/hr.
Emissions of sulphur dioxide from the concentrate dryer are due mainly to burning high sulphur
oil. However a significant amount may be generated by ignition of the concentrates due to poor
temperature control in the kiln. It is envisaged that there will be a reduction in sulphur dioxide
emissions as a result of:
- a more consistent throughput of uniformly blended concentrate allowing a more stable
operation and hence more precise temperature control

6.2.1.1.3 Process Steam Boilers
Exhaust gas from the waste heat boilers is currently exhausted to the atmosphere via the 325 m
stack.  The boilers may be decommissioned once smelter operations are stabilised and
sufficient quantities of steam are produced in the waste heat boilers to satisfy process
requirements. This will eliminate this pollution source.
6.2.1.1.4 Sulphuric Acid Plant Emissions
Stabilising operations will have a significant impact on reducing emissions from the acid plant by
providing a constant tenor, high volume SO2 gas stream to the acid plants. This will allow the
plant to operate within its design limits.
To ensure emission targets are achieved, improvements in the acid plant will include:
- equipment repairs and upgrades
- implementation of a regular maintenance programme
- improvements in flow and operator control with ductwork and fan system upgrades
Two double contact acid plants are a prerequisite to comply with the legal requirements. In this
respect, UM will investigate the feasibility of converting the single contact acid plant into a
double contact acid plant.
6.2.1.1.5 Material Handling
Airborne dust emissions generated during the handling, transport and mixing of dry materials will
be reduced by modernizing the existing facilities and implementation of a 'clean plant program'.
6.2.1.1.6 Waste Material Storage
Details of provisions to reduce wind borne dust emissions from open storage areas are provided
in Sections 6.2.1.3 and 6.2.2.3.
6.2.1.1.7 Planning Strategy for the Reduction of Air Emissions
A five year plan has been developed for the implementation of programmes to bring air
emissions into compliance with legislative requirements, and is shown in Figure 6.2.1. At the
end of this five year period, air emission levels will be at or below current limits set by the
Bulgarian Environmental Ministry and the draft BAT-EU recommendation of Osparcom.

During this period, a general trend of reducing air emission levels is expected. However, given
the extent of changes to be made to smelter operations and equipment, combined with an
increase in productions levels, air emissions are expected to fluctuate over short term periods.
The planning strategy foresees . urgent protective measures tto be taken within 6 months, the
major operational investments and controlled measures within the first 3 years. Further
optimalisation and management of the production and cleaning installations, may require an
additional two years period. The final objective will be to comply with both Bulgarian and EU-
BAT standards within 5 years from the signing of the agreement.

6.2.1.2 Waste Water
A two-step approach will be followed in order to remedy MDK's effluent water problems:
Step 1: Proposed Intermediate Solution and Remedies
Step 2: Future Design Improvements
Step 1: Proposed Intermediate Solution and Remedies of the Problems
Step 1. 1: Existing Neutralization Plant Design Improvements (to realise within 6 months)
The following improvements to the existing effluent treatment plant at MDK are proposed for
immediate implementation.  The proposed "interim  design' will eliminate most of the
environmental problems and provide an effluent treatment plant which is consistent with Current
Industry Practice elsewhere in the Western World and Latin America.
- Keep the existing infrastructure, including acidic effluent equalisation, lime making and
neutralisation system.
- Improve the design of the neutralisation unit by rebuilding liquid risers to enable better
contacting, improve aeration and mixing by using air spargers, provide lime feed to each of
the three neutralisation chambers and install 3-stage pH control, one in each of the three
chambers.
- The operating conditions (i.e. aeration rate, pH, lime concentration and quantity, reaction
time and arsenic speciation) should be optimised in a parallel bench-top study in order to
"fine-tune" operation of the plant, optimise use of chemicals and improve quality of treated
effluent.
Step 1.2: New Design and Additional Equipment for Immediate Implementation (to realise
between 9 and 12 months)
The following additional equipment will bring about major improvement in the performance of the
water treatment process and the quality of effluent produced by the wastewater treatment plant
(see Figures 4.2-2, 6.2-land 6.2-2):
A large circular clarifier/thickener to be installed immediately after the existing neutralization
plant. The clarifier will separate the arsenic-contaminated solids from the water as a
thickened slurry of approximately 15-20% solids concentration.

- A large recessed plate filter press with adequate capacity to dewater the sludge under high
pressure and obtain a filter cake containing approximately 60-70% w/w dry solids. The filter
cake will be removed and transported by trucks to the three existing lagoons nearby, to be
dug up, prepared and lined so that they can safely receive the hazardous arsenic-containing
filter cake. By using a high pressure on the order of 15 bar, the filter cake will have low
moisture and thus will be easier to handle and occupy minimum space.
- The filtrate from the filter press as well as the clarifier supernatant are combined and sent to
a polishing filter (i.e. dual media filter) to remove entrained suspended solids and minimize
the concentration of arsenic and other heavy metals in the effluent.
- Before discharge, the filtered effluent is pH adjusted by adding acid in a stirred tank, thus
reducing the pH to the range 7-8. The adjustment of pH of the filtered water will stop any
further precipitation of solids and result in an environmentally acceptable effluent.
This design for immediate implementation represents a well-recognized and accepted industry
practice for the treatment of acidic copper smelter effluents.
The above "immediate" improvements in the existing design can be implemented during a
period of approximately 9-12 months from privitatization of MDK. This period will be required to
prepare equipment specifications, purchase, install and start-up of the new equipment, as well
as preparation of the new, secure solid disposal lagoons.
Step 2: Future Design Improvements
The proposed "Intermediate Design" can be upgraded at a later date (i.e. within a period of three
years) in order to further improve the effluent treatment process and achieve even better
separation of arsenic and other heavy metals from the water. A multistage water treatment
system will be installed based on the Best Available Techniques.
The above water treatment system design will result in a dramatic improvement in the quality of
the effluent and will likely achieve an overall plant effluent arsenic concentration on the order of
0.1 mg/L (annual average) or 0.5 mg/L (daily average), compared to an average range of 1-5
mg/L which is achievable by using the simple neutralization, filtration, dewatering and pH
adjustment scheme which is proposed for immediate implementation. Clearly, the Future
Solution" will require considerable additional investment in equipment and a significant increase
in the plant operating costs.
Process Improvements
One of the key contributors to the large quantity of solids generated by the neutralization plant is
the relatively high concentration of the 'weak acid" generated as a result of gas cleaning and
cooling. The problem of metal dust removal is complicated by the high sulphur trioxide

concentration in the gas from the flash furnace. This adds to the acid value in the"weak acid"
waste and to calcium sulphate production as by-product of acid neutralization. Therefore:
Operation of the flash furnace must therefore be optimized to reduce S03 production.
Futhermore, the feasibility of recycling some of the weak acid streams will be considered
(e.g. from the wet ESP's).
The feasibility of reusing the water used for regenerating the Ion Exchange resins for the
purpose of gas cleaning and cooling should also be examined.
Finally, it is worthwhile also to consider using the effluent from the proposed effluent
treatment plant for cooling of the slag since this application requires a relatively poor quality
water.
Surface Water Run-off and Rainwater
In general, the quality of surface run-off from the MDK plant is not poor. The pH in the Sanar
Dere, Kiselo Dere, Zlatitsa and Pirdopska rivers are in the range 6.5-9 and the TSS is in the
range 10-80 mg/L, with the rivers having less than 50 mg/L as TSS. The concentration of heavy
metals based on the recent audit conducted on-site were quite low, except for copper ranging
between 0.2 and 2 mg/L. Current analyses of zinc (Zn) show a concentration in the range 0.02 -
0.5 mg total Zn/L, with the lower range reflecting Zlatishka, Pirdopska and Topolnitza rivers.
The lower values of zinc are below the aquatic toxicity levels for most organisms.
From examination of the limited analytical data available todate, it is difficult to conclude whether
or not the run-off surface water will need treatment. It is expected that the quality of surface
water will improve significantly after implementing measures to clean the MDK site and to
improve the process and control various emissions and dust. The concentration of metals such
as copper, zinc, arsenic, etc. will likely decrease significantly. At that point, it will be possible to
determine whether or not surface water catchment and treatmnent  will be necessary.
Consideration should be given to water conservation, reduction of surface run-off, recycling,
reuse, etc.

6.2.1.3 Solid Waste Disposal
6.2.1.3.1 General
The process of disposal of solid wastes will be developed in three stages:
Step 1.     Immediate Remediation that will be required to ensure public safety and allow
continued operation.
Step 2.      Intermediate disposal plan to reduce the existing pollution in the shortest time.
This will allow time to design the future solution and finalize acquisition of land.
Step 3.     Future disposal plan that will meet the Bulgarian and International criteria. Future
disposal facilities have to become available about 3 years after Union Miniere
becomes investor in the plant.
The three steps of the disposal plans for gypsum arsenite solids, fayalite tailings and re-usable
plant residues are illustrated on Drawings 90579-02, 90579-003 and 90579-004. The concepts
and conceptual desiyns are discussed in the next sections.

6.2.1.3.2 Solid waste from acid effluent treatment plant.
Step 1: Immediate action to create an intermediate disposal area (to realise within 6 months)
The solid wastes will be safely disposed in plastic lined trenches located in the small lagoons
area.
The existing slime pond represents a critical environmental risk, requiring urgent measures for
the following reasons:
It is practically full with a large volume of slimes containing arsenic and heavy metals. Due to
lack of any additional capacity, a major rainfall could cause an overflow or weakening and
breaking the dam, releasing arsenic slimes.
- The perimeter dam of the lagoon may not be stable. Analyses of the dam based on
recognized international standards, shows the minimum factor of safety of the dam being
below accepted criteria. A collapse of the dam would be catastrophic by releasing arsenic
and other contaminants into the Topolnitsa Reservoir.
- Because of the unavailability of an altemative discard area, the lagoon nonetheless
continues to be filled with additional contaminated slime.
It is of utmost urgency to fortify the dam immediately and develop an altemative area for
disposal of the calcium arsenite slime. UM/Hatch have develop a plan that can be executed
very rapidly if early approval is obtained. This plan consists of the following:
1. Increase the stability of the dam  immediately.  This will be done by fortressing the
downstream slope with additional earth material. This additional fill has been designed so
that it agrees with the final reclaim slope that will be produced when the slime is rehabilitated
into park land. The dam re-inforcement is illustrated on Drawing 90579-203.
The second part of the stabilization will involve placing a clay zone on the upstream side of
the dam, to depth of about 3 m, to stop the leakage of water through the dam. Continued
leakage will weaken the dam.
2. Develop an altemative plan to dispose of the calcium-arsenite. The proposed plan will
consist of modifying the existing neutralization plant to produce a solid filter cake residue and
the solid calcium-arsenite will be encapsulated within a plastic liner to form a secure disposal
site. The changes will involve the following:
Modifying the existing neutralization plant by:
adding a clarifier to settle out the neutralized material into a sludge;

- adding high pressure filter presses that will compress the sludge into a solid filter cake
that can be handled as earth material, and
- adding multi-media filter to remove fine suspended solids from the clarifier and filter
press effluents.
The existing small lagoons will be rehabilitated and upgraded to store safely the solid
residue This will be done by completing the excavation of all residues within the lagoons,
deepening the lagoons by one metre to increase their capacity, installing a groundwater
drainage system and than finally lining the lagoon with a heavy duty polyethylene (plastic)
liner. The solid residue will be placed from end, covered continually with a soil layer and a
plastic liner. Finally, the liner will be covered with a minimum of 1 m fill. This will
encapsulate the calcium-arsenite.
It is necessary to immediately order the equipment for the neutralization plant and the lagoon
liners and start preparing the lagoons for the solid residue. Utmost urgency will be required in
order to complete the modification so that the disposal of the slime into the slime pond can be
stopped as soon as possible.
The immediate plan for the residue will produce storage for only about two years. A new
intermediate and long-term disposal area will have to be developed.
The environmental hazard of the slime pond, Blue Lagoon, has been known for some time, and
various solutions to solve the problem have been considered. All the solutions involve mixing
the calcium-arsenite slime with fayalite tailings and pumping this slurry to an off-site tailings
pond such as the existing pond at Chelopetch mine, into underground mine openings at
Chelopetch or constructing a new pond at Bakadjik.
UM/Hatch do not accept these solutions for several reasons as follows:
- diluting the arsenic with fayalite is not acceptable by intemational standards because it does
not solve the problem of arsenic, but spreads it,
- transporting the arsenic/fayalite creates another risk of pipe leakage that will result in spills in
agricultural land and there will be continuous work along the pipeline route because the
great abrasiveness of the fayalite tailings will require pipe repairs and frequent replacement,
- capital cost and operating costs for the pipeline and pumping will be high,
finally, UM/Hatch disagree in developing a disposal site on virgin land surrounded by
agricultural land when a better altemative is available, nor does UM/Hatch agree in placing
the mixture within an underground mined-out area.  The reason being that normally
groundwater will seep through the filled-in mine openings which will contaminate the
groundwater and most ministries of mines do not want to contaminate future ore resolves.
UM/Hatch propose to continue the disposal process design developed for the immediate
solution. It is proposed to continue producing solid filter cake residue and encapsulating in

plastic lined trenches. These new trenches would be located just south of the plant and east of
the slime lagoon in an area which has been largely used for disposal of solid construction
materials. The intermediate and future residue disposal would be done in lined trenches that will
be constructed as needed and continually covered.
The trenches will be perpendicular to an existing road. To minimize any impact on the public
using this road, it is proposed to provide a buffer between the residue disposal area and the
road and to construct on the buffer, i.e. between the road and disposal area, a landscape
longitudinal mound that will prevent direct view of the residue disposal area.
The plan for future solid residue disposal is shown on Drawing 90579-03.
In the future (step 3) the new water treatment plant will produce two streams of solid waste,
namely; gypsum and calcium ferric arsenate. Both of these wastes will be compressed into
solid residue cakes that will be safely disposed in similar but separate lined trenches. The
trenches will be located south of the plant and east of the existing slime lagoon.
The trenches will be progressively excavated as needed, the sections that are filled, will be
continuously covered and reclaimed. Only small sections of one set of trenches will be exposed
at any time.
6.2.1.3.3 Fayalite Tailings
Step 1: Immediate Remediation: After settling and dewatering in a pond, the newly produced
tailings will be excavated and transported to the Elatzite tailings area for disposal. As an
immediate action, the transportatioh of the tailings to Elatzite, will be performed by means of
covered trucks.
A temporally settling pont, will be created and used until the final tailing disposal site (see step 2)
will be ready (within 5 years).
Special provisions will be made for the design of the intermediate settling area to prevent wind
erosion. Some of the measures that will be taken are:
-  providing sufficient freeboard between the maximum level of tailings and the crest of the
perimeter dams,
-  discharge the tailings in the active pond along a central pipe to maximize the saturation of
the tailings and maintaining water cover over the lower two thirds of the tailings ( i.e. keep a
minimum of two thirds of the tailings submerged), and
- provide water spray over the upper one third exposed tailings.

Step 2: Intermediate Disposal: In the future a new designed tailing disposal facility complying to
the requirements of the new EU landfill directive, will be constructed.
The operation of two small ponds to sediment out the tailings and trucking the tailings to the
Elatzite tailings pond was only a temporary and interim solution. It is proposed to develop a
better solution for the long term condition. The disposal of the tailings has been studied for
many years but up to the present time, no solution has been accepted by the Ministry of
Environment. Some of the solutions that have been considered are:
- pumping the tailings to either Chelopetch mine tailings pond or place these tailings into
underground mined out areas,
- designing a new tailings pond in Bakadjik area, and
- selling the fayalite tailings to the cement industry.
Step 3: Future Disposal Plan: UM/Hatch have considered these options and found them
undesirable when compared to their preferred option for the following reasons:
Chelopetch tailings pond or underground mine.
1) Pumping of fayalite tailings over long distances will involve considerable maintenance of the
pipeline and be costly to operate. Frequent maintenance of the pipeline and the potential for
spills will not be looked at favourably by the local population.
2) The disposal of tailings into another mine with a different owner is not a secure option.
3) Most mine operators have found pumping of tailings into mine openings costly and
inefficient. This method is most often used when it is necessary to reinforce the mined out
areas for additional ore recovery. In this case the tailings are mixed with cement to produce
a rigid roof support.
New tailings pond at Bakadjik.
1) UM/Hatch disagree in developing a disposal site on virgin land surrounded by agricultural
land when a better alternative is available.
2) The proposed Bakadjik site will be costly to develop because it will require high dams. It is
questionable if low cost soil will be available for the construction of the dams. If not, more
costly rock will have to be used.
3) The Bakadjik site will require several kilometre long pipelines that will have to cross
agricultural land. The pipeline will require continuous maintenance and therefore an access
road which will impact on the agricultural land it will cross.
Future Fayalite Tailings Pond adjacent to MDK Plant
UM/Hatch prefer to develop a future tailings pond immediately adjacent to the MDK plant. The
proposed area is bounded on two sides by the existing slag dump and the large filled fayalite
tailings pond. The advantages of this area are:
PR90579 Rev 0. 95108                                                   PR.DOT, Rev. 3. 96105

1 ) It is hidden from Pirdop citizens by the existing high slag dump,
2) It is bounded on two sides by existing plant deposits, namely: slag and fayalite tailings. This
area is not used by the public for through access.
3) Large quantities of soil will be required to rehabilitate the slime pond, slag dump, existing
large tailings pond, and fill many depressions at the plant that were produced by the
excavation of contaminated soils. The resulting depression will be a start of the tailings pond.
4) Because of the great depth of soil overburden at this location, plenty of soil will be needed to
construct a perimeter dam on the east side. The construction of dams on the south and
west side will require only small amount of fill because of the existence of the walls from the
slag dump and tailings pond.
5) The final closure, rehabilitation of this pond, will merge into the rehabilitated slag dump and
tailings pond to form one mound.
At this time, UM/Hatch have developed an intermediate solution for handling the fayalite tailings.
Upon completion of the design of this intermediate solution, UM will re-evaluate the solutions
presented by others and consider new solutions.
6.2.1.3.4 Residue Storage Disposal Area
The existing disposal area for various plan residues that are re-used in the smelter are stored
within a concrete walled compound in the western section of the plant. The compound floor
consist of asphalt paving over natural compacted soil. One drill hole within the compound, and
drilling outside along the perimeter, show soil and some water contamination.
It is planned to construct a new floor within the compound with a surface water collection system
to prevent future soil contamination. This work will be step 2 project.
The construction will involve:
- removal of the asphalt and excavation of about 1 m of the contaminated soil,
covering the soil with a heavy plastic liner,
- constructing a concrete floor in the compound, and
providing a surface drainage system so that all precipitation water can be collected in a
central location and removed for treatment and a water treatment plant.

The following schedule shown in Figure 6.2.1-1 indicates the timing for implementing the various
stages for improving the handling of solid wastes at MDK.

6.2.2 Remediation of Contaminated Areas and Disposal Sites
6.2.2. 1 General
MDK plant has four major contaminated areas/disposal sites that have to be remediated,
namely:
- contamination within the plant area
- slime pond
- fayalite tailings pond, and
- slag dump

These areas/disposal areas have to be remedied to prevent the contamination spreading to the
surrounding environment and prevent an environmental disaster in case of the failure of the
slime pond. A summary of the concern and the proposed remediation measures are discussed
in the next sections.
6.2.2.2 Plant Area Contamination
The plant is contaminated by the presence of hazardous solid waste piles, operation of various
facilities, such as, electrolysis plant, acid plant, fuel area and abandoned smelter production
buildings in various state of collapse. The major contaminants are heavy metals, such as As,
Cu, Pb, Cd, and Sb and hydrocarbons.
Materials and soils contaminated materials with these metals are sources for surface and
groundwater contamination which may migrate offsite. Therefore the sources have to excavated
and removed into a secure landfill.
The degree of contamination of the various areas and the contaminants were presented in
Section 4.6. Details of the environmental assessment of the plant is presented in detail in
Technical Support Document 3, Solid Wastes and Ground Conditions.
Estimated quantities of major contaminated and scrap steel at the plant site are given in Table
6.2.2-1. This table indicates that there are 565 tons of contaminated solid waste and 66,000 tons
of scrap steel.

The contaminated solid waste will be encapsulated in the slime pond and the scrap steel will be
clean, cut into suitable sizes and sold to the steel industry. The concept of waste encapsulation
is discussed in the next section.
Groundwater contamination was observed to be widespread in the Southwest corner of the site
near the abandoned smelter area, electrolysis workshop, small lagoons and hydrochloric acid
storage tanks. While the level of groundwater impact on the site is high, the mass transport of
contaminants off-site is relatively small.
However, considering the high groundwater contamination at the plant site, further studies of the
contamination flow and potential effect on Topotnitsa River will have to be evaluated in greater
detail.
6.2.2.3 Slime Pond
The environmental hazard of the slime pond, Blue Lagoon, has been know for some time, and
various solutions have been forwarded.  Three previously proposed solutions known to
UM/Hatch are:
- mixing the slimes with the tailings and pumping this slurry to an offsite tailings pond,
mixing the slimes with local clay soil and compacting this mixture into large mound and
,processing of the slimes through a gold extraction process and storing the resulting slimes in
a more secure containment.
UM and Hatch do not consider any of these as optimum solutions and is proposing an altemate
solution that is considered to be more environmentally acceptable. The relative advantages and
disadvantages of the alternative proposals are discussed in more detail below.
1) Pumping Slime/Tailings Mixture to an Off-Site Tailings Pond
These solutions involve mixing the calcium-arsenite slime with fayalite tailings and pumping
this slurry to an off-site tailings pond such as the existing pond at Chelopetch mine, into
underground mine openings at Chelopetch or construct a new pond at Bakadjk.UM/Hatch do
not accept this solutions for several reasons:
diluting the arsenic with fayalite is not acceptable by international standards because it does
not solve the problem of arsenic, but spreads it,
- transporting the arsenic/fayaiite creates another risk of pipe leakage that will result in spills in
agricultural land and there will be continuous work along the pipeline route because the
great abrasiveness of the fayalite tailings will require pipe repairs and frequent replacement,
- capital cost and operating costs for the pipeline and pumping will be high,
PR90579 Rev. 0. 95106                                                 PR. DOT. Rev 3. 96/05

>  finally, UM/Hatch disagree with the proposal to develop a disposal site on virgin land
surrounded by agricultural land when a better alternative is available, nor does UM/Hatch
agree in placing the mixture within underground mined-out area. The reason being that
normally groundwater will seep through the filled-in mine openings which will contaminate
the groundwater and most ministries of mines do not want to contaminate future ore
resolves.
2) Mixing slimes with clay soil and storing in a mound.
This solution is not acceptable because of the difficulty in construction, use of large volumes of
good clay soil and producing a much larger volume of contaminated material, albeit in a diluted
form. In brief:
-  mixing of slimes with clay soil will require large volumes of clay soil to soak up the large
volumes of water in the slimes,
- mixing will require a large outside surface area that will require a rainwater collection and
treatment system for the rainy periods and that will produce wind erosion during dry weather,
- mixing of the large volume of clay required for the mixing, the end result will be a much
larger volume of wastes, albeit less contaminated,
- the mound will require a cover to prevent rainwater infiltration and contamination of the
groundwater in the long-term.
3) Gold Extraction
It is proposed to dredge out the slimes from the pond and process the slimes through a cyanide
process to extract gold and other precious metals that are contained in the slimes.  It is
suggested that the income from the recovery of gold and precious metals will pay for the safe
disposal of the remaining arsenic slimes. This solution is not acceptable to the Union Miniere
team for the following reasons:
-  the cyanide gold extraction process will add another pollutant to the slimes,
-  it is believed that the plant to extract the gold and precious metals is too costly for the
relatively small volume of slimes and the estimated gold content to make any appreciable
profit, if any, to provide money for disposal of the slimes,
-  the cyanide gold processing of gypsum slimes is not well proven technology,
-  the cyanide plant operation will produce an increased risk of contaminating the outside area,
and finally,
-  a separate slime storage area will have to be developed.
4) UM/Hatch Preferred Solution - Encapsulation of the Slime Pond
Union Miniere propose to leave the slime in place, compress it into a near solid state and cover
the slime and other covering material with a double liner to prevent future rain water infiltration.
The resulting mound would be covered with clean earth and vegetated with grass, bushes and
trees to produce a park.

The solution would consist of the following components:
- Termination of Slime Disposal in the Blue Lagoon. In a very short time after Union Miniere
becomes a full investor in the MDK Plant, it will improve the acid plant effluent treatment
plant and incorporate slime filter presses that will produce small volumes of solid"slimes" to
be disposed in lined secured storage containments.
- Perimeter Dam Reinforcement.  The perimeter will be reinforced as soon as possible to
provide additional comfort in regard to the stability of the dam for the period until the
encapsulation of the Blue Lagoon is completed. The proposed reinforcement will form the
lower portion of the final vegetated mound.
- In-Place Compression of Slimes. The slimes in the Blue lagoon will be compressed in-place
into a solid mass that will have about half of the existing volume and thickness. This will be
executed with proven technologies that are used to build roads over soft soils and
consolidate very soft slimes and clays. To consolidate the slime, a heavy loading will have
to be applied to the surface of the slime by placing earth fill. To minimize the need to bring
new material to the plant, it is proposed to use some of the contaminated materials from the
MDK plant site as the loading material.
Encapsulating the Compressed Slimes and Contaminated Plant Fill Material. It is proposed
to shape the fill over the Blue Lagoon to form a natural looking mound that can be developed
into a park setting. The mound will be covered with double protection consisting of a plastic
liner and a 'dry cover" to stop any rain infiltration into the contaminated materials and slimes.
The "dry cover" will have a thick soil cover that will be vegetated with grass , bushes and
trees.
- Perimeter underground drainage system will designed and constructed to prevent
contamination of the groundwater during construction and prevent future regional
groundwater being contaminated by the slimes.
The design for this solution is provided in Technical Support Document No 4, titled Slime
Lagoon. The concept of slime consolidation and encapsulation is illustrated on Drawing 90579-
206.
6.2.2.4 Fayalite Tailings Pond
The existing fayalite tailings pond has reached its capacity. It has been partially covered with
soil but the northern portion is still being used for alternatively settling out of tailings siurry. This
northem area is required for settling out the tailings because only one small pond is available for
this purpose. When this pond is being used, the northern portion of the large pond has to be
used as the alternative settling pond.
PR9OS79 Rev. 0. 95/08                                                 PR.OOT. Rev. 3. 96A)S

UM is proposing to construct a second small settling pond just west of the existing small pond so
that the large tailings pond can be closed and remediated. This will be readily accomplished
since the fayalite tailings are inert. Groundwater sampling at the toe of the tailings pond did not
show any groundwater contamination.
The closure or remediation of the tailings pond will involve some regrading of the slope to make
the southern slope shallower for vegetation and aesthetic purpose, regrade the surface to
control the surface water and vegetate the new regraded mound.
The design of the small tailings pond, regrading of the large tailings pond and the conceptual
design of a proposed future tailings pond are given Technical Support Document No 5, titled
Fayalite Tailings Disposal.
6.2.2.5 Slag Dump
The slag dump contains some 7 million tonnes of slag and covers an area of about 11 ha. The
slag dump surface is irregular, black in colour and presents an unsightly feature above the town
of Pirdop.  Aside of the aesthetic features, it is not environmentally friendly because of
production of dust during high wind and the high content of copper. The copper is released
gradually and produces unacceptable seepage water. However, the release is not of major
proportion.
It is proposed to regrade the dump to produce gradual slopes to provide a stable slope to
support vegetation. The slag dump will be covered with a soil layer representing a 'dry cover'.
The 'dry cover' design is used for mine waste rock that generate acid because of high sulphur
content. The 'dry cover' design consist of two layers of clayey soil, similar to that which is found
upslope of the slag dump. The bottom layer is about 0.6 m thick and is compacted. The upper
layer is placed loosely.
The concept is that the lower layer forms a low permeability zone that keeps the water in the
upper layer. The upper layer acts as a water storage zone in which rainfall water is stored to
evaporate at a later time. This combination reduces the infiltration of water greatly and keeps
the oxygen out of the mine rock, or in this case, slag. The great reduction of water infiltration
into the mine rock or slag, reduces seepage contamination by the reduction of water and the
absence of oxygen.
6.3 Recommendations for Improvement of Environmental Management
6.3.1 Structure
The structure of environmental management at MDK is discussed in Section 3. Although there
is a system in place for monitoring air emissions and waste water discharges it is not clear how

regulatory authorities and ensuring that the plant is in compliance with the regulations, the
responsibility for control of emissions should be at Plant or Department Manager level. For this
to be effective a formal system should be established for reporting violations or non -compliance
to the Departmental Managers.
6.3.2 Management Control Techniques
Management control techniques are an important factor in minimising fugitive emissions.
Specific techniques under this category include:
plant housekeeping
training and contingency planning
inspection schedules and maintenance
- minimisation of waste
6.3.2. 1 Housekeeping
From visual observations made during the assessment there is no attention to housekeeping on
the plant; dust and waste materials are accumulating inside and outside the plant areas.
Dust that accumulates in yards or buildings can be a significant source of fugitive emissions.
The risk can be reduced by paving surface areas. Outside paved areas should be cleaned
using a mobile vauum cleaner; indoor areas can be cleaned using smaller equipment.
Equipment for cleaning spills or leaks should be readily available.
Housekeeping should be an integral part of the daily operating routine and systems should be
introduced to monitor its effectiveness. Supervisors and operators must be aware of their
individual responsibility towards protecting the environment.
6.3.2.2 Training and Contingency Planning
The training of operators and supervisors should emphasise the potential environmental
problems associated with a particular operation. Written procedures should be available with
specific action to be'taken in the event of process malfunction or equipment failure which could
result in in release of pollutants to the environment.
Records of employee training in this respect should be maintained and refresher training carried
out at regular intervals.
6.3.2.3 Inspection schedules and maintenance
Pollution abatement equipment should incorporate the necessary control' and alarm
instrumentation to warn of breakdown or excursion outside preset limits.

In addition, procedures should be employed to ensure that routine manual or visual checks are
also carried out to guarantee correct operation or condition of abatement equipment. These
checks should be recorded. These inspections should include for example:
- the condition of flues and ducts for accumulation of dust
- the condition of seals, hatches and dampers for signs of fume leakage
- the operation of alarm systems
Preventative maintenance should be practiced to replace or recondition critical equipment
prior to its anticipated failure date.
6.3.2.4 Waste Minimisation
A thorough audit of individual processes should be carried out to determine the potential for
recycle of water, solid waste and packaging. Dry or dusty materials should be handled in closed
containers.
6.4 Measures for Monitoring Emissions
6.4. 1 Air
6.4.1.1 Emissions
Point sources of proces emissions where monitoring is required to record the levels of
substances requiring control are:
- the combined gas stream to the 325 metre stack for: dust and gaseous substances, sulphur
dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. The dust will be analysed for representative
metals.
the combined gas stream from the sulphuric acid plants prior to the 120 metre stack for:
sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide
Air measurements will be best carried out to conform to techniques approved by the
Environmental Agencies.
6.4.1.2 Ambient Air Quality
MDK already monitors the concentration of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere at two locations;
one in Pirdop and one in Zlatitsa. Additional instruments have been purchased so that
monitoring can be carried out at additional locations in these towns.
A programme for routine monitoring of dust in these locations and at various selected positions
at the plant perimeter will be implemented. Standard techniques for this include:
- deposit guages for meauring the quantity of deposited dust
- high volume air sampling to determine the concentration of fine particle and respirable dust
(<10 microns) in the atmosphere.

6.4.2 Water
6.4.2.1 Effluent waters
After installing the definitive waste water cleaning plant, a continuous measurement system of
water sampling, based on flow rate measurements, will be installed.
Measurements of all relevant and important parameters will be conducted, in accordance to
Bulgarian and international requirements.
6. 4.2 Receiving surface waters
Frequent controls of upstream and downstream water samples will be taken from the
conjunction of the Pirdopska into the Topolnitsa river, to assess and evaluate the impact of the
MDK plant on the receiving water quality.

7. CONCLUSIONS
In general the Environmental Impact Assessment carried out by Hatch Union/Miniere confirms
the findings of previous impact assessments and studies.  The significant issues are
summarised in the following sections. The proposed plans for remediation of the most serious
contamination and for bringing the plant into compliance with Bulgarian and European
evironmental legislation are also summarised.
7.1 Environmental Impact
7.1.1 Air
- sulphur dioxide emissions from the acid plant stack are in excess of the mandatory limits due
to the relatively low conversion efficiency of the single contact acid plant.
- emissions of dust and sulphur dioxide from the 325 metre stack exceed the environmental
standards. However considering the height of the release point these are not considered to
have a significant impact on local air quality.
-  low level fugitive emissions from the furnace operations and dust blown from dry storage
areas have a significant impact on the ambient air quality both inside and outside the plant
perimeter.
7.1.2 Water
- the treated acidic effluent which is discharged to the river Pirdopska exceeds the Category 3
receiving water standards for several parameters
the drainage water from the operating facility which is discharged to the Sanar Dere channel
often exceeds the crieria for Category 3 receiving water
- run-off water from the old part of the site plus water from the slag treatment process which
are discharged into the Kiselo Dere channel exceed the crteria for Category 2 receiving
water
7.1.3 Solid Waste
The major concems with respect to solid waste storage and disposal are:
- the receptacle for the waste water treatment sludge is almost full and there are concems
about its stability
- the fayalite tailings pond which is now full is a source of windblown dust emissions
- the presence on site of a variety of waste materials, contaminated disused equipment and
derelict structures and buildings is a source of ground and groundwater contamination
7.2 Remediation
A five year plan has been developed for bringing the plant into compliance with regulations and
for remediation of existing waste storage areas and contaminated parts of the site
A contributing factor to the exceedance of limits for air emissions is the current operating
regime of the smelter. A priority for UM would be to operate the smelter with a consistent
throughput of higher grade copner concentrate so that it is runnino at a level close to its

design parameters. Optimisation of the smelter operation in this manner will improve the
efficiency of the gas handling and cleaning system. At the same time UM will study the
modification or replacement of gas cleaning equipment necessary to bring the plant into
compliance.
A two step approach will be adopted for improving the treated effluent quality. In the first
step for immediate implementation, the existing neutralisation plant will be modified to
improve the efficiency and additional equipment will be installed so that a solid filter cake
residue is produced instead of a slurry. The filter cake will be deposited safely in lined
trenches. In the second step the plant will be upgraded to a double stage treatment process
based on best available technique for treatment of effluent of this type. Furthermore the
optimisation of the smelter operation and gas cleaning is expected to reduce the volume of
acidic effluent requiring treatment.
-- Since the pond used for storing waste water treatment sludge is full and there are concems
about the stability of the walls, provision will be made to store this material in a suitably
designed lagoon. This will be linked with the improved effluent treatment process discussed
above.
>- the pond will be decommissioned and then encapsulated
> alil of the waste on site, including disused buildings will be deposited onto the slime pond
to aid the dewatering and compression process
the fayalite tailings pond will be encapsulated so that it ceases to be an environmental risk
as far as dust emissions are concerned. Similarly an old slag dump will also be covered to
prevent any leachate from contaminating the sub-surface
