I. Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o fthe Executive Directors to provide an
additional credit inan amount o f SDR 13.5 million (US$22 million equivalent) to the
Ghana Community Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP, Cr. 3964-GH).

2.      The proposed additional credit would help finance the costs associated with
scaling up o f CBRDP to reconstruct public goods inthe flood-affected regions o f the
north, and extend support for decentralized service provision through the financing o f
basic public infrastructure by local level government authorities for an additional sixteen
months o fproject implementation. The proposed additional credit would also support
further capacity buildinginrelationto the expansion andextension o fpublic works
activities, and insupport o f decentralization as envisioned under the original project.
Finally, the additional credit would support incremental program management costs
related to these activities and an extension o f the project implementation period.

3.       CBRDP operates inclose coordination with several development partners and
programs. Inparticular, project implementation will continuejointly with the Agence
Franqaise de Developpement (AFD) andthe InternationalFundfor Agricultural
Development (IFAD). While AFD provides parallel funding for CBRDP (through a loan
o f10 million), IFAD and the Bank are working closely on the estimated US$17 million
Northern Region Poverty Reduction Program (NORPREP). The Bank is assuming
supervision responsibility for NORPREPto help inimproving its effectiveness and
efficiency, andwill harmonize the program with CBRDP's implementationprocedures.

11.      BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancing

4.       The OriginalCredit. CBRDP (SDR 40.9 million) was approved on July 29,
2004 and became effective onNovember 2,2004. CBRDP's project development
objective (PDO) is to strengthen the capacity o f rural communities to enhance their
quality o f life by improvingtheir productive assets, rural infrastructure, and access to key
support services from private and public sources (PAD, pg. 5).

Progresson OngoingCredit

5.       Project implementation progress (IP)andprogress toward achieving the PDO
have been consistently rated satisfactory since effectiveness inNovember 2004 through
the latest ISR o f M a y 2008. The current closing date i s February 15,2009. A Midterm
Review (MTR) finalized inAugust/September 2007 concluded that: CBRDP had made
strong progress under most components; project management remained satisfactory; and
that the project would achieve most o f its intended outcomes and close as originally
planned. An independent Beneficiary Assessment conducted immediately prior to the
MTRhas confirmedpositive outcomes for several components. A SupervisionMission
completedinMarch 2008 added to this assessment. These achievements are highlighted
below, andpresented indetail inAnnex 1.




                                               1

0    Component 1, Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building, aims to build and
     strengthen the capacities o f national, regional, and local government agencies; non-
     governmental and community organizations; and specific public andprivate service
    providers to plan, manage and deliver basic services, and insupport o f the
    decentralization agenda o f GoG. To date, the project has provided training to all 138
    District Assemblies (DAs) and 454 selected Area Councils (ACs) indecentralization
    policy andregulations, procurement, financial management, planning, and monitoring
     and evaluation. The project has supported national institutions involvedinthe
    decentralization effort indevelopment planning, monitoring and financial
    management. Additional assistance has beenprovided to the Regional Planning and
     Coordination Units (RPCU), NGOs, CBOs, private and public service providers, and
    rural communities engaged inrapid project implementationmethods. The MTR
    considered Component 1to be very successful. Training o f user groups for water and
     schools has exceeded projections and appears to have helped to improve outcomes on
    water quality, user satisfaction and school enrollment,


0    Component 2, Infrastructure for Agricultural Development (IAD), intendedto support
    investments inwater catchment and irrigation; improvement intransport; and post-
    harvest infrastructure. Annex 3 provides a detailed breakdown o f investments inthis
    component, which has primarilysupported public goods subprojects for feeder road
    rehabilitation, market facilities and slaughterhouses through the provision o f grants
    managed by District Assemblies.' CBRDP i s financing a total o f 174 sub-projects
    (including those under construction or inthe process o f procurement) valued at about
    US$12 million as o f end-February 2008. The project continues to demonstrate
    progress interms o f increasing levels o f investment for IAD(as well as infrastructure
    for social andhuman development), and interms o f moving sub-projects from
    planningto completion stage. Feeder road subprojects (which comprise almost 74
    percent o f the total IADinvestments) also appear to be having a quantitative impact
    on reducing transport costs andtimes, and increased traffic. Due to issues with dam
    construction, less investment has been made inthis area than originally projected.

0   Component 3, Rural Enterprise Development/Learning Centers, provides training,
    technical and financial assistance to new and existingrural micro-enterprises through
    both grants and "advances" (commercial loans). To date, the component has
    disbursed about US$2.5 million through "advances" to 781 rural farmers and
    enterprises, plus US$22,000 inpoverty-targeted grants to complement the borrowers'
    equity and make the debt burden more affordable. An additional US$1.04 million (35
    percent o f which is commercial loans) has gone to upgrade 78 enterprises into
    learning centers that have trained over 1,600 people (mostly youth) inincome-
    generating skills, and helped about 732 o f them get started inbusiness with
    US$485,000 inloans and grants. The component has demonstrated a strong demand
    for term loans (of 18 months) at commercial rates not previously consideredviable.

'These subproject grants are managed by local government authorities for both project specific activities as
well as part o f the block grant facility established under the CBRDP that supported infrastructure
investments and the decentralization process.

    Ithas also developedan interestingmodel o f skills development, andrefined a
    mechanism o fproviding subsidies targeting the poor that help them access and afford
    commercial finance that i s being considered for replication inother projects.

0   Component 4, Infrastructure for Social and HumanDevelopment (ISHD) supports the
    rehabilitation and improvement o f community-level education, health, nutrition, and
    water and sanitation infrastructure through subproject grants managedby D A s
    (similar to IAD).* To date, ISHDhas absorbed more than double the level o f IAD
    investments (Annex 1). Among the anticipated subproject types, primary schools are
    the most important interms o fvalue, followed by boreholes. These together
    represented 83 percent o f the total ISHD investments as o f end-February 2008. The
    remaining 17 percent o f investments has gone toward health, nutrition and sanitation
    facilities. The Beneficiary Assessment found that schools have had a positive impact
    on enrollment rates and have significantly reduced the number o f days lost due to bad
    weather (where previously, due to the lack o f enclosed school buildings, teaching
    took place outdoors). Interms o f water, the MTR found that the original target
    number o f boreholes will be exceeded, and an estimated 338,771 people will have
    access to clean drinking water (compared to the baseline o f 117,7 11) as a result o f the
    sub-projects that have been completed, are ongoing, or are inthe process o f being
    procured. About 87 percent o f drilled wells have proven successful.

0   Component 5, Community BasedNatural Resource Management CNRM) supports the
    preparation o f integrated NRMplans at community, area and district levels;
    protection o f existing and rehabilitation o f degraded forest and watershed areas; and
    sustainable natural resource livelihoods opportunities. The component has begun to
    show some results incommunity sensitization, public awareness, the engagement and
    commitment o f district-level staff, and insmall-scale eco-tourism activities. The
    most recent Supervision Mission found that 17 DAs, 39 ACs and 223 communities
    have requested support for NRMactivities, 160 hectares o f sacred groves and
    community dedicated forest have beenplaced under protectionby communities, and
    374 hectares o f degraded farmlands have beenplanted with multipurpose tree species.
    However, the Mission concluded that the extent o f the component's impact on the
    five target watersheds will be limited, and expectations o f the component should be
    adjusted accordingly.

6.       Overall project management has been rated satisfactory or better. Earlier issues
with the project M&Esystem havebeen addressed, andwork is ongoing to improve data
collection, monitoring andreporting on project results. There i s no disbursement lag
from original estimates. As o f M a y 21,2008, the project has disbursed SDR 33.8 million
(83 percent).



 The description o fComponent 3 inthe DCA for ISHDdoes not indicate that this component would be
supported through subproject grants, though the PAD clearly implies that it would be and project
implementation procedures reflect h s . The new Financing Agreement will therefore needto address this
inconsistency.

Rationalefor AdditionalFinancing

7.      The Government is seeking additional financing under CBRDP inresponse to two
significant issues: (i)  reconstructiono f flood-damaged infrastructure inthe north; and (ii)
need for additional time to develop a harmonized framework for development partner
assistance for decentralized service delivery and to consult with the incoming
government (to be elected at the end o f 2008).

8.       ScalinP Up inResponse to Floods. Heavy andpersistent rains duringAugust-
September 2007 caused massive flooding inthe three northern regions o f Ghana that left
approximately 75,000 people vulnerable and caused an estimated US$129 millionin
darn age^.^ The World Bank worked closely with GoG to review the impact o f the floods
anddiscuss how ongoing or plannedprojects mightbe adapted or accelerated to help
respond to the damages. Among several options considered, the Bank and GoG decided
to utilize uncommittedresources from health and education sector operations to respond
to emergency needs (Le. insecticide-treated bednets and reconstructionand/or restoration
o f schools). The Bank also helped support Government's response by amending the
existing D C A for CBRDP to: (i)      increase the overall size o f the special account and
district-level advance accounts to improve cash-flow; and (ii)           reallocate funds for general
program management costs that have increased as a result o f the project's support to
Government's overall response. Furthermore, the Bankproposed that additional
financing be provided to CBRDP to help Government respond to the floods through the
project's block-grant mechanism to D A s insupport o f eligible public works subprojects
as defined inthe PAD, D C A and implementation manual.

9.      Expansion o f Support to Decentralization. CBRDP supports local level service
delivery through block grant allocations to Local Government Authorities (LGAs) for
priority infrastructure investments. The project was originally designed as a bridge
between a previous rural infrastructure operation based on community driven
development principles (the Village InfrastructureProject-- VIP), and a development
policy lending operation to support GoG's decentralization program that, as envisioned in
the CAS, was to commence inFY09. With a new government to be elected inlate 2008,
the consultation process on the scope o f decentralization policies and measures is now
expected to extendwell into 2009. It is therefore unlikely that a new operation will be
ready for submission to the BoarduntilFY10. As such, and given continued Government
prioritization for decentralization, GoG has requested that financing for the CBRDP
block grant mechanism, which channels funding directly to DAs, be extendedby sixteen
months to allow for a bridge betweenthis support and that o f any new operation.

10.     Government has sought Bank support for these emerging needs as the AFD and
IFAD financing are insufficient to address these areas. Inparticular: (i) funds have  AFD
been, for the most part, previously committed to specific DAs; and (ii)             IFADfinancing is
exclusively meant for only one o f Ghana's ten regions (Le., Northern Region), andpart o f
this fundinghas also been committed to help respond to the flood damages there.


  Anupdatedassessmentconducted inJanuary 2008 indicated that about US$32.3 million of damages
remain infeeder roads, primary health and education structures, and water and sanitation facilities.

111.     ProposedChangesunder the Project

11.      CBRDP's development objective and design, as presented inthe PAD, would
remain unchanged. The proposed additional financing would support the scaling up o f
three types o fbroad activities contemplatedunder the original PAD andD C A and that
would contribute further to and enhance achievement o f the PDO. These are:

     Scalingup ofpublicworks under Components2,4 and 5 for: (i)agricultural
     development; (ii) human and social development; and (iii)naturalresource
     management(US$18.4 million). The CBRDP supports public works investments
     identified through a local level development planning process or other priority setting
    mechanism. Subproject grants are then channeled to Beneficiaries (communities and
     LGAs) either directly inresponse to a given project (community groups and Area
     Councils) or through annual block-grants to DAs, which then finance individual
     subprojects. These funds can support a wide-range o fpotential subprojects that are
     linked to the sectoral areas indicated above, and which correspond with three o fthe
     original project components. To date, the vast majority o fpublic works' investments
    have gone toward, inorder o f magnitude, primary schools, wells, feeder roads, health
     andnutrition facilities, toilets, andmarkets (Annex 3). Nonetheless, the additional
     credit may be used for other eligible public investments as described inthe PAD and
    DCA, depending on identified local priorities and current implementationprocedures
     agreed uponbetweenthe Bank and Government.

    As noted above, the amount o fthe additional credit for these types o fpublic works
    would be used for two different purposes: US$6.5 million insupport o f reconstruction
     efforts inthe north o f the country, andUS$11.9 millioninsupport o f decentralized
     service delivery. The vast majority (87 percent) o f the US$6.5 million for flood
    reconstruction works inthe north will go toward feeder road repair. The US$11.9
    million to be used insupport o f the block-grant mechanism for DAs will help extend
    the Bank's support for the GoG's decentralization program for one year (CY 2009).
    These resources could be usedfor all eligible public goods as outlined inthe PAD
     (Annex 7,page 51) and detailed inthe project implementationmanual. These
     activities and expenditures would be subject to the identical implementation
    arrangements as for the current project.

0   Scalingup of Component1capacitv buildingactivities to support the flood
    responseinthe northand extendthe blockgrant mechanismfor 16 months
    (US$1.6million). CBRDP's capacitybuildingcomponent has proven effective in
    supporting DAs, ACs, and communities to assume core responsibilities under the
    decentralization process, including local level planning,procurement, financial
    management and oversight o fworks activities. The additional credit would help this
    component to extend andimprove the impact o f training incontracts management and
    rapid results methodologies4for selected flood-affected communities and ACs.
    Standard CBRDP training inbasic procurement procedures and financial

 Rapidresults methodologies have beenused successfully under the CBRDP to accelerate work and to
increase participation and control o f local communities around works activities.


                                                      5

     management would also be provided to those ACs affectedby the floods but not
     previously considered for support under CBRDP. Finally, the additional credit would
     support ongoing, specialized and on-demand capacity buildingassistance for other
     DAs and ACs throughout Ghana as part o f extending the block-grant mechanism.
     While the focus o f this capacity buildingi s expected to be on the ACs and Districts
     either affected by the floods, newly created, or where on-demand support is indicated,
     there may also be need for support to regional andnational level institutions. As
     such, the range o fpossible beneficiaries inthe D C A should not be amended.

 0   Continuedproiectmanapementsupport associatedwith expandedwork inthe
     north and the proposedprojectextensionof sixteenmonthsto June 30,2010
     (US$2.0 million). CBRDP's response to the floods has increased overall operating
     costs (travel, per diem, fuel and other operational inputs) and consultant services, as
     project management has reached out to assist flood-affected regions and districts.
     These flood-related incremental costs are expected to continue through the end o f
     2008. Secondly, the addition o f sixteen months o f implementation beyond the
     original closing date o f February 2009, carries with it project management and
     incremental operating costs for that additional period.

 12.     The PDO andproject designwill remain the same under the additional financing.
The task team, however, proposes to revise the project's Results Framework, in
particular, to refine the outcome indicators (as stated inthe original PAD and the Project
ImplementationManual) given: (i)             experiences to date with the project's principal
demand-driven components 2,4 and 5; (ii)              the fact that the PAD had too many indicators
that were both difficult and costly to measure; and (iii)          that these indicators emphasized
outputs rather than outcomes. There were also no clear causal links between some output
and outcome indicators. The proposedrevised indicators are, to a large extent, a subset
o f the original indicators inthe PAD, but are reworded to capture outcomes related to
actualproject activities, rather than focus on outputs. Annex 2 gives a comparison o f the
original indicators inthe PAD andthe proposed revised Results Framework.'

13.      The implementation arrangements as described inthe PAD for the original credit,
as approvedby the Board, also remain unchanged. However, inline with Bankpolicy,
all new procurements following the effectiveness o f the additional financing will be
governed by the Bank's May 2004 Procurement and Consultant Guidelines as revised in
October 2006. As explained inparagraph23 below, going forward the Bank will also
finance 100percent o f all eligible expenditures (inclusive o f any applicable taxes) inline
with Ghana's country financing parameters, which came into effect after the approval o f
the original CBRDP credit. Also, the new FinancingAgreement (FA), which will amend,
restate and supersede the original Development Credit Agreement (DCA), will:

  For example, inthe PAD, under Component 2, the indicator is the number o f small-scale contractors
mobilized to provide services. The revised indicator attempts to measure improved road accessibility.
Under Component 4, the original indicator on health measured the numbero f community health
improvement facilities rehabilitated or constructed. The revised indicator measures access to healthcare-
the number o f people seeking medical attention at health centers. Similarly for water, the revised indicators
propose to measure the number o fpeople with access to safe water and the average time lapse between
breakdown and repairs o f water facilities, rather than the numbero fboreholes constructed.


                                                        6

(i) DCAcovenantsthatwerealreadycompleted(i.e.,hlfilledeffectivenessand
    eliminate
disbursement conditions); (ii)         simplify the text o f a few covenants without changing their
substance, particularly inrelation to subprojects and the shifiingo f certain detailed
disbursement andprocurement provisions from the legal agreement into the disbursement
letter andthe procurement planin line with the current standard structure o f the Banks'
legal documentation; and (iii) some minor inconsistencies inthe way the project
                                       correct
is described inthe D C A versus the original PAD, notably regarding the project
development objective, omission o f a project management component, and o f the use o f
grants for component 4 (Infrastructure o f Social and HumanDevelopment) and grants
and advances for component 5 (Community-based Natural Resource Management).
Lastly, the FA would also establish June 30,2010 as the new project closing date.

14.       Table 1shows original and revised investment projections by project component.
Since the project uses a demand-driven approach that is based on a local level
development planningprocess, the original component projections, particularly for
components 3 and4, were very rough estimates. The end-of-project projections are
based on actual performance to date including specific commitments under these
different components.

IV.       Consistencywith CAS

15.       Theproposed activities are fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy,
(CAS FY08-11,Report No. 39822-GH). The CAS supports Ghana's second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (GPRSII, 2006-2009), which is built on three pillars: (i)                      raising
private sector competitiveness, including the modernization o f agriculture and sustainable
NRMand infrastructure; (ii)          improvinghuman development outcomes, with interventions
inthe health, education, water and sanitation, and socialprotection sectors; and(iii)
strengthening governance and civic responsibility by directing effective decentralization

to local authorities, including sufficient resources andresponsibilities for districts to
fulfill their mandates. The proposedscalingup supports all three GPRSIIpillars, and, in
particular, pillars (ii) (iii), helping to rebuild damaged feeder roads, health and
                         and        by
education facilities and water sources, and aiding decentralized institutional capacity
building(focused on the northernACs), which has proved to be successful insupporting
DAs, ACs andcommunities inassuming core responsibilities under the decentralization
agenda. These measures contribute to the CAS' emphasis on increasing support to
vulnerable groups andreducingpoverty.

V.       Appraisalof Scaled-upProjectActivities

16.      Although the project i s being scaled up, the program remains as originally
designed and appraised, and the PDOremains unchanged. The economic, financial,
technical, fiduciary and social aspects o f the activities to be undertaken with the
additional credit remain the same as inthe original project. CBRDP's global Economic
Rate o f Return (ERR) to the quantifiable benefits was estimated at 48 percent, with a
correspondingNet Present Value o f US$94 million. The ERR was found to be robust to
large changes inproject costs (20 percent) andbenefits (PAD, pg. 14).

17.      As no new types o f activities are envisioned, the original environmental category
(B)remains the same. The project will continue to observe relevant national andBank
safeguard policies and procedures, as outlined inan Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) documents,
both o f which were re-disclosed by the Government and the Bank during the AF
preparationprocess. CBRDP was found to be compliant with Bank safeguard
requirements at the MTR and the relevant framework documents were assessedas part o f
the appraisal process and found to remain applicable to the AF. An updated ISDS for the
AF was also approved and disclosedthrough the Bank's InfoShop on April 9,2008. The
task team andrelevant specialists will review the application o f the ESMF and RPF
duringthe first supervision mission following approvalo fthe AF to determine ifany
adjustments are recommended to improve their use and impact.

18.      The project will maintain and apply existing systems and procedures for all
procurement, financial management and disbursement arrangements for the additional
financing. The responsible Government executing agency remains the same and all
relevant and qualified staff at national and regional levels will continue underthe
additional financing. To date, the performance of these systems, procedures and staff has
been consistently rated satisfactory.

19.      A DesignatedAccount will be maintainedbythe project for the purposes o f
financing eligible activities and expenditures. Financial thresholds for submitting
Statements o f Expenditure (SOE) insupport o f Withdrawal Applications as specified in
the original operationwill continue to apply.7 Inaddition, for expenditures on sub-


  These SOE thresholds are $150,000 for expenditure o n Goods, $200,000 for expenditure o n Works,
$50,000 for expenditure on services of individual consultants and $100,000 for expenditure on services of
consulting firms.

project grants, (category 4 a), withdrawals will be on the basis o f Statements o f
Expenditure (SOE) below the equivalent o fUS$50,000, and for which the SOE will
include information on the identity o f the beneficiary community or user group and the
date o f their registration, inaccordance with relevant laws and regulations. For
disbursements under Category 4 a, to the District Assembly (DA), the name o f the DA
will also be indicated inthe SOE. Further, copies o fthe bank statement o fthe
DesignatedAccount and a reconciliation statement for this Account should be submitted
with each Application o freplenishment. DAs will maintain district-level advance
accounts (AAs) o f up to a maximum o f US$ 50,000.8 These AAs, which are on a 90-day
rollingretirement basis, are an essential element o f the block-grant mechanism
established under the project and support the on-going financing o fpublic works at local
government level^.^ Project management will report andreview these balances monthly,
and send this information to the Bank task team. Appropriate remedies will be applied if
the balances are not turned around in90 days, and upon closure o f the project, the
unspent balances should be refundedto the Designated Account. Detailed procedures for
this are being introduced inthe project implementation manual. Some early procedural
problems with these accounts have been resolved andDA FM andprocurement problems
have beenminimized over the course o f the project. No project audits are outstanding
and there has beenno significant delay insubmission or issues raisedwith past audit
reports. Furthermore, there have been no significant procurement problems encountered
or concerns raised inany supervision mission. The project has provided andwill
continue to provide capacity buildingsupport for relevant local government staff to
ensure appropriate application o f the relevant procurement procedures. National level
project procurement will continue to be handledby an experienced procurement
specialist inthe PMU. As mentioned inparagraph 13 above, the additional financing
would be governed by the Bank's Procurement and Consultant Guidelines o f M a y 2004,
as amended inOctober 2006.

20.     Regular and close supervision support on both FMandprocurement matters will
be maintained under the additional credit through qualified staff inthe Country Office.
Issues identified ina recent IAD assessment regarding possible double-payments for
AFD co-financed subprojects at DAlevelshavebeenaddressed. Open commitments
have beenclosed and a new withdrawal application reporting format has beendeveloped
to clearly indicate where Bank and AFD funding are co-financing a given subproject.

21.     The Government is strongly committed to the scaling up o f CBRDP to both help
respond to the floods inthe north and insupport o f the national decentralization action
plan." Development partners and the Bank's decentralization team" have recognized a
valuable link betweenthe CBRDP and the GoG's decentralization program and support


 The amount o f the advances to the District Assembly was recently increased from $20,000 to $50,000 for
those DAs where cash-flow and performance warrant, and conditional on prior Bank no objection.
 Current outstanding AA balances among all the DAs stand at an average of $4,170, and the average
amount o f time since the last replenishment i s 130 days.

continuation o f this linkage through the additional credit as a bridge to more formal and
systematic support being considered by the Bank. Alternative options for supportingthe
same activities were considered and rejected on the grounds that similar support could
not be provided inas timely or cost-effective fashion. The size and scope o f the
additional credit fit easily and efficiently within the structure o f the existing project and
the activities will be completed within 16months o f the original project closing date.

22.       Table 2 indicates how the additional financing would be allocatedby expenditure
category incomparison to the current project allocation. The vast majority o f the AF (86
percent) will go toward expenditure category 4.a. for subproject grants, which support
public works. The current estimated allocation for CBRDP takes into consideration a
recently authorized reallocation o f the original credit proceeds that increased category 3
(consultants, studies, training) by SDR 1.5 million, and category 5 (operating costs) by
SDR 1.5 million, andwhich reducedthe unallocated categoryby SDR 3 million.

23.       The task team proposes that IDA finance 100percent o f the cost o f activities
covered inthe proposed additional financing, as permittedunder the Ghana Country
Financing Parameters (taxes would be eligible expenditures). The team also proposes
amending the existing Credit Agreement to increase the IDA share o f financing to 100
percent for the remainingproject period to avoid inconsistency betweenthe two
agreements and potential implementation complications. The team concludes that
increasing the IDA cost-share would not adversely affect the achievement o f the PDO.

VI.       ProjectMonitoringand Evaluationand ExpectedOutcomes


24.       CBDRP has benefited from the systems, procedures and knowledge that were
built under the predecessor VIP. VIP's M&Esystem, however, included too manyoutput
indicators, and CBRDP initially suffered from this same weakness. Inparticular,



                                               10

CBRDP's M&E system, as described inthe PAD, i s overly complicated and assumes a
far higher capacity at community, AC, DA andregional levels thancurrently exists.
Initially, the project attemptedto establish the baseline for all sub-proj ect activities.
However, CBRDP's experience has highlightedthe fact that the demand-driven process
makes it difficult to establish targets for sub-projects. Therefore, expectations on sub-
project numbers, results, and project performance measures needed to be adjusted.

25.     Technical support provided over 2006-07 assisted CBRDP to simplify the M&E
system, byrevising the project ResultsFramework (RF) and streamlining the project
performance indicators (Annex 2). Work is ongoing to further improve data collection,
reporting andthe use o f monitoring information to measure overall project results. It i s
this refined RFthat i s proposed for application under both the AF and the overall project.

VII. BenefitsandRisks

26.     Project benefits remain as described inthe PAD. Inparticular, the AF will
continue to support outcomes related to improving livelihoods inthose communities that
benefit from investments financed under the project, and will support the decentralization
process through capacity buildingo f LGAs and relevant national departments.

27.     The main risks noted inthe original PAD, regarding (i)     weak capacity for project
implementation, (ii)   misuse o fproject funds by DAs, and (iii) o f financial
                                                                  failure
intermediaries to participate inrural enterprise promotion, have beenmitigated to a large
degree or proven less critical than originally thought. Nonetheless, given continued need
to buildcapacity o fnewly appointed DA staff,12 particularly inthe area o fprocurement,
the task team considers the risk related to weak local capacity and the potential misuse o f
project resources inat least some o f the LGAs to remainmoderate.

28.     Furthermore, the extension o f the project through the additional financing does
pose one new potential risk: that the Government could delay key decentralization policy
decisions given the continued financing under CBRDP. The risk is considered only
moderate, however, given: (i)   renewed andwidespread commitment from all parts o f
Government for the decentralization agenda; (ii)    active ongoing dialogue between GoG
and a large group o f development partners that support decentralization; and (iii)    the
relatively small additional financing that the CBRDP represents to the overall program.
To help further mitigate this potential risk, the task team will maintain close links to the
decentralizationworking group through both the Country Office focal point and AFD,
which co-finances CBRDP andplays a lead role inthe decentralization dialogue.

VIII. FinancialTerms and Conditionsfor the AdditionalFinancing

29.     The additional financing o fUS$22 million equivalent would be provided as a
Credit on standard IDA terms, with a maturity o f 40 years, including a grace period o f ten
years. There are no non-standard conditions o f effectiveness or disbursement, or new
dated covenants underthe proposed additional credit.
