SECOND JENGKA TRIANGLE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the further development of
land settlement, and the creation of a forest industries complex in the
Jengka Triangle. Loars totalling US$21.5 million equivalent are proposed,
of which US$13 million equivalent would be for land settlement and US$8.5
million for forestry. The Jengka Triangle, which lies approximately in the
center of West Malaysia, is the subject of Malaysia's first regional devel-
opment program. Under this program about 93,000 acres would be cleared of
forest, planted with crops - mainly oil palms and rubber, divided into
holdings of about ten acres each, and allotted to some 9,000 families.
A full physical and social infrastructure would be established in the
Triangle, including three urban centers. A forest Industries complex would
be created to utilize timber removed in the course of land clearing, and
the timber in those areas that would remain under forest in the Triangle
and adjacent forest reserves. A Bank loan of US$14 million equivalent
(533-MA) was made to Malaysia in 1968 to finance the first stage of land
settlement in the Triangle; this project, which covered 33,000 acres, is
being carried out efficiently and its target of settling 2,800 families by
1972 should be achieved. In the agriculture sector two other Bank loans
have been made to Malaysia, of US$45 million and US$10 million equivalent;
these were for irrigation development, principally for rice production.
Progress on these projects has been satisfactory.
ii.       The Second Jengka Triangle project consists of two sub-projects -
the Second Jengka Land Settlement Project and the Jengka Forestry Project.
A forest industries complex was not included in the First Jengka Triangle
project since arrangements for logging had already been made. The complex
is required now for the best use of the forest resources located on land to
be developed under both the Second Jengka Triangle project and the envisaged
third and final stage.
iii.      The proposed land settlement project includes the clearing of
about 32,000 acres of forest and the planting of about 16,800 acres of
oil palms, 13,600 acres of rubber and 700 acres of other crops, and the
settlement of some 3,000 settlers with their families. The proposed
forestry project would be the first to be financed by the Bank group in
Asia. It would also be the first integrated forest industries operation
in Malaysia. The project would consist of the establishment of a modern
logging and timber processing complex. Besides itself providing valuable
economic benefits and employment opportunities, it could lead, by its ex-
ample, to better utilization of Malaysia's large forest resources.
iv.       Total project costs are estimated at US$41.0 million equivalent,
including interest, of which US$28.6 million would be for land settlement



- ii -
and US$12.4 million for forestry. The proposed loan of US$13 million equiv-
alent for land settlement would assist in financing costs during the period
1970 through 1976 and disbursements would amount to about 45% of total
project costs including interest during the disbursement period. Remaining
costs would be met by the Government. The loan would include some US$5.8 mil-
lion of local costs. The proposed loan of US$8.5 million for forestry would
finance the foreign exchange costs excluding interest. Remaining forestry
project costs would be met by equity contributions by Majlis Amanah Ra'ayat
(MARA), a statutory corporation, and out of earnings. Procurement for both
land settlement and forestry would be on the basis of international
competitive bidding, although it is anticipated that local suppliers and
contractors would be the successful bidders for land settlement supplies
and works.
v.         The land settlement project would be implemented, apart from
Government infrastructure works, by the Federal Land Development Authority
(FLDA) a statutory Government corporation. FLDA is satisfactorily manag-
ing both the first stage Jengka project and some 80 other smaller settle-
ment schemes. Its financial management has not, however, kept pace with
its rapid expansion and certain steps will be taken, including the appoint-
ment of a Finance Director, to improve financial administration and
procedures.
vi.        The forestry project would be carried out by Sharikat Jengka
Sendirian Berhad (SJSB), a subsidiary of MARA and would be managed by
Cantrans Services (1965) Limited under a four-year management agreement.
vii.       The project as a whole should make a significant contribution to
Malaysia's economy, to its foreign exchange earnings and to alleviating
unemployment. All production from the land settlement project and a sub-
stantial proportion of that from the forestry project would be exported.
Net foreign exchange earnings are estimated at about US$160 million from
the land settlement project and US$32 million from the forestry project.
Annual foreign exchange earnings would be about US$6 million from the land
settlement project, and about US$3 million from the forestry project. The
economic rate of return on the land settlement project, based on current
estimates of long-term commodity prices, would be over 18% from oil palms
and over 11% from rubber. A sensitivity analysis shows that it is unlikely
that these returns would fall to below 9% for each crop. The rate of re-
turn on the forestry project is estimated at about 29%.  The two projects
would provide employment for over 4,000 persons.
viii.      The project is suitable for two Bank loans to Malaysia totalling
US$21.5 million. The Land Settlement loan would be for a period of 25 years
including 7 years grace and the Forestry loan for 12 years including 4 years
grace. Malaysia would on-lend the loans to FLDA and SJSB on the same terms.

SECOND JENGKA TRIANGLE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project appraised in this report consists of two sub-projects,
the Second Jengka Land Settlement Project and the Jengka Forestry Project.
The first would be the second stage of the Jengka Triangle Land Settlement
Program and would be carried out by the Federal Land Development Authority
(FLDA). The second would be the establishment of a modern forest indus-
tries complex in the Jengka Triangle. It would be carried out by Sharikat
Jengka Sendirian Berhad (SJSB), a subsidiary of Majlis Amanah Ra'ayat (MARA),
and would be managed by Cantrans Services (1965) Limited (Cantrans).
1.02      The Jengka Triangle Program is based on a comprehensive study of
the region by consultants (Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton and Hunting
Technical Services Ltd.). This was completed in 1967 and was financed
partly by a Bank technical assistance grant. The Master Plan prepared
by the consultants recommended the exploitation of the Triangle's forest
resources through a modern logging system and the establishment of timber
processing facilities, the planting of about 93,000 acres of oil palms
and rubber and the settlement of some 9,000 settlers with their families.
1.03      In April 1968 the Bank approved a loan of US$14 million to finance
the first stage of the settlement program (Loan 533-MA). Progress on this
project has been generally satisfactory. Exploitation of the Triangle's
forestry potential was, on the other hand, poor but in September 1969
an agreement was signed between MARA and Cantrans providing for the manage-
ment and operation by Cantrans of logging and timber processing in the
Triangle. In April, 1970 SJSB was incorporated to carry out the project.
In future the forestry and land settlement projects combined should produce
substantial economic and social benefits.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of a mission in August/
September 1969, consisting of Messrs. Whyte, Gold and Willems of the Bank
and Rowe of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
1.05      The Bank has made two loans for Malaysian agriculture besides
that for the first Jengka Triangle Project. They were of US$45 million in
1965 for the Muda irrigation scheme (434-MA) and of US$10 million in 1967
for the Kemubu irrigation scheme (500-MA). Progress on these projects
has been satisfactory.

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Malaysia's economy depends heavily on agriculture -- a sector
which generates about 30% of GDP, gives employment to over 50% of the
population in West Malaysia (and over 75% in East Malaysia) and provides
about 60% of export earnings. The dominant commodity in agriculture is
rubber, which alone provides 15% of total GDP, 55% of all agricultural
output and about 40% of total export earnings. Despite the importance of
the agricultural sector, agricultural products still make up nearly one-
quarter of the country's imports. Rice is now the major agricultural
import, and an average of 380,000 tons annually were imported in the period
1964-1967. Annual production had reached 700,000 tons by 1967 and devel-
opments in drainage, irrigation, double-cropping and new varieties may
eliminate imports by the early 1970's. Agricultural production as a whole
has been growing at an annual average rate of around 5.5%, which compares
with a population growth rate in Malaysia of about 3% per year.
2.02      The present area under rubber is some 4.4 million acres, of
which about 1.7 million acres are commercial estates, 2.6 million acres
are owned by smallholders and 130,000 acres are in FLDA settlement schemes.
Projections up to the year 1975 indicate there will be an increase in rub-
ber acreage of some 200,000 acres, which would raise the total area under
rubber cultivation to 4.6 million acres by that date. This change will
take place mainly as a result of increases in FLDA and smallholder culti-
vation.  Because higher-yielding clones 1/ are now being planted, total
production is estimated to increase from the level of about 1.1 million
tons of rubber at the present time to about 1.5 million tons by 1975. Of
the latter figure, estates are expected to produce about 725,000 tons,
smallholders about 710,000 tons and FLDA schemes about 65,000 tons.
2.03      Malaysia's heavy commitment to rubber production has led to
increasing efforts to bring about diversification of production within
the agricultural sector. Diversification into crops other than rubber
was emphasized in the First Malaysia Plan (1966-1970), in which the major
agricultural targets were identified as follows:
(a) an expansion of crops whose production would increase foreign
exchange earnings;
1/   High yielding rubber trees possessing other satisfactory character-
istics are selected and reproduced vegetatively. Consequently the
planting material, the clone, produced in this way possesses the
characteristics of its single parent, unlike seedling material which
inherits the characteristics of both a male and a female parent in
combinations not controllable by the plant breeder.



-3-
(b) an expansion of rice production in order to reduce rice
imports;
(c) the diversification of agriculture through the establishment
of new crop and livestock enterprises;
(d) the opening up of virgin land, now in jungle, which could
serve the joint purposes of adding to productive land and
reducing current levels of unemployment.
2.04      Current estimates of future agricultural production begin to
show the effects of this interest in diversified agriculture. For ex-
ample, there will be a significant increase in oil palm acreage and pro-
duction - total acreage under oil palm is expected to increase from
about 500,000 acres at present (of which FLDA schemes have 125,000 acres)
to over 800,000 acres by 1975, when FLDA schemes would account for about
307,000 acres, or 38% of the total. Production of palm oil is expected
to increase from 300,000 tons annually at present to over 750,000 tons
per year by 1975. FLDA schemes should be producing about 300,000 tons by
the latter date, which would make FLDA and its settlers the largest single
source of oil palm produce in the world.
2.05      The Plan authorities estimate that the value of agricultural
output as a whole has been growing at an annual average rate of 5.5% during
the First Plan period 1966-1970, although trends for individual products
have been appreciably different from those envisaged in the Plan. For
example, production of palm oil, fish and timber are ahead of Plan proj-
ections, while production of rice, copra and tobacco have fallen behind
the projections.
2.06      Although the dependence of the Malaysian economy on rubber and
increasingly on oil palms is recognized, a significant degree of diversi-
fication has not been achieved. The main reason is that Malaysia has the
skills and growing conditions to produce these two crops more efficiently
than other countries and should, therefore, continue to produce them in sub-
stantial quantities. Also, tree crops, which protect the soil from ero-
sion and facilitate the maintenance of soil fertility, are well suited
to the high rainfall and broken topography in West Malaysia. However,
extensive studies and experimentation are being carried out by various
bodies in Malaysia such as the Department of Agriculture, the Rubber
Research Institute of Malaya (RRIM), the Malaysian Agricultural Research
and Development Institute (MARDI), the Economic Planning Unit, commercial
firms and FLDA. Substantial yield increases have been achieved in maize,
sorghum, soya bean and tapioca but only on small scale experiments. Some
plantation companies have diversified successfully on a commercial scale,
particularly into cocoa inter-cropped with coconuts on the west coast of
Malaysia.
2.07      The element of diversification in the proposed project, while of
considerable importance, is not large in the physical sense (para 4.15),
but Bank assistance to diversified agricultural projects in Malaysia is



-4-
increasing. In 1965 and 1967 Bank loans of US$45 million and US$10 mil-
lion were made for the Muda and Kemubu irrigation schemes. These two proj-
ects should eventually increase rice production by over 500,000 tons a
year. The Bank is assisting the Government in developing a short term
credit system to provide production credit facilities for the Muda and
Kemubu projects and this could lead to assistance for longer term agricul-
tural credits in Malaysia generally. In addition, a livestock project is
now being prepared under the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
B. Land Settlement
2.08      Unemployment is estimated to be as high as 13% in the urban areas
of West Malaysia, and an unestimated but very high level of underemployment
exists in rural areas. With population increasing at an estimated 3%
annually, the need to create employment, bring about a more equitable dis-
tribution of incomes and promote economic growth has led to increasing
emphasis on agricultural development through land settlement schemes.
These schemes are carried out both by State Governments and by the Federal
Government through FLDA; in the period since it was established in 1956,
FLDA has been the main instrument for land settlement in West Malaysia.
The Federal Land Development Authority (FLDA)
2.09      FLDA was established in 1956 as an independent statutory
corporation with the duty and powers to "... promote and assist the in-
vestigation, formulation and carrying out of projects for the development
and settlement of land within the Federation." FLDA in practice enjoys
a fairly high degree of autonomy in the implementation of land settlement
schemes. A full description of the Authority is contained in Annex 1.
2.10      Table 1 of Annex 1 shows that up to 1963 FLDA developed 80,000
acres of rubber and oil palm and that over the next six years the acreage
tripled to some 257,000 acres, comprising 130,000 acres of rubber and 127,000
acres of oil palm. To date some 16,000 families have been settled and the
settler population on FLDA schemes is now over 100,000. Future plans call
for continuous expansion and Table 1 shows the estimated increase in FLDA's
planted acreage up to 1975.
The JenRka Triangle Program
2.11      As shown in Map 1 the Jengka Triangle is in the State of Pahang,
about 120 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur and close to the geographical
center of West Malaysia.   It covers some 300,000 acres of which 160,000
acres are being or will be developed, the remainder being occupied or re-
served for other uses.
2.12      The Bank has been closely involved with the development of the
Triangle since the plans were first conceived. In 1963 a Bank mission re-
viewed the potential and development plans of the Triangle and in 1965 the



Bank made a technical assistance grant of US$507,000 to the Federal Gov-
ernment to help finance the preparation of an integrated regional develop-
ment plan. The plan, published in 1967, is described more fully in Annex 2.
In April 1968 the Bank made a loan of US$14 million (533-MA) to help fi-
nance the first stage of the program covering some 33,000 acres. Progress
under the loan is described in paras 2.18 to 2.24.
2.13      The second stage of the Program would bring the total planted
acreage in Jengka to about 58,000 acres leaving some 35,000 acres for the
third and last stage which is expected to begin in 1972.
C. Forestry
2.14      The total forested area in West Malaysia is nearly 33,000 sq mi,
or 65% of the total land area. Man-made plantations have not as yet been
established on a commercial scale. In recent years there has been a rapid
increase in the demand for logs, sawn timber and plywood in both domestic
and export markets. Log removals from forest reserves and state lands
increased from 1.2 million tons in 1958 to 3.6 million tons in 1968, and
exports of logs amounted to Just under 960,000 tons in that year. By mid-
1968 there were 449 sawmills in operation which produced 1.4 million tons
of sawn timber in 1968; nearly 600,000 tons of this was exported. In the
same year 16 plywood mills produced nearly 225 million sq ft of which 150
million sq ft was exported. Details of production and export of logs sawn
timber and plywood are shown in Annex 18.
2.15      Despite its importance and potential, development of forestry,and
forest industries is still being carried out haphazardly and inefficiently
without regard for the sustained yield management of the forests or the
country's future timber needs. The Federal Forest Department has no
executive control over the exploitation of forests and State Governments
do not adequately supervise logging and processing activities. Much of
the merchantable timber (between 60 and 80 percent in many cases) has
been wasted in lands cleared for settlement; the issue of annual licenses
to individual loggers without relation to the processing industry has
led to a proliferation of undercapitalized and inefficient wood process-
ing operations and there have been substantial losses to the economy
through the export of logs and unmanufactured forest products instead of
processed timber.
2.16      The Federal Government has recently shown, however, that it is
aware of the need to improve the exploitation of forest resources. The
Government has asked States to prepare plans for forest exploitation and
these plans will be reviewed by the Government. The Federal Government
played a large part in concluding the agreement between MARA and Cantrans
for management of the forest resources of the Jengka Triangle (para 5.28).

2.17      MARA was established in 1966 as an independent statutory
corporation with the duty and power to ".... promote, stimulate, facilitate
and undertake economic and social development in the Federation and more
particularly in the rural areas." It is run by a council and executive
committee appointed by the Minister of National Rural Development, who at
present is also the Chairman of the Committee. It is organized into divi-
sions, each of which is under the control of an Executive Director. As
shown in Annex 19 MARA's activities are diverse. Their general aim is to
bring about greater participation of the Malay section of the community in
commerce and industry, but many of its activities are non-commercial (e.g.
training). MARA was made responsible for developing the Jengka Triangle's
timber resources in 1966. No formal agreement with the State Government
was signed, however, and the MARA subsidiary 2/ responsible for the operation
until Cantrans took over logging in early 1970, worked on annual licenses.
D. First Jengka Triangle Project (Loan 533-MA)
The Proiect
2.18      The project financed by Loan 533-MA was the first stage of land
development in the Jengka Triangle, and is confined to land settlement only.
The loan provides funds for the clearing of some 33,000 acres of tropical
rain forest, the planting of 23,000 acres of oil palms and 4,200 acres of
rubber, the settlement of 2,800 families, and the provision of a physical
and social infrastructure for the project area together with the necessary
crop processing facilities. The project is being developed over the period
1967 through 1974 and is being carried out by FLDA.
Comparison of Forecast with Actual Performance
2.19      Bar charts in Annex 3 compare actual performance with forecasts
at the time of appraisal. Although delays have occurred in a number of
schemes, the problems which caused these delays have been largely overcome.
'In Scheme V, the one scheme where felling and clearing operations suffered
more serious delays due to a poor contractor, planting began in April and
is expected to be completed before the end of 1970.
2.20      Delays in village, settler housing and infrastructural develop-
ment have followed the delays in planting. This lag has not created prob-
lems but efforts are being made to avoid such delays in the future and
supervision missions are checking progress carefully. Settlers began to
arrive on the project in April, 1970.
:L/ This cannot be translated literally. It means, however, an organiza-
tion devoted to the economic improvement of the people. In practice
MARA's activities are aimed at the economic development of the Malay
people, who, in contrast with the Chinese people have played, so far,
a minor role in the business and industrial sectors of Malaysia.

Costs, Loan Disbursements and Financing
2.21      Unit costs have proved to be within estimates, despite a general
slight rise in costs in Malaysia. Loan disbursements totaled M$5.3 million
(US$1.8 million equivalent) at March 31, 1970. Disbursements against fur-
ther expenditures to December 31, 1969 are estimated at about M$2 million
thus bringing total disbursements in respect of the period to the end of
1969 to about M$7.3 million. This compares with M$9.4 million estimated
at the time of appraisal. Lower than forecast disbursement reflects the
delay in non-agricultural works. FLDA has experienced no problems in
obtaining funds from the Government for project purposes.
Project Administration
2.22      FLDA has appointed adequate numbers of qualified staff to carry
out the project. The last senior position, that of Settler Development
Officer, was filled in April 1970 to coincide with arrival of the first
settlers.
2.23      Project accounts are satisfacorily maintained and are audited by
independent auditors (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.) acceptable to the
Bank. The audited balance sheet for 1968 is shown in Annex 1, Table 2.
General
2.24      The project is proceeding satisfactorily, no problems have arisen
in reporting and procurement, and the cooperation of the project authori-
ties with the Bank has been excellent. It was envisaged, however, that the
Bank would use the opportunities provided by loan 533-MA to effect improve-
ments in FLDA's overall administration, particularly in financial affairs,
and settlers lease and loan arrangements. Progress has been slow in these
matters and the proposed loan provides for further and quicker improvement.
These are explained in Chapter V.
III.  THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      The project area comprises the northwest section of the Jengka
Triangle, and the Tekam, Tekai and Berkelah forest reserves lying to the
north and northeast of the Triangle respectively (see Maps).
3.02      Land settlement would be carried out in the northwest section of
the Triangle. This area is undulating and the distribution of its soils
complex, thus requiring careful selection of the crop to be planted. Cli-
mate, with uniform temperature and plentiful and well-distributed rainfall,
is well suited to both rubber and oil palms, and these would be the main
crops established under the project.
3.03      Forest exploitation would take place in some 70,000 acres of
permanent forest in the Triangle itself, 65,000 acres of Tekam, 96,000
acres of Tekai, and 139,000 acres of Berkelah Reserve forests, and on



land to be cleared for settlement (see Map 2). Detailed inventories have
been made of the Jengka forests, and the remaining reserves are being in-
ventoried under the FAO/UNDP Forestry and Forest Industries Development
Project. Inventory results are expected to be similar to those of Jengka.
The Jengka inventories show the presence of hundreds of timber producing
species, including more than 120 species considered to be of commerical
importance. About 50% of the tree counted consist of species currently
used in the Malaysian timber industry. The remainder, mainly the medium
and heavier hardwoods, comprises tree species whose timber is not at
present generally used by the local industry but which, if processed, is
considered to have a high commercial value in the world market. With full
utilization of commercial species under the project, yields of about 18
tons of timber/acre are expected, and the total commercial timber content
of the project area is estimated at more than 7.0 million tons.
3.04      The project area has good access to the national road and rail
system with connections to Kuala Lumpur, Port Swettenham Kuantan and
Singapore. However, as stated in para 6.04, expansion of port and trans-
portation facilities will have to keep pace with development in the region
and elsewhere.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Definition
4.01      The project would comprise two interrelated sub-projects - a land
settlement project and a forestry project. It would be carried out within
the framework of a program for the integrated regional development of the
470 sq mi of land which form the Jengka Triangle. The forestry project
would utilize timber in permanent forests in the Triangle and adjacent
forest reserves, and would also enable the most economic use of timber
standing on land to be cleared for the land settlement project. Conse-
quently such land clearing operations would be coordinated with the devel-
opment of the logging and timber processing units which would form part of
the forestry project.
4.02      Land Settlement.  The land settlement project would comprise the
clearing of about 32,000 acres of land and its settlement by about 3,000
families. The project includes:
-    the clearing of about 32,000 acres of forest and the
planting and maintenance until 1979 of about 16,800
acres of oil palms, and about 13,600 acres of rubber;
-    the reservation of approximately 1,400 acres for the
development of a Regional Center;



- 9 -
-    the provision of villages, houses, offices and stores
to accommodate settler families and management and
support staff, together with appropriate roads, water
systems and educational, health and other social services;
and
-    the construction of a palm oil mill with an initial
capacity of 24 tons ffb (fresh fruit bunches) per hour
and the expansion of this capacity to 42 tons ffb per
hour;
-    the use of about 700 acres of the FLDA Research Center,
Tekam, for crop diversification trials on a commercial
scale.
4.03      Each settler would be provided with 10 acres of planted oil palms
or rubber, a house and a house lot of one-quarter acre. Settlers would
repay the costs of development as explained in para 5.14. The project would
be developed as seven schemes numbered 8 through 14 (schemes 1 through 7
being those in the first Jengka Project). Each scheme would have a village
containing some 430 settler families together with a small number of FLDA
and government officials and would be supplied with treated water, roads,
health clinic, primary school, etc. Each village would also have a postal
agency, police post and telephone communication. Secondary schools would
be provided for every two or three villages.
4.04      Forestry.  The forestry project would comprise a forest industries
complex adequate to efficiently extract, process, and market timber from the
Triangle, and the Tekam, Tekai and Berkelah forest reserves. The complex,
further details of which appear in Annex 20, would be established on 150
acres at the Regional Centers, and would include:
-    a mechanized logging unit with an annual extractive
capacity of 175,000 tons of logs;
-    a sawmill with an annual capacity of about 42,000 tons
of sawn timber (68,000 tons of roundwood equivalent),
and ancillary drying kilns, planer mill and impregna-
tion plant;
-    a plywood mill with an annual capacity of about 60
million sq ft (41,000 tons of roundwood equivalent);
-    steam generating plant, machine shop equipment, water
supply and other necessary facilities, and the construc-
tion of houses, offices and other buildings for manage-
ment and labor.

B. Detailed Features
4.05      Land Clearing and Crop Establishment.  The table below summarizes
the proposed schedule of clearing and planting which is detailed in Annex 4.
Mlarketable timber totaling some 430,000 tons would be extracted from all
areas prior to clearing. Of this the logging unit to be set up under the
project would handle about 330,000 tons, the remainder having been logged
by other contractors.

Rubber Planting                      -       4,540    -       9,070   13,610
4.06      Clearing of Scheme 8 of 4,800 acres, which would be planted with
rubber in 1970, has begun. FLDA's standard, and well-proved practice of
using contractors to clear the land, plant the rubber and oil palms and
maintain the plantings for up to twelve months after planting, would con-
tinue. Sufficient private contracting capacity exists for project purposes.
4.07      Development of Villages and Infrastructure.  A schedule of village
and infrastructure development is given in Annex 5. Settlers would arrive
oni the schemes 12 to 18 months after planting and would be used as labor on
immature areas until the plantings come into bearing. Village areas would
be cleared and houses constructed by contractors employed by FLDA. Provi-
slon of water supplies and construction of roads would be the responsibility
of the Public Works Department of the State of Pahang. Adequate private
contracting capacity is available for the clearing and building programs and
with assistance from the Federal Department of Public Works, the State Gov-
ernment of Pahang would be able to execute its part of the program. Fol-
lowing the initial phase of village development, other departments of both
Federal and State Governments would be responsible for providing the educa-
tional, health, postal, police and other community facilities and social
services.
4.08      Forestry.  The logging unit of the forestry project is now being
established. It will be able to handle 90,000 tons in the first year of
operation ending October 1970 and 175,000 tons in the second year. The
unit will be established and operated by Charnell International Consultants
Ltd., a Canadian firm of forestry consultants with overseas experience in
Taiwan, Peru, Fiji, and Guyana, under the terms of the management agreement
between MARA and Cantrans (para 5.29).



- 11 -
4.09      The processing facilities would be established over the next
four years by S.G. Gardiner Engineering Ltd., a Canadian forest engineer-
ing firm, under the Cantrans agreement. The saw mill would have an output
of 20,800 tons in 1970/71, 33,300 tons in 1971/72 ,and 41,700 tons in 1972/73.
The plywood mill would have an output of 36 million sq ft (1/4 inch basis)
in 1971/72 and 60 million sq ft in 1972/73.
4.10      Initially the raw material needs of the forest industries complex
would be met from timber extracted from land required for the land settle-
ment project. Forest exploitation schedules have been prepared which are
geared to land clearing schedules. Following utilization of timber re-
quired for both second and third (and final) stage land settlement proj-
ects, the complex would be supplied for two or three years from an area of
about 52,000 acres which would be retained as protective forests in the
Triangle. Thereafter these forests would be managed on a sustained yield
basis. The timber resources of the Triangle itself would be depleted by
thelate 1970's, and subsequently the complex would depend upon log sup-
plies from the nearby Tekam, Tekai and Berkelah reserves. The arrangements
for ensuring such supplies are discussed in para 5.27. The reserves should
be able to provide the complex's raw material needs for 20 to 30 years.
Regional Center and Other Towns
4.11      Under the first Jengka Triangle loan assurances were received
that a site for a Southeast town, one of the three towns (Southeast and
Southwest towns and a Regional Center) proposed in the Master Plan, would
be identified and reserved. Land has been reserved but no further devel-
opment has taken place since no demand has yet arisen. Meanwhile, it has
been decided that FLDA should be responsible for the development of a
Regional Center which would be situated in a central position at the inter-
section of the north-south and east-west highways (Map 1). About 1,400
acres have been reserved for the Regional Center; the forest industries
complex, Jengka Division headquarters, light industries and commercial
services would be established there in due course. Cantrans has earmarked
150 acres on which it would establish the forest industrial complex. In
the meantime, progress so far in the development of the Jengka Triangle has
already stimulated commercial activities in the villages and towns on the
perimeter of the project area.
Processing Facilities
4.12      Oil Palm.  A single mill would be constructed near the Regional
Center. This would open at a capacity of 24 tons of ffb 1/ per hour in
1974 and would be expanded to a capacity of 42 tons per hour in 1977. This
1/   ffb - the product of the oil palm, is a cluster of individual fruits.
Each fruit consists of a nut, which contains the palm kernel, sur-
rounded by oily flesh from which palm oil is extracted.



- 12 -
would be sufficient to meet the processing requirements of the project.
Any ffb produced prior to 1974 would be processed at the Ulu Jempol Mill
close to the project area. This is already in operation.
4.13      Rubber.  Rubber processing facilities for the second stage of the
project would not be required until 1977 and are not included in the project.
Until 1977 the small amount of rubber produced by the project would be pro-
cessed by other FLDA factories near the project area.
4.14      As required under Loan 533-MA, FLDA engaged a palm oil mill con-
sultant to advise on mill designs and specifications and to supervise con-
struction and operation of project mills. Assurances were obtained during
Regotiations that FLDA would employ consultants acceptable to the Bank to
design and construct the rubber factories required in 1977 and to advise
on their operation, as well as to carry out construction of the oil mill
required for the project.
Planting Material
4.15      FLDA will begin producing its own oil palm planting material
in 1970. However, breeding experts on the FLDA Research Committee, and
elsewhere, consider that further investigation into the yield potential
of this material is necessary before it can be accepted for planting on a
large scale. Consequently, assurances were obtainted during negotiations
that this material would not be used for the project planting unless it has
been proven under adequate field trials. Rubber planting material used for
the project would be Clonal material approved by the RRIM.
Crop Diversification
4.16      Since successful diversification is essential for the future agri-
cultural development of Malaysia and for FLDA settlement plans (paras 2.06
and 2.07), the project would include the establishment of 700 acres for com-
mercial scale diversification trials at the Sungei Tekam Research Centre.
These trials would be administered by FLDA, which would receive technical
assistance from such bodies as MARDI, RRIM and others who have been working
on crop diversification. A feature of the trials would be the use of
mlnimum soil disturbance techniques on which development work has been done
recently in Malaysia by a Louisiana State University team sponsored by
the Ford Foundation. The use of these techniques would be the key to
achieving diversification into non-tree crops, other than rice, in West
Kalaysia. It is anticipated that the crop rotations used over 50 acres
and upwards for any one planting would begin with a legume, such as soybean,
and be followed by a grain crop, either maize or sorghum. Other crops
tested would include groundnuts and cassava. All these crops are in domestic
demand.

C. Cost Estimates and Proposed FinancinR
Cost Estimates
4.17      Land settlement project costs over the full period of development,
1969-1979, are estimated at M$77.8 million (US$25.4 million) excluding
interest. About 51% of project costs are for agricultural development;
and are calculated on the unit cost estimates shown in Annex 6. These are
based on maximum costs for representative conditions which allow between
5 and 10 percent contingencies. Therefore no specific contingency has
been included in project costs other than for palm oil mills and staff
salaries for which 10 percent has been allowed.
4.18      Excluding social infrastructure, but including project area roads,
total development costs per settler family would be approximately M$25,000.
This compares with an estimated average cost of approximately M$22,000 of
providing similar employment opportunities on commercial oil palm and rubber
estates. While FLDA's development and procurement policies result in
relatively low costs in clearing, planting and crop establishment, its
costs of upkeep of immature areas are rather higher than on commercial
estates due to the need to pay subsistence to a larger number of settler
labor than would be needed on a commercial estate where the labor force is
more closely related to upkeep requirements.
4.19      Forestry project costs are estimated at M$38.1 million (US$12.4
million). The costs are based on estimates supplied by Cantrans and in-
clude a contingency allowance of 15 percent on plant, equipment and build-
ings.
4.20      The following table summarizes the local currency, foreign ex-
change and total costs for the settlement and forestry projects. Further
details are given in Annexes 7 and 21 respectively.

Proposed Financing
4.21      Because of the different nature of the two projects, the dif-
ferent terms proposed for the two loans, and because they would be carried
out by different authorities, a separate Bank loan would be made for each.
This would also facilitate disbursements and project supervision.  It is
proposed that the two loans would be made to the Government rather than
directly to FlDA and SJSB. The grounds for this are that, in the case of
FLDA, it is not financially autonomous and requires Government subsidies
for its operations; it is not possible therefore to establish conclusively
that it would be able to directly repay the proposed Bank loan. In the
case of SJSB, the forestry operations should be profitable and enable
SJSB to build up a strong financial position. But considering the newness
of the industry and the fact that SJSB is a subsidiary of MARA, which is
financed mostly by Government appropriation, it is preferable for the loan
to be made to Government. Both loans would be on-lent to FLDA and SJSB on
the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.
4.22      Land Settlement_Proiect.  A Bank loan of US$13 million (M$39.8 mil-
lion) would be made to the Government for the settlement project to assist in
financing project costs in the period 1970-76. About M$17.7 million (US$5.8
million) would be for local currency costs.  The loan, equivalent to about
45% of total project cost, would be sufficient to bring about necessary im-
provements in project organization and management. The loan would be for a
period of 25 years including a grace period of seven years, during which         l
interest estimated at M$9.2 million (US$3.0 million) would be financed by the
loan. The Government would on-lend to FLDA on the same terms. The period of
the loan is based on the settler's loan repayment periods, which would end
22 years after clearing in the case of oil palms and 24 years after clearing
in that of rubber.
4.23      The remaining project costs would be met by the Government.  Man-
agement costs would be met by Government grants unless, as explained in para
5.18, produce prices are at a level which would permit settlers to contribute
to scheme management costs. Development costs, which are repayable by set-
tlers, would be met by Government loans to FLDA on the terms set out in Annex
1, para 11. The Government would also meet the costs of roads, water supply
and social infrastructure, such as schools and health centers.
4.24      The following table summarizes the contribution to project finan-
cing to be made by the Bank and the Government:

4.25      Forestry Project.  A Bank loan of US$8.5 million (M$26.0 million)
would be made to the Government for the forestry project.  Because the
management contract had to be concluded and work begun on procuring equip-
ment for the project without delay if valuable timber were not to be lost
in land settlement clearing operations, an estimated total of US$450,000
will have been paid in management fees and some US$3 million committed on
equipment contracts, of which some US$300,000 will have been paid, before
the loan is signed. Retroactive financing of these amounts is included in
the proposed Bank loan. This equipment is being procured according to Bank
Guidelines. Since the project should generate sufficient cash to repay the
loan over a short period, the loan would be for a term of 12 years including
a grace period of four years to cover the period of disbursement. The Gov-
ernment would on-lend to SJSB on the same terms. The proposed Bank loan
would finance the foreign exchange costs of the forestry project amounting
to 68 percent of total project costs. Interest on the loan would not be
financed by the Bank as cash earnings from the project should be sufficient
to meet interest payments from the first year of operation. The statement
of sources and application of funds in Annex 25 shows that because of the
heavy incidence of expenditure in the first two years, additional financing
estimated at M$10.0 million would be required. This would be provided by
equity from MARA and Pahang State Government (para 5.33) and the remainder
would be met out of earnings. The following table shows the proportions to
be met by the Bank loan, equity, and earnings:

Procurement
4.26      Land Settlement.  Tendering for contracts for land clearing and
planting, buildings and housing construction would be on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. It is probable that, as in the first stage
project, local contractors would be the successful bidders for these works.
Palm oil mill machinery and construction and other equipment and materials
would also be procured through international bidding. Much of the palm oil
mill machinery and other goods are produced in Malaysia and a margin of
protection of 15% or the customs duty, whichever is less, would be allowed
to local industry.
4.27      Forestry.  Tendering for equipment and buildings for the forestry
project would also be on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Cantrans would be responsible for preparing specifications, tender documents
and contracts and for evaluating bids. Apart from buildings and smaller
machinery items which could be manufactured locally, most of the equipment
would be imported.
Disbursement.
4.28      Land Settlement.  A schedule of estimated Bank disbursements is
given in Annex 7. Disbursements would be made against FLDA expenditures
only and would follow the same procedures as Under Loan 533-MA. Thus, for
administrative convenience disbursements of 100% would be made against pay-
ments to contractors for land clearing and planting, planting and other
materials, buildings and house construction and palm oil mill construction.
The total is estimated at about M$25.4 million (US$8.3 million) including
contingencies. Disbursement would be made against shipping documents for
equipment, materials and supplies or, if procured locally, against 70% of
the on-site cost. The total is estimated at about M$4.8 million (US$1.6
million). Disbursements would also be made against recruitment costs and
salary for a minimum of two years of a Finance Director estimated at
M$300,000 (US$100,000). Any surplus funds remaining in the loan account
should be cancelled.
4.29      Forestry.  A schedule of estimated disbursements for the forestry
project is given in Annex 21. The Bank would disburse 100% of the cif cost
of imported equipment and vehicles against normal documentation, i.e.
suppliers invoices and evidence of payment and shipment. Disbursements
would also be made against the foreign exchange cost of the management fee
paid to Cantrans. Any surplus funds remaining in the loan account should
be cancelled.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Land Settlement Project
FLDA
5.01      FLDA's organization chart is shown in Annex 1.  The Authority
has a Board of thirteen directors including representatives of Ministries,
private concerns and the Commonwealth Development Corporation. The Chair-
man of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer. The next in line is the
General Manager. Since these are key positions, assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Bank would be informed and given an opportunity
to comment prior to any changes in them.
5D02      Recently FLDA has undergone reorganization.  This included the
establishment of eight departments including a Finance Department. Pre-
viously the Authority's financial affairs were combined with general admin-
istration under the then Deputy Chairman (Finance and Administration). As
explained in paras 5.21 to 5.25, the financial administration has been
deficient in certain respects and as a result both of FLDA's own recognition
of the need to improve its financial management, and of the Bank's continued
emphasis on this need, FLDA is to recruit a suitably qualified and experi-
enced Finance Director.   UNDP agreed to help find a candidate and finance
.Lis salary but responses to UNDP's advertisements were unsatisfactory. FLDA
is therefore trying to recruit a candidate by other means and the costs of
recruitment and salary for a minimum of two years are provided for under
the proposed loan. The initial appointment would be a condition of effec-
t.Lveness of the loan and would be subject to the Bank's agreement. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that subsequent appointments would
be made in consultation with the Bank. While FLDA is experiencing problems
in its administration and financial management, largely due to its rapid
growth, the standards of its field operations remain satisfactory both in
terms of quality and cost control.
Jengka Division
5.03      The Jengka Division was created to implement the Jengka Triangle
Program and has a large measure of autonomy and maintains its own accounts.
It has been responsible for carrying out the first stage project and it will
also carry out the second stage project. An organization chart of the
Jengka Division is shown in Annex 8.
5.04      The Jengka Division is headed by a Director who is responsible to
the Jengka Management Comwittee. The latter comprises the Chairman and
General Manager of FLDA, representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Minis-
try of National and Rural Development, MARA, the Pahang State Government
and the Public Works Department. The Division Director is also a member.
The Management Committee is responsible for policy decisions concerning the
Triangle's development and for implementation of the project agreements
between FLDA and the Bank.



- 19 -
5.05      The Director is supported by a Senior Administration Officer and
a staff of specialists at Division headquarters. They are organized in five
departments - Administration, Lands, Planting, Settler Development and
Engineering. The Division also draws on specialist staff and advisers at
FLDA headquarters. The Senior Planting Officer is responsible for manage-
ment of the first stage of Jengka and a Second Senior Planting Officer
will be appointed in 1971 to manage the second stage. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the initial appointment of the second
Senior Planting Officer would be satisfactory to the Bank and that the Bank
would be consulted before any subsequent changes in the appointment.
5.06      At scheme level a similar system of organization is employed, as
has proved very effective on other FLDA schemes with the difference that
a Settler Development Officer is attached to each scheme. These officers
and the Division's settler development department will train settlers in
agricultural and community development and operation.
5.07      At present Jengka Division headquarters are in Temerloh where
office accommodations and temporary housing have been obtained. Permanent
headquarters are being constructed over the period 1969-1972 at Sungei
Tekam, on the northern boundary of the project area.
Research and Training
5.08      The FLDA Research Center is located at Sungei Tekam.  The main
research priority at present is the development and production of oil palm
planting material (para 4.15). Experiments are being carried out on crop
diversification, and the project provides for commercial scale trials (para
4.16). The Research Center will provide FLDA with soil and foliar analyses
and other technical services. In March 1970 there were six full time re-
search officers and this number will be increased as the center develops.
5.09      FLDA recruits cadet managers direct from university, trainee assis-
tant managers from Serdang Agricultural College, and field assistants at
secondary school certificate level. The latter receive training at the
FLDA training centre. There are ample recruits at all levels and no diffi-
culties are foreseen in keeping up with future expansion. However, the
rate of development of FLDA has strained its sources of experienced manage-
ment. Cadet managers require a minimum of two years of in-job training and
assistant managers about five years before they are considered qualified to
become managers. For its program of 50,000 acres development each year,
FLDA requires 10 managers, 20 assistant managers, and 100 field assistants.
Potential managers for the next five years, therefore, should already be
in employment. Over the next two or three years, experienced managers are
likely to be in short supply, but steps are being taken to gear recruitment
to long term requirements. Current plans are based on a 1969 report by an
FAO consultant on FLDA's training needs. 1/ FLDA has a training division
which is responsible for running the Authority's existing training center.
1/   Assessment of Staff and Settler Training Needs of FLDA (FAO ref. TA 2724)
by Dr. M. M. Elgabaly.



- 20 -
It will shortly establish two more centers. The Jengka project has been
assigned staff of satisfactory calibre.
5.10      In addition to project management training there is also a need
to improve settler training. FLDA has experienced difficulties in main-
taining husbandry standards in cases where settlers, with little or no
agricultural experience, take over the running of their individual rubber
holdings. The greatest danger to the project from inexperienced settlers
;is in the exploitation of rubber bark reserves. This problem is receiving
close attention from FLDA management and is watched carefully by Bank
supervision missions. Its solution is the training of settlers to appre-
,ciate the dangers of uncontrolled exploitation of bark reserves, and
this would be done by the Settler Development Officers.
Settlement Procedures
5.11      A full description of settlement operation and administration is
given in Annex 9.
5.12      Settler Selection.  Settlers are selected from all parts of
M4alaysia though 50% of Jengka settlers must come from the State of Pahang
provided they have the minimum qualifications which include being a Malaysian
citizen, married, healthy, between the ages of 18 and 35 and the owner of
less than two acres of land. Selection is in two stages - settlers are
Eirst interviewed in their home district and a final selection is then made
at FLDA headquarters on the basis given in Annex 9.
5.13      Settlers' Agreements.  On arrival at a scheme, the settler signs
the first part of his agreement under which he agrees to work under the
direction of FLDA on the development of the scheme. At the end of the
fEifth year after palm planting, or the seventh year after rubber planting,
the settler, provided his performance is satisfactory, signs the second
part of his agreement, which changes his status from, in effect, an employee
of the Authority to a smallholder. In the case of rubber, he is allocated
a specific 10 acre lot and is registered as an occupier in expectation of
title. In the case of oil palms, the settler is allocated a specific 10
acre lot after five years of production, and he may then choose whether
to work individually or participate in a number of lots on a cooperative
or communal basis. When a rubber or oil palm settler has paid off his
loan, the State will alienate the holding to the settler on a 99-year lease,
less the period elapsed.
5.14      While the settler's loan is outstanding, his holding is adminis-
tered by FLDA.- The settler must sell all latex or ffb to factories or
mills specified by the authority and he receives payment from the Authority
after deductions have been made for transport and processing costs, his loan
and other charges. Each settler's loan account is debited with the cost of
his house, the development of his holding and any subsistence payments or
other charges, e.g., for tools. Interest at 6-1/4%, the standard rate on
all FLDA schemes, is charged and capitalized during the development period.



- 21 -
This interest rate, which falls between the interest charged by the Gov-
ernment at 5-1/2% and the current interest rate on Bank loans, is lower
than the present commercial cost of money in Malaysia of about 8%. The
loans are repayable over fifteen years commencing in the sixth year after
palm planting and the eighth year after rubber planting. Tables 1 and 2
of Annex 9 show the buildup of typical loan accounts. Other charges in-
clude land rents which are transmitted to the State Government, a replant-
ing cess and a management charge.
5.15      The settlers' agreements which were approved under Loan 533-M4A
required that Jengka settlers bear the full management costs incurred by
FLDA in both the development and operating phases of the project even
though incremental export duties and cesses would more than cover
management costs. Wlen these arrangements were agreed between the Bank,
FLDA, and the Government, price projections then being used indicated
that Jengka settlers would be able to meet these costs in full and retain
adequate incomes. Since that time, forecast palm produce prices have
weakened, and indications are that if Jengka oil palm settlers pay manage-
ment costs in full, resulting incomes would give inadequate incentives.
Rubber settlers could not directly pay full managenent costs if the prices
for rubber forecast by the Bank obtain, and if duties and levies are main-
tained at present levels.
5.16      Because of the new circumstances, the method of recovery of
management costs has been changed. Instead of a fixed charge on settlers'
production, which was to be levied on Jengka settlers only, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that FLDA would, by September 30, 1970,
levy a cess at a level acceptable to the Bank on all settlers. This cess
will be geared to settlers' incomes and will vary with produce prices and
the size of settlers' holdings. It will also take into account the Govern-
ment's policy that settlers should receive an average annual income of not
less than M$3,600 after meeting all charges and loan repayments.
5.17      The method of applying the cess and the rates to be charged were
agreed during negotiations. For settlers on 10-acre holdings, the oil palm
levy would start at M$1/ton of ffb at a palm oil price of M$440/ton FOB
(M$498 or US$166/ton CIF) and would increase by M$1/ton up to a maximum of
M$9.34/ton of ffb. The rubber levy would start at 1 M cent/lb at a rubber
price of 65.4 M cents/lb FOB (69.4 M cents or 23.1 US cents/lb CIF) and
would increase by 1 M cent up to a maximum of 6 M cents/lb.
5.18      With the future prices for palm products and rubber assumed in
this report, no cess will be payable (at present prices, oil palm but not
rubber settlers would pay the cess). However, as Annex 16 shows, the Gov-
ernment would indirectly recover all project costs, including management
but excluding social infrastructure, through export duties and cesses on
project production, loan repayments and import duties and other taxes.

FLDA's Finances and Accounts
5.19      Jengka.  The arrangements under Loan 533-MA included the estab-
lishment of separate accounts for Jengka and the preparation of quarterly
and annual accounts for the project. These accounts are satisfactory and
Annex 10 shows the audited balance sheet as at December 31, 1968. FLDA's
estimated sources and applications of funds for the second Jengka project
are shown in Annex 11. At the end of the period from the commencement of
the project until settlers' loans are repaid, 1969-1995, there should be a
cash surplus from the project of about M$7.8 million, which is the approx-
imate amount required to meet repayments after 1995 on Government loans.
5.20      FLDA.  FLDA's overall financial position is described in Annex 1
in which Table 2 shows the summarized balance sheets for 1964 through 1968.
FLDA's expenditures are financed in two ways - by Government loans (in-
cluding relending of Bank loans) for settlement development and by Govern-
ment grants for administration costs. The terms of current loans, which
vary between oil palm and rubber schemes, are given in Annex 1, para 11.
FLDA accounts to the Government for its expenditures on loan and admin-
istration accounts and the Government provides funds for both by way of
budget allocations. No difficulties have been met in obtaining funds
from the Government promptly.
5.21      Two balance sheets are prepared, one for administration account
(grants from Government for FLDA administration) and one for loan account
(loans from Government for settler development which eventually will be
repaid by settlers). Separate balance sheets are prepared for each scheme.
The form of FLDA's annual accounts hitherto has not clearly shown either
its financial position or expenditure on its activities. Expenses have
not been allocated properly and amounts recoverable from settlers have not
been separated from other development expenditures. The delay, discussed
below, in completing settlers' loan accounts has prevented showing the
loans made to settlers, and these will be shown when settlers' accounts
are completed.
5.22      So that FLDA's annual accounts show clearly its financial position
and operating results, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
FLDA accounts would be prepared in a form satisfactory to the Bank. In
future:
(a) An annual consolidated balance sheet will be prepared showing
FLDA's overall financial position;
(b) Amounts due from settlers will be shown when settlers' ac-
counts are completed;
(c) The annual accounts will show the results of FLDA's activi-
ties for the year, including proper allocation of expenses
and the profit or loss on self-contained operations such
as palm oil mills, rubber factories, and retail shops.



- 23 -
5.23      There have been prolonged delays in preparing settlers' accounts
for schemes other than Jengka and only a few are completed although a nunmber
of schemes are in production. This has been due in part to delays in complet-
ing the scheme accounts on which settlers' accounts are based. The annual
accounts for FLDA have also been late in preparation. To bring settlers'
accounts up-to-date as quickly as possible, FLDA is employing its auditors
to assist in accounting and clerical work, and assurances were obtained
during negotiations that settlers' accounts for all areas for which settlers
had begun loan repayments by December 31, 1968, would be completed according
to a timetable agreed with the Bank, and that other settlers' accounts would
be completed promptly thereafter.
5.24      A further important deficiency in ELDA's accounting system is the
absence of management accounting and budgetary control procedures. One of
the first duties of the new Finance Director (para 5.02) would be to in-
troduce such procedures and then, on the basis of expenditure budgets and
estimated receipts from settlers, prepare cash flow forecasts so as to
assess FLDA's future financial position. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that such forecasts will be submitted to the Bank by June 30,
1971.
5.25      Although as indicated above, much remains to be done to improve
FLDA's financial management, the Authority has made progress in this respect
since the last loan was appraised. Early in 1968 FLDA appointed Public
Administration Service (PAS) of Chicago to review its financial and general
administration. As a result of the PAS recommendations, the accounts de-
partment was reorganized and with assistance from PAS computerized processing
of settlers' accounts has been introduced. These measures together with
the appointment of a Finance Director, and the emphasis now laid by FLDA's
senior management on improving the financial administration, should lead to
considerable improvement.
Audit
5.26      The FLDA audit is carried out by Azman, Wong, Salleh & Co., a
Kuala Lumpur firm. The audit arrangements are satisfactory but the scope
of the work carried out has been limited in the past in that it did not
include some of FLDA's activities such as mill, factory and shop operations,
and included only a short form of report. These activities are now being
audited by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., and assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the audit report would be in a form satisfactory to the
Bank. Assurances were also obtained that the auditors would be acceptable
to the Bank. Under Loan 533-MA independent auditors satisfactory to the
Bank were required to be appointed for the Jengka project and Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell & Co. were appointed in September 1969.
B. Forestry Project
5.27      A new company, Sharikat Jengka Sendirian Berhad (SJSB), has been
formed to carry out and operate the forestry project. Annex 22 shows SJSB's



- 24 -
organization chart. The Board of Directors will have not less than 3 or
more than 15 members. Fourteen directors have been appointed; they include
representatives of MARA, Ministry of Rural Development, Treasury, Pahang
State Government, Pahang Development Corporation, and FLDA. A former MARA
official has been appointed Managing Director. An Executive Committee has
been formed to manage the day-to-day affairs of the company; it has 7 mem-
bers including the Deputy Chairman and Managing Director of SJSB, and re-
presentatives of the Treasury, Pahang State, MARA and FLDA.
5.28      The project will be carried out and operated initially by Cantrans
under a management agreement with MARA which was signed in September 1969
after two years of negotiations. In return for a management fee of Can$1.7
million (M$4.8 million), Cantrans will supply for a period of four years
starting October 1, 1969, consulting engineers, project management, purchas-
ing, financial and other technical services, and in general establish and
operate logging and timber processing in the project area. Cantrans will
also train Malaysians locally and in Canada with a view to their being able
to take over at the end of the four years.
5.29      As the organization chart shows, Cantrans personnel will fill the
important executive posts below Managing Director including Project Manager,
Financial Controller, Purchasing Officer, and heads of the Logging and Pro-
cessing divisions, who will be supplied by Charnell International Consult-
ants Ltd. and S. G. Gardiner Engineering Services Ltd., both Vancouver firms
associated with Cantrans. Cantrans and its associates have carried out
similar operations in other parts of the world, including Guyana and China,
and are well qualified. They have made good progress already in establish-
ing the industry. Because of the importance of experienced management,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that SJSB would employ consult-
ants acceptable to the Bank to carry out and manage the project and that the
Bank would be consulted before any changes in the positions of Managing
Director, Project Manager, and Financial Controller.
5.30      As explained in para 2.17, previous forestry operations in the
Jengka Triangle were on annual timber extraction licenses from the Pahang
State Government.  In order to ensure an adequate supply of timber for the
project, the State Government gave the following undertakings:
(a) No licenses will be issued in the Jengka Triangle other than to
MARA or SJSB and licenses will be issued to SJSB as and when
required;
(b) About 300,000 acres in the Tekam, Tekai and Berkelah Forest
Reserves would be set aside for logging operations by SJSB.
Licenses for these areas would be issued to SJSB on comple-
tion of logging operations in the Triangle.
(c) The forest areas will be adequately policed and supervised by
the Pahang Forest Department.



- 25 -
Finances, Accounts and Audit
5.31      SJSB's authorized capital is M$20 million of which up to M$13
million will be issued for cash subscriptions by MARA (M$10 million) and
Pahang State Development Corporation (M$3 million). Should the amount
required be less, the subscribers' cash contributions will be reduced pro-
portionately. An additional M$4.5 million will be issued in non-voting
shares to 1,800 timber license holders in the Triangle in exchange for
logging rights. These shares will be redeemed at par when SJSB has com-
pleted logging operations over 90,000 acres.
5.32      SJSB's estimated operating results, sources and applications of
funds and balance sheets for 1970 to 1974 are shown in Annexes 24-26. The
project is estimated to show an operating profit in the third year and a
profit of M$7 million in 1974. No provision has been made for income taxes
in the period since, although SJSB will be liable to tax, the availability
of tax depreciation allowances and possible pioneer status relief would
eliminate any tax charge.
5.33      The statement of sources and applications of funds shows an
estimated cash surplus of M$24 million by the end of 1974; annual debt
service on the proposed Bank loan would be covered 2.7 times by cash
earnings. The estimated balance sheet at the end of 1974 shows that the
debt/equity ratio would be 43:57. These forecasts assume equity contri-
butions of M$10 million in cash as this is the estimated amount needed
rather than the full M$13 million allowed by MARA and the Pahang State
Development Corporation.
5.34      The act which established MARA, provided that all monies earned
from any project financed from funds provided by Government shall be re-
tained in a fund to be administered and controlled by MARA. Apart from
a general provision that MARA shall ensure that its total resources are
sufficient to meet all sums properly chargeable to its revenue account, in-
cluding depreciation and interest, MARA can dispose of the fund in any
manner consistent with its purposes under the Act. Therefore, in order to
ensure that sufficient funds are retained from the operations of the
forestry project to finance the construction of the project and meet debt
service obligations, assurances were received during negotiations that
SJSB would not distribute any profits before the Closing Date of the Bank
loan without the prior approval of the Bank, and thereafter unless adequate
provision has been made for meeting SJSB's obligations including debt
service. Assurances were also obtained that SJSB would not incur any in-
debtedness over US$100,000 in the aggregate without the prior approval of
the Bank.
5.35      Under the agreement between Cantrans and MARA, Cantrans has
appointed a project controller to set up, control and supervise all
accounts of the project, control all expenditures, manage all bank
accounts, and in general undertake financial direction of the project.
He will also prepare, not less than quarterly, comprehensive financial
reports on the project. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
copies of such accounts would be transmitted to the Bank. Assurances were



- 26 -
also obtained that the accounts would be audited annually by a firm of
auditors satisfactory to the Bank and that copies of the accounts and
auditors' report would be sent to the Bank not later than four months
after the close of each financial year.
VI. PRODUCTION. MARKETS, PRICES AND OPERATING RESULTS
A. Yields and Production
Land Settlement
6.01      Project yield estimates are based on current FLDA and commercial
experience. Annex 12 shows the estimated annual yields per acre from oil
palms and rubber. At full production the project would yield some 36,000
tons of palm oil, 8,000 tons of palm kernels and 9,000 tons of rubber a
year. These figures compare with estimated total Malaysian production in
1975 of 750,000 tons of palm oil and 1.5 million tons of rubber.
Forestry
6.02      The logging unit would have an annual output of 175,000 tons by
1970/71 when it would reach full production. Of this approximately 108,000
tons would be utilized by the sawmill and plywood mill the remainder being
sold locally or exported. The annual output of the sawmill at full produc-
tion would be 41,700 tons and that of the plywood mill 60 million sq ft,
1/4 inch basis.
B. Markets and Prices
Oil Palm
6.03      Present FLDA oil palm production is marketed through existing
commercial channels. However, by the time FLDA's current oil palm devel-
opment plans come to fruition, it will be the largest producer of palm oil
and kernels in Malaysia and the world, and the Authority considers that for
commercial and economic reasons it should market its palm produce indepen-
dently. Under Loan 533-MA, it was agreed that FLDA should engage consult-
ants to study its palm oil marketing needs and that decisions on marketing
policy would be taken only following consultation with the Bank on the
consultants' and FLDA's recommendations. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has agreed to finance the study.
6.04      The ADB is also assisting in the finance of two palm oil mills
and the loan agreement with ADB stipulates that FLDA will develop its own
bulk installations and handling facilities at Port Swettenham. Construc-
tion is to start in 1970. Port Swettenham is experiencing considerable
congestion problems, and expansion of the port, financed in part by German



- 27 -
bilateral assistance, is under way. Since the development of transportation
to port and port facilities are most important to the project, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Government would consult with
the Bank on any plans for meeting the project's transport and storage
requirements. Similar assurances were obtained for the forestry project.
6.05      The market prospects and expected price trends for palm oil and
kernels are discussed in Annex 13. Until recently the growth in supply
rate of palm oil was low compared with other fats and oils amounting to
only 1.3% per annum between 1954/56 and 1965/67. However, current ex-
pansion plans are expected to increase the annual growth rate to over 5%
between 1965/67 and 1980, and to raise the share of palm oil production
in total fats and oils from about 3% in 1965/67 to 5%. Much of the addi-
tional world supplies of palm oil will be exported and absorbed by the
international market. In the light of expected declining world market
prices for nearly all major fats and oils and the need for palm oil to
increase its share of total usage, it is estimated that palm oil prices
will fall by the mid-1970's from the average 1969 price of US$179
per ton into a price range of US$155 - US$165 per ton cif. For cal-
culation of project earnings a price of US$160 per ton cif (equivalent
to M$480) has been used but returns from the project have been tested for
sensitivity at prices ranging from US$110 (M$330) to US$185 (M$555) per
ton cif, see Annex 17 Chart 1. The demand for palm kernel oil is more
inelastic than for most other fats and oils and although prices will prob-
ably fall they are not expected to fluctuate widely. A price of US$136
(M$408) per ton cif for palm kernels has been used in this report; this
compares with an average 1969 price of US$181 per ton.
Rubber
6.06      Present arrangements for marketing rubber through commercial
channels are satisfactory. FLDA is considering the possibilities of
directly marketing its rubber produce but in view of the already heavy
commitments of FLDA's management resources and the need to evaluate fully
any change in the present arrangements, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Bank would be consulted before any change is made.
6.07      The market prospects and price trends for rubber are reviewed
in Annex 14. In the period to 1975, consumption of rubber, natural and
synthetic, outside the Communist countries is expected to grow at 6.5%
per annum compared with a rate of 6% per annum from 1950/52 to 1968. If
natural rubber is to retain its share of total consumption, prices for
natural rubber will have to become more competitive with prices of syn-
thetic rubber. The present cost of producing polyisoprene, which is highly
competitive with natural rubber, is around 21 US cents per pound but tech-
nical developments might result in a reduction in cost to around 12 US
cents per pound. It is expected that, based on assessments of future cost
prices of synthetics, the price of natural rubber could fall to about 16
US cents per pound by the mid-1970's from the 1969 average price



- 28 -
level of 26.2 US cents. Over the longer term the price may continue at
about 16 US cents or fall further to about 12 US cents per pound, but the
latter appears to have low probability. For this report a constant price
of 16 US cents per pound cif (equivalent to 48 M cents per pound) is used
but returns from the project have also been calculated at prices ranging
from 12 US cents (36 M cents) to 20 US cents (60 M cents) per pound, see
Annex 17 Chart 2.
:Forest Products
6.08      Jengka forest products are currently being marketed by East
Asiatic Company (the Malaysian subsidiary of a Danish company) under an
interim agency agreement concluded in March 1970 with MARA. This agree-
ment will remain in force until a long-term agreement is concluded. MARA
iLssued invitations in March 1970 for provision of long-term marketing
services and MARA's Board of Directors is considering several submissions.
Based on the recommendations of a UNIDO expert and Cantrans, the Directors-
designate of SJSB have proposed the appointment of East Asiatic. The agree-
ment would be for 10 years (with termination earlier on prior notice by
either party) and would provide for the establishment of a Joint Marketing
Corporation owned equally by SJSB and East Asiatic. The Marketing Corpora-
tion would handle all local sales and East Asiatic itself all export sales
on 5% commission. Arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, such as the fore-
going, are required to be concluded prior to effectiveness of the Loan.
6.09      The market prospects for Jengka forest products are examined in
Annex 27.  Surveys and studies by FAO and other qualified agencies, in-
cluding the Bank, indicate an increasing world deficit in industrial wood,
particularly of broad leaved tropical hardwoods such as would be produced
under the project. The shortage is expected to result in higher average
prices since it could be met only by exploiting reserves of hardwoods
distant from convenient shipping points, and by the increased use of
species not commonly utilized at present. The Jengka project would benefit
from this since it would be located close to the national road and rail
network providing transportation to Port Swettenham and Singapore. An
ongoing UNDP financed study of forestry and forest industries development
in Malaysia concludes that the demand for West Malaysian timber, in both
log and processed form, from both the domestic market and export markets
in North America, the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia will outstrip
supply by 1972. Thereafter exports, which are expected to increase by
10% annually to 1972, should decline sharply due to increasing domestic
demand, and a basic shortage of timber.
61.10     In project projections an initial price of M$45/ton and a long-
term price of M$48lton have been used for log sales. These are based on
existing prices for Jengka species and are conservative since they take no
account of the almost inevitable future rise in tropical hardwood prices.
EIt is anticipated that disposal in log form will decline as the world deficit
in broad leaved hardwoods develops and that the bulk of project sales will
be in the form of sawn wood and plywood. Almost any species yielding satis-
factory lumber can be exported as sawn wood provided that volumes are suffi-
ciently large, and that steady supplies are available to accustom users to



- 29 -
the characteristics peculiar to the species. Project operations covering
large areas of forest annualy should make even scarce species available in
adequate quantity, and some 50% of timber available would be of well accepted
species such as Keruing and Red Meranti which now make up about 80% of all
Malaysian exports. A broad range of ex-mill prices is anticipated for the
species found in the project area, and an average ex-mill price of M$196/ton
for both export and domestic markets is used in project calculations. This
is in line with prices now being obtained for a comparable range of species
and grades.
6.11      The United States is the largest potential customer for Malaysian
plywood and veneer. Canada and the US are the only large customers for
veneer at present, but restricted log exports from Southeast Asia could
bring Japan, Taiwan and Korea into the veneer market. A comparatively
large domestic market, anticipated to run at about 100 million sq ft by
1975, the availability of species with adequate technical qualities for
plywood and species with the attractive appearance necessary for facing
export plywood should facilitate the disposal of project produced plywood.
In this report an estimated ex-mill price for plywood of all grades of
M$200/thousand sq ft has been used. Prices as high as M$260/thousand sq
ft are obtained currently.
C. Settlers' Income
6.12      Because of fluctuating commodity prices and the difficulty of
projecting prices over the long lifetimes of the two crops, it is hard to
estimate what settlers will actually earn. Settlers' incomes are also deter-
mined by the size of holding that the average family can manage efficiently.
The maximum size of holdings of either crop that the average family can
manage is about 10 acres and thus there is little scope for improving in-
comes by increasing holding size without the employment of non-family
labor.
6.13      Statements of estimated settlers income from oil palm and rubber
holdings are shown in Annex 15. At the prices assumed of M$480 (US$160) per
ton cif for oil palm and 48 M cents (16 US cents) per pound cif for rubber,
the settler's income from rubber would be considerably lower than that from
oil palm, and because of the longer development period, the rubber settler's
loan repayments would be higher. Nevertheless, the annual net income from
rubber of over M$1,600 in years 11-19 compares with about M$1,500 earned
by the average estate worker. The estimated income from oil palms would
be much higher, with a maximum of M$4,400 and an average over the loan
repayment period of about M$3,500.
6.14      While the difference between estimated settlers' incomes from the
two crops appears extreme, quite minor price changes could change the pic-
ture radically. Thus an increase in the rubber price and a drop in palm
oil price of 12.5% in each case from Bank forecast levels would result



- 30 -
in approximate equality of incomes from oil palms and rubber. At the cur-
rent rubber price, a settler's income would be about M$4,200 a year at
full production and settlers are as keen to settle on rubber as on oil
palm schemes. In Malaysia the planting industry, which is vitally concerned
with investment profitablity, considers that a fall in the price of rubber
to 16 US cents per pound is less likely than a drop in palm oil price to
below US$160 per ton. For this reason FLDA and the Government is continuing
to include rubber in its settlement programs and the plantation industry is
still undertaking the replanting and new planting of rubber.
D. Government Revenues
6.15      Annex 16 shows that revenues to the Government from the land
settlement project would exceed government outgoings on loans for develop-
ment, grants for administration and management, and road construction and
maintenance. Government revenues would mainly comprise loan repayments
from FLDA and export duties and cesses on oil palm and rubber.
6.16      Most of the cash earnings from the forestry project, which are
estimated at over M$7.0 million a year after debt service from 1974, would
accrue to the Government through MARA. The Pahang State Government would
receive revenues through dividends on the Pahang State Development Corpor-
ation's holding, and in royalties and premiums which by 1974 would amount
to about M$1.8 million a year.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Land Settlement
7.01      The project would produce substantial economic and social bene-
fits through the settlement of some 3,000 families and the establishment
of high-yielding crops. It would provide employment and satisfactory in-
comes for settlers who would be drawn from the large number of unemployed
or underemployed peoples of Malaysia, and would utilize unexploited forest
lands. All production would be exported and the total value of exports
over the life of the project is estimated at about US$160 million. After
all plantings come into bearing the average annual value of production
based on the prices assumed for the report would be about US$7.2 million
- sufficient to cover debt service on the proposed Bank loan over five
times.
7.02      Annex 17 shows the calculation of the economic rate of return on
typical oil palm and rubber schemes. Using CIF prices of M$480 per ton
for palm oil, M$408 per ton for palm kernels and 48 N cents for rubber,
the returns are estimated at 18.3Z for oil palm and 11.1% for rubber. The
financial rates of return are about 16% and 9% respectively. The difference
between the two returns appears high but the decision to plant rubber is
justified by the following considerations:



- 31 -
- sub-optimum yields would be obtained from oil palms
planted on the areas scheduled for rubber since the
soils of these areas are not suited to oil palms,
and the consequent rate of return from oil palms
would be about the same as that from rubber;
- while the rubber areas could be left under forest,
no returns would be obtained from this land during
the next 50 years or so - the time needed for the
forest to regenerate a commercial volume of timber
following the exploitation envisaged under the
forestry project;
- Government plans for settling large numbers of un-
employed or underemployed persons on the land could
not be achieved if rubber were excluded from settle-
ment programs;
- experience on other FLDA schemes has shown that rubber
is well suited to the capabilities of settlers and
method of settlement.
7.03      To test the sensitivity of the rates of return to variations in
prices, the returns have been calculated at prices ranging from US$110
(M$330) to US$185 (M$555) per ton for palm oil and from 12 US cents (36
M cents) to 20 US cents (60 M cents) per pound for rubber. The returns
are plotted in the charts to Annex 17 and are summarized below:
Oil Palm                  Rubber
US$/ton     %         US cents/lb        Z
110      9.8              12          7.8
135     14.4              14          9.3
160     18.3              16         11.1
185     21.2              18         12.7
20         14.0
Forestry
7.04      The forestry project would yield substantial economic benefits,
would provide employment for about 1,200 people, would systematically and
efficiently exploit the forest resources in the project area and would
provide net foreign exchange earnings estimated at US$32 million over the
period to 1980. Furthermore, the establishment of an efficient and profit-
able forestry complex in the Jengka Triangle together with the development
of markets for Malaysian forest products could lead through its demonstra-
tion effect to better utilization in future of Malaysia's other forest
resources.



- 32 -
7.05      The calculation of the economic rate of return on the project,
which is similar to the financial rate of return is shown in Annex 25.
It is based on project earnings for the period to 1980, by which time the
processing machinery would be near the end of its useful life, and on the
price assumptions given in paras 6.10 and 6.11. The rate of return is
estimated at 29.2%.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The project is technically, economically and financially sound and
suitable for Bank loans totalling US$21.5 million, US$13 million being for
the Second Jengka Land Settlement Project for a period of 25 years including
7 years grace, and US$8.5 million for the Jengka Forestry Project for 12
years including 4 years grace. The main assurances obtained during negotia-
tions were:
(a)  Land Settlement Project
(i)  that the Bank would be informed prior to any changes
in positions of Chairman and General Manager (para
5.01) and Finance Director (para 5.02);
(ii) that FLDA would, by September 30, 1970, levy a cess on
all settlers at a level acceptable to the Bank for re-
covery of scheme management costs (para 5.16);
(iii) that FLDA would prepare and submit to the Bank a forecast
of its cash flows by June 30, 1971 (para 5.24).
(b) Forestry Project
(i)  that SJSB would employ consultants acceptable to the Bank
and inform the Bank before any changes in the positions
of Managing Director, Project Manager and Financial Con-
troller (para 5.29);
(ii) that SJSB would not distribute any profits before the Clos-
ing Date without the prior approval of the Bank and there-
after unless adequate provision has been made to meet its
obligations; also that SJSB would not incur debt over
$US100,000 in aggregate without the prior approval of the
Bank (para 5.35);
8.02      The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the Bank
loans:
(i) Land Settlement Project. Appointment of a Finance Director
satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.02);
(ii) Forestry Project. Conclusion of long-term marketing arrangments
satisfactory to the Bank (para 6.08).

MALAYS IA
SECOND JETIG11h TRIAITGLE PROJECT
THE FEDERAL LAND DEVELOPmENT AUTHORITY
BACKGROUND
1.        The Federal Land Development Authority (FLDA) was established under
the Land Development Ordinance of 1956 with the duty to "promote and assist
the investigation, formulation and carrying out of projects for the develop-
ment and settlement of land within the Federation."
2.        From 1957 through 1960 FLDA's functions were twofold.  First, it
made available Federal resources, principally financial, to State Governments
for approved land development schemes, of which 114 were financed by FLDA in
this period. Second, the Authority itself undertook the development of 15
schemes totalling some 15,000 acres on which 2,900 settler families had been
settled by the end of 1960.
3.        Partly because of difficulties of coordination between the many
State and Federal departments and agencies responsible to their several
ministries, progress was slow. However, many important lessons were learned
and, when in 1961 the Federal Government launched its development program
under the 1961-1965 five-year plan, in which the highest priority was given
to rural development, FLDA was chosen as the chief agency for planning and
implementing settlement schemes. Thus FLDA abandoned the role of "loans
board" for State Corporations and became directly responsible for the planning,
development, financing, and administration of schemes and for coordinating
the work of all Government agencies associated with it in settlement develop-
ment. The FLDA organization was strengthened by the addition of technical
and administrative staff, the reorganization of head office sections and the
establishment of a regional office in each of the States of West Malaysia.
4.        FLDA's performance since its reorganization has been impressive
and Table 1 shows the rapid increase in planted acreage to a total of 257,000
at the end of 1969.  The Authority's administration, particularly financial,
has not kept pace with this growth, but a recent reorganization together with
the appointment of a Finance Director and the attention now being paid by
FLDA's top management to its administrative and financial problems should lead
to an early improvement. In all the FLDA is fulfilling a vital role in
agricultural development, the settlement of people, and the creation of jobs.
ORGANIZATION
5.        FLDA's new organization is shown in Chart 1.  Previously there
were two Deputy Chairmen, one responsible for Development and the other for
Administration (including Finance), who reported to the Chairman. In practice,
however, some departments tended to report directly to the Chairman. The new






ANNEX 1
Page 2
organization should be more efficient through increased delegation, and more
clearly defined functions and functional responsibility.
6.        The Ministry of National and Rural Development is responsible for
FIDA. The Board of FLDA numbers 13 and includes representatives of appropriate
ministries, private concerns and the Commonwealth Development Corporation.
There are three committees which help guide the Board: (a) technical in-
vestigation and planning, (b) finance and (c) establishment.
7.        The Chairman is the chief executive officer. The present Chairman
has been in the post for over 10 years. NIext in line to him is the General
Manager under whom there are nine departments - Finance, Administration,
Projects, Settlement, Planting, Processing, Marketing, Research, and the
Jengka Division. Directors have been or will be appointed to all but Admin-
tration, Projects, and Processing, which in the meantime work to the General
Manager.
8.        Also reporting to the General Manager are the Regional Offices, of
which there are eight. N6minally the Regional Secretaries, assisted by
Group Managers, are responsible for the schemes in their regions but in
practice the schemes are controlled by FLDA headquarters. FIDA intends to
increase the powers and responsibilities of the regional offices in future,
probably on the pattern established for Jengka.
FINANICE
9.        Finance for FLDA is obtained, except for the on-lending of Loan
533-MA and an initial loan from CDC, from Governmient budget allocations. In
addition, funds are allocated, for roads and water supply for example, which
are not within FLDA's accounting but which are expended by the Government
agency concerned wsith the agreement of FIDA. The Government budget allo-
cations to FIDA are made in two forms - grants for Administration and loans
for Settlement Development.
10.       Summarized audited balance sheets for the five years 1964-68 are
shown in Table 2. As at December 31, 1968, the Government loan account
totalled M$185.7 million and the administration account M$52.1 million. FIDA's
total capital, accumulated net income and reserves were M$277.8 million,
nearly three and a half times the total at the end of fiscal year 196k.
11.       The terms of Government loans are as follows:
(a) Schemes in existence at December 31, 1968:
-   Interest at 5%;
-   Interest free for first four years after drawing;
-  Simple interest for next six years;
-  Repayment over next 15 years.
(b) Nlew oil palm schemes after January 1, 1968:
-   Interest at 5 1/2%;
-   Interest free for first fcur years after drawing;
-  Simple interest for next two years;
-  Repayment over next fourteen years.



ANNEX 1

(c)  New 'rubber schexis after January 1, 1968:
- Interest at 5-1/2%;
- Interest free for first four years after drawing;
- Simple interest for next six years;
- Repayment over next fifteen years.
12.       The loan from CDC was signed in 1958 for an amount of M$5.1
million. Interest is at 6-3/4% and repayment is over 25 years commencing
in March 1970.
13.       M$ 5.3 million was drawn under Loan 533-MA up to March 31, 1970.
Interest is at 6-1/41O and repayment is over 12 years after 5 years grace.
14.       The terms of loans to settlers are detailed in Annex 9.   Interest
is at 6-1/4% and repayment is over 15 years from the 6th year after planting
of oil palms and the 8th year after planting of rubber.
ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATION AND SYSTEX
15.       FLDA's accounts are split between administration and loan items,
the basic difference being that administration is paid for by Government grants
while loan items, which include the costs of clearing, planting, upkeep,
house-lot clearing, house construction and subsistence loans, are financed
by Government loan and are repayable by the settlers. The loan account is
a consolidation of all development costs charged to schemes, and separate
accounts are kept for each scheme.
16.       FLDA's accounting organization and procedures failed to keep pace
with its rapid expansion and it was not until recently that FLDA began to
appreciate the need for a proper system of accounting and financial control.
Early in 1968 FIDA appointed Public Administration Service (PAS) of Chicago
to carry out a "General Reconnaissance of the Financial and General Adminis-
tration of FLDA."  The PAS report, subrni-.ted in January 1969, concluded that
the financial administration was inadequate to handle SPLDA's present and future
financial and accounting problems. The principal shortcomings were:
(a) the breakdovm of bookkeeping procedures for current work on
settlerst accounts, e.g., loans for housing and subsistence
and loan repayments;
(b)  the lack of progress in allocating development costs to
settlers and in establishing settlers loan accounts;
(c) the delay in preparation of scheme accounts;
(d) the lack of a costing and budgetary control system for
FIDA as a whole, mills and factories, development, etc.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
17.       As a result of the PAS report, FIDA's own growing awareness of
the problem and successive reports and recommendations from Bank missions5
FLDA has taken the following steps to improve its financial administration
and accounting system:
(a) With the assistance of a member of PAS staff, it developed
a system for computerization of the accounts. The accounts
will be processed by International Computer Leasing Kuala Lumpur.
(b) The financial functions were separated from administration
and placed under the responsibility of anewly created position
of Finance Director.
(c) The accounts department was reorganized along the functional
lines recommended by PAS.
(d) A timetable was drawn up and agreed with the survey department
and the auditors for completion of FLDA schemes and settlers'
accounts. According to this timetable, the audited FLDA
accounts for 1969 will be completed by the end of August, 1970.
The audited scheme accounts for 1968 will be ready by July 1,
1970. FIDA has also undertaken that settlers accounts for areas
in respect of which settlers had by December 31, 1968 begun
loan repayments will be completed according to a timetable agreed
with the Bank and that settlers accounts will be completed
promptly thereafter.
18.      These steps should lead to a considerable improvement in FIDA's
financial administration and accounting, but much will depend on the appoint-
ment of the Financial Director. The Finance Director will be responsible
not only for bringing the financial accounting, including settlers' accounts,
up-to-date but for developing and implementing a management accounting system
and financial planning procedures.
Audit
19.      The accounts of FIDA and schemes other than Jengka are audited
by Azman, Wong, Salleh & Co., a local firm. The Jengka accounts are audited
by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. Hitherto, the FLDA audit was not sufficiently
comprehensive in either the work carried out or the scope of the report and
the form of the final audited accounts could be improved considerably. How-
ever, all FLDA's activities, are now being audited and the scope of the audit
report has been improved.

SBCOND JENGKA TRIANGLE PROJECT
The Jengka Triangle Master Plan
1.        The project proposed for Bank financing is the second sta.e of a
program for the development of the Jengka Triangle, the Master Plan for which
was completed by Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton and Hunting Technical Ser-
vices (TAMS3-Hunting) and was partly financed by a technical assistance grant
from the Bank. The first stage of the program is being financed in part by a
Bank loan of US$14 million which was signed in April 1968.
2.        The Jengka Triangle is in the State of Pahang, about 120 miles north-
east of Kuala Lumpur in West Malaysia. It lies between the towns of Jerantut-
Maran-Temerloh near the Pahang River and near the railway from Kota Bahru to
Singapore (see Map). It covers some 300,000 acres (470 square miles) of which
about 136,500 acres are occupied or reserved in some way. The remaining
163,500 acres available for development and being developed consist largely of
undulating land divided by many streams and valleys. The climate is typical
of West Malaysia with an abundant and evenly distributed rainfall of about 90
inches per annum and mean daily temperature between 77°F and 800F.
3.        The undeveloped part of the Triangle is mainly under natural rain
forest which has been exploited haphazardly and inef'ficiently (para 2.15 of
main report). Rubber is produced on the periphery by smallholders and four
rubber schemes are being developed by FLDA near the Triangle. Oil palms are
grown on the east side of the Triangle at an FLDA scheme and on an adjacent
estate.
4.        Limited commercial and social services are provided at the towns
of Jerantut in the fioZth and Maran in the southeast. Temerloh in the southwest
is larger and is a centre of local government and urban services. Prior to its
development, the Triangle itself had no settled population.
5.        The land capability assessments made by TAMS-Hunting indicated that
about 93,000 acres would be suitable for either oil palms or rubber. Some
71,000 acres are definitely suitable for oil palm and the remainder, because
it has poorer soil and steeper slopes, would be more suitable to rubber. The
decision on which crop to plant also takes into account the price forecasts
for each.  The consultants' study and the appraisal for the first Bank loan
were based on considerably higher prices for palm oil than are now ccsidered
likely (Annex 13), and the original land use recommendations will not now be
followed. In addition to the main tree crops, fish ponds, rice, orchard and
garden crops will be developed by the settlers with technical assistance from
FLDA and as part of the Stage II Project about 700 acres will be used at the
Research Center, Tekam, for commercial scale trials of other crops, including..
animal foodstuffs such as maize and sorghum.s
6.        The Master Plan provides for the phased development of the Jengca
Triangle during the 12-year period 1966 to 1977 by means of FLDA supervised
smallholder development supported by the provision of rural and urban infra-
structure and services.   Under Stage I, a total of 33,110 acres have been
cleared of which some 23,800 acres will be oil palms and 4,200 acres will be
rubber (the original project consisted entirely of oil palms but on soil,
topographic and price considerations, the last scheme consisting of 4,200



ANNEX 2 - p. 2
acres was changed to rubber).  The develcpment of 30, 390 acres under the
proposed Stage II Project would leave some 35,000 acres for a further stage
or stages.
7.        It is estimated in the Master Plan that the population of the Jengka
Triangle would total some 105,000 people distributed by occupation as follows:
(a)  Settlers and families on new land                59,000
(b)  Settlers and families on existing FLDA
schemes being developed and which could
eventually be administered as part of
the Triangle Program                             13,000
(c)  Rural support (FLDA staff, health) etc.)         12,500
(d)  Towns (Government and FLDA staff, commer-
cial, forest industry workers, etc.)             20,00
104l500
8.        Proposed educational and medical facilities were based on the Con-
sultants recommended village size of 100 family units, whereas the Government
and FLDA decided that, in conformity with other FLDA schemes, the villages
would be of 400 family units. Each village will contain a primary school,
midwife clinic, community centre, religious building, recreation field, health
sub-centre and police post. There will be a secondary school for groups of
two to three villages and it is also expected that upper secondary schools, a
teachers' training college and a hospital will be added. There will also be
a full range of public services and utilities, including water supplies, sani-
tation systems, power, telecommunications, and government administration in
support of planned development.
9.        Full development of the Triangle as specified in the Master Plan
would require capital expenditure of about M$345 million (US$115 million) of
which FLDA's share would be about M$240 million (US$80 million). Experience
on the first two stages indicates that actual expenditure should approximate
to these totals.

2ND JENGKA TRIANGTE PROJECT
SETTLE=ENT OPERATION AND ADmINISTRATION
Settler Selection
1.          FLDA schemes are intended mainly for rural people who either
possess no land or have insufficient land to obtain an adequat'e standard
of living. Selection of Jengka settlers would conform to this policy.
2.          The Federal Government stipulates that 20% of places in all
FLDA schemes will be available to ex-members of the security forces posses-
sing the minimum qualifications. In the case of the Jengka Project, the
State of Pahang requires that 50% of the settlers (others than ex-service-
men) should be from the State of Pahang, provided they possess the minimum
qualifications.
3.          Selection is in two stages. First, applicants are interviewed
in their home districts throughout Ialaysia by FLDA staff and local offi-
cials who hnow the district and its people. At this stage the candidates'
general suitability is determined and the basic minimum criteria for selec-
tion applied. These are that the candidate:-
- is a Nfialaysian citizen;
- is married;
- has no serious criminal record;
- is physically and mentally fit;
- is prepared to abide by therules and regulations
established by FLDA;
- has less than two acres of land; and
- is over 18 and under 35 (formerly over 21 and
under 45).
4.          Following the interview, points are awarded to each candidate,
up to a maximum of 30, on the following scales:-
Age     Points      Age      Points        Age      Points
18       4          24        10           30         6

5.          The final selection is made by FIDA Headquarters on the
above points system and the required allotment of places to servicemen.
Development Period
6.          On arrival at a scheme - some 2 years after clearing - the
settler signs the first part of the settlers agreement. This provides
that in return for being permitted to settle on the scheme, the settler
works under the direction of the Authority on the development of the
scheme.  The settler is paid a minimum of M$ 2.90 per day, about M$ 70
a month, for his iwork and if no work is available, he receives a subsisb.
ence loan at the same rate.  The settler is required to abide by all
rules and regulations of the Authority and if he breaks them, or if he is
considered unsuitable in conduct or behaviofr, he may be required to leave
the scheme.
Post Development
7.          At the end of the 5th year after palm planting and the 7th
year after rubber planting the nettler, assuming his performance is
satisfactory, signs the second part of his agreement - the Supplement
Agreement. This changes the status of the settler from, in effect, an
employee of the Authority to that of a smallholder.  He is registered
as an occupier in expectation of title of approximately 10 acres of
rubber or oil palm and a 1/4 acreihouse lot. In the case of rubber,
the settler is allotted a specific area but in the case of oil palm,
because it is not practical to cultivate oil palms initially as small-
holdings, on schemes other than Jengka he is not allocated a specific
area. Once the settler has paid off his loan (see below) the Authority
will recommend to the State Govern4nent that the State alienate to the
settler, in the case of rubber, tht 10 acre rubber area and 1/4 acre house
lot, and in the case of oil palm the 1/4 house lot, on a 99-year lease.
The 10 acre oil palm area will be %lienated to a Co-operative Society
./.. .



ANNEX 9
Page 3
of which the settler is a member. In the case of Jengka, however,
it is provided that after five years of production, the settler would
be allotted a specific 10 acre lot and he would then choose whether
to work his lot individually or participate in a number of lots on a
co-operative basis.
8.          During the period when any loan repayments or charges are
due by the settler to the Authority or the State, the area is managed
and administered by the Authority.. At all times the settler is required
to sell all latex or ffb to factories or mills specified by the Authority
for which he shall receive the average price received by the Authority
(during the current month for rubber but over the preceding three months
for palm oil) after deducting transport, processing, distribution, mill
amortization, etc. In the case Af oil palm, further deductions are made
for upkeep costs and a replanting reserve fund; for rubber the upkeep
costs are borne directly by the settler and a replanting reserve cess is
recovered at export.
9.          Under Loan 533-MA, it was also provided that Jengka settlers
would bear the project headquarters and scheme managements costs during
the development and operating periods. This arrangement has since been
altered and instead FLDA and the Government will introduce arrangements
to recover FLDA's administration costs from settlers as a who;e (pafa
5.16 of main report).    The amount of the levy for 10-acre oil palm and
rubber holaings is showin in Table 5.
Settlers Loans
10.         A loan account would be opened for each settler which would
be charged with the cost of his house, including clearing the house lot
and of developing 10 acres of oil palms or his specific 10 acre rubber
lot. At the end of the fifth year after oil palm planting and the
seventh year after rubber planting, settlers would be issued with a
statement showing the amount of the loan and the repayment due. The
statements would also include any loans for subsistence, tools, etc.
11.         Interest would be charged at 6-1/4% on the loan and would be
capitalized over the development period. The attached tables show the
accumulation of the loan account of typical oil palm and rubber settlers.
12.         Loans would be repaid by equal annual installments of princi-
pal. and interest over a period of 15 years commencing on the first day
of the sixth year after palm planting and the eighth year after rubber
planting. However, during the first two years of repayment on rubber
schemes, loan deductions shall be made only in small amounts as will
leave the settler with a monthly income of i!$ 100.  Loan repayments
would be deducted at source from payments made by the FLDA owned and
operated mills and rubber factories to settlers for their production.
The costs of fertilizers and other inputs would also be recovered in
this way.

MARKET PROSPECTS FOR PAUII OIL AND PALM ERNELS
Palm Oil
1.        Trends in supply and demand for individual fats and oils are far
more difficult to judge than those for the total market, particularly since
most of the major oil products are produced either as joint products or
by-products. Thus, as in the case of soybeans, the production of specific
oils may be determined, not only by trends in the oils and fats market, but
also by the demand for the joint or related products. Another feature which
also has to be considered in reviewing the market for a particular oil
product is the amount of substitution possible between different fats and
oils.  IJithin a broad range, on technical considerations, one oil can be
substituted for another. Currently, the bulk of palm oil is used in the
food industry. Here it meets its strongest competition from soybean, oil,
and fish oil and lard. Fish oils are at a disadvantage compared with palm
oil, owing to the high processing costs involved in making them usable for
this purpose.
2,        Usually, the associated product of the marine and vegetable oils is
a protein-rich cake or meal.  The oil palm, however, compared with some
of its competitors, produces a very low proportion of protein cake to oil
and the cake is the by-product of palm kernel oil, rather than palm oil.
The overall ratio of palm and palm kernel oils to cake is about 9:1. In
comparison, the soybean produces oil to meal in the ratio of 1:4 in terms
of weight.
3.        Palm oil is produced almost entirely in four developing countries:
Nigeria, democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Malaysia.  Table
I indicates the production situation in these and other countries in recent
years.  Compared iLth other major fats and oils (Table 2) the growth rate
for world palm oil production has been low, up to recent years amounting to
only 1.3% per annum. The only really significant expansion took place in
Malaysia.  However, in a number of countries, particularly Milalaysia, a
considerable further expansion in production is planned for the future. Some
of these plans have already been put into operation. If these developments
go according to schedule, total world production will amount to approximately
2.5 million tons between 1975 and 1980. This would represent a growth rate
of slightly more than 5,, between 1965-67 and 1980, compared with a yearly
rate of increase of 1.3% between 1954-56 and 1965-67.  The share of palm
oil production on total fats and oils production would increase to approxi-
mately 5%, compared with about 3%0 in 1965-67.



A.TTIX 13

4.       lMany of the developments are export-oriented and a considerable
share of the additional supplies will have to be absorbed by the international
market.  Oil palm exports increased very slowly during the last decade, largely
owing to the slow growth in production rather than marketing difficulties.
Actually, in the period from 1954-56 to 1965-67, palm oil exports declined
slightly (Table 3). It is estimated that by 1975 palm oil exports will amount
to approximately 1.2 million tons, compared with 550,000 tons in 1965-67.
Consequently, the share of palm oil exports on total trade will probably
increase to 9% in 1975, compared with 5.4% in the earlier period.
5.        The palm oil economy thus faces two major problems in the future.
Firstly, it will have to face declining world market prices, a phenomenon
that is shared by nearly all major fats and oils. Secondly, it will have
to increase its share as an ingredient in the total usage of fats and oils.
Considering the fact that palm oil does not have all the quality characteristic3
enjoyed by some of the other oils (e.g., coconut oil), this could only be
achieved through price declines larger than those expected for some other
oils.
6.        It is in food uses where palm oil will have to increase its market
share. In the past, this was only possible to a certain degree, mainly because
of limitation in availabilities. Among other factors, this apparently prevented
processors from undertaking the necessary research into the technical and
economic difficulcies which would have to be overcome if palm oil is to be
incorporated as a major ingredient in food produhicts.  One major difficulty,
particularly at the relatively high palm oil prices of the past, appears to
have been the disposal at remunerative prices of the inedible portion resulting
from palm oil processing, which would make large-scale processing feasible.
17.        The Chart (IBRD-4905) indicates that palm oil prices have generally
followed the trend of all fats and oils prices, declining to a low level
in 1962 and experiencing a sharp fall after the high 1965 prices. Of particulai'
importance is the narrowing of the large price difference between soybean oil
and palm oil which prevailed in the 1950's. Since 1963, prices for both
products have moved closely together, which indicates that their future
fortunes will also be tightly knit.
8.        In the second half of 1968, palm oil prices dropped sharply reaching
a low point of approximately $140 per ton, compared with $222 per ton in 1967.
The steep decline was caused by large shipments of soybeans and soybean oil
and unusually large exports of sunflower seed and fish oil. This Tras a
relatively short term situation and prices recovered tolwards the end of 1968.
The average for the whole of 1968 was $172 per ton and for the first six months
of 1969, the price averaged nearly $171 per ton. In view of the large
anticipated exports and the technical difficulties mentioned previously, it, is
estimated that paIm oil prices will fall Icy the mid-1970's into a price range
115§-165 per ton cri.f. 7%rnpe.



Page 3
9.          These projections have to be seen in the light of the uncertainties
which surround any price forecast and of fats and oils in particular. For
example, if soybean exports under P.L. 480 are reduced or cease altogether
without compensating changes in U.S. production policy, the above price forecast
may prove to be optimistic.  On the other hand, if only part of the large
requirements that would be needed to meet the needs of fat deficit develop:n,
countries could be turned into effective demand, the forecast may be pessimistlic
Palm Kernels
10.         The fruits of the oil palm contain two separate sources of oil: t'.-
fleshy and fibrous mesocarp (pulp) from which paLm oil is obtained and a nut
kernel in a hard shell from wdhich palm kernel is extracted.  The pulp of the
fruits deteriorates rapidly after harvest and extraction has to be carried
out in producing areas. Palm kernels, in contrast, deteriorate very slowly
and their processing into oils is usually performed un large crushing mills, in
the importing industrialized countries. Only in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo have palm kernels have crushed on a large scale and the country's
exports consist almost entirely of oil, rather than kernels.
11.         Wild palm fruits have a low proportion of pulp and a high proportilor.
of kernels. In plantations now in the process of developmient, however, the
ratio of pulp to Iernel is expected to increase. Thus; the future expansion
in palm oil output wTill not be matched by a crmlensurate increase in palm
kernel oil output.
12.         Palr,m kernel oil, unlike palm oil, is a lauric oil and as such clesel
resembles coconut oil.  These types of oils are regarded in many coantries as
a desirable ingredient of iaiargarine and shortening, and for use in confectionanry
and bakery products.  Lauric oils also possess special qualities which make
then an essential constituent up to a certain minim Lun in soap manufacture; they
also have a w^ide variety of other industrial uses, such as in the manufacture
of synthetic detergents.
13.         All these factors account for a more inelastic demand greater than
for most other fats and oils.  This became very apparent in 1967-68 wThen prices
of nearly all major fats and oils decreased. Prices of lauric oils, including
palm kernel oil, renmined high, mostly because of short supplies, but also
because of the limited degree of substitutability.  Presently, there are some
indications that new industrial processes will make it possible to produce
synthetically the special component of the lauric acid oils which are the caluwe
of the inelastic demand.  This, of course, would limit the special role these
oils play in the market.  However, so far no definite information is availab`
which indicates that industrial manufacture of lauric oils wfill be undertaken ot
a large scale.
14.         The price, production and trade situation for palm kernels and pn Im
kernel oil are indicated in the Chart and Table 4. It is assumed that palrm
kernel oil, in line with other fats and oils, will follow a downward trend fci:-
the future, and it is estimated that a price range of $134v-138 per m ton for
palm kernels will prevail in the mrid-1970Is.

MARKET PROSPECTS FOR NATURAL RUBBER
I. INTRODUCTION
1.          Natural rubber (NR) is traditionally one of the major primary com-
modities traded between developed countries and LDC's. Generating average
earnings of approximately one billion U.S. dollars per annum in the period be-
tween 1955 and 1967, it has ranked between fourth and sixth position in impor-
tance in foreign trade among all primary commodities traded.
2.           Concentration is particularly high in the export trade in natural
rubber compared to other commodities. In the postwar period more than 90% of
all exports have been shipped from four countries in Southeast Asia, i.e.,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Ceylon. The remainder is exported by a
group of some 15 relatively minor exporting countries, among which the leaders
are Viet-Nam and Liberia. The market share of the major exporter group as a
whole has changed remarkably little in the postwar period. There has, how-
ever, been one rather striking change in market shares within this group in-
volving a declining market share for Indonesia which has been taken over al-
most entirely by Malaysia, with almost no gain by the other two countries.
As a result, as of 1967 nearly 50 percent of all of natural rubber supplies
were exported from Malaysia (Table 1).
3.           Ironically, the countries that benefitted most or suffered least
from this change in market shares also made the most progress in reducing their
dependence on rubber exports. Despite the remarkable increase in its share
of the market, dependence on foreign exchange earnings from natural rubber
exports has been continuously reduced in the case of Malaysia. Earnings
from natural rubber have also declined in importance for Thailand. In Viet-
Nam, Indonesia and Cambodia, on the othBr hand, dependence on natural rubber
was not reduced to any significant extent in the postwar period (Tables
2 and 3).
Trends and Prospects
4.           Natural rubber is a case of a commodity, whose share in the world
market has dropped in the past as a result of substitution by a synthetic
rubber and whose price is likely to decline in the future. From 1950-52 to
1968 consumption of new rubber (as distinguished from regenerated rubber) in
the non-Communist world rose by an average annual rate of around 6%, but the
consumption of natural rubber increased at the rate of only 2.3%. In this
same period, accordingly, the share of natural rubber in the world market de-
clined from 65% to 35% while that of synthetic rubber increased from 35% to
65%. Initially this relative drop in natural rubber was due at least partly
to the inelastic supply of rubber in the postwar period, but increasingly it
has been attributable to the ability of industry to produce a wide range of



ANNEX 1h
synthetics at qualities and prices that proved attractlve as compared with
natural rubber.
5.          The sirgle most important market for rubber is the transportation
equipment industry.  Approximately 50$' of all new rubber is utilized in tires
and tire products.  Also, aside from tires, automobiles average more than 100
lb of rubber per car. Other 'Fnon'tire" uses include a wide variety of indus-
trial and consumer goods. Since end products of rubber have a high income
elasticity of demand, future wJorld denand for rubber should a Priori depend
to a large extent on the future rate of income growth and esTecially of growth
in manufacturing output. This reasoning is supported by cor-relation analysis
betueen world manufacturing output and world rubber consumption which yields
a coefficient (referred to hereafter as elasticity of deauand) of 1.1 for the
period 1951-1967.
6.          Table 4 presents a view of the probable course of iworld demand for
new rubber to 1985 based on projections made in the Economics Department. On
the basis of pro ections of GNP and projections of industrial output in the
OECD countries I  total world consumption outside the centrally planned countries
is expected to grow at just over 6.5,.; per annum reaching a level of 8.7 million
long tons per year arcund 1975.  Tn addition, net imports of natural rubber into
the centrally planned countries are projected to reach 700,000 long tons as of
1975. Of course, deviations in the grow.th rate of GM%P in GECD countries from
the assumed grow.7th rates as projected would have an effect on the above picture,
as would, too, a change in the amount of imports into the centrally planned
countries, or a chan-e in the assumed elasticity coefficient of demand 2/.
The implications of a more pessinistic assumption in tlhese determinants can be
quantified by taldng as the growth rate of GIJP in CECD countries, the lowver lItit
indicated above, i.e., 4.3j1 p.a. (rounded from 4.25Z), for the period of 1967
to 1975.  The corresponding gr-owth rate of total newv rubber consumption of 5.5,'
p.a. w-ould then yield an estim,ate of total new rubber consumption in the wJorld
as of 1975 of about 8.4 million long tons.  Estimates of natural rubber imports
into the centrally planned countries range from 600,000 long tons, i;lying
that any increase in consumption in these countries could be met by expanding
output of their synthetic rubber industry to 850,000 long tons, which would
reflect a technical relationship between tire production and natural rubber
consumption similar to that in the rest of the world.  A. medium projection of
total ne-T rubber consum-ption in the Free 7world, representing a grwJth rate of
6.$% p.a. would result in 8.7 million long tons as of 1975.  Imports into the
centrally planned countries could be assumed at 700,000 long tons as of 1975.
1/ It was assumed on the basis of available projections by OECD, that GNP in
all developed countries would groT at a range betwYeen 4.3 to 4.6 p.a. and
industrial production at a range betwreen 4.8 and 5.8 p.a.
2/  It should be noted, however, that the elasticity coefficient of 1.1 held
remarkably strong over the last 16 years.

7.          Potential production from already existing rubber plantings is
expected to increase to 3.5 million long tons in the mid-1970's (wfith further
increases to approximately 4.0 millicn long tons in 1980 and 1985 in the absence
of replantings as of 1969). Since it is expected that the centrally planned
countries would import abcut 700,000 long tons as of 1975, approximately 2.8
million long tons of natural rubber would be left for sale in the free world
market in the 1970's.  If output proceeded at capacity level, therefore,
natural rubber would have to retain its share of the  grouth in demand. In
essence, this means that between now and the mid-1970's natural rubber's share
of total rubber demand would have to decline more slowly than in the period
before 1967. As a consequence it is expected that prices for natural rubber
would have to becormie more competitive Mith prices of synthetic ribber.
8.         I1latural rubber prices are likely to decline to about 16 U.S. cents
per pound as of the nid-1970's (see chart). This forecast is based on our
assessment of wvhat will happen to the cost price of synthetic rubber.  The
major develomment foreseen in synthetic rubber is ccmnercial production of the
highly competitive stereo-regular rubbers (i.e. polyisoprene and poly-butadiene)
besides the more traditional SBR, and a decline in the price of raw>J material
inputs of such rubbers, except for polyisoprene. In assessing the prospective
price for butadiene-based synthetic rubber (SBR and PB) the major development
anticipated is the change in the status of butadiene from being a product
primarily produced for synthetic rubber conversion to a by-product of another
major chemical product, ethylene.  In the case of polyisoprene, cost reduction
in the raw material input is also foreseen, although as a result of expected
economies of scale rather than a change in status from major product to by-
product.  The projected Drice of natural rubber is based on the assumption thlat
the cost/price of PI w,,ill serve as a ceiling since protracted movements of
natural rubber above that ceiling would lead to an acceleration of capacity in
polyisoprene.
9.          Over the longer run-and in particular for the period 1975-85 during
which new and replanted rubber would be maturin--it is believed that the price
of natural rubber may either decline somewhato more, to a level say, of approxi-
mately 12 U.S. cents per pound, c.i.f. NJew York or stay at 16 U.S. cents per
pound. This prognosis is based on the assumption of further technological pro-
gress in the synthetic rubber industry. In making a longer term forecast for
natural rubber, the key question is the possible further price developments in
polyisoprene, which fromri the standpoint of quality is the synthetic most likely
to m.ake progress at the expense of natural rubber. There are presently research
efforts by the industry to adjust the petro-chemical production stream so as to
derive isoprene, the major raT. material inputs, as a by-product.  The history of
success in butadiene-based rubbers suggests that this aim may be achieved. HoTv-
ever, the present position is that an approach to such a technical breakthrough
has not yet been fcund.  If a breakthrough were to be achieved, it is conceiva-
ble that the price of polyisoprene would fall belowT 15 U.S. cents per pound,
compared to 21 U.S. cents as of 1968, and both oolyisoprene and natural rubber
might be selling at a level in the order of 12 U.S. cents per pound.  A situa-
tion such a3 this is within the realrn of possibilities sometimie between 1975 and
1985.  If isoprene cannot be produced as a by-product, however, prices for
polyisoprene and natural rubber might continue at the projected 1975 level, in
real terms, for the period i975 -1985.  According to repeated industry statements
at IRSG meetings, howJever, efficient producers of natural rubber operatinc on
replanted high-yielding acreage should be able to produce rubber profitably at
prices as lou as 12 U.S. cents per pound c.i.f. consuwinig countries.



ANNEX 14
10.         The foregoing im-licitly assumes that in the late 1970's and the
1980's all natural rubber produced at the suggested prices will be absorbed,
i.e., that price ccnsiterations will outwyeigh any possible additional tech-
nical advantages that synthetic rubber may present to consumers. On thse
other hand, if this assumption .wrere considered to be too optimistic, the
question would arise whether it would be desirable to improve or even main-
tain the existing natural rubber capacity.
11.         To test this proposition, prospective demand for new rubber in the
1980's was compared wi^th natural rubber output that would materialize from a
global 3,; replanting program in the natural rubber industry (see Table 4).  The
production implications of such an ambitious program is shovn in line 6 of
Table 4, indicating that the resulting output of natural rubber would in fact
be substantially absorbed even if technical substitution against natural rubber
continued regardless of price. Of course, if low prices for natural rubber,
especially any w^zell belowx the future cost price of synthetic rubber resulting
from new- plantings with high yielding trees were to halt, or even reverse
substitution, then foreseeable supplies of natural rubber might not be sufficient
to meet demand even with an accelerated global rate in replanting.  The probable
magnitude of the deficit is illustrated in line 5 of Table 4. In other words,
the implicit natural rubber shortage seen in the 1950's w-Tould be repeated.
12.         In this case new planting in addition to the prograam to improve
the cost competitiveness of natural rubber against synthetic rubber by replant-
ing would be reouired. iJoreover, it may be noted that it is far from certain
at this point in time that a replanting rate of 3% per annum could be achieved
on a global basis. Even if it is achieved, completion of the program would
require between 13 to 29 years.  Such a long-term program would be subject to
adjustment if the prospects for rubber change over time.  The case for newJ
planting is further strengthened by the prospects for improvement in the
competitive position of natural rubber through better preparation of the raw
material which w>ould proceed alongside a planting program. Such improvements
involving production of new fonas of crude natural rubber such as "block rubber",
raise the technical standards of natural rubber and malce possible a reduction
in the processing costs of the rubber products manufacturer who is the decisive
factor in deciding the issues of substitution between natural and synthetic
rubbers.

SECOND JENGKA TRIANGLE PROJECT
MAJLIS AHANAH RA'AYAT (1ARA)
General
1.        Majlis Amanah Ra'ayat (MARA) was established following a resolution
of the Konggeres Ekonomi Bumiputeras (Economic Congress of the Indigenous
People) held in June, 1965.
2.        Section 6 (1) of the Majlis Amanah Ratayat Act provides that it is
the duty of the WIjLis to promote, stimulate, facilitate and undertake
economic and social development in Malaysia and more particularly in the rural
areas.
3.        The Hajlis shall have powers:
(1)  To carry on all activities, particularly the development of
comnercial and industrial enterprises, including the manu-
facturing, assemblying, processing, packing, grading and
marketing of products, research and training.
(2) To promote the carrying on of any such activities by other
bodies or persons, and for that purpose to establish or
expand, or promote the establishment or expansion of, other
bodies to carry on any such activities either under the
control or partial control of IAERA independently.
(3) To give assistance to such bodies or persons appearing to
!ARA to have facilities for the carrying on of any such
activities including financial assistance by the taking
up of shares or loan capital or by loan or otherwise.
(4) To carry on any such activities in association with other
bodies or persons (including departments or authorities of
the Government of the E-ederation of Ialaysia) or as managing
agent or o-therwise on its behalf.
(5)  To purchase, underwrite or otherwise acquire any stock and
shares in any public or private company and to dispose of
the same on such terms and conditions as 1MRA may determine.

5.        MLARA's activities are confined to bringing about greater parti-
cipation of the people, particularly the Bumiputeras, in the commercial and
industrial life of the country and it is now in the process of implementing
an elaborate plan of activities which can be classified into the following
categories:
(i) Provision of Training
(ii) Provision of supervised credit facilities
(iii) KIanagement and advisory services
(iv) Carrying out directly managed projects and participating in
joint ventures, and
(v) Purchasing of shares reserved for Bumiputeras.
Training Facilities
6.        MAA is now undertaking an extensive training programme to provide
training opportunities and facilities for Bumiputera entrepreneurs, students
and youth desiring to prepare themselves for careers in commerce and industry
and also for careers for its own staff. HiAA 's largest single training project
at present is the  4RA College of Business and Professional Studies in Petaling
Jaya, near Xuala Lumpur.  This is a post-secondary residential College offering
between 2 and 3 years courses in business and professional subjects to young
Bumiputeras. Those students selected for admission into the College will be
given financial aids covering free tuition, full board and lodging, and
travelling expenses to and from their home-towns.
Credit Finance
7.        One important activity of 1MARA is its credit finance programme which
provides credit facilities for enterprises in the industrial and commercial
sectors, to assist in their expansion and modernization. iYIARA operates its
credit finance programme very much on similar lines as a development bank and the
principal objectives of the programme is to aid economic development by making
capital, enterprises and managerial and technical advice available to the
private sector, more particularly the Bumiputera sector of the economy.  Within
this framework, the credit finance programme of MARA is intended to be an
important instrument in promoting, stimulating and facilitating greater part-
icipation of the Bumiputera in commerce and industry.
Directly Managed Projects, Joint Ventures and Purchase of Shares
8.        MARA will aslo participate directly in commerce and industry and
take part in joint ventures with local and overseas groups in commercial and
industrial activities and buy shares reserved for Bumiputera in private and
other companies, with a view to handing over ultimately such ventures or
shares to Bumiputera entrepreneurs.

of the cottage and other small scale industries;
(2) To undertake the establishment of pilot projects in order to
test the commercial viability of any undertaking;
(3) To purchase raw materials or finished products for sale to
producers, where such bulk purchases can lower cost and
assure regular supplies;
(k) To build shophouses which can be rented out to Bumiputera
businessmen;
(5) To participate directly in commerce and industry and to take
part in joint ventures with local and/or overseas groups in
commercial and industrial activities, where ncessary and
desirable, with a view to handing over ultimately such ventures,
or IHRA's shares in them, to Bumiputera;
(6) To collect statistical data pertaining to Bumiputera enterprises
in commerce and industry for planning purposes;
(7) To collect technical information which can be published perio-
dically in iuhlay and English for general dissemination;

bility studies of specific industries, either on its own
or with the assistance of professional firms, where there is
a need for such surveys and studies.
Advisory Services
10.       The objective of the Advisory Service Division is:
To provide free or for a small fee the technical and professional
advisory services that will make Bumiputera enterprises viable, and to assist

MARKET PROSPECTS FOR FOREST PRODUCTS
A. West Malaysia Log SuMply and Demand
1.          Over the past few years there has been a rapid increase in
West Mlalaysia demand for logs. The demand stems from the needs of sawmilling,
plywood and veneer industries in export and domestic markets, and from
log exporters.
2.          Log removal increased from 1.2 million tons in 1958, to 3.6
million tons in 1968.  Exports of logs, mainly to Singapore and Japan
increased from about 276,000 tons in 1960 to just under 960,000 tons
in 1968.
3.          In 1968 about 449 West M1alaysian sawmills produced some 1.4
million tons of sawn timber, consuming some 2.4 million tons of logs in the
process.
4.          In 1968 about 16 plywood mills produced nearly 225 million square
ft of plywood and veneer (3/16 inch basis) and accounted for the balance
of the countryts log production.
5.        4Marketing studies carried out as part of the ongoing UNDP/FAO
Forestry and Forest Industries Development Project (Malaysia) indicate
that demand, particularly in North America, the United Kingdom, Japan and
Australia for Malaysian logs, sawn timber and plywood will continue to
outstrip supply. The quantity of processed timber available for export
will probably be restricbd after 1972 by log shortages and by increasing
local demand. Projections indicate that to 1972 the annual increases in
exports are likely to be at the rate of 10 percent for logs and 5 percent
for sawn timber, plywood and veneer; and that thereafter exports will
decline sharply.
6.          In the light of an anticipated deficit in log supplies an
efficient forest industries complex established in the Jengka triangle with
its assured supply of logs would be in a highly competitive position.
7.          Prices.  The weighted average price for Jengka Triangle logs
is expected to be M$ 48 per cubic tons at Jengka, based on representative
ranges of existing prices for Jengka species.

8.         ERports* Exports of sawn timber from West Malaysia amounted
to nearly 600,000 tons in 1968. Keruing and Red Meranti currently make up
about 80 percent of all exports, although many other species are exported.
Prospects for future exports are excellent; European, United States and
Japanese imports are expected to increase rapidly. West Malaysia's parti-
cipation in world markets for sawn timber will be restricted after 1972,
mostly by a shortage of logs and to a certain extent by domestic needs.
Total exports are expected to increase by 5 percent annually to 1972
(reaching a maximum of about 750,000 tons) and then to decline sharply.
9.          Almost any species yielding satisfactory lumber can be exported.
It is essential, however, to have a fairly large volume available and a
steady supply, so that users can become accustomed to characteristics
peculiar to various species. Operations in the Jengka Triangle and Tekam and
Berkeleh reserves, covering very large areas annually, should make even
scarce species available in adequate quantity.
10.         There are opportunities for increasing exports of kiln-dried
timber and for applying further processing such as planing and moulding
(most exports are rough, air-dry lumber).
I1.         The most important customers for sawn timber are expected to
be Australia, the United Kingdom, Western Europe and the United States.
Japan is expected to become a major importer of MIalaysian hardwoods.
12.         Domestic.  The domestic market for lumber accepts a wider
range of species, sizes and grades, and a higher moisture content than does
the export market.  MAuch of the lumber used locally must either be naturally
durable or be treated with preservatives.
13.         The prefabrication of housing components is growing, and current-
ly uses about 8,000 tons per year. Building components are used domesti-
cally and in East Malaysia, and are exported to other Southeast Asia
destinations. There is an opportunity in this field to use species and
grades that are not readily saleable as lumber.
14.         Total domestic consumption is now estimated at about 800,000
tons; it is expected to rise to about 1,000,000 tons in 1975.
15.         Prices.  A broad range of ex-mill prices for the species found in
the Jengka Triangle is expected and average export and domestic sales
prices and forecast at M$ 196 per ton (1N$ 226 fob for export timber).

C. Plywood and Veneer I4arkets
16.         Exports.  Plywood and veneer exports reached 150 million
square feet m    S.  Substantial future increases are expected in the
import requirements of the industrial areas of the world (the United
States, Europe, Japan).
17.         Exploitation of potential export markets by West Malaysia
will be restricted by log shortages and by increasing local plywood
demands. It is estimated that West Malaysian exports will increase
to a maximum of about 210 million square feet per year by. 1972 and then
decline gradually.
18.         The United States is by far the largest potential customer
for Malaysian plywood and veneer. Canada and the United States are the
only large customers for veneer at present, but restricted log exports
from Southeast Asia could bring Japan, Taiwan and Korea into the veneer
markets.
19.         Quarter inch and 3/16-inch plywood face increasing competition
in the world market; they are supplied in large quantities by Japan,
Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, as well as by a few West African
countries. Better opportunities may lie in manufacturing thicker panels
for export and selling thinner panels locally.
20.         Species are relatively unimportant in finished plywood,
provided that technical qualities are adequate.  Panels faced with species
resembling Red, White or Yellow M4eranti should have no market resistance;
panels faced with other species will have to present an attractive appear-
ance (e.g.Sepetri); otherwise they will have to be used where appearance
is unimportant (e.g. concrete forming).
21.         Veneer exports may initially have to be restricted to accept-
able species such as IMengkulang or Meranti.  New species can be intro-
duced, but for export it is necessary to ensure consistent quality and
adequate and dependable supply so that users do not have to vary produc-
tion techniques frequently.
22.         Domestic.  Plywood-is used locally for interior panelling,
concrete forming and furniture. Total domestic consumption of locally
produced plywood was 74 million square feet (3/16-inch basis) in 1968.
Tentative forecast domestic consumption is 100 million square feet by
1975.
23.         Prices.  Plywood prices vary with thickness, colour, type of
glue used, and grade of face and back veneers.  A conservative price
range, based on white species and on a low-grade face, is given below.

D. Other Forest Products
24.         Present market conditions, economies of plant size, and char-
acteristics of the Jengka timber indicates that it would not be practical
to consider the manufacture of pulp, fibreboard or particle board in the
Jengka Triangle. Other products such as poles, charcoal, and fuel wood
would consume only small quantities of logs and sales for these uses are
not included in the estimates of this report.
E. Conclusion
25.         Markets exist that could readily absorb Jengka's forest
products. However, their disposal to these markets particularly in the
early years of operation will necessitate a carefully planned sales
programme under the direction of experienced marketing managers. Satis-
factory marketing arrangements wuld be provided under the project.
