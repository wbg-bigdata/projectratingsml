MEMORARDUM AND RECOMMERDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A SECOND KARACHI WATER SMPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of SDR 97.1 million
(US$125.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
Credit would be ou standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity to finance, in
part, a Second Karachi Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The proceeds
of the credit would be channelled through the Government of Sind (GOS)
which, in turn, would on-lend it to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation
(KKC) at an annual interest rate of 11. RMC would on-lend the proceeds to
the executing agency, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) also at 11%.
The Overseas Development Administration and the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (ODA/CDC) of the United Kingdom would participate through
parallel mixed credit financing of US$56.4 million equivalent, and the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to participate through parallel
financing of US$81.9 million equivalont. To expedite the start-up of the
project, US$2.0 million (1.6X of the Credit amount) will be allowed in the
Proposed Credit for the retroactive financing of expenditures for civil
works and equipment purchases incurred after the appraisal by IDA and
before Credit Efffectiveness.
BacM2und
2.       In 1981, about 18X of Pakistan's total population lived in urban
areas; today, 31% of the .iopulation-31 million people-are urban
dwellers. Of these, 7.0 million live in Karachi, the capital of Sind
province; the City's population is growing at about 4.7X a year. Karachi
is Pakistan's commercial, banking, and industrial center, and it has the
nation's tvo ports. It offers many opportunities for employment. Largely
because of institutional and financial constraints, urban services in the
City are seriously deficient. Piped water is supplied at an average level
of 20 gallons per person per day (gpd) compared to about 30 gpd in Lahore
and 32 gpd in Bombay. Service is intermittent and the supply sometimes
becomes contaminated. Only 45X of households have individual connections;
the remaining population is served by about 19,000 standpipes (in addition
to private wells) at approximately one standpipe per 166 persons.
Waterborne sewerage is available to only about 40Q of the population,
mainly higher income groups. The treatment capacity of the two existing
sewage treatment plants is only about 20K of the total daily delivery of
potable water. As a result, most piped sewage as well as much of the waste
from unserviced areas flows directly into open drains, streams and low
lying areas. However, through IDA's assistance and more recently with the
help of ADB, water supply and sewerage services have improved over the past
5 years since KWSB's inception. The First Karachi Water Supply Project
(1374-PAX, US$25 M, 1983) successfully achieved its physical targets and



increased KWSB's capacity to convey an additional 50 mgd of water to
Greater Karachi. The quality of management and operations has also
improved though much remains to be done especially with regard to rapidly
rising personnel costs, low tariffs, cost recovery and human resource
development. The water supply and sewerage component of the Karachi
Special Development Project (1652-PAK, US$56.3 M, 1986) vill also increase
KWSP"s capacity to deliver additional potable water, and will improve and
expand Karachi's sewerage system. The proposed project will continue the
strengthening of KWSB started by these two on-going projects.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.       Although IDA has supported two projects to improve water supply in
Karachi, one of which covered other urban services as well, much remains to
be done with regard to the implementation of policies pertaining to
financial and institutional matters which are being pursued in this
Project. The Project strengthens KWSB's procedures with regard to
appropriate tariff levels, arrears reduction, and staffing ratios, besides
improving its capacity to contribute towards capital investment. However,
these are major steps in restoring financial discipline which cannot be
pursued without IDA's active involvement and support in the foreseeable
future. IDA's support for KWSB's program is to be accomplished in three
phases. In the first phase, IDA established working relationships with the
executing agency and the GOS, and provided the necessary institutional
framework for the next generation cf projects. In the second phase,
through the proposed Project and probably one follow-on project, IDA would
consolidate KWSB's capacity to execute large scale projects, and vould
continue to focus on the broader policy objectives of economic pricing,
self-financing, cost recovery, and envirommental protection.  In the third
phase, IDA would seek to expand support for the sector through sector
lending at the provincial and national levels of government. IDA's
participation in the Project would also assist in mobilizing support from
cofinanciers, particularly ADB and ODA/CDC of the United Kingdom.
Project Obiectives
4.       The objectives of the project are to:  (a) increase potable water
supply by 100 mgd (about 31X) and further augment water availability by
strengthening loss reduction measures; (b) improve the financial viability
of KWSB through increased revenues, cost reductions, and increased
operational efficiency; (c) improve the organization and management of
KWSB; and (d) improve sanitation in the City including its low-income and
coastal areas, by increasing severage coverage by 232 mgd and treatment
capacity by 94 mgd.
Pro ect Description
5.       (a)  Water SUpply. About 150 km of transmission works; pumping
stations; direct filtration treatment works; storage reservoirs; 40 km of
primary distribution mains; and strengthening of the distribution network.
(b) Sanitation. Three sewage treatment works together with associated
trunk sewers; repair and cleaning of existing severs; and small-bore severs
for low income neighborhoods; (c) Institutional Strenathenina. Technical
assistance, training and studies for KWSB to enable it to plan and execute
large scale projects, improve operations and maintenance, and improve and
extend sanitation in the City and coastal areas.



-3-
Agreed Actions
6.       Agreements were obtained during the credit negotiations with the
GOP, GOS, KDC, and KWSB on the following:
(a) to provide sufficient foreign excho.ge to enable KWSB to
purchase necessary spare parts;
(b) to control growth of Fersonal and administrative costs of
KWSB according to an agreed staffiug plan;
(c) to set up and staff the Development Wing of KWSB;
(d) to undertake a study of metering for customers, and to
prepare and implement a metering program in accordance with
the recommendations of the study;
(e) to carry out a study of KWSB's tariff structure, and to
prepare and implement a tariff adjustment program to improve
tLe structure and levels of water tariffs and sewerage
charges;
(f)  on an accounts receivables' covenant requiring KWSB, by
December 31, 1989, to undertake measures adequate to ensure,
starting with the fiscal year 1990/91, that its accounts
receivables for water consumption by all categories of
consumers are curent at a level of not less than 90%, and
that all bills issued by KWSB for water consumption are
settled within three months of the billing date; and
(g) on a financial covenant requiring KWSB to generate cash from
charges to customers sufficient to cover cash operations and
maintenance cost plus debt service in FY1991/92, and, in
addition, to cover at least 20% of its capital expenditures
starting with FY1992/93 and thereafter; and to achieve this
level of self-financing, KWSB has already approved, as of
January 5, 1989, a tariff increase of 35%; and will introduce
a sewerage surcharge equivalent of 75% of the water charge by
July 1, 1989; a water tariff increase of 35% by July 1, 1990;
and annual 10% increases in water tariffs each year in July
1991 and 1992 changing to adJustments for annual inflation
each year starting July 1, 1993.
7.       Conditions for effectiveness of the Credit Agreement are:  (a) the
signing of subsidiary loan agreement between GOS, KMC, and KWSB, and
(b) fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the
funding agreements with ODA and CDC. In addition, disbursements for civil
works associated with increased water supply (about 66% of the total
credit) is conditional on the effectiveness of the ADB loan.
Benefits
8.       Through provision of increased water supply, sewerage, sewage
treatment, and institutional strengthening, the proposed project would



-4-
contribute to the continued eco-mic growth of greater Karachi, benefiting
all income groups, and especially the poor. With the project, water
connections are expected to increase from about 880,000 to about one
million; and sewerage coverage is expected to increase from about 40% of
the population to 76%. The intemnal financial rate of return for the
project is projected to be 8%. There is significant consumer's surplus
with respect to the figures used. Even vith the additional vater being
produced by the Project, the total availability of water is projected to
remain insufficient with respect to essential demand.
9.       Non-quantifiable benefits from the Project include reductions in
health and environmental risks, and increases in industrial produetivity,
employment opportunities, and property values.
Risks
10.      The principal risks to the project are delays in Implementation
and insufficient finance to complete it. The risks would be minimized by
(a) the prior acquisition of land, (b) the prior appointmeit of consultants
and advisers, (c) assurances from international agencies (IDA, ODA/CDC, and
ADB) of 80% of the financial resources required, and (d) providing measures
and resources for improving technical performance, management improvement,
and control of costs.
Recommendation
11.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
