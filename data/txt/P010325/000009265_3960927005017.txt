Beneficiaries:   Government of Sind (GOS), Karachi Metropolitan Corporation
(KMC), and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB).
Amount:          SDR 97.1 million (US$125 million equivalent).
Terms:           Standard, with 35 years maturity.
On-lending:      From the Government of Pakistan (GOP) through the Government
of Sind (GOS) to the KMC at an annual interest rate of llX
with a repayment period of 25 years including six years of
grace. From the KMC to the executing agency, KWSB, on the
same terms as received by the KMC.
Project
Description:     The objectives of the Project are to: (a) increase potable
water supply by about 31X (100 million gallons per day) and
further augment water availability by strengthening loss
reduction measures; (b) improve the financial viability of
KWSB through increased revenues, cost reductions, and
increased operational efficiency; (c) improve the organization
and management of KWSB; (d) improve sanitation in khe City,
including its low-income and coastal areas by increasing
sewerage coverage by 232 mgd and treatment capacity by 94 mgd.
The Project includes: (a) Water SuDDYl - a 30-km canal and a
70-km, 4 meter square conduit to bring water from the Indus
River to Dhabeji; four major pumping stations; two direct
filtration treatment works; storage reservoirs; 40 km of
primary distribution mains; 10 km of steel pumping main; and
expansion/rehabilitation of the distribution network; (b)
Sanitation - three new sewage treatment works together with
associated trunk sewers; repair and cleaning of existing
sewers; small-bore sewers for low-income neighborhoods; and
(c) Institutional Strenathenina - technical assistance,
training and studies for KWSB to enable St to plan and execute
large scale projects, improve operations and maintenance, and
improve and extend sanitation in the City and coastal areas.

Project
Beneficiaries
and Riss:        The Project's beneficiaries would be: (a) approitmately 2.5
million people who vould receive piped water, and i.9 million
who would receive sewerage services, as a result of the
Project; and (b) 7.0 million people and light industry and
commercial customers already connected to the water and
sewerage system who would receive improved service. The main
risks are delay in implement&tion and insufficient funds to
complete the Project. The probability of the risks occurring
is low. Project advisers and consultants necessary for start
up have been appointed; land for the water component has been
acquired; and 80X of the finance is to be provided by the
international lenders.

STAFF APRAISAL REPO
SECOND KARACHI WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
I. THE URBAN WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
A. Urban Growth
1.01     Pakistan's urban population is growing rapidly due to the Country's
relatively high birthrate, migration from rural areas in search of
employment, and growth in personal incomes. The cutrrent population of
Pakistan is over 100 million, of which over 30 million are urban dwellers.
During the 1970s, the urban population grew by 4.1X per year, compared to
3.1% for the population as a whole and 2.1X for rural areas. The urban
population is projected to continue growing by at least 4.72 per year over
the next 12 years; and by the year 2000, approximately 60 million people -
over 40% of the total population - are expt.cted to be urban. Urban centers
will play an increasingly important role in economic development by
providing essential services including water supply and sanitation.
B. Service Levels
1.02     In 1980, 58X of the Country's urban housing units used piped water,
while 33X relied on hand pumps, 7X on wells, and 2X on surface water
sources. The latest available data show that urban piped water supply
coverage improved to approximately 80X of the urban population in 1986
compared with rural piped coverage of about 352. Water supply in all major
cities is irregular, with availability ranging only from four to eight hours
per day, often at reduced pressures. Supply interruptions produce negative
pressures leading sometimes to contamination of water. Network losses are
high, varying from about 40% of production in Karachi to 50% in Lahore and
Faisalabad.
1.03     About 522 of the urban population are served with sewerage.  The
balance have septic tanks and soakpits. Installation of sewage treatment
plants has lagged behk.nd network development, resulting in substantial
amounts of raw or partially treated sewage being discharged into drainage
canals and rivers. Solid waste collection services are rudimentary in most
smaller towns, and severs and drains tend to become clogged with uncollected
refuse.
1.04     The water and sewerage deficiencies are due, apart from inadequate
investment to inadequate user charges, poor collection of revenue from
users, deficient maintenance because of under-traxned staff, lack of
appropriate polici4s, and management weaknesses.  Charges for water are low
rel.tive to both costs and to rates charged by private vendors. In most
cities, there are no charges for sewerage and drainage services.



- 2 -
C. Sector Oraanization
1.05     The responsibility for water supply and sanitation policy is
divided between the federal and provincial governments, while implementation
is almost exclusively the responsibility of provincial governments and local
agencies constituted under them. Annual and five-year economic and social
development plans are prepared by the Planning and Development livision of
the Ministry of Planning and Development. The Physical Planning and Housing
Section of the Ministry of Housing and Works prepares the housing, urban
development (including water supply and sanitation) and regional development
sections of thesa plans in consultation with other agencies, and is
responsible for technical review of requests for capital assistance Cor
-water supply and sanitation.
1.06     Requests for financial assistance for development expenditures are
incorporated ixn Project Concept (PC) documents: PCl's for investment
projects and Pt:2's for feasibility studies and technical assistance.
Presently, the provincial governments are empowered to approve local
(municipal) schemes up to a value of Rs 60 million (about US$1.5 million).
Above this figure, schemes must be sent to the Federal Government (GOP) for
review by a Central Develo9ment Working Party (CDWP) and approval by the
Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC).  Projects
estimated to cost more than Rs 600 million, and all for3ign aided projects,
are approved by the ECNITC. The National Economic Council (NEC) is the
highest authority to approva the Five-Year Plan and Annual Development Plan
(ADP). It is chaired by the President of Pakistan. All fedaral ministers
and provincial governors are members of the Council.
1.07     The Federal Ministry of Housing and Works has an Environment and
Urban Affairs Division which le responsible for coordinating urban
(including water supply and re.tation) and regional policies.  There is
also a Federal Ministry for Lc. ..i Government and Rural Development, which is
responsible for the structurt:  -uianca and development of local governments.
1.08     Until recently, the GOF has been looked upon as a principal source
for meeting financing gaps for investment and operations, but, more and
more, it ic seeking to discourage this dependence. Financing gaps are
viewed by the GOP as responsibilities mainly of the provincial governments,
who are being encouraged to wield stricter control over municipal,
development authority, and local council spending, and to promote full cost
recovery for services rendered.
1.09     In each province, water supply and sanitation projects are
constructed through the efforts of one or more of the following: (a) Public
Health Engineering Departments (PHED); (b) Public Works Departments; (c)
Local Government Work Agencies; (d) Municipal Committees; and (e) in the
case of large cities, Development Authorities. Completed schemes are handed
over to local governments which are held responsible for their operation and
maintenance except in the larger cities such as Karachi, Lahore, Pesha--tar,
Multan, Faisalabad, Hyderabad and Islamabad, wht.re autonomous authorities
have overall responsibility for building and operating the systems.



D. Sector Oblectives
1.10     Plans for the the development of the water and sanitation sector
were included in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 1983-1988. The draft Seventh
Plan intends to increase (i) the water supply coverage in urban areas on
average from the existing 80% to 95% by 1993 by serving an additional 13.6
million persons, and (li) the coverage of urban sewerage from 52% in 1988 to
70% in 1993 by serving an additional 12.4 million persons. The Seventh Plan
points out the need for development of sewerage in conjunction with water
supply development to ^ope with increased waste water volume resulting from
increased water supply. For rural areas, the Seventh Plan envisages an
increase in the coverage of water supply from the existing 40% to 75% by
serving an additional 31.2 million persons, and the sanitation coverage from
10% to 30% by serving an additional 17 million persons.
1.11     To accomplish the above targets, the Seventh Plan estimates the
total financial requirements for urban areas at about Rs 15.9 billion, which
appears to be an underestimate. The Seventh Plan allocates Rs 9 billion for
the sector from the ADP and an additional Rs 2.5 billion from the Special
Development Program (SDP). The balance would be provided by tle local
bodies. The allocated ADP amount of Rs 9 billion represents about 3.3% of
thae total public sector investment of Rs 270 billion. It will be
distributed as follows: (a) 50.8% for Punjab, 22.2% for Sind, 18.2% for
Northwest Frontier and 8.8% for Baluchistan; (b) 27.8% for urban areas aud
7,.2% for rural areas. Of the Rs 2.5 billion SDP allocation, about Rs 800
million will be allocated for Sind. Even under the most favorable
circumstances, however, probably nc more than about 90% of the planned
allocatiouw is likely to be provided within the plan period.
E. Constraints
1.12     The development of the water supply and sanitation sector in
Pakistan is constrained mainly by financial deficiencies and institutional
shortcomings.
1.13     Cost recovery is poor because of billing and collection
deficiencies and low tariffs. Efforts to raise tariffs are often frustrated
by the argument that Increases are only possible when service improves.
Some tariff structures are regressive resulting in low income hoaseholds
having to pay more per uLit of water consumed than households with high
incomes. The Sixth Plan proposed to introduce metering to discourage waste
and to Introduce tariff structures with progressively increasing rates for
higher consumption of water. This has not, however, been done.
1.14     Although water supply and sanitation services are subsidized by
provincial and municipal governments, the combined subsidies and revenues
are not adequa_e for proper operations and maintenance and for expansion of
the services to keep pace with increasing demand. To improve the sector's
finances, the Seventh Plan calls for increased charges to users, and
proposes to add subsidies for interest, power rates, and customs duties.
Under the cost recovery policy expressed in the Plan, users would be



- 4 -
expected to pay, on average, somewhat more than they are paying at present
but not enough to cover investment expenditures for replacement or expansion.
1.15     The sector's institutional shortcomings are its organization and
management deficiencies, and its inadequately trained and poorly motivated
staffs. The sector at most levels of government has difficulty attracting
and retaining qualified staff. These problems as well as the financial
difficulties outlined above and a strategy for improving water tariffs and
sewerage charges, and their structure are addressed for Karachi in
connection with the proposed project in paras. 4.03 to 4.18 and 5.01 to 5.18.
F. Previous IDA Credits in the Sector
1.16     There have been five 1DA-financed projects in the sector in
Pakistan, three in Lahore and two in Karachi. The first two projects in
Lahore have been successfully completed, the Lahore Water and Sewerage
Project (Credit 106-PAK, US$1.75 million equivalent, 1967) and the Lahore
Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Project (Credit 630-PAK, US$26.6 million
equivalent, 1976). The principal objectives of these two projects were to
assist the development of a financially sound water and sewerage agency for
metropolitan Lahore, improve service levels, and help prepare an urban
project. The Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), established in
1977, successfully completed the second project, and although its initial
financial performance was disappointing, it later improved in accordance
with an action plan prepared in 1982 defining specific steps and objectives
for operational and financial improvements. The agreed performance targets
were achieved, as has been reported in the recently prepared Project
Completion Report (No. 6204). WASA has, however, fallen short of its
financial objectives in recent years due to the Government of Punjab's
unwillingness to increase tariffs. The third operation in Lahore is e
component of the Punjab Urban Development Project (Credit 1895-PAK, US$90.0
million equivalent) which was approved by IDA on April 12, 1988.
1.17     The two projects in Karachi are on-going.  The first of these was
the FLrachi Water Supply Project (Credit 1374-PAK., US$25.0 million
equivalent, 1983) to improve Karachi's bulk water supply system, and to
support the creation and strengthening of KWSB as a water and sewerage
authority responsible for source-to-tap operations.L1
1.18     Despite drawbacks due to the uncertain political climate, there
have been major accomplishments. In the past four years, KWSB has shifted
from an archaic, manual single-entry accounting system to a computerized,
double-entry system. Also, KWSB has computerized and integrated its systems
for payroll, financial accounting, fixed assets accounting, capital works in
progress, inventory control, purchasing, monitoring and control of vehicles
and gasoline purchases, financial reporting and cash management. New bulk
and retail billing and collection systems are near completion. Bulk water
bills are presently printed and issued by computer. Retail bills will be
printed and issued by computer by July 1988 after completion of a master
/1 KWSB was established as a semi-autonomous agency under the Karachi
Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), which controls its board, tariffs,
recruitment, and staff compensation.

file of arrears.  With respect to water supply, KWSB with the engineering
assistance of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) completed US$15
million of civil works to increase supply by over So mgd and installed a
domestic pilot metering program it two areas of the city and a loss-reduction
unit in KWSB, and is in the p;ocess of completing rehabilitation of several
trunk mains. These works are being completed in less than five years and
within their budgets. Consideration is beizg given by KWSB to the
possibility of requesting IDA to permit the use of surplus funds expected in
Credit 1374-PAR for further strengthening the trunk main transmission.
1.19     KWSB has, since the start of the first project,  increased its
retail customers from about 350,000 to over 880,000. Despite this increase
of some 250%, revenues for FY1987/88 are expected to be only 170X more than
those of FY1984/85 because of a decline in the tariff average. With regard
to billing and collection, KWSB has been able to improve its annual
collection ratio for retail customers from about 5UX in 1983 to about 85%.
For the bulk commercial and industrial category, the collections ratio is
83% although this figure is relatively uncertain because of defective bulk
meters. For the two categories of customers for which KWSB has been most
constrained politically, the ratios are low: 45% for public bodies
(autonomotvs agencies), and zero for government departments.
1.20     The second project in Karachi became effective in late 1986; a
US$56.3 million water supply and sewerage component of the Karachi Special
Development Project (Credit 1652-PAK, US$70.0 million equivalent, 1986).L1
The objectives of Credit 1652-PAK are: (a) institutional strengthening; (b)
improved resource mobilization and cost recovery; (c) new approaches to
serve the poor; and (d) urban service improvements. Project implementation
continues to be satisfactory. C!vil works on four contracts totalling about
US$6.0 million are either completed or nearing completion, and contracts for
about US*28 million of civil works are expected to be let by the end of the
second half of 1988. Six consultancy contracts have been awarded, and three
more are in the final stages of evaluation. There have been delays with the
KMC consultancies (Financial management assiscance to KMC, the land
management study, and Katchi Abadi component implementation).  Because of
denials of tariff increases, large institutional arrears, and excessive
hiring practices, KWSB has not met the financial covenants of the project
(see para. 5.13).
1.21     Despite these setbacks, KWSB has made significant improvements in
its financial and technical operations, but more needs to be done. IDA's
continuing involvement would assist the GOS and KWSB efforts in increasing
water and sewerage servic a and improving operational performance and
project implementation capability. It would help to strengthen policies and
financial discipline, and would help to mobilize resources from
co-financiers such as the ADB, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA)
and the Commonwealth Development Cor:poration (CDC).
Ll IDA and the ADB co-finance this project.

II.  PROJECT AREA, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND
A. Prolect Area
2.01     Karachi is the commercial center and largest city of the country
and the provincial capital of Sind, with s population of over 7 milli-rn and
a total urban area of 35,250 hectares. It is also a vibrant and dynamic
industrial center, and it contributes more than 15% of the national GDP, 42Z
of value added in large scale manufacturing, and 25% of the revenues of the
federal government. Being a city of high growth in employment, Karachi
attracts rural migration more than any other city in Pakistan, and because
of this and the natural increase in population, it is growing at about 4.7%
per annum. Contrary to experience in other countries, urbanization in
Pakistan in general and in Karachi specifically is not expect"d to reduce
population growth over the medium term. The urban fertility rate has
remained as high as the rural rate, while urban mortality has declined.
2.02     Karachi has an arid climate with an average annual rainfall of
approximately 200mm (8 inches). The total varies widely, however, and up to
800 mm (32 inches) occasionally falls in a year.
2.03     Karachi's topography is characterized by undulating plains and
coastal flats except for the hilly western part and some scattered hills
elsewhere. The City is traversed by the Lyari and Malir Rivers, both of
which are dry from time to time, particularly in the reaches passing through
the City. Together with their many small tributaries and the City's natural
drains (nullahs), they drain the City of its stormwater and wastewater, and
discharge them into the Arabian Sea, mainly in Karachi Harbour.
B. Existina Water Facilities and Level of Service
2.04     With a present source capacity of 323 mgd and strict rationing of
daily supply of all consumer categories to about 3 or 4 hours per day,
Karachi is able to provide on average about 46 gallons per capita per day
(gpcpd) inclusive of industry and commerce and unaccounted for water
estimated at about 40% of production. Corresponding figures for other
cities in the region are Lahore 81, Islamabad 75, and Delhi 55 gpcpd. When
demands of industry and commerce and unaccounted for water are not included,
the average per capita domestic daily consumption is about 20 gpcpd.
2.05     This relatively low availability of water is not likely to change
in the near future. The close-in, existing surface and groundwater sources
are not reliable because rainrall in the Karachi Region is low and highly
variable. Increased supply from the Indus River, the main source for the
foreseeable future, will require large investments in facilities to convey
the water over a distance of about 80 miles. Progress in developing these
facilities together with additional sewerage facilities will not be rapid
because of the magnitude of the costs relative to the funds expected to be
available.
2.06     The existing water supply depends on three sources.  The oldest
source supplying 6 mgd at Dumlottee is largely exhausted. The recently
completed Hub system supplies 85 mgd (26%) from a multi-purpose dam on the
Hub River via a conduit to Mangho Pir where it enters the primary
distribution



system. The balance of 232 mgd (72%) of existing supply is provided by the
Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply System (GKBWSS), which draws water from
the Indus River at the Kotri Barrage and conveys it by canal and conduit to
Karachi.
2.07     The continuation of the Indus supply from Kotri Barrage for the
projected demands of the city supply is necessary for the secure operation
of the existing system and of any future supply. The immediate additional
requirement of 100 mgd is available from Kotri through the Kinjher lake. A
study completed in June 1988 for the Irrigation Department (the System
Operators) has indicated the need for essential works on the Kalri Baghar
Feeder (KB Feeder) and the Kinjher lake to safeguard the supplies both for
irrigation and domestic use.
2.08     A nominal allowance has been made in the proposed project costs to
help complete these essential works and a KWSB contribution towards the
total cost is proposed, subject to the completion of detailed designs.
2.09     One hundred and fifty-eight (158) mgd, 49% of the total water
produced, is consumed by about 7.0 million domestic consumers (0.9 million
customers); 36 mgd by industry and commerce (11), and 129 mgd or 40% is
unaccounted. A separate 13 mgd is delivered by direct conduit of about 30
km to the Pakistan Steel Mill. Ninety percent of the population of Karachi
are receiving treated water from KWSB in 1988. The remaining 10%, about
700,000 people, draw water from other sources which are susceptible to
pollution and associated health hazards. Approximately 67% of the water
sold is unmetered. Only some 430 bulk customers receive metered sales at
present.
2.10     KWSB recognizes how important leak detection and repair, and
reduction of unaccounted for water are. KWSB has accepted the concept of
metering for retail operations, and it has introduced through Credit
1374-PAK, a pilot project of domestic meters in high income areas of the
City. This has had modest success in enhancing KWSB's recognition of the
inadequacy of its present retail tariff system, which is based on floor area
rather than consumption quantity. KWSB's bulk metering has not been
successful, primarily because approximately two-thirds of the total number
of bulk meters remain in disrepair. These include many master meters which
are designed to measure flows in the primary and secondary systems (see
paras 4.14 and 5.05).
C. Existing Sewerage Facilities
2.11     Most areas of the City are served with conventional separate sewer
networks. However, the sewage produced exceeds the capacity of the network,
which is dilapidated and poorly maintained. In turn, the capacity of the
network exceeds the capacity of the two, twenty-year-old sewage treatment
plants which, due to inadequate maintenance, do not achieve their design
capacity of 20 mgd each. These deficiencies result in sewage overflows and
discharge of sewage in nullahs in the City. This poses a health ha?.ard and
pollutes the marine environment. Initial efforts to improve the facilities
are being made under the sewerage component of the Karachi Special
Development Project. Efforts to further improve the facilities are included



in the sanitation component of the proposed project. The on-going project
and the proposed project are parts of a fifteen-year sewerage master plan to
gradually increase KWSB's capacity to collect and treat the City's wastewater
(para. 3.02). The plan envisages treatment for all of the sewage collected
by the time the planned investments are completed in 2003.
2.12     Environmental Pollution.  Industrial wastes are also a problem.
Many of these effluents are not allowed into the sewers because of the
structural damage they would cause. Furthermore, without pre-treatment many
could interfere with the biological processes involved in the treatment of
the domestic sewage. Most manufacturers, however, are reluctant to add to
their costs by treating wastes, and therefore dispose of them by the
easiest, most convenient method possible into sewers and open drains without
regard for the environment. There are laws prohibiting this, but, at
present, enforcement is weak. The Karachi authorities have indicated that
the laws will be strengthened, and that enforcement actions will be stepped
up in line with agreements outlined in a memorandum of understandIng with
the ADB. These agreements are expected to be incorporated into the legal
documents for the proposed ADB loan.
D. Water Demand and SuRDIV
2.13     The demand for potable water in the Karachi Metropolitan Area (KMA)
has been the subject of severtl studies during the past two decades, the
most recent being the 1985 feasibility study financed by Credit 1374-PAK./i
The estimate below is based on that study with minor modifications to bring
its estimates up to date.
2.14     The growth in the demand for water in the KMA depends principally
on industrial growth, population growth, changes in standards of living, and
changes in the effectiveness of the transm.ssion and distribution system.
.able 2.1 shows the total production compared with the estimated demand from
1985 to 2000 based on three scenarios. Detailed tables showing disaggregated
date for each scenario are available in the Project File. The "Limited
Growth Scenario" adopted as most likely by KWSB planners (and by IDA)
assumes: modest population growth; continuation of the Government's policy
to restrict industrial consumption; increases in living standards including
gradual increases in average per capita domestic consumption from 22 gal/day
in 1985 to 32 gal/day by 2000, and a reduction in transmission and
distribution losses from the current 40% to 25% over the period. The "Low
Growth Scenario" anticipates lower population growth and a lower improvement
in consumption levels. The "High Losses Scenario", representing a
continuation of present trends, is the same as the "Limited Growth Scenario"
except that losses are assumed to continue at the present rate of 40%. The
projected supply totals indicated in the table are less than the scenario
figures throughout the period.
2.15     The best estimate of overall gross demand for water in 1988 is 401
mgd, compared with only 323 mgd of actual available supplies. KWSB manages
Ll Feasibility study for Future Expansion of Karachi Water Supply System -

Consulting Engineers Ltd. for KWSB and KDA.

the shortfall by providing water to different zones of the city on a rotating
basis for only a few hours each day. The Government further restrains demand
for water by prohibiting the establishment of new industrial activities in
the KMA that would be large watex consumers.
2.16     Demand for water is expected to increase 94% to 778 mgd by the year
2000, assuming the successful implementation of demand management and loss
control programs. Otherwise, if present trends continue, the gross demand
will reach 988 mgd by the end of the century. Even under the "Low Growth
Scenario", which assumes lower than expected population growth and only
nominal improvement in consumption levels, the total demand will increase by
300 mgd over the next 12 years.
2.17     The next increase in supply is being financed by Credit 1374-PAK
and will make 28 mgd available by the end of 1989, and another 22 mgd by
1990.  The proposed project would make an additional 100 mgd available by
1992-94.  A follow-on project (Karachi III) planned by KWSB would add an
additional 140 mgd in 1999-2000.  Together, these projects would result in a
290 mgd increase in production.

III. THE PROJECT
A. °tigin of the Prj.ect
3.01     The project is based on consultant studies for water supply and
sewerage done in the first IDA financed project (Credit 1374-PAK) and in the
IDA and ADB co-financed Project (Credit 1652-PAK). The proposed project is
a follow-on to these two projects, both of which were designed to expand
water and sewerage facilities for the City and to strengthen the operational
and firanclal functions of KWSB. The design of the proy-sed project is
based on least cost criteria.
B. Objectives
3.02     The proposed project constitutes the first phase of a two-phase
investment program to expand water production by 240 million gallons per day
(mgd) on average, and to add about 365 mgd of sewerage treatment capacity.
The objectives of the Project are to: (a) increase potable water supply by
100 mgd (about 31%) and further augment water availability by strengthening
loss reduction measures; (b) improve the financial viability of KWSB through
increased revenues, cost reductions, and greater operational efficiency; (c)
improve the organization and management of KWSB; and (d) improve sanitation
in the City including its low-income and coastal areas, by increasing
sewerage coverage by 232 mgd and treatment capacity by 94 mgd.

3.04     The Project's cost is estimated at Rs 6,219.6 million (US$331.8
million equivalent, excluding interest during construction (IDC), and
including US$ 20.0 million for physical contingencies, US$ 39.0 million for
price contingencies and US$ 22.2 million for duties and taxes). The base
estimate of US$250.6 million equivalent is in prices of June 1988. The
foreign exchange component is US$113.5 million, 342 of the estimated total
cost. The estimates are summarized in Table 3.1 and presented in detail in
Annex 5.
3.05     The project's water components are estimated to cost Rs 4,419.5
million (US$227.3 million, including US$ 37.8 million for physical and price
contingencies and US$17.8 million for duties and taxes). The foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$ 89.1 million, 392 of the estimated
total.
3.06     The sewerage components are estimated to cost Rs 1,832.2 million
(US$104.7 militon, including US$22.7 million for physical and price con-
tingencies and US$4.4 million for duties and taxes). The foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$26.2 million, 252 of the estimated total.
3.07     The estimates are based on price experience with contracts under
the on-going Credits 1374-PAK and 1652-PAK. Most of the water components
are at predesign stage. An allowance of 8% has been used for physical
contingencies on costs of water civil works and equipment. The sewerage
works are at predesign stage, and an allowance of 10% has been used for
physical contingencies for their civil works, and one of 5X for their
mechanical and electrical equipment. The annual inflation rates assumed in
estimating the price ccntingencies for the local currency expenditures for
the water component are 7%, 6%, and 42 for fiscal years 1988/89 through
1990/91, and 1.22 thereafter. The assumed annual inflation rates for the
price contingencies for the estimated foreign expenditures are 5.5%, 2.52,
and 0.4% for fiscal years 1988/89 through 1990/91, and 1.2% thereafter.
3.08     The estimated total number of man-months for engineering
consultancies is 5,481. For the water component, the number is 3,560 (2,900
local and 660 internationally recruited). For sewerage, the number is 1,921
(824 local and 1,097 internationally recruited). The estimated man-month
cost is US$2,363 equivalent for local consultants and US$5,464 equivalent
for internationally recruited consultants.
3.09     The estimated total number of man-months for training and technical
and managerial assistance is 1,010 (860 local and 150 internationally
recruited). The estimated man-month cost is US$2,378 equivalent for local
consultants and US$13,600 equivalent for internationally recruited
consultants.

E. Financing
3.10     The proposed project is approximately 75% of KWSB's investment
program for 1988 to 1996 including on-going capital expenditures for the
projects financed in part by Credits 1374-PAK and 1652-PAK, and the
expenditures of funds by KWSB from KMC's annual improvement prog-m./Li
External financing for the proposed project would be provided in parallel by
the ADB (US$81.9 million equivalent), the ODA (US$10.5 million equivalent),
CDC (US$45.9 million equivalent), and IDA (US$125.0 million equivalent). Tne
proposed parallel financing arrangements categorize the Project according to
water supply and institutional strengthening (the Water Supply Component),
and sewerage (the Sewerage Component). IDA and the ODA/CDC would finance the
Water Supply Component (together providing US$181.4 million equivalent), and
the ADB would finance the Sewerage Component including related tecbnical
assistance (US$81.9 million). ODA would provide about US$10.5 million
equivalent of grant funds, ircluding about US$1.5 million in grant funds for
the first year of detailed design and construction supervision and CDC about
US$45.9 million equivalent in loans. ADB would also provide US$2.8 million
for the foreign currency portion of interest during construction for
sewerage. Net of interest financing, the proposed txternal financing of
US$263.3 million will finance 80% of the estimated total project cost, or
85% of the total ret of duties and taxes. It will cover 100% of estimated
foreign exchange costs (US$113.5 million) plus 69% of the estimated local
currency costs. This level of local currency financing is justified (i)
because of the low foreign exchange component (34%), and (ii) because of the
high proportion of low income beneficiaries to be served in the City who
would not be able to afford more than the projected (increasing) tariff
levels. KWSB would finance 9% of total project costs (US$30.0 million) from
internal cash generation, and the GOP and GOS would finance 11% as grants:
5% for water and 6% for sewerage. Table 3.2 below and Annex 7 (page 2 of 5),
present the project financing plan and the entity financing plan of the KWSB,
respectively. The signing of subsidiary loan/credit agreements between GOP
and GOS, GOS and KMC, and KMC and KWSB and fulfillment of all conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the funding agreements with ODA and CDC
are conditions of credit effectiveness. In addition, disbursements for
civil works associated with increased water supply (about 66% of the total
credit amount) is conditional on the effectiveness of the ADB loan.

F. Status of Imilemeit_ation
3.11     By the time the Project is expected to be presented to the Board
(January 1989), works under seven contracts are expected to be in the stage
of detailed design prepiration. These are contracts W6 to W8, and W18 to
W21 (see Annex 5, page 2) for a listing of contracts and estimated costs).
The total value of these contracts is estimated at US$95 million, about 30%
of the estimated cost of the Project. By Board Presentation, detailed
designs for four of these seven contracts will have been completed.
3.12     Detailed designs for civil works contracts to be let during the
first year for the Sewerage Component are expected to be completed by the
time of the ADB Board Presentation (expected April 1989). KWSB has engaged
Sir Malcolm MacDonald and Partners and Associated Consulting Engineers for
the water component, and Balfours Engineering Consultants for the sewerage
components. These consortia are acceptable to the three co-financiers, and
IDA Guidelines were followed in engaging the two firms for the water and
sewerage components.
3.13     Terms of reference for parts of the institutional strengthening
component of KWSB have been prepared by KWSB and reviewed and approved by
IDA. These include the following subprojects: organization study; training
center support; creation of the Development Wing; management training; and
reduction of system losses, metering and systems management. Terms of
reference for thLe remaining subprojects are in preparation.
G. Procurement
3.14     Table 3.3 summarizes the estimated project costs categorized
according to the types of procurement to be used. For the IDA-supportad
components, procurement with an estimated value of US$152.2 million will be
in accordance with IDA Guidelines. Within this total, fifteen contracts for
civil works with estimated values totalling about US$130.9 million including
contingencies will be awarded through International Competitive Bidding
(ICB). Eligible domestic civil works bidders would be afforded a preference
of 7.5% undar ICB prvcurement.  Small contracts (average size is US$0.40
million) for institutional strengthening consisting of minor civil works,
equipment and vehicles, totalling rbout US$2.5 million including
contingencies will be awarded acco::ding to Local Competitive Bidding
procedures (LCB). Consultants have already been recruited for project
execution in accordance with IDA guidelines; additional consultants ana
training will be similarly recruited (US$3.8 million). Local procedures
have been reviewed and found to ensure adequate competition and to encourage
efficiency of procurement, and they do not preclude foreign bidders from
participation. The review also concluded, however, that the procedures do
not fully comply with the IDA Guidelines in some important areas: (a)
insufficient time is allowed by some agencies for bid submission; (b) bid
evaluation criteria are not always sufficiently clear; (c) tbe lowest priced
bid is sometimes favored, rather than the lowest evaluated responsive bid;
and (d) bid opening does not always occur promptly after bid submission.
Assurances were obtained durirn negotiations that IDA Guidelines will be
complied with.



- 18 -
3.15     Contracts for equipment with an estimated value of about US$35.3
million, including contingencies, will be awarded according to ODA's
procurement procedures for mixed credits under the AID and Trade Provision
(ATP) and the ODA's September 19, 1986 co-financing Agreement with IDA.
Procurement for funding by CDC (approximately US$18.1 million, including
contingencies) of both foreign and local costs of the civiJ works for the
,water treatment component is not formally tied. Arrangements will be a
matter for agreement between CDC and KWSB.
3.16     For the ADB-s.pported components, procurement totalling an
estimated US$85.7 million will be carried out in accordance with ADB
guidelines. Contracts for civil works with an estimated value of about
US$70.9 million, for equipment and installation of about US$8.2 million, and
for advisors and training of about US$1.5 million will be awarded according
to ADB procurement procedures for international competitive bidding.
3.17     The land required for the water treatment plants, pumping stations
and conduits is already in the possession of the KWSB. KWSB does not yet
have the land needed for its sewage treatment ponds, but has agreed with ADB
that the land will be acquired, or be granted the right to use the land for
construction of project facilities by the time of ALB's effectiveness of its
loan (presently scheduled for June 1989).

3.18     The proposed IDA credit disbursements by category are shown in
Table 3.4. The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in
Annex 6. The credit of US$125 million would be disbursed in 8-1/2 years.
The disbursement schedule is consistent with the disbursement profile for
the sector and the Region. A special account would be established to
facilitate prompt disbursements against local expenditures and smaller
foreign currency expenditures (see para. 3.20).  Disbursements would be made
against certified statements of expenditures (SOE) for the institutional
strengthening component on all civil works contracts under US$100,000,
locally procured equipment and material contracts under US$50,000, all
training and services contracts, and project agency incremental start-up
costs (staff salaries, etc.) of about US$0.6 million for .he first four years
of implementation of the proposed training center, the consumer education
program, the Development Wing, and the reduction of system losses, metering
and pilot systems management sub-project. The executing agency is familiar
with IDA SOE procedures and has demonstrated that it can comply with the IDA
guidelines.  Supporting documentation f'r disbursements against SOEs would
be retained by KWSB, made available to iDA staff for review on request, and
audited annually by auditors acceptable to IDA (para. 3.27). Disbursements
are expected to continue until June 30, 1997, the proposed Closing Date for
the credit.
3.19     Retrogetive financing.  To expedite the establishment of the
Development Wing, KWSB is proceeding imaediately with the rehabilitation of
existing premises, the construction of new offices, and the purchase of
furniture and office equipment including computers for engineering design
and information management. For this purpose, US$2.0 million will be
allowed in the proposed Credit for the retroactive financing of expenditures
incurred after the appraisal by IDA and before Credit Effectiveness.
3.20     Special Account.  The GOP aareed during neaotiations to oRen and
maintain in US dollars a Special Account for KWSB in the National Bank of
Pakistan with an allocation of US$5.0 million. The opening of, withdrawals
from, and replenishment of the account will be done in accordance with
procedures, terms and ccnditions acceptable to IDA.

J. Trainina
3.21     The Project includes the development of training capability within
KWSB, and the training of KWSB personnel (paras. 4.08 and 4.09). The
organization study (paras. 4.05 and 4.07) will identify training needs
through analysis of desired qualifications for all positions within KWSB and
actual qualifications existing in KWSB. A training manager from a
professional training institute in Pakistan, and the KWSB Training Director,
once identified and recruited, would work closely with the consultants
conducting the organization study to determine the training needs. DurinTt
negotiations, KWSB and IDA discussed the terms of reference for the manuower
and oraanization studies, and KWSB aereed on an action ulan for training
implementation.
K. Imnlementation Schedule
3.22     The project is scheduled by KWSB to be completed in seven years as
is shown in Annex 11. With the near completion of Credit 1374-PAK, KWSB has
demonstrated its ability to implement a modest-sized civil works program
reasonably close to plan. However, the proposed project is several times
larger than that financed by Credit 1374-PAK, and delays should be allowed
for. The proposed price contingencies, disbursement schedule, financial
analysis, and economic evaluation have, therefore, been based on an 8-1.'2
year implementation period, the historical average implementation period for
water and sewerage projects in the Region.



- 22 -
L. Prolect Management and Monitorine
3.23     The Project will be managed initially by an already functioning
Coordination Unit directed by the Senior Chief Engineer reporting to the
Managing Director. The purpose of this unit is to manage start-up activities
of the project. In late 1989, project management responsibilities would be
handed over to the Development Wing (para. 4.17). The Coordination Unit and
then the Development Wing will be responsible for preparation of quarterly
reports for IDA, disbursement applications, and any other information needed
by IDA. The quarterly reports will follow the same format used successfully
in the two on-going IDA-financed projects.
3.24     The scale of the investments planned under the proposed project
requires the establishment of a separate unit to monitor implementation.
The unit would report to the Senior Chief Engineer responsible for managing
the Project. The unit will in due course become a part of the Development
Wing. During negotiations, KWSB and IDA agreed on terms of reference and
staffing of the Coordination Unit, and on an action plan to achieve its
oblective.
M. Pro ect Financial Manaxement. Accounts and Audits
3.25     Project accounts will be maintained by KWSB similar to those used
for the on-going projects supported by Credits 1374-PAR and 1652-PAR.
Project accounts for the institutional component are to be structured to
aggregate costs for each individual subcomponent (e.g., study, equipment,
technical assistance activity).
3.26     There have been delays in completing KWSB's external audits for
1985/86 and 1986/87 as required under the credit agreements for the on-going
IDA operations (Credit 1374-PAR and Credit 1652-PAK). The audit covenants
require the submission of audits to IDA no later than 9 months after the end
of the KWSB fiscal year. The delays were due to KWSB's decision to delay
external audits while it was modernizing the accounting systems it inherited
from its two predecessor agencies./l The modernization is now complete.
The accounts for fiscal years 1985/86 and 1986/87 have been completed, and a
chartered accounting and auditing firm acceptable to IDA was engaged to carry
out the two audits. During negotiations, KWSB submitted these audits to IDA.
IDA has reviewed the audits and has found them to be satisfactor .
3.27     For the future, independent auditors acceptable to IDA should
conduct annual audits in accordance with IDA Guidelines, and KWSB should
submit to IDA the audited income statements, sources and uses of funds
statements, and balance sheets together with audits of SOEs for the
institutional strengthening component and of the Special Account, no later
than 9 months after the end of the KWSB fiscal year. During negotiations,
KWSB agreed to an audit covenant which covers the conditions above.
/1 Internal audits were intensified during this period.

IV. THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A. Functions and Powers
4.01     The Project would be executed by KWSB which is currently
implementing the first Karachi Water Supply Project and also the water and
sewerage components of the Karachi Special Development Project. KWSB was
established on February 1, 1983 under a revision of the Sind Local
Government Ordinance of 1979 as a semi-autonomous organization within KMC
responsible for the production, treatment and distribution of water, and for
the collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater within the area
administered by KMC. KWSB took over functions that were performed previously
by the KDA (water production), the KWMB (water distribution), and the KMC
(sewerage and sewage treatment). The ordinance enables KWSB to operate and
maintain the system and undertake new capital works, as well as provide for
the establishment and adjustment of tariffs for water supply and sewerage,
subject to approval by KMC.  Under the ordinance, KMC is responsible for
KWSB's liabilities.
4.02     On November 30, 1987, the ordinance of 1979 das amended to expand
KWSB's board membership. The new board consists of the Mayor (Chairman),
Deputy Mayor, 3 elected KMC councillors, a GOS appointee, and the Managing
Director of KWSB. The Board meets monthly to resolve major issues. The
Managing Director is the chief executive of KWSB with powers to carry out
day to day operations. The budget is developed annually, and is approved by
the Council of the KMC in full session.
B. Staffing and Organization Structure
4.03     On its creation in 1983, KWSB began with about 3,000 employees from
KWMB, 2,000 from KDA and 1,000 from KMC. The present total is 10,545 (11,751
positions are authorized). Annual growth in the number of employees during
the past four years has averaged about 15X. This rate of growth exceeds the
growth rate for water production and revenue generation, and is one of the
main causes for expenditures rising faster than and exceeding revenues.
Most o:e the 4,500 people employed since the creation of KWSB are unskilled
laborers. In addition to overstaffing, there are other manpower and
staffing problems having to do with promotion, transfers, staff
qualifications, recruitment, career development, and performance evaluation
which KWSB should deal with (paras. 4.05 to 4.07).
4.04     There are also problems which result from the organization's
structure. The present structure consists of five departments, although, in
practice, there are six: Secretariat, Finance, Assessment Tax and Revenue,
Bulk Water Supply, Water Distribution and Sewerage (officially with Bulk
Water Supply in one department), and Co-ordination and Planning. Each
department is further divided into divlsions, sections and circles. The
structure has been adjusted over time in response to crisis situations, which
has led to further problems. For example, water distribution and sewerage
operate as one department often causing sewerage operations to go unattended
when there is a water crisis in the City.
4.05     These problems and these concerning manpower noted above were
identified during the preparation of the proposed project and brought to the



- 24 -
attention of the management of KWSB and the GOB. Detailed Terms of Reference
(TOR) and a short list of consultants for a manpower study (funded by KWSB)
and an organization study (funded by ODA)to deal with the issues were
developed by KWSB and submitted for approval to the IDA appraisal mission
(copies of the TOR are in the Project Files). The TOR were considered
satisfactory, and the manpower study is presently near completion by KWSB.
4.06     During nezotiations. KWSB and IDA discussed the findings of
manpower-study and manmnnnt Rlan to control the aLrowth of Dpersonnel and
adminisrrative costs and on an action plan to aeccom2lsh this oeti.
4.07     Durina neaotiations. agreement was reached between KWSB and IDA on
an action Dlan to implement the oraanization study.L  The 2rincipal aim of
the study is to-deal with the structural and broader manpower-and stAffina
issues of KWSB (Dara. 3.21).
C.   Sl8J
4.08     KWSB does not have a training program for its staff except for
training carried out in the accounting and finance department under Credit
1374-PAK. The training provided under Credit 1374-PAK has been effective
(paras. 1.16 to 1.19), and this success has encouraged the developing of
training plans for the rest of KWSB to be implemented in the proposed project
(para. 3.21).
4.09     IDA would suppcrt as a part of the proposed project the development
of a training center including the rehabilitation of a building and the
construction of a building to house the center, and technical and managerial
assistance to develop training capability.  During nexotiatigp. KSB and IDA
discussed the terms of refermee 2rgnared by CWSB to dleyelQp the center, and
agreement yas reached on an action 2_an to accomplish this objective.
D. Manaaement and Administration
4.10     Significant improvements in management and pdministrative procedures
have been made by KWSB since its formation five years ago (paras. 1.18 to
1.19), but further improvements are necessary. Coordination between
different parts of the organization should be improved. Better documentation
of systems and procedures is needed. In the budget process, costs are being
controlled, but in many areas sufficient funds are not budgeted to maintain
sound operating and maintenance standards. Budgeting procedures should be
revised to strengthen the role of operations staff In budget decision making
(see also para. 4.15).
4.11     During the preparation of the Project, diagnostic surveys and
feedback discussions were held by Bank staff vith the management and key
staff of KWSB and the GOS to identify management and administration problems.
These meetings concluded that the problems should be addressed in connection
with the proposed project, and that the first step should be to undertake an
organization study (as mentioned in paras. 4.05 and 4.07 above).
LI The PC-II for the organization study Uas been cleared by the Board of
Directors of the NVSB, by 00S and by the GOP.



- 25 -
E. Maintenance
4.12     Some of the maintenance practices of the KWSB are deficient in key
reEtpects and should be improved. The majority of field sites are
.verstaffed. The central maintenance workshop is under-utilized since
equipment from distribution and collection pumping sites usually is sent to
private workshops for repair. Equipment O&M manuals frequently are
unavailable. Preventive maintenance requirements for much of the electrical
and mechanical equipment are unavailable, and little maintenance is done for
this equipment.
4.13     Preventive maintenance of equipment in the bulk water system is
generally good except for the bulk meters, of which usually about two thirds
are in disrepair. The maintenance of the sewage pumping stations is
adequate, but that of the water pumping stations is not. The availability
of standby pumpsets, however, makes maintenance of the latter less urgent.
The cost of breakdowns versus preventive maintenance has not been studied
adequately. Maintenance of the sewage collection system is limited largely
to clearing sewer stoppages. Scheduled cleaning of particularly troublesome
sewer stretches is not normally done. Most of the effort of water
maintenance crews is to clear blocked water pipes and to operate valves.
Drawings displaying valve locations are not available for most valves.
4.14     Although some spare parts for pumping equipment for water
distribution and sewage collection are available locally, imported spare
parts necessary for bulk water supply are in short supply due to the lack of
foreign exchange. During negotiations, agreement was reached with KWSB on
an action-Rlan to repair bulk meters and install new ones (para. 5.05).
Also, durina negotiations. aareement was reached between the GOP and IDA
that the GOP will make available sufficient forei=n currency in exchanae for
ruDees to enable KWSB to ourchase necessarv spare Darts.
4.15     Budgets for funds for operations and maintenance typically are
prepared in detail, but are subsequently reduced to reflect available funds
and then have little relationship with appropriate performance and
engineering standards. Operations and maintenance records are kept, but
usually are not used in analyzing equipment performance or in controlling
costs. Records of labour inputs with respect to work performed (except for
work performed by private contractors) usually are not kept for the
distribution and collection systems. During negotiations, agreements were
reached between KWSB and IDA on an action-plan to strengthen the budaetina
system to take into account adeauate standards in order to imDrove operations
and maintenance.
4.16     Also agreements were reached on actions to develop sYstems and
procedures for maintenance, the first steD of which is the inclusion of the
sublect in the oraanization study (oaras. 4.05 to 4.07).
F. Project Execution Capability
4.17     In the past, KWSB has relied on KDA for its engineering,
procurement administration, and construction supervision on large projects.
To facilitate the implementation of the proposed project, KWSB recently
established a Coordination Unit (para. 3.23) for the purpose of managing the
project. Also, KWSB recently decided to expand its capability in these areas



- 26 -
by means of a newly created unit to begin in 1989 to take responsibility for
new project development. The second unit, referred to by KWSB as its
Development Wing, will undertake the plsnning, engineering, procurement
administration, and construction supervision for all phases of project
execution. Such an organization was created and developed successfully in
KDA when the first bulk water scheme was prepared in 1951 by the Central
Engineering Authority and built under the aegis of KDA. The approach is now
to be used by KWSB starting with a nucleus of engineering and finance staff.
As engineering designs and procurement documents for the proposed project
are completed, the nucleus would be expanded to carry out tendering
administration, bid evaluation, contract negotiations and award, contract
management, and construction supervision. This is expected to commence in
mid-1989, at which point, the staff of the Coordinating Unit would become
key members of the Wing. Staffing requirements are to be identified in
analyses by consultants in the organization study. The recommendations of
the study will have to be approved by the KMC and GOS.
4.18     The proposed project would refurbish existing KWSB premises during
the start-up period, and would build and equip new offices nearby. Also,
technical assistance and computer equipment would be provided for
engineering and project management. During negotiations, KWSB agreed to
staff the Development Wing in accordance with the recommendations of the
organization and manpower-studies (paras. 3.24. 4.06. and 4.07).
G. Computerization
4.19     In the past four years, KWSB has computerized and integrated its
systems for payroll, financial accounting, fixed assets accounting,
Inventory control, purchasing, control and monitoring of vehicles and fuel
purchases, and financial reporting. The computerized bulk and retail
consumer billing and collection systems are Lear completion.
4.20     Employee medical records and medical payments are manually
produced, inefficient and cumbersome. Medical funds often are wasted and
misused. Registers and ledgers for project accounting also are produced
manually and very inefficiently. Responsibility and accountability for
accounts are fragmented among several departments; there are serious
deficiencies in communications between the departments; and their records
are not kept up to date. There are frequent delays in making payments to
contractors. Durina negotiations, assurances were obtained from KWSB that
it would extend its existinQ comouterization consultancy contract to
complete the on-aoinx work with the retail billing system and to address the
above problems.
V. FINANCES
A. Past Performance and Current Financial Position
5.01     Net Income.  Notwithstanding KWSB's recently strengthened financial
systems, its revenues have not kept pace with its costs, and net income has
been negative for the three years 1984/8! to 1986/87 (Table 5.1). Operating
revenues (including subsidies from KMC for sewerage operations)Li covered
/1 KMC is obligated, according to the Sind Ordinance 1983 (Amended), to
cover losses incurred by KWSB.



- 27 -
on average about 85% of annual operating expenses, and collections
(excludiug the KMC subsidy) amounted to 57% of billings for the period.
5.02     The main reasons for the negative net income have been the
unwillingness of the authorities to increa-e water tariffs and implement
sewerage charges while personnel and administrative costs have been rising
sharply. The subjects of personnel and administrative costs are being/will
be addressed in the manpower and organization studies and the manning plan
discussed in an earlier section (paras.4.06 and 4.07). The question of
revenues is discussed below.
5.03     Tariff Level and Structure.  A summary of the previous and current
tariff level and structure is in the Project File. The last tariff increase
averaged about 33% (25% for domestic and 50% for ocher categories) and
occurred in the Fall of 1985 (the previous increase was in 1981).
5.04     Unmetered supply to individual customers accounts for about 67% of
the water produced. Charges are based on customer floor areas and plot
sizes. So long as this practice continues, tariffs, of course, cannot
moderate wasteful consumption. Durina negotiations, KWSB agreed to an action
Dlan to (i) undertake a study of metering for all of its customers, and (ii)
prepare and imDlement a metering orogram for customers in accordance with the
recommendations of the study and in agreement with IDA.
5.05     Thirty three percent (33%X of KWSB water produced is sold to bulk
consumers (Table 5.2), principally industrial and defense installations.
Bulk consumers are billed on the basis of bulk meter readings, but two-thirds
of the meters are in disrepair or in dispute with the consumer. During
negotiations. KWSB agreed on an action program to reDair existing bulk meters
and inst-all new ones where needed (Rara, 4.14).

- 29 -
5.06     Current tariff levels are far below the long-run marginal cost for
water and sewerage. The long-run marginal cost with the proposed project is
estimated to be about Rs 28 per 1,000 gallons based on a 9% opportunity cost
of capital (see Annex 10), whereas the average tariff is Rs 2.6 per 1,000
gallons. The highest tariff to bulk consumers is about Rs 9 per 1,000
gallons, and to retail consumers, the average tariff is about Rs 2 per 1,000
gallons. Private bulk suppliers in Karachi are known to resell KWSB water
in bulk quantities at about Rs 13 to Rs 20 per 1,000 gallons. There is
considerable scope for increasing tariffs.
5.07     KWSB has proposed to the KMC Council several tariff increases in the
past, but only one (in 1985 in connection with Credit 1652-PAK) was approved.
The changeover in 1981 from a billing system based on annual rental values to
one based on floor area was supposed to make it easier to increase tariffs.
Hovever, in actual experience, this has not been the case. Tariffs have been
considlered by the decision-makers mainly in light of their political impact
and proposals to raise tariffs have been rejected. The situation is
exacerbated by the fact that Karachi is a city with close to one million
customers who are not metered, so there is little restraint on consumption.
The lack of metered consumption has led to wasteful consumption by all income
groups.   During negotiations. KWSB aareed to carry out a study of its tariff
structure to, inter alia. examine the feasibility of imDroving the present
relationshiRs between consumDtion, costs, uricina, and affordability, and to
recommend to the authorities an action proAram of adAustments in the tariff
structure.
5.08     In addition to the bulk and retail sales revenue, about 21% of the
total revenue is a subsidy from KMC to cover sewerage operations, and 4% is
from charges for reconnection, home repairs, fines, etc., as shown in
Table 5.2.

73%-83% of billings for the period FY 1985 to 1987. Collections for each
year averaged slightly under 70% of annual billings.
5.10     Collection performance for bulk water supplied to "public bodies"
has averaged about 44% over the past three years. This group consists of
institutions such as Defense Housing, District Councils and cantonments which



- 30 -
receive water in bulk and redistribute to residents wlthin their areas or
colonies. The poor collection performance is due to about 20 institutions in
this aroup which account for about 85% of the arrears. In addition, the
number of bulk customers (commercial as well as public bodies) whose meters
are not functioning is high. In May 1987, there were 287 bulk meters not
working out of the 430 total. For 1986/87, the amount billed on these 287
meters was approximately Rs 88 million, about 60% of the total billed for
bulk supplies. When a meter is not working, KWSB bills according to meter
readings taken the year before.
5.11     Bills to "government properties" such as Government hospitals,
libraries, and offices, are not being paid at all. The amount billed for
1986/87 was Rs 19 militon, and the total in arrears is about Rs 76 million.
One customer, the KMC, accounts for two-thirds of the is 76 million.
5.12     KWSB has taken steps to adazess these arrear3, and progress is being
achieved in some cases. The cantonment boards (Rs 7.3 million in arrears)
and Defense Housing Authority (Rs *.8 million in arrears) have agreed to pay
in 3 installments over the next 3 years. KMC has provided in its current
budget Rs 20 million for payment to KWSB and has committed itself to similar
annual payments in the future.  KWSB collected about Rs. 54 million of
revenue from -ublic institutions (e.g., "public bodies" and "aovernment
properties") since the end of December 1987. During negotiations, PS.
i         aareed to improve its billing and collection oerformance as indicated i:i
Table 5.3 through improved enforcement and consumer education in accordance
with an accounts receivables covenant requiring KWSB. by December 31, 1989.
to undertake measures adeauate to ensure, starting with the fiscal year
1990/91. that its accounts receivables for water coasumotion by all
categories of consumers are current at a level of not less than 90%. and
that all bills issued by KWSB for water consumption are settled within three
months of the billins date.

B.  F_utire Financial Performance
5.13     Analysis of the impact of the proposed investments on KWSB's
finances (Annex 7) indicates that even with collection improvements, tariff
increases will be needed if KWSB is to cover its operations and maintenance
costs and service its debt from July 1991, and, i-A addition from July 1992,
to contribute 20% towards its capital expenditures. This objective would be
a reduction of the target of the existing self-financing covenant with which
KWSB presently is not complying: i.e., a contribution of 30% to investments
by July 1988. (A summary of the financial covenants for KWSB in ongoing IDA
operations is presented in Annex 12). The reduction is appropriate because
of debt service and affordability considerations (para. 6.06). Key
monitoring indicators are presented in Annex 9).
5.14     The operational aesets of KWSB at present are estimated to have a
total value of Rs 2,854 million at mid-1987 prices. The total is expected
to increase fourfold to about Rs 11,000 million by fiscal year 1996/97, by
which time all of the major components of the ongoing projects and the
proposed project will have been commissioned. Most of the new asseta will
have been financed by borrowing, and, as a result, debt repayments will
increase from approximately Rs 53 million a year in FY1993 to Rs 269 million
a year in FY1997.
5.15     The water tariff increases proposed, together with the sewerage
charge discussed below, to meet the planned self-financing targets are
annual 10% increases each year in July 1991 and 1992 changing to adjustments
for annual inflation each year starting July 1, 1993; and in addition, one
35% increase by Board Presentation (January 1989), implementation of the
agreed charge for sewerage by July 1, 1989 (75% of the water charge; this
percentage to be maintained thereafter; para. 5.16); and a 35% increase in
water tariffs on July 1, 1990.11
5.16     KWSB is planning to resubmit its 1986 proposal to introduce a
surcharge on the water bill as a means of generating revenues to cover
sewerage operations. Under this proposal, the surcharge would replace the
KMC conservancy tax. The surcharge would be 75% of the water bill. Half of
the surcharge collections would be handed over to KMC to pay for its ongoing
conservancy activities,L2 and the other half would be retained by KWSB.
5.17     When this sewerage charge is introduced, some of the institutions
that are not presently paying conservancy tax, and those who are paying
conservancy tax but have their own sewerage system may noa be willing to pay
the new charge or may ask for a reduction in the percentage level,  There is
little Justification to exempt them from payment as they contribute to
environmental pollution, and most of them discharge their sewage into the
KWSB sewage system.
Ll These targets and the ones mentioned in para. 5.18 do not preclude the
tariff study described in para. 5.07.
12 Conservancy activities include maintenance of public lavatories, fire
brigade operations; etc.



- 32 -
5.18     During negotiations, KWSB agreed to:  (a) raise its tariffs to
achieve coverage of at least its cash oRerations and maintenance costs plus
debt service starting with FY1991/92. and startina with FY1992/93 and
thereafter to contribute in addition at least 20% toward its annual cavital
expenditure; (b) implement inflation-based annual increases: and(c)
introduce a sewerage charge.  The adjustments to be made in each case should
be on or before the dates, and no less percentaQes than those indicated above
in Dara. 5.15.
VI. PROJECT BENEFITS, ECONOMIC EVALUATION, AND RISKS
A. Backaround
6.01     The Project would provide piped water facilities for approximately
2.5 m'llion people, and sewerage for 1.9 million people by 1996. It would
contriuate to a more reliable and safer water supply for the 7.0 million
people presently served, through equipment for improved operation and
maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing water and sewerage networks.
At present, the City experiences low water pressure and intermittent and
sometimes contaminated supply. The Project would also improve supply to
industrial and commercial enterprises thereby improving their productivity.
An additional benefit would be significant savings in operating costs and
the postponement of capital investments due to reduction of unaccounted for
water.
6.02     Among the important non-quantifiable project benefits are:
increased land values as a result of reductior. of pollution in the City and
its coastal areas through sewage treatment and control of industrial
effluent; generation of new commercial and recreational activities;
strengthening of the tourism industry; and significant health benefits.
Regarding the latter, it is estimated that 30% of all reported cases of
illness and 40% of deaths in Pakistan are attributable to water-borne
diseases. The health benefits would especially accrue to lower-income
groups which have not previously had access to sufficient clean water and
water-borne sewage disposal.
6.03     Delaying the Project would entail expenditures by households and
industries to alleviate water shortages and inadequate waste disposal. They
would continue the practices of constructing water storage tanks above
dwellings, drilling private wells, and constructing septic tanks in areas
unsuitable for them.
B. Re-Use of Effluent
6.04     KWSB has undertaken a prefeasibility study of possibilities for
using treated effluent for farming, industrial cooling, and irrigation of
parks. The results of the study are positive, and KWSB plans to undertake
with ADB financing a more comprehensive study to identify investment
options.



- 33 -
C.  Environmental ImRact
6.05     The environmental impact of the project would be positive.  The
periodic contamination of the City's water distribution network, because of
wastewater infiltration resulting from negative pressures in the system,
would be kept from worsening, and in some cases would be reduced. Incidence
of water-borne diseases would be reduced. Pollution of coastal areas in
Karachi would be reduced and the environment improved through the p-ovision
of three new sewage treatment plants and the implementation of institutional
strengthening measures, nationally and locally.
D. Affordability
6.06     Customers in the lowest income category are estimated to have an
average household income of Rs 1,250 per month (in 1986 prices). The water
charge and conservancy tax billed to this group total about Rs 11.2 on
average, about 0.9% of the average household income. Assuming a 35% increase
in water rates in 1988 and again in 1990, and implementation of a sewerage
surcharge in 1989 at 75% of the water charge, the total average bill would '.e
Rs 31.82 in 1990. This amounts to 2% of the lowest income group's average
household income of Rs 1,520 at 1990 prices assuming a 5% increase in income
per year, or 3% assumin6 incomes do not increase between 1986 and 1990. This
2% is believed to be the limit of what could be charged to these consumers
given the poverty level and the political implications.
E. Poverty ImDact
6.0'     About one half of the new water and sewerage connections would be
for the increasing population of the City. The population of Karachi is
expected to increase by 3.2 million people over the project period. Of
these, about 2.5 million people would be provided with water and 1.9 million
witn sewerage connections. Since it is estimated that approximately 64% of
the increase will be made up of immigrants, mostly from poorer areas, It is
estimated that of the beneficiaries, at least 1.5 million receiving water
and 1.1 million receiving sewerage will have incomes below the poverty
threshold .Ll
6.08     Household water connections will be provided also to about
1.2 million people (2,000 new connections/mo x 12 mo. x 7 years x 7 persons
per household) who are already inhabitants of the City today without piped
water. Service through provision of standpipes to about: 1.2 million people
will also be a part the Project. Of those 2.4 million, at least 1.7 million
are estimated to have incomes below the poverty threshold. Public sewerage
would also be provided to about 1.9 million persons presently in the City
without this service. About 37% of these are estimated to be below the
poverty threshold.
/1 On the assumption that 36% of the City's population increase is made
up of natural increase (1.2 million), whose social structure reflects that
of the City (35% poor), and 64% of immigrants (2.1 million), of whom 75%
would be poor.



- 34 -
F. Rate of Return
6.09     Internal financial rate of return calculations have been made taking
the projected incremental water sales due to the Project as the measure of
benefits. Capital and operating cost streams and revenues, excluding taxes
and duties, are indicated in Annex 10, at prices of June 1988. It is assumed
that without the Project, there would be a gradual decline in water sales due
to increases in operating problems and water losses. The calculated internal
return of 8% understates the economic return of the Project since it excludes
benefits not reflected in sales revenue, e.g., reductions in health and
environmental risks, Increases in labor productivity and employment
opportunities, increases in property values, the promotion of economic
development, and improved institutional capabilities. Also, there is a
significant consumer's surplus with respect to the figures used; even with
the additional water being added by the Project, the total availability of
water is projected to remain insufficient with respect to essential demand.
J   Least Cost SolutLi
6.10     The proposed project constitutes the least-cost solution for meeting
the City's water and sewerage needs. Construction of the parallel conduit
transmission system to bring water from the Indus River to Karachi has been
calculated by KWSB's engineering consultants to be the least-cost
alternative. The selected sewage treatment alternative is the least-cost
solution given the high cost of land and relatively high cost of power
consumption associated with pumping in the area.
H. Risks
6.11     The main risks to the Project are possibilities of delays in
implementation, ana of insufficient local funds. Delays in implementation,
unless caused by lack of finance or circumstances such as prolonged strikes,
seem unlikely, and their probability is judged to be low. A conservative
approach has been taken in estimating the time required fGr implementation,
and several preparatory actions are already underway. Land has been acquired
for the water component, and land for the sewage treatment facility is to be
provided mainly frrm property already owned by the Government. Advisers to
provide guidance and training on project execution have been employed and are
on site. There is strong support from GOS both for implementation of the
physical components and for the institutional strengthening.
6.12     With regard to the availability of local funds, the financing plan
calls for 80% of the funds to be provided by IDA, ODA/CDC, and ADB.
Increased tariffs and collections should ensure KWSB's ability to provide
its share, and the remainder is well within GOS/GOP ability.
VII.  ASSURANCES, AGREEMENTS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Agreements reached at negotiations:
(a) GOP would provide sufficient foreign exchange to enable KWSB
to purchase necessary spare parts (para. 4.14);



- 35 -
(b) KWSB would control the growth of personnel and administrative
costs according to an agreed manning plan (para. 4.06);
(c)  RWSB would cause the completion of the immediate works
required on the Kalri Baghar Feeder and Kinjher Lake (action
plan item, paras. 2.07 and 2.08);
(d) KWSB would carry out the study to be made of KWSB's
organization, manpower, and staffing issues in accordance with
an agreed timetable (action plan item, paras. 4.07 and 4.16);
(e) KWSB would develop a KWSB training center according to an
agreed action plan (action plan item, paras. 3.21 and 4.09);
(f) KWSB would repair bulk meters and install new ones according

(para. 3.24);
(1) KWSB would submit annual audit reports prepared by independent
auditors carried out in accordance with IDA Guidelines and
submitted no later than 9 months after the end of each fiscal
year (para. 3.27);
(m) KWSB would undertake a study of metering for customers, and
prepare and implement a metering program in accordance with
the recommendations of the study (para. 5.04);
(n) KWSB would carry out a study of its tariff structure, and
recommend to the authorities a program of tariff structure
adjustments (para. 5.07);
(o) KWSB would improve billing and collection performance in
accordance with an accounts receivables covenant requiring
KWSB, by December 31, 1989, to undertake measures adequate to
ensure, starting with the fiscal year 1990/91, that its
accounts receivables for water consumption by all categories
of consumers are current at a level of not less than 90%, and



- 36 -
that all bills issued by KWSB for water consumption are settled
within three months of the billing date.(para. 5.12);
(p) KWSB would comply with a financial covenant which would
require .WSB to generate cash from charges to customers
sufficient to cover cash operations and maintenance cost plus
debt service in FY1991/92, and, in addition, to cover at least
20% of its capital expenditures starting with FY1992/93 and
thereafter (para. 5.18); and
(q) KWSB would generate sufficient cash to implement a program of
tariff adjustments on or before the dates, and in no less
percentages, than those indicated in paras 5.15 and 5.18.
7.02     Conditions of Effectiveness:  The effectiveness of ODA and CDC
loans/credits and signature of subsidiary loan agreement between GOS, KMC
and KWSB. During negotiations, agreement was reached between GOP and IDA to
link effectiveness with disbursements of the water component on the
effectiveness of the ADB loan. Disbursements for civil works associated
with increased water supply (about 83X of total works of the water
component) would not be made until the ADB loan is declared effective.
7.03     Subject to agreement on the above, the Project would be suitable
for a Credit in the amount of SDR 97.1 million (US$125 million equivalent)
on standard terms, of which US$2 million would be retroactive for
expenditures from March 1, 1988.

STAFF APRIsAL BRPORT
SECOND ARACEI WAT2R SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
la%nned Imurovements to Water Sunnl  System
A   rouni
1.       The proposed project iL part of a continuum of planning and
development of the Greater Karachi wator supply systm initiated in the
early 1950a. The government ha  completed the firat three phaes of the
Greater Karachi Water Supply Scheme begun In 1953 which, along with the Hub
system and earlier Dumlottee system now provide 1.47 NM3/d (323 rgd) which
is far from sufficient to supply current needs. The Firat Karachi Water
Supply Project (Credit 1374 Pak), now underway, ia flinucing Phase IV of
GKWSS which will add 0.23 MO3/M (50 mgd) for a total of 1.69 M[3/d (373
mgd) by 1990. The Karachi Special Development Project (Credit 1652 Pak) is
financing the rehabilitation of critical sections of the bulk supply
system. Credit 1374 also included technical assistance to conduet a
comprehensive study of future water needs to the year 1025. Based on
information provided In that study, there presently exists a service
deficit of approximately 0.35 Mm3/d (77 ugd) and the demand for water will
increase by approximately 20 to 30 mgd per year between now and the year
2000. The study concluded that even with successful implementation of a
recommended loss reduction and demand management program, it will be
necessary to provide significantly expanded supply to avoid further
degradation of consumption levels, which at 82 lpcpd (18 gpcpd). Net of
transmission losses and exclusive of water consumed by non-domestic users
(industrial, commercial, ete.) are already grossly inadequate.
2.       Phase V of the CKMWSS recomanded by the consultants called for an
additional 1.09 RM3/d (240 mgd) of bulk water supply with associated
treatment facilities. Because the cost estimates for this proposal exceeded
the resources available for investment, the plan was later revised so as to
optimize the unit cost of providing water without exceeding the resource
constraint imposed by KWS3's financial capability. The revised Phase V plan
consists o0 two consecutive stages of 0.45 MO3/d (100 mgd) each, of which
the proposed project would be the first stage. The second 0.45 M3/d (100
mgd) would be developed to come online In the later half of the 1990a after
satisfactory progress has been made on the-first phase.
B. Proiect Components
3.       The following is an outline of components in the water project.
For more details refer to the schedule of project components in Annex 2.
The layout of the proposed physical components is shown on IBRD Map
Nos. 20572 and 20'49.

4.       The improvements to the bulk water supply system will be designed
to provide approximately 0.45 MO3/d (100 mad) additional water at the end
of this proposed project, expandable to 0.91 1b3/d (200 mgd) during the
next stage.
S.       The new conveyance system will abstract raw vater from the
Kinjhar-Gujjo Canal at Gujjo for conveyance to Karachi and treatment at
Pipri and Northeast Karachi.
Conveyance Svstm - Guile to Dhabeii
6.       The existing tall regulator on the Haleji-Gujjo Link Canal vill be
replaced by a new tail regulator at the outfall of that canal Into a new
Gujjo-Gharo Canal (ref). A head regulator for the now canal vill be
constructed at the offtake from the Klnjhar-Gujjo (KG) Canal and vill have
a design capacity of 1.20 Mn3/d (265 mgd).
New Guiie - ghare Creek (CGG  Canal 
7.       A new 17.7 km concrcte lined canal vill rum parallel to the
existing canal along Its north side from Gujjo to Gharo Creek. The nev
canal vill have an initial design capacity of 0.50 W3'4d (110 .gd) vhich
can be expanded later to 1.20 Ib3/d (265 mgd) by ralising the embaniment.
Chare Creek ;
8.       Gharo Creek will be crossed by a syphon 2 Km long. The syphon will
be constructed In-situ as part of a tvin box conduit. One first box will be
constructed during the proposed project, and the second box will be added
in the future. The Inlet works will incorporate screens and facilities
will be provided to isolate the boxes with stoplogs.
Gharo Creek - Dhabeli Conduit
9.       A 10 km coanduit will connect Gharo Creek Syphon with Dhabeji
Pumping Station, running parallel to the existing conduit along Its north
side. Th Gharo - Dhabeji conduit is designed for an ultimate capacity -f
0.97 WM3/d (214 ugd) as a tvin reinforced concrete box conduit with
internal dimensions of 3.3. x 3.3m (10.8 ft x 10.8 ft) for each section.
One box with a capacity of 0.49 MN3Od (107 mud) will be constructed during
the proposed project and the second box will be added in the future.
Chambers at 5 km intervals will allow access for maintenance vehicles, and
the design will Incorporate facilities for Isolation of sections of the
conduit with stoplogs.

Dhiabeii puiiint Station
10.      The Dhaboji Pumping Station will be expanded on a 2.3 hectare site
(5.7 acres) located to the northeast side of the existing station. The now
facilities will add pumping capacity of 0.48 WM3Id (105 mgd) at 67m
(220 ft) head.
II.      The conduit at Dhabeji will terminate as an open intake/overflow
structure. Water will pass through a screen chamber containing fixed box
screens and mechanically cleaned band screens before entering the suction
conduit.
12.      Pumps will be double suction vertical spindle type, driven through
a gearbox by dual-fuel engines using as as the primary fuel. The pumpsets
will be contained in a pumphouse 16. x 41. (55 ft x 135 ft) including a
laydown area at the end of the pumphouse under the comand of the station
crane. The pump house will contain three duty and two standby pumpeets.
Space on the site will be reserved for construction of a second pumping
station if the sam capacity in the future.
13.      Air vessels will be provided outside the pumphouses for surge
protection to the pumping main.
14.      In the event of reduced demand, excess water will be spilled at
the intake/overflow structure. A syphon will be constructed beneath the
existing 1.27 Mm3Ud (280 mgd) conduit to discharge into an overflow channel
located to the south of the existing conduit. The overflow channel will
connect into the existing overflow canal.
Service Buildincs and Staff Housing
15.      A workshop and administration building will be provided adjacent
to the pumping station. Staff housing will be located in the existing staff
housing compound. Houses will be provided for staff grades 4 and above.
Dhabeii Pumpint Main
16.      The project will finance construction of a new 4.6 km pumping main
to Dhabeji High Point with a capacity of 0.48 Mm3/d (105 mgd), to run
parallel to the existing four pumping mains on the east side. The pumping
main will consist of two buried steel pipelines each 1500mm (59 in) in
diameter. The upper end of the pipelines will discharge into an outfall
structure containing flap gates to prevent reverse flow to also allow
isolation of-the pipelines for maintenance. Leakage past the flap gates
would be removed by pumping from a sump in the outfall structure. A cross
connection will be provided between the outfall structure and the existing
conduit.

17.      A new 51 km conduit with a first stage design capacity of 0.48;
m3/d (105 .gd), of simllar design to that of the condult from Gharo-Dhaboji
conduit, will rum parallel to the existing,Dhubeji-Northeast Karachi
conduit. Twenty-one syphous will be constructed as strengthLAed conduit
section.
18.      In general the conduit will rum parallel to the exasting conduit
on the south side. This will place the new conduit on the downalopes side
of the ezisting conduit vhere It will be protected from damage causes by
surface water ru-off end vhere any rum off via the nullaha will be avay
from the existing conduit. The conduit will follow a detour aroimd the
ridge pierced by the existing tunnel near Pipri. Upon completion of the new
conduit, the twanel section could be taken out of servlce for maintenace
while still maintainin a reduced flow.
Plort Treatment Works
19.      The existing treatment works at Pipri have sufficient to provide
full treatment for 0.23 W/3/d (50 mgd) sn partial treatment for an
additional 0.11 MO3/M (25 mgd). The partial treatment is provided by a low"
lift pimping station and clarifiers which were constructed and financed
under Credit 1374 PAK. A shortage of funds In 1983 precluded the inclusion
of the filters at that time. The proposed project will provide filters vwth
a capacity of 0.11 V.3/d (25 mgd) to complement the earlier investment and

20.      The new treatamnt vorks with a capacity of 0.45 MV3/d (100 mgd)
are designed as the first stage of a facility that vill ultimately have a
capacity of 0.91 MV3/d (200 mgd). Bach of the two stages is designed as a
separate treatment plan, twinned so that the road arrangements are
economical to minmize interconnecting pipe lengths. The site for these new
facilitie will surround the existing KD bigh lift pumping station. The
new facilities will require the addition of 14.6 hectares to the existing
13.5 hectares for a total site area of 28.1 hectares.
21.      The proposed project vill finance the construction of both low and
high lift pumpin stations, treatment works, treated water storage,
maintenance and administration buildings and staff housing.

contained in a pumphouse measuring 14a x 20 a (46 ft x 66 ft) vith a
laydown area at the end of the pumphouse under the comand of the stat  i
crane. The pimphouse vill contain one duty and one standby pumpaet. The
delivery bumains will discharge Into a distribution header chamber, the
flow of vwlch wvil gravitate to the treatment works.
TreatMent Plant
24.      Treatment will be by rapid gravity filtration with iline
coagulation and dlasnfection by ehlorination. The filters vill be
accomodated in a block measurin  89.5m z 39.3a (294 ft. x 130 ft)
incorporating a central gallery 6.3m (20.7 ft). The arrangmnents wlthln
the control building and elsewhere will be *simlar to the Plpri plant.
After treatment, water vill gravitate to the treated vater reservoir.
Treated Water Reservoir
25.      A new treated vater reservoir vill have a capacity of 45,000 m3
(10 mg) and will be divided into two compartments. The lilet chamber will
contain isolating valves to enable either compartment to be drained for
maintenance.   The outlet chamber vill contain outlet and wash-out valves.
Separate outlet mains vill lead to the high lift pUmping station and to the
gravity treated water main to COD.
High Lift uMuing tto
26.      A new high lift pumping station will pump 0.32 MO3/4 (70 mgd) to
University reservoir at a head of 21r (69 ft). The pumpeets will be
contained In a single pumphouse 12m s 6Gm i39 ft x 197 ft) which will have
a central laydown area under the comanmd of the station crane. As the NEK
treatment site Is flat, It vill be necessary to set the pump suction below
ground level. Pumps vlll be double suction vertical spindle type driven
through a gearboz by dual fuel engines utilizing gs as the primary fuel.
There will be three duty and two standby pumpsete. Surge protection will
be provided by air vessels situated at each end of the pumphouse.
Service Buildina and Staff basins
27.      An administration building will be located at the entrance to the
treatment works. Separate vorkshops will be provided for the pumping
stations and the treatment vorks. The workshop for the puming statijns
will be located adjacent to the low lift pumpig station.

Rub Water Troatment Plan
28.      Currently, 0.40 NM3/d (89 mad) of water from the Hub rLver source
la beLng delLvered Into the distributLon system after minimal treatment
liaLted to chlorination. The proposed project will fLnance the construction
of treatment works with capacLty of 0.20 Mm3/d (45 ugd), designed along the
same lines an the works at PLprL end Northeast Karachl. Storage end high
lift pumping &Aready exists at the proposed location. Adequate lend is
available ond reserved at the existing site.
Water Treatment Method
29.      An ODA-funded pllot study is under-way to confirm that direct
filtratLon processes can be used on the Indus nd Rub vaters, both of low
turbidLty. These sources are reservolr supplies whlch v1ll feed the new
fllter plants.
30.      The dlrect filtration process is defined as followns
prechlorLnatLon, pH correction vith sulphuric acld, in-Lne co^gulation
vLth alum, in-line addLtLon of polymer, Dlrect rapid gravLty flItration
5m/h (16 ft/h), and dLsinfectLon by chlorination.
31.      The pilot plant trials referred to above may prove that
-prechlorination and the use of polymers are unmecesary. Meanwhile lt ia
considered prudent to allow for such fcllitles and they have been included
in the cost astlmates of the project.
Connections to Primary Distribution Svatm
Pumping Main to University ReservoLr from ReK
32.      Treated water will be pumped from the new high lift pumping
statlon at N3K (ref) to the existlng University reservolr. The new pumplng
main consLstLng of twin 1400mn (55 ln) dLameter steel pLpelines 21 Km long
will follov the alLigment of the exLstLng condult and will have a capaclty
of 0.32 M.m3/d (70 mgd).
Gravity Main from MMl to UMiversity MSAin
33.      The remsainng 0.14 HM3/d (30 mgd) treated water from the new
treatment works at NRK will will gravLtate to the exLstLng distributLon
system and vill be connected at the UnLversLty Main near Rashid Minhas
Road. The gravity main vlll have a capacity of 0.14 Ma3/d (30 mgd) and vill
comprLie one 150Qm (60 ln) diameter prestreesed concrete pLpelines 13.0 km
long. The route wlll follov the alLgnment of the existLng conduit.
Strengthenina of Primary Distribution
34.      The priority needs for strengthening the prmary dLstrLbution
system have been LdentLfLed based on a computer analysis of the network to
a planning horlzon of 1995 (peak day flows). The project will finance the
addltion of 35.9 km of new mains mostly parallel to ezLstLng mains,,
distributed among the vater supply zones as follovs: Northeast Karachl -
7.3 km, Southeast Karachl - 9.8 km, Central Karachl - 18.8 km. IndivLdual

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND KARACHI WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
Institutional Stren thenina Comuonent - Detailed Descrilotion
1.       The Institutional strengtheinlg component consists of a number of
sup-projects having to do with a wide range of institutional deficiencies
and needs; for example, from conumer education to bulk metering. This
section of the aide memoir. focuses on the organization and management of
KWSBi its problems, and the approach to dealing vith them.
2.       The Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) is planning on
undertaking a major development project to bring badly needed additional
water into the city and to enlarge and improve its sevage treatment and
disposal capability.  It is essential that KWSB be able to function   I
effectively end efficiently to manage the new project while continuing to
operate and maintain existing system  and facilities.  A program of          6
institutional strengthening has been planned to "ssist PWSB in preparing to
do so.
3.       In planning this program with the World Bank, a number of problems
were identified by the Managing Director and hls senior managers. KWSB is
an amalgamation of three different groups (from KDA, KMC, and KWMS) that
have not fully coalesced Into a unified, cohesive organization. There is a
lack of KWSI identify, Image, and pride, and little feeling of collective
responsibility. Common service rules have only recently been adopted, but
in keneral there is a lack of documented and clearly understood systems and
procedures. There have been many ch nges in posting at the senior level
within the past two years. Senior staff have thus had comparatively little
time working together. As a result, individual responsibilities and role
relationships are not clear, and there are problems with rivalry and
resentment, communication and coordination, prob'.m solving and decision
making, authority and responsibility. Managers are overwhelmed by
day-to-day problems, resulting In little time for planning. Management is
thus mostly crisis d manageent. The organization has grown with no
particular organizational or corporate plan, resulting in an organization
that is much larger than It should be, by comparable international
standards, vwlle some areas appear to be shorthanded an overworked. There
are some gaps in technical understanding and expertise in some parts of
KWSB. A number of the senior managers are nearing retirement, but so far
there Is no plan to identify and train their replacements.

4.       The Government of Sind is not unaware of the problems.  A
directive was Issued in the Spring of 1987 to review and assess the
effectiveness of KWSB operations. A similar but more comprehensive plan
has been proposed as a part of the appraisal of the Karachi II project to
strengthen KWSB through a comprehensive and thorough ortanizational study.
tenm building and executive development. manastement trainins for senior and
lunior level manaper . a manoower study and development of a mannina plan,
and deve     n f   training capability and center.  KWSB has agreed to
this approtch and is In the process of obtaining Government of Sind
approvals for proceeding. The Managing Director, KWSB Board of Directors,
and Government of Sind are very supportive of these efforts, and would like
to develop KWSB Into an effective organization with modern management
methods and techAiques before the MD retires, in three years.
5.       The organization study would build on the analyses and
recommendations of the consultants and the senior management teas regarding
functional relationships and organizational structure at the upper
leviels. The study would be carried on down through the organization,
examining functions and structure, tasks and activities, systems and
procedures, information needs and flow, job descriptions and qualifications
of persons in their assigned positions. Assistance would be provided in 6
development of job descriptions and systems and procedures manuals, vith
the emphasis being on development of manuals that are understandable,
acceptable, and useable. Recommendations would be made for modification or
Improvement and for training. A priority In the beginnlng would be
assistance in defining the functions and structure for a project management
unit (development wing) for the new projects being under:aken.
6.       The manpower study will precede the organization study and will
provide information for decisions regarding reduction In strength of total
staff as vell within specific categories or certain parts of the
organization, reallocation of personnel, or strengthening in certain
categories and parts of the organization.  Alternative manning plans based
on different assumptions about feasibility and costs will be developed.
The organizational study will follow the manpower study and will go into
greater detail, analyzing specific tasks, functions, numbers and type of
persons required to perform these tasks and functions, and job
descriptions, and assessing the qualifications of individuals assigned to
these jobs.  It vill provide information for decisions regarding possible
restructuring of the organi2aticn, addition or deletion of positions,,
specific assignments of staff, and training needs. Some restructuring of
the organization at all levels might therefore result from the analysis of
KWSB functions and relationships. Some lateral transfers of personnel
might be suggested by the study, or poissible deputations from other
organizations, or even some direct hires, where capabilities do not exist
internally.

ANNEX 3_
Page 3 of 4
7.       The purpose of team building and executive development at the
senior level would be to mould this group Into a cohesive senior management
team with clearly defined roles, functional relationships,
responsibilities, and authority, and with improved communication,
information sharin8, coordination, planning problem solving, decision
making, accountability, end control. Team bui'ding and executive
development should be combined in an Integrated program, in which
management concepts and theories are examined in terms of the meaning they
have for the individual and the group as a whole, and their implications
for working relationships and functioning as an effective team.
S.       Since all of the activities discussed In this paper involve
training or have training implications, It is Important that the training
center be closely associated vith them. The organization study will
identify training needed to upgrade personnel In their present assignments
or prepare them for future assignaents and training in use of the systems
and procedures defined during the study. An incentive system linking
training with promotion and pay Increases should also be an outcome of the
study, if employees are to take training seriously.  The systm  ad
procedures vill be documented In manuals, which will be updated as needed,
as KWSB grovw and develops. Training to meet the growing needs of KWSB
vill have to be planned for and managed effectively.
9.       in the development of the training center, It would be advisable
to have technical and managerial assistance from a well established and
experienced training institution such as the Pakistan Institute of
Management (PIN) In planAnng and managing training for KWSB. PIN could
help in ldentifying and training the training director, setting up a
training unit, developing a long range training plan for KWSS, and managing
training until such time as the training director is prepared to take
over. The training director and PIN training manager should assist the
organization study in defining and clarifying training needs, since it will
be their responslbility to plan, develop and implement training to meet
these needs, as well as to develop a program to continue systematically
identifying and prioritizing training needs following the organization
study. Discussions have been held with PIN regarding their Involvement,
and they have expressed interest In participating In the project, along the
lines mentioned above.
10.      Sice the Karachi II project provides a unique opportunity for the
training of [WSB staff with highly experienced consultants in project
design and management, decisions regarding assignment of personnel for
training should be made by senior management on the basis of long range
planning and future needf of KWSB (which should be clarified during team
building and senior management training), and careful assessment of the
qualifications and abilities of personnel being considered. The training
director and PIN training advisor should monitor this training, working



- 52 -
ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 4
closely with the person or persons given the training responsibility by the
engineering consultants, and should ensure that appropriate records are
maintained.
1i.      During the first, basic design and documentation phase of the
Karachi It project (approximately the first year), it has been suggested
that a skeleton staff will be maintained in Karachi, with a few young,
qualified engineers attached to the consulting firms in England for
training. Each of the two consulting firms will ass.gn a trainer who is
also a trained project engineer to assume the responsibility for training
of the KWSB engineers in both England and Karachi. During this time, the
organization study will assist in identifying the organizational structure
and staffing needs of the Development Wing, and will assist in preparation
of job descriptions. Careful screening of potential appointees to these
positions and selection should be completed in sufficient time to have them
assigned to the Development Wing prior to Phase Two, when the major
activity will move from England to Karachi for tendering and construction
supervision. During Phase Two, the appropriateness and effectiveness of
the Development Wing structure and staffing will be assessed to determine
what changes or modifications should be made.  Training of KWSB staff will
continue during Phase Two. By the time Karachi III starts, approximately
in 1992, a fully functional Development Wing should be in place, capable of
planning and managing new projects.
12.      It would be advisable to have one person, a specialist in
organizational development and training, with experience in technology
transfer, to supervise these activities. The specialist would provide
guidance and assistance where needed, and would ensure that coordination
among the various activities was maintained. He could assist with the team
building and senior management training and could provide advisement to the
Managing Director on matters pertaining to organizational development or
training.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND KARACHI WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
Planned Improvements to Sewerage System
PART A: SEWERAGE
(a) Cleaning and Repair of Existing Sewers
1.        The existing severs ln Karachi are in poor conditions due
to Inadequate maintenance and repair. Preliminary surveys conducted by
the Consultants during the Mester Plan and Fesibillty Study revealed
blockage  and  corrosion at  many locations.   Therefore, cleaning  and
repalr of the existing severs are essential to restore their conveyance
capacity. It is proposed that a number of representative areas in the
city be selected as pilot areas for sever cleaning and repair with the
objectives to determine the extent of the cleanlng and repair works
required, identify the problems and refine the unit costs adopted In the
cost estimates.    If possible,  the pilot cleaning and repair works
should be Implemented as soon as possible under KUDP.
2.        The following works have been estimated by the Consultants:
(i) Cleaning Works: -The total length of the sewers that need
to be cleaned is estimated at about 3548 km as detailed belows
Sever Dia.      Lengtb
(in.)         (km)
6 and 8         2,826
10 to 21           541
24 to 36           163
42 to 72            18
(LI)  Repair Works: -This  teak will  Involve renovation  of
manholes and replacant of corroded sewers.  The quantity of works will
have to be determined. A budget of about Rs 70.6 million is allowed for
the task.
(b) Rehabilitation of Two Pumping Stations
3.        Two existing pumping stations will need mLoor modifications to
suit revised duties on completion of the Sewerage Project.  The two
pumping stations known as Chakiwara (11.5 mgd design capacity) end
Barnes Street (21 mgd capacity) have recently been fitted with new pumps
which are designed to discharge directly to the Inlet of the existing
Sewage Treatment Plant No. I (TP I). Under the proposed Sewerage Master
Plan, the two pumplng stations will discharge into the Lyart Interceptor
Sewer, thus, their duty pumping heads will be reduced.  Since the two
pumping stations are equipped with new pumps and have design capacities

(c) Construction of New Secondary Severs
4.        About 181 km of new secondary or street sewers with diameters
ranging from 200 to 675 mm will be constructed to intercept and convey
sewage, currently discharged into nullahs, into the nearest trunk
sewers. Emphasls will be placed on the low-income areas beLig upgraded
under KUDP and KSDP-1.  Under the katchl abadi upgradLng components of
the two projects, the Department of Katchi Abadl UpgradLng of KMC will
adopt a low-cost sanLtatLon approach based on small-bore sewers.  The
low cost sanltation approach will Lnvolve encouraging lndlvidual
households to bulld hyglenlc pour-flush latrines whLch drain into simple
septic tanks or cesspits.  Effluent of the tank together wlth sullage
will be drained from the premises through small sewers lito lane sewers
whlch will in turn drain Into street sewers to be constructed under the
Project. Retentlon of solids In the tank allows the use of smaller
severs laid at less gradLents compared to conventional sewers deslgned
to convey raw sewage.
5.        Main areas  requLring secondary severs are those of Orangi
(6000 acres) and BaldLa (1000 acres). Both these areas are Included L1
the katchl abadi upgrading component of KUDP for whlch provisions has
been made for on-site sewerage Lmprovement. Due to lack of trunk sewers
during the formulatlon of KUDP, It was planned to dLscharge septic tank
effluent and sullage into open dralns. However, slace trunk sewers will
be laid under the Project through the areas, secondary severs should,
therefore, be Lncluded ln the Project to serve these two areas.  The
requirements for secondary sewers are estimated as follows:

(b) Upgrading of TP III
8.        TP III, located at North Karachi, was deslgned and built by
KDA and has a S mgd treatment capacity. The treatment plant features
are based on the oxldation ditch process but without final settling
tanks.   Therefore,  the treatment plant will function as an aerated
lagoon with the retention time of less than 24 hours.  This aeration
time ls too short for the aerated lagoon process and will not enable

ANNEX 4
Ai      Page 5 of 7
the treatment plant to achieve a significant reduction of pollutants
in the sewage   In order to increase its efficiency, it is necessary
to convert It into an activated sludge process and the following
works would be required:
(1) Construction of at least two dedimentation tanks fitted
with mechanical sludge scrapers.  The sedimeutation tanks are to be
located after the aeration tanks for separating bacterial sludge from
the aeration tank effluent;
(2) Construction of a pumpLag station with an appropriate
number of low-llft pUmps for returning the bacterial sludge removed
from the sedimentation tanks to the aeratLon tanks;
(3) Replacement of the existing aerators If they are found to
have low oxygen transfer capacity;
(4) Installation of flow measurement devices and by-pass
for grit traps.
PART C: SEWERAGE OPERATION STREVGTRENING
10.       Part C will include the following:
(a) Expert Services
(1)  advisor for Project implementation for a period of three
years;
(i)  expert in operation and maintenance of sewers for a
period of one year;
(LL1) espert in sewer cleaning, repair and maintenance for a
period of one year;
(iv)  expert in operation and maintenance of sewage treatment
plants for a period of one year;
(v)   expert in Industrial waste survey and monitoring system
for a perlod of one year.
11.        for a large sewerge project like the proposed Project, lt
would be of beneflt to KWSB to have an advisor to assist and train KWSB
staff in the management of Project implementation. The advisor to be
provided will be exclusively lnvolved in the implementation of the
Sewerage Project and a similar advisor would be provided for the Water
Supply Component. Ths experts in (II), (iII) and (iv) are necessary to
assist KWSB in upgrading its sewer maintenance and operational
management of sewage treatment works.
12.        Experiences  in  other  countries  confirm  that  combined
treatment  of municipal  sewage  and  industrial  effluent  is  the most
cost-effective approach to industrial effluent ns agment. Therefore,
industrial effluent should be admitted into KWSBIs sowers for treatment
as mutch as possible. ThLs will require KWSB to set up a system for



- 58 -
ANNEX 4
Page 6 of 7
monitoring industrial effluent. Due to shortage of experience in this
disclpline in KWSU, an advisor in industrial effluent :anagement vtll be
needed to assist KWSB in setting up such a system.
(b) Training
13.       To improve and extend its sewerage services to cope with the
increasing demand and for long term operatLon of KWSB, attention should
be given to personnel development particularly the building up of a
group of young qualified professionals for sewerage operations.  The
Project,  therefore,  provides  a  budget  for  academic  and  practical
training overseas in subjects relevant to sewerage operations.
14.       The training  element would consist of the following:
(i) Academic training at diploma level (about 10-12 months) in
environmental engineering followed by practical training (about sixth
months) after graduation. The budget allows for the trainLig of eight
professionals for a period of about 1.5 year each.
(IL) Practical training in sewer construction and maintenance,
sewerage planning, and computer application ia technical management of
sewerage operations.  The  budget  allows  for  the   :alning of eight
professionals for a period of about six months each.
15.       The scope of the training and the number of man-years to be
allocated wlll be firmed up during pre-appraisal.
(c) Sewer Mapping
16.       Accurate sewer maps and inventory ar  essential to sewerage
operations and management. There has been no systematic recording of
se'er data nor preparation of 'as-constructed" record drawings of new
sewerage  schemes.    Therefore,  this  elemeat  of  the  Project  will
establish computer-based maps and records of the existing severs in
Karachi.  The maps and records would include the following information:
(1) manhole and sewe; locations (referenced to known points);
(2) sewer diameters and structural condition;
(3) sewer invert and manhole cover levels and manhole
characteristics.
(d) Equipment for Industrial Effluent Monitoring System
17.       Necessary equipment  and  facilities  for  industrial effluent
survey   and   monitoring   will   be   provided   including   vehLcles,
microcomputers and softwares, laboratory equipment, samplers, flow
measuring equipment,etc.  A budget of about RJ 5 milIlon is provided.

PAKISTAN
STAFF APPRUISAL REPORT
SECOND KARACHI WATER SUPPLY AND SANIXATION PROJECT
Key Assumptions Underling the Financial Proiections
A. General
1.       All financial statements indicate:
-    three year historical data (84-85, 85-86, 86-87); and
-    ten years projections (87-88 through 96-97)
2.       All financial projections are based on expected/assumed increase
in operating costs and tariff increases which are explained in the
following paragraphs.
3.       Water oroduction is assumed to increase from the present level of
324 mgd to 484 mgd as below:
86-87 323 mad
87-88 343 mgd
88-89 364 mgd
89-90 373 mgd
90-91 373 mgd
91-92 373 mgd
92-93 373 mgd
93-94 423 mgd
94-95 473 mgd
Consumption by bulk users (which is metered) is assumed to increase in the
same proportion as production.
B. Revenue Prolections
1.       Water Tariff increase as follows:
FY-88/89     October 88        35%        July 92        10%
FY-89/90     July 89            0%        July 93         7%
FY-90/91     July 90           35%        July 94         7X
FY-91/92     July 91           10        July 95         7X
2.       Revenues from bulk consumers will go up in proportion to the
increase in water volume consumed in addition to the increases in tariffs.

ANNEX a
Page 2 of 6
3.       Revenues from retail consumers will go up by 5% every year (in
addition to tariff increases) due to increase in number of consumers/NARV
(Net Annual Rental Value).
4.       Seweraae surcharne at 50% of 75% of water bill for retail
consumers from July 1989 onwards. No subsidy from KKC for recurring
sewerage or water costs from July 1989 onwards.  However, the KKC subsidy
is continued for improvement works.
C. Exnenditure Prolections
1. 0 & N Cost Assumotions
(a) inflation for all 0 & N costs is taken at 7S p.a.;
(b) no change in raw water costs as most of it is related to Hub
water whose volume is not projected to increase;
(e) manpower costs not increased in real terms; increased only
for inflation on the assumption of improvements in
productivity/efficiency);
(d)  power, fuel and chemicals costs increased in proportion to
volumes of water produced In addition to unit price
inflation. In addition, power costs increased in 1987-88 by
40% over 1986-87 costs levels to incorporate payment of FAC
(Fuel Adjustment Charge);
(e) repairs and maintenance costs increased each year by an
amount equivalent to 1.5% of cumulative value of new assets
created; and
(f) administration and other overheads not increased in real
terms, increased for inflation only.
2. Depreciation
(a) IDA transferred assets (essentially related to water) are
depreciated at 5% for major assets and 10% for minor assets
on straight line basis on the value fixed by consultants
(total Rs. 1,034.3 million);
(b) assets created as improvement works depreciated at 52 on
straight line basis;
(c) minor assets procured by KWSB (such as vehicles and office
equipment) depreciated at 10% on a straight line basis; and
(d) new major assets created under IDA/ADB/other external
assisted projects depreciated at 3.5% on straight line basis
after they are converted from capital WIP to fixed assets.

3. Intereat CharEes
(a) on loans transferred from KDA (both Provincial Government loans
and Foreign loans) Interest charges have been computed by KWSB
on the basis of equal Installments and provided for in KWSB
budget of 1987-88. The same figures have been adopted in the
financial projections; and
(b) on other existing loans (IDA 1374-PAR and ADB 793-F) interest
payment is assumed to be as per the respective loan schedules.
4. HadDekta
at 5% of revenue from water and sewerage charges.
D. Sources and Uses of Funds Proisetions
1. Loans and Grants
(a) loan drawals In respect of IDA 1374-PAR, IDA 1652-PAK and ADB
793-F are as per schedule o disbursal. For IDA 1374-PAK, KDA
portion of the loan Is not included In the fund flows;
(b) for Karachi II project, loans are computed at 80% of the
sewerage project cost and 702 of the water (and institutional)
project cost;
(c) grants for projects financed by IDA 1374-YAR, IDA 1652-PAK and
ADB 793-F are based on schedule of capital investments less
loans received; and
(d) for Karachi II project, grants are computed as total capital
investment In a year less loans and internal contribution of 20%
starting In FY1993.
2. Internal Contribution
For Karachi II project, contribution to capital investment will be
from July 1992 onwards. Internal funds will contribute approximately 20X of
capital investments after 1991-92.
3. XNC Subelft
KMC subsidy for "improvement works" (minor capital expenditures for
KMC) at 1002 matching investments. No KiC subsidy oan recurrent expenses after
sewerage surcharge is introduced.
4. Canital Investments
(a) on-going projects - as per schedules already worked out for
respective projects;

ANNEX 8
Page 4 of 6
(b)  improvement works - 5S increase each year; and
(c)  Karachl II project - as per tentative schedule worked out.
5. Debt Servicing
(a) Loan Repayments
(i) on loans transferred from KDA: From KDA a total of
Rs. 211.8 million loans were due for repayment to KWSB.
Of this, Rs. 105.4 million loans were due for repayment
before the transfer itself and hence treated by KWSB as
"to be recovered from KDA." The remaining amount of Rs.
106.4 million is projected to be repaid as per schedule
worked out by KWSB;
(ii) other existing loans (IDA and ADB): As per schedule of
repayment agreed;
{iii)   on new loans:  Repayment starts after the projection
period.
(b) Interest Payments
(i) on loans transferred from KDA: For the portion to be
repaid by KWSB - as per schedule worked out by KWSB;
(ii) other existing loans (IDA and ADB): As per schedule of
interest payments agreed; and
(iii)   On new loans:  Payments after the projection period.
6. Increase in Working Capital
Difference between this year's and last year's working capital is
taken as cash outflow (except in 86-87 and 87-88 when it is adjusted for
changes in current liabilities/current assets occurring due to transfers from
KDA which do not require or release any cash).
E. Balance Sheet Proiections
1. Fixed Assets
(a)  transferred from KDA:  In 1985-86 fixed assets revalued based on
historical costs at Rs 1,034.1 million (by consultants) are
transferred from KDA;
(b)  Improvement Works:  Amounts spent by KWSB on improvement works
since formation of KWSB are treated as fixed assets;
(c)  minor Assets:  Minor assets such as vehicle and office equipment
procured by KWSB since its inception are treated as fixed assets;

ANNEX 8-
Page 5 of 6
(d)  New Assets:  For each of the ongoing projects, the money spent
during a year is first treated as capital work-in-progress and
then transferred to fixed assets In the next year; and
(e)  Sewersie Assets Transferred from KM: KWSB has estimated the
net value of sewerage assets transferred from RMC as Ras. 8S
million. The same figure is adopted in the balance sheet.
2. Receivables from KDA
As per the consultants report on transfer of assets from KDA to KWSB,
Rs. 148 million is recoverable from KDA. The same ls shown as assets in KWSB
balance sheet.  Of this, Rs. 42.6 million which relates to employee provident
fund and cash/bank is assumed to be received In 2 installments In 1988-89 and
1989-90. The remaining amount of Rs. 105.4 million which relates to
outstanding long term-loans is assumed to be paid by IDA dlrectly and hence
reduced from assets (and liabilities under loans transferred from IDA).
3. Accumulated Losses
Cumulative operational losses since inception. Projected to
increase/decrease depending on KWSB's net losses/profits.
4. Capital Reserves
Comprises reserves transferred from KDA (largely debentures) and
subsidies received from KMC.  Projected to increase vith grants from GOS and
subsidies from KMC for improvement works.
5. Working Capital Items
(a)  Advances and Pre-navment:  Projected at a level of 20S of
capital WIP (except after completion of the project when it is
maintained at 102 of expenditure on "improvement works").

and expected collection programe from institutional and other
users, certain collection efficiency targets have been projected
based on these targets.
