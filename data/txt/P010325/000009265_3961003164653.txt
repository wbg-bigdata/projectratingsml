MENORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE SECOND KARACHI WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  the  proposed
supplemental credit of SDR 66.4 million (US$91.9 million equivalent) to the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan is submitted for approval. The credit would be made
as a supplement to Credit 1987-PAK for the Second Karachi Water and Sanitation
Project. The supplemental credit would be repaid on the same payment schedule
as the existing credit and would be on standard IDA terms, with 35 years
maturity. It will help finance priority components for the water conveyance and
treatment of 100 million gallons per day (mgd) of potable water to Karachi. The
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom would participate through parallel mixed
credit financing of US$48.8 million equivalent for procurement of plant and
equipment for water treatment and pumping facilities. The proceeds of the credit
would be onlent to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation ((KMC) (through the
Government of Sindh) at an annual interest rate of 11% with a repayment period
of 25 years, including six years grace, and from the KMC of the executing agency,
Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), on the same terms as received by KMC.
The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background. The population of Pakistan in December 1991 was estimated
at 116.0 million, with 32% living in urban areas. The province of Sindh is the
second largest of Pakistan's four provinces with a 1990 population of about 27.0
million. It is the most urbanized with almost half of its population living in
urban areas. Of the 12 - 13 million urban based population in Sindh, between 9
and 10 million live in Karachi, the country's largest commercial and industrial
center. In this decade, an estimated 4.5 to 5.0 million people will be added to
the population of Karachi.   With around 8.5% of the national population,
Karachi's present economic importance far exceeds that of any other city in
Pakistan. It accounts for about 20% of Pakistan's GDP, 42% of value added and
35% of employment in large-scale manufacturing, 40% of value added in financial
services, 72Z of capital issued, and 40% of tax revenues.
3.        Karachi is located in a water-scarce area with an average annual
rainfall of only 300 mm. The groundwater is brackish and, thus, households and
industries have little choice but to rely on the public water supply system
operated by KWSB. While slightly over one quarter of Karachi's water supply
comes from the nearby Hub River, the remaining three quarters must be conveyed
from the Indus River some 150 km away. The present supply--at the head of the
system--is about 350 mgd or about 35 gallons per capita per day, including
industrial and commercial uses and unaccounted for water. This is well below
comparable figures for large cities in the developing world. Because of the
overall water scarcity, KWSB operates the system on a rotational basis and most
households have water for only a few hours three or four times a week.
4.        Because no other sources are available, the water supply to Karachi
can be increased significantly only by importing water from the Indus River. The
Second Karachi Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Cr. 1987-PAK, US$125



- 2 -
million), as approved by the Board in February 1989, cor ituted the first phase
of a two-phase investment program to expand water prod   ton by 240 mgd.  The
main objective of the project, inter alia, was to increas potable water supply
by 100 mgd and further augment water availability by strengthening water loss
reduction measures.   At current population growth rates,  the per capita
availability of water supply is expected to decline over the next two decades,
even with the entire 240 mgd increase in water supply production.
5.        The First Karachi Water Supply Project (Cr. 1374-PAR, US$25 million,
approved in 1983) successfully achieved its physical targets and increased KWSB's
capacity to convey an additional 50 mgd of water to Greater Karachi. The quality
of management and operations also improved under tbis credit, which closed in
June 1991. In addition, under the ongoing Karachi Special Development Project
(Cr. 1652-PAK, US$70.0 million, approved in 1986), KWSB's capacity to deliver
additional potable water was increased and Karachi's sewerage system was improved
and expanded. In February 1989, IDA approved the Second Karachi Water Supply and
Sanitation Project which was aimed at continuing the investment and institutional
improvements sought under these other operations. The proposed supplemental
credit to the ongoing Secord Karachi Water Supply and Sanitation Project will
ensure that the project achl eves its original physical targets, and will continue
to strengthen KWSB's operations.
6.        Original Proiect Oblectives and Description.  Credit 1987-PAR to the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan of US$125.0 million was approved on February 28,
1989. It was signed on April 26, 1989 and it became effective on December 13,
1989. The objectives of the project are to: (a) increase potable water supply
by 100 mgd and further augment water availability by s_rengthening loss reduction
measures; (b) improve the financial viability of KWSB through increased revenues,
cost reductions, and increased operational efficiency; (c) improve the
organization and management of KWSB; and (d) improve sanitation in Karachi
including its low-income and coastal areas, by increasing sewerage coverage by
232 mgd and treatment capacity by 94 mgd.   The project has three major
components: (a) Water Supply: financed by IDA and ODA/CDC, consists of about 150
km of conveyance system from KG-Canal, near the Indus, to Karachi and includes
transmission works; pumping stations; direct filtration treatment works; storage
reservoirs; 50 km of primary distribution mains; and strengthening of the
distribution network; (b) Institutional Strentthenin:g financed by IDA, includes
technical assistance, training and studies for KWSB to enable it to plan and
execute large scale projects, improve operation and maintenance, and improve and
extend sanitation in the city and coastal areas; and (c) Sanitation: cofinanced
(in parallel) by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), comprises three sewage
treatment works together with associated trunk sewers; repair and cleaning of
existing sewers; and small-bore sewers for low income neighborhoods.
7.        Status of Proiect Implementation.  The project is being implemented
by KWSB. KWSB raised water tariffs by 35X in July 1989 and introduced a sewerage
surcharge in July 1990, leading to an aggregate increase of about 1351 since
1988. No tariff increase took place in 1991, but starting August 1992 water
tariffs and sewerage tariffs were increased by an average of 70Z. After these
adjustments the water and sewerage tariffs have increased four fold over the
1988-1992 period. Technical assistance is being provided through consultant
services for management and administrative procedures, coordination between
different parts of the KWSB organization, engineering designs and for



- 3 -
construction supervision. The KWSB is expanding its capability in these areas,
and through the newly created Development Wing will gradually take over the
planning, engineering, procurement administration, and construction supervision
for subsequent projects.   The Wing is now operational with a nucleus of
engineering and financial staff.   As engineering designs and procurement
documentation for all project components are completed, RWSB plans to expand this
nucleus to carry out contract administration, bid evaluation, contract
negotiation and award, construction management and supervision of works. After
initial delays due to cumbersome approval and review procedures in Pakistan,
physical implementation is now proceeding well. The first major civil works
contract was awarded in January 1991 and by now contracts valued at about 95Z of
the credit amount have been awarded for construction of the water conveyance
systems and for consultant services and equipment. In addition, two major UK-
financed plant and equipment contracts are in the process of being finalized for
award. Thus, by January 1993, about 96Z of the available foreign assistance for
the water components is expected to have been committed.
8.        After receipt of the first major civil works and equipment tenders,
it became clear that the project has experienced serious cost overruns. Thus,
in February 1992, IDA fielded a mission to undertake an in-depth review of the
project and to agree with Government on an action program to deal with the
unanticipated cost increases. Based on a detailed analysis, the February 1992
mission concluded that changes in scope to some of the civil work., escalation
in prices of construction materials, currency exchange rates, low contingency
provisions and a mixed response by foreign contractors all contributed to the
cost overruns.   (A detailed analysis is contained in the attached Technical
Annex).
9.        Revised Scone of the Prolect.  The revised scope of the project calls
for: (a) deferment of components (accounting for some 272 of the original project
cost) that are not crucial for meeting the main objectives of the project;
(b) increased  emphasis  on  leak  detection  and  water  loss  reduction;
(c) containment of operating costs; (d) enhanced revenue mobilization efforts,
including raising water tariffs by about 702; and (e) an in-depth examination of
possible options for public/private sector participation in the provision of
water and sanitation services. The deferred components would be deleted from the
present credit but could be considered for IDA financing under a potential
subsequent lending operation. The remaining civil works and equipment components
are all integral parts of the main water conveyance system and cannot be altered
or postponed without jeopardizing the integrity of the project.
10.       Prolect Costs and Financina.   The entire project was originally
estimated at appraisal (August 1988) to cost Rs 6,219.6 million (US$331.8 million
equivalent). The water components of the project financed by IDA and ODA/CDC
were estimated to cost Rs 4,414.7 million (US$227.6 million equivalent). The
sewerage components, financed by ADB, were estimated at Rs 1,804.9 or US$104.2
million equivalent. According to the project financing plan, GOP, GOS, IMC and
KWSB agreed to contribute US$45.9 million equivalent to finance part of the local
currency costs including taxes and duties for the water components, and the
balance through parallel external financing by IDA (US$125.0 million), and by
ODA/CDC (US56.4 million). About US$181.4 million of the external finances were
for the project's civil works, plant and equipment as well as technical
assistance related to the water components of the project.



- 4 -
11.       The proposed reformulated water supply component of the project, is
estimated to cost about Rs 8,925.9 million (US$331.7 million equivalent)
including Rs 786.7 million (US$30.9 million equivalent) for taxes and duties.
The base estimate of Rs 7,734.0 million (US$303.3 million equivalent) is in
January 1993 prices. The foreign exchange component is US$135.0 million, 412 of
the estimated total cost. A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are
summarized  in  Schedule  A.    Amounte  and methods  of procurement  and  of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.   A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Pakistan are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
Technical Annex is attached to provide updated information on the proposed
project based on the reappraisal of the project in February 1992 and follow-up
mission in October 1992.  Map no. 20572R is also attached.  Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7355-PAK, dated December 30, 1988, provides the detailed information
on the project as originally appraised.
12.       Justification of Supplemental Credit.   The Government requested
supplemental financing from IDA because of its inability to finance the
additional project costs. Supplemental financing to permit completion of the
system in its entirety is justified on social, technical and economic grounds.
The components of the project are not divisible and permit no flexibility in
reducing its scope without sacrificing the goal of supplying 100 mgd of potable
water to Karachi. The deletion of selected parts, or even one component from the
conveyance system as originally conceived would result in no additional water
reaching the city, and hence dooms the project to failure in meeting its
objectives. In addition, the system must be completed in its entirety, including
all necessary water treatment pumping and storage facilities to ensure that the
City's quality of potable water is not threatened by the inclusion of untreated
water into the distribution system. Karachi already receives untreated water
from the Rub River, and although not ideal, the supply is acceptable because of
the better quality and lower quantity of water supplied from this source during
most of the year. However, water from the Indus River should not be allowed to
enter into the distribution system without treatment because of its higher
turbidity and lower quality.
13.       The project has reached a critical phase in terms of activities
scheduling, whereby procurement action must be expedited to avoid severe delays
in project completion, particularly in the case of the ODA/CDC financed plant and
equipment components for water treatment and pumping stations. At present, some
95% of the original credit amount (US$ 125.0 million) has been committed and
about US$ 40 million has been disbursed. It is in this context that the request
for supplemental financing to the ongoing IDA credit was requested by GOP to
assure ODAICDC that additional funds would be available to complete the
conveyance in its entirety.
14.       Benefits.   At present Karachi experiences low water pressure and
intermittent and sometimes contaminated supply. The project would provide a more
reliable and safer water supply for the people presently served, benefiting all
income groups and especially the urban poor. It would also improve supply to
industrial and commercial enterprises thereby improving their productivity and
contributing to the continued economic growth of greater Karachi. The economic
internal rate of return of the project is very conservatively estimated at 11X.
However, this excludes benefits not reflected in sales revenues such as the



- 5 -
inherent externalities in the form of (a) health benef its to consumers,
especially lower-income groups, and to the general public as well; and (b)
increased economic growth in the service area.
15.       Risks.  The principal risk to the project is the mixed response by
international and domestic contractors due to the security situation in rural
Sindh vhich could affect implementation and costs. However, contractors working
on the project have not so far experienced any difficulties. Still, flexibility
was incorporated into the revised implementation schedule to allow for the
initial contracts to be in areas contiguous to the ongoing works which are
unaffected by political unrest. Works will be awarded at annual intervals in
order to monitor the situation and allow the timing of later contracts to be
adjusted to prevailing conditions. Moreover, the current cost estimates are
based on price experience with contracts under the ongoing Credit 1987-PAK and,
therefore, already reflect current expectations regarding the working
environment. A second risk is the possible weakening of Government's commitment
to allocating sufficient counterpart funds on time. This would be addressed by
providing for a apecial account for counterpart funds which would be closely
monitored by IDA. Replenishment of the account by Government should take place
once 50Z of the initial balance has been withdrawn. Anucher risk is the possible
over-extension of KWSB's management capacity by existing and future commitments.
This would be addressed by continuing the ongoing consultant services for
supervision, and by strengthening KWSB and improving its efficiency through
technical assistance and training in contract administration, management and cost
control.
16.       Environmental Impact.  The environmental impact of the project is
positive. The periodic contamination of the city's water distribution network,
resulting from negative system pressures, would be reduced and in selected areas
would be eliminated. Pollution of coastal areas in Karachi would be reduced and
the environment improved through the ADB-financed sewerage project and its
treatment facilities. The environmental issues associated with the project are
related to the consistency and quality of vastewater treatment and disposal
requirements under the ADB-financed sanitation components.  In addition, the
Karachi authorities previously indicated that the environmental laws will be
strengthened, and that enforcement will be stepped up. These agreements are
included in the ADB-financed sanitation project. KWSB will increase its efforts
to reduce the current excessive water losses through rehabilitation of the old
distribution systems and active leak detection programs in order to maximize the
use of scarce water resources and to minimize environmental pressures concerning
wastewater discharges into the urban and coastal areas. Contract specifications
and conditions will stipulate that contractors will be required to undertake
adequate measures to ensure safe traffic flow and pedestrian passage during civil
works construction.
17.       The impact of water abstraction from the Indus is minimal considering
that water supply requirements represent only 6 percent of the total abstraction
(mainly irrigation) at Kotri Barrage.   Also future water requirements for
domestic and industrial purposes will not exceed 10 percent of total river
abstraction.  The project is already 2 years in implementation and nearly all
land has been acquired for the project. Because the Project's civil works are
almost exclusively in desert areas, or on land already owned by the
Government/Board, KWSB has not, and will not need, to relocate or resettle any



-6-
local people. The consistency and quality of wastewater treatment and disposal
requirements under the ADB financed sanitation component form part of a
fifteenyear sewerage master plan which aims to gradually increase KWSB's capacity
to collect, treat and safely dispose of the city's wastewater.   The plan
envisages treatment for all collected sewage by about the year 2005.   The
environmental standards for the sewerage component conform to ADB requirements
and are acceptable to IDA.
18.      AMreed Actions.  A special account for counterpart funds would be
reactivated by GOS. The account would start with minimum of Rs 75.0 million and
would be replenished when the account balance falls below 502 of the original
amount. IDA would monitor the account by receiving bank statements of accounts.
The current procurement conditions would remain unchanged but with an additional
requirement that all land must be acquired and in the possession of KWSB before
IDA issues its t.o objection to award of all remaining contract packages. Cost
reduction measures, amounting to about Rs.5(iO million, are presently being
implemented. These measures should be sufficient to ensure that the financial
covenant would be met for FY94 without another tariff increase. If experience
during the current fiscal year indicates that these cost reduction measures would
be inadequate to generate a sufficient surplus to meet the cash generation
covenant, GOS/KWSB has agreed to adjust the tariff again in July 1993.
19.       Conditions for effectiveness of the supplemental credit are: (a) for
meeting the existing financial covenant conditions before the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1993, KMC has attributed to KWSB the necessary funds to cover its
operating expenses (including increases in working capital and debt service);
(b) the Subsidiary Loan Agreement has been amended and executed on behalf of the
GOS and KMC.
20.       Recommendation.    I am satisfied that the proposed  supplemental
development credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed supplemental
credit.

SECOND KARACHI WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
THE REFOIJMULATED WATER SUPPLY COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT
A. Origin of the Project
1.          The proposed project is a reformulation of the original Second Karachi
Water Supply and Sanitation project (Credit 1987-PAK) and is based on consultant
studies for water supply and sewerage done in the first IDA financed project (Credit
1374-PAK) and in the IDA and ADB co-financed Project (Credit 1652-PAK). The project
is a follow-on to these two projects, both of which were designed to expand water
and sewerage facilities for the City and to strengthen the operational and financial
functions of KWSB.
2.          Given the cost increases experienced by this and other projects in
Pakistan, the Government and IDA, beginning in mid-1991, began a thorough review of
the project implementation experience with a view toward deciding what actions would
be needed to ensure its effective and uninterrupted implementation.   It was
recognized that: (a) without additional commitment of resources from IDA and
ODA/CDC, the project could not achieve its original objective; (b) adequate, regular
counterpart funding was an essential condition for continuation; (c) no changes in
the project content should take place which would jeopardize the conveyance of
additional water to Karachi; and (d) the Government and IDA would work closely to
ensure that the agreed modified concept would not constrain implementation of the
project as originally conceived, and would also open up future avenues for
addressing the city's serious water shortage problems in a more effective manner.
3.          If implemented as reformulated,  the proposed project would still
represent the needed effective means to start addressing the water-shortage in
Karachi. Continued IDA support, under the modifications proposed would also yield
a unique opportunity to continue implementing the institutional strengthening
components which, over the medium-and long-term, will result in more effective
project implementation.
B. Obiectives
4.          The reformulated water supply component of the project coh titutes the
first phase of a two-phase investment program to expand water production by 200 mgd
on average. The objectives of the water supply component of the project are to: (a)
increase potable water supply by 100 mgd (about 311) and further augment water
availability by strengthening loss reduction measures; (b) improve the financial
viability of KWSB through increased revenues, cost reductions, and greater
operational efficiency; and (c) improve the organization and management of KWSB.

C. DesgrLDIL
5,          The basic activities, and targets of the project would not change. The
proposed modifications and supplemental funding woulds (a) provide assurance and
enhance project sustainability in the eyes of co-financierst (b) result in
comparably simpler project design, with project activities more focussed and with
a greater degree of success for the project to do the job which was intended; and
(c) would bring about a public utility that is well run and understands its
obligations to, and addresses the needs of, its customers.
6.          It is with this is mind that the proposed reformulated project contains
appropriate revisions in the project scope, consistent with funding constraints, and
the ability of KWSB to meet its target. The proposed project, as reformulated
consists of all the necessary facilities to complete thr conveyance system for
delivery of 100 mgd into KWSB's distribution system.  It is proposed that the
following components, that are not crucial for meeting the main objective of the
project, be deferred: (a) the Hub treatment plant; (b) the Pipri filters; (c) the
South East Karachi primary distribution system strengthening; (d) the water
conseristion component of the consumer education program; and (e) the distribution
system mapping. The deferment of these components reduces the base cost of the
project by some 272. They would be delayed to a future date when they could be
financed under a subsequent lending operation, dealing with improvement and
rehabilitation of the distribution system. The remaining equipment and civil works
components are all integral parts of the main conveyance system. Therefore, the
deletion or deferment of parts or even one component from the convoyance system
would result in rendering the entire system useless with no additional water
reaching Karachi.
7.          At present, the supply of water is far below demand, resulting in a few
hours service per day and in some areas only during some days of the week. In such
a situation water conservation programs appear to be premature and, therefore, is
is proposed to defer this part of the consumer education program to the next lending
operation (FY95) which will specifically address operational improvements, water
loss reduction and system rehabilitation. As for the education of consumers on the
health aspects of increased water use, consultants will prepare a plan and
implementation program how to address these issues, especially with the low income
groups, and to determine the most appropiate municipal authorities to carry out this
program. The execution of a pilot project forms part of the consultancy services.
8.          The reformulated project would include three minor new components:
(a) repairs to the Hub main which is leaking at the rate of 10 mgd; (b) minor
additional works on Kinjhar-Gujjo (KG) Canal which forms part of the water
conveyance system; and (c) upgrading the finance department's mainframe computer and
the provision of personal computers to each of KWSB's twenty-two district offices.
The Hub repairs would quickly make additional water available to Karachi, the
additional works on KG-Canal would secure uninterrupted bulk water supply to the
city and the computer equipment would substantially enhance KWSB's revenue
collection efforts. In total, these three components would add about one percent
to the base cost.
9.          The major project components as reformulated are briefly described below
and are shown on IBRD Map 20572R. Tables 1 and 2 provide additional details.



- 17 -
Part A: Civil Works
(a)  pater Transmission and Distribution (US$192.6 million).  Provides for
about 100 km of a second conveyance system for an additional 0.45 nm3/d
(100 mgd) of raw Indus water from the Kinjhar-Gujjo (KG) Canal to a new
treatment facility at Northeast Karachi (NEK); strengthening of the
primary distribution system through provision of about 10 km of new mains
in Northeast and Central Karachi; repair of the Rub main, now leaking at
a rate of 10 mgd; and minor additional works on KG Canal to secure future
bulk water supply to the city. A brief description of the transmission
system components is given belows
(i)  New iGuljo - Gharo Creek (GG) Canal (Contract Wl):  A new 17.7 km
concrete lined canal will run parallel to tho existing canal along
its north side from Gujjo to Gharo Creek. The new canal will have
an initial design capacity of 0.50 Mm3/d (110 mgd) which can be
expanded later to 1.20 Mm3/d (265 mgd) by raising the embankment.
Upgrading System Headworks:   The existing tail regulator on the
Haleji-Gujjo Link Canal will be replaced at the outfall of that
canal into a new Gujjo-Gharo Canal. A head regulator (1.20 Mm3/d or
265 mgd) for the new canal will be constructed at the offtake from
the KG Canal.
(ii)  Gharo Creek Svyhon (Contract W2):   This section consists of an
inverted steel siphon of twin pipes of 1.82 m in diameter. The
pipes will be protected by concrete surround and internal cement
mortar lining. A screened entry transition is included at the tail
of Gujjo-Gharo Creek Canal (Contract W1).
(iii) Gharo Creek - Dhabeii Conduit (Contract W3): A 10 km conduit will
connect Gharo Creek Syphon with Dhabeji Pumping Station, running
parallel to tho existing conduit along its north side. The Oharo -
Dhabeji conduit is designed for an ultimate capacity of 0.97 Nm3/d
(214 mgd) as a twin reinforced concrete box conduit with internal
dimensions of 3.3m x 3.3m (10,8 ft x 10.8 ft) for each section. One
box with a capacity of 0.49 ilu3id (107 mgd) will be constructed
during the proposed project and the second box will be added in the
future. The design will incorporate facilities for isolation of
conduit sections with stoplogs.
(iv) Dhabeii Pumping Station (Contract W4A): The Dhabeji Pumping Station
will be expanded on a 2.3 hectare site (5.7 acres) located to the
northeast side of the existing station. The new facilities will add
pumping capacity of 0.48 Vm3/d (105 mgd) at 67m (220 ft) head. The
conduit at Dhabeji will terminate as an open intake/overflow
structure. Water will pass through a screen chamber containing
fixed box screens and mechanically cleaned band screens before
entering the suction conduit.
Pumps will be electrically driven double suction vertical spindle
type. The pumpsets will be contained in a pumphouse 38m x 22m (125
ft x 72 ft) including a laydown area at the end of the pumphouse



- 18 -
under the command of the station crane. The pump house will contain
three duty and two standby pumpsets.  Space on the site will be
reserved for construction of a second pumping station of the same
capacity in the future. Air vessels will be provided outside the
pumphouses for surge protection to the pumping main.
In the event of an emergency, excess water will be spilled at Siphon
No. 2. A connection into the existing siphon will be provided in
the second phase of the investment program.
(v) Service Buildinas and Staff Housing (Contract W4B): A workshop and
administration building will be provided adjacent to the pumping
station.   Staff housing will be located in the existing staf'.
housing compound. Houses will be provided for staff grades 4 and
above.
(vi)  Dhabeji Pumpina Main (Contract W5):   The project will finance
4:onstruction of a new 4.6 km pumping main to Dhabeji High Point wvth
a capacity of 0.48 Mm3/d (105 mgd), to run parallel to the existing
four pumping mains on the east side. The pumping main will consist
of two buried steel pipelines each 1500mm (59 in) in diameter. The
upper end of the pipelines will discharge into an outfall structure
containing flap gates to prevent reverse flow to also allow
isolation of the pipelines for maintenance. Leakage past the flap
gates would be removed by pumping from a sump in the outfall
structure in Phase II.
(vii)  Conduits Between Dhabeji and North East Karachi (Contracts 16. 17A
& B and 18): A new 51 km conduit with a first stage design capacity
of 0.48 Mm3/d (105 mgd), of similar design to that of the conduit
from Gharo-Dhabeji conduit, will run parallel to the existing
Dhabeji-Northeast Karachi conduit.   Twenty-one syphons will be
constructed in twin steel pipeline.
In general, the conduit will run parallel to the existing conduit on
the south side. This will place the new conduit on the downhill
side of the existing conduit where it will be protected from damage
causes by surface water run-off. The conduit will follow a detour
around the ridge pierced by the existing tunnel near Pipri. Upon
completion of the new conduit, the tunnel section could be taken out
of service for maintenance.
(viii) Pumoing Mair to Universitr Reservoir from NEK (Contract M9): Treated
water will be pumped from the new high lift pumping station at NEU
to the existing University reservoir.   The new pumping main
consisting of twin 1400mm (55 in) diameter steel pipelines each 9 Km
long will follow the alignment of the existing conduit and will have
a capacity of 0.32 Mm3/d (70 mgd).
(ix) Gravitv Main from NEK to University Main (Contract M10): The
remaining 0.14 Mm3/d (30 mgd) treated water from the new treatment
works at NEK will gravitate to the existing distribution system and
will be connected at the University Main near Rashid Minhas Road



- 19 -
junction with University Road.   The gravity main will have a
capacity of 0.14 Mm3/d (30 mgd) and will comprise one 1500mm (59 in)
diameter prestressed concrete pipeline 13.0 km long. The route will
follow the alignment of the existing conduit.
(x)  Strengthening of Primary Distribution at Northeast and Central
Karachi Zones (Contracts  711 and W12):   The priority needs for
strengthening the primary distribution system were identified based
on a computer analysis of the network to a planning horizon of 1995
(peak day flows). The project will finance the addition of 10 km of
new mains mostly parallel to existing mains. Individual mains are
shown  on  IBRD  Map.  No.  20572R.    The  strengthening  of  the
distribution system in South East Karachi Zone (Contract W13) has
been deferred due to financing constraints.
(xi) A new treated water reservoir (Contract W14) will have a capacity of
45,000 m3 (10 mg) end will be divided into two compartments. The
inlet chamber will contain isolating valves to enable either
compartment to be drained for maintenance. The outlet chamber will
contain outlet and wash-out valves. Separate outlet mains will lead
to the high lift pumping station and to the gravity treated water
main.
(xii) Hub Main Renair (Contract WNM): The 1.7 m diameter, 10.4 km long
prestressed concrete main, supplying about 30X of Karachi's water,
is leaking through the joints at an alarming rate of about 10 mgd.
due to poor installation and settlements of the pipes. Specialist
contractors will be invited to submit proposals for various repair
techniques of the joints.
(xiii)  Additional works on Kinihar-Guilo  Canal (Contract WN3):   The
headworks gates and the first kilometer of canal lining, constructed
in 1982, have been damaged and deteriorated due to lack of
maintenance and flooding. Repair of these works is urgent in order
to secure the bulk water to Karachi when the entire canal will be
put into operation after completion of the works under Cr. 1652-PAR.
(b)  Water Treatment  (Contract  =15)  (US$23.6 million).   This component
includes construction of water treatment facilities at Northeast Karachi
(0.45 Wm3/d, 100 mgd), low and high lift pumping stations, treated water
storage, maintenance and administrative buildings and staff housing. The
new treatment works are designed as the first stage of a facility that
will ultimately have a capacity of 0.91 Mm3/d (200 mgd). Each of the two
stages is designed as a separate treatment plan, twinned so that the road
arrangements are economical to minimize interconnecting pipe lengths.
The site for these new facilities will surround the existing RDA high
lift pumping station. The new facilities will require the addition of
10 hectares to the existing 21 hectares for a total site area of 31
hectares. A brief description of the components is given below:



- 20 -
(i) The conduit from Dhabeji vill terminate at the intake to the low
lift pumping station which will have a capacity of 0.45 Mm3/d (100
mgd) at lOm (33 ft) head. Water will paos through a screen chambor
containing fixed box coarse screens end mechanically cleaned band
screens before entering the suction conduit.
(ii) Pumps will be electrically driven mixed flow wet well type. The
pumpsets will be contained in a pumphouse measuring 34m x 20m (110
ft x 65 ft) with a laydown area at the end of the pumphouse under
the command of the station crane. The pumphouse will contain one
duty and one standby pumpset. The delivery busmains will discharge
into a distribution header chamber, the flow of which vill gravitate
to the treatment works.
(iii) Treatment vili be by rapid gravity filtration with inline
coagulation and disinfection by chlorination. The filters will be
accommodated in a block measuring 144m x 40m (467 ft. x 130 ft)
incorporating a central gallery 9.4m wide. After treatments Water
will gravitate to the treated water reservoir.
(iv) A new high lift pumping station will pump 0.32 Mm3/d (70 mgd) to
University reservoir at a head of 21m (69 ft). The pumpsats will be
contained in a single pumphouse 34m x 23m (110 ft x 75 ft) which
vill have I central laydown area under the command of the station
crane. As the NEK treatment site is flat, it will be necessary to
set the pump suction below ground level. Pumps will be electrically

management and training.
D. Cost Estimates
9.        Beginning in July 1991, KWSB with assistance from the project consultants
and IDA, initiated a detailed review to identify the circumstances and reasons for
the increase in project costs from the August 1986 preliminary cost estimates (on
which the appraisal base cost estimates were calculated), to the February 1992
revised project cost estimate using final engineering designs, bill of quantities
and recent bid prices.   Changes in scope of some of the civil works, the
foreign/local currency cost split ratio, escalatiou in prices in construction
materials, currency exchange rates, contingency provisions and mixed response by
foreign contractors all contributed to the ultimate cost overruns.
10.       Table 3 gives a detailed analysis of the cost overrun.  In summary, the
identifiable factors that contributed to the cost overrun are as followss
(a) At the appraisal stage, the availability of design information was
limited as was the definition of the final scope of the works.
Quantities for civil works were based on preliminary engineering designs
in the form of basic drawings for major structures and initial route
drawings derived from preliminary site investigations. Where available,
unit rates from other projects of a similar type were used together with
rates provided by GOP. Where no market rates were available, unit rates
were estimated based on published labor and material prices. Tor the
mechanical/electrical plant and equipment, quantities were taken from
outline designs and information derived from the Water Research Center
(UK) Publication TR61 with appropriate adjustments for the cost structure
in Pakistan. Subsequent international experience demonstrated that the
cost relationship in this publication were inaccurate. Cost data were
obtained also from manufacturers' pricing publications, and by reference
to other water supply projects of similar nature.  In aggregate, the
preliminary nsture of the designs available at appraisal resulted in an
underestimation of about 20S in the cost for civil works and about 42X
for plant and equipment.
(b) During final design it became necessary to incorporate some parts of the
second phase works into the first 100 mgd scheme becauses (i) sections
of the conveyance system could not be designedi hydraulically to be built
in two phases; (ii) where conduits passed through rocky areas, excavation
was doubled in order to eliminate the need for blasting during
construction of the second -phase works which would damage elements
constructed under the present project; (iii) double conduit construction
was included at major road and drainage canal crossings; and (iv) at the
treatment  plant   and  pumping   station   facilities   site  work.,



- 23 -
infrastructure, storage, main pipe and conduit work, were upgraded for
reasons of economy and to improve flexibility during second phase
construction activity. The incorporation of second phase works in the
current phase increased the base cost for civil works by about 5%.
(c)  The initial cost estimates for the project were prepared in August 1986.
They were updated by the original appraisal mission to reflect the price
level in June 1988. However, since 1986 construction prices in Pakistan
have increased rapidly and erratically.   Prices of basic building
waterials such as concrete and steel, because of the withdrawal of
Government subsidies, moved up faster than most wholesale prices. With
perfect hindsight, it appears that the 1988 (appraisal) prices might have
been slightly underestimated due to the erratic movement on construction
costs during the previous two years. Most of the escalation, however,
is clearly due to the general increase in construction costs experienced
throughout Pakistan over the last four years. In total, price escalation
increased the base cost of the project by approximately 73Z.
(d)  Foreign contractors have shown little interest to bid for civil works
contracts in the project.  Also, special procurement requirements of
ODAICDC affected the local and foreign split for, and the cost of, plant
and equipment. These two factors account for about a 382 increase in the
cost for plant and equipment and about 17S for the project as a whole.
11.       The reformulated project's cost is now estimated at Re 8,925.9 million
(US$331.7 million equivalent) and including US$15.0 million for physical
contingencies, US$13.4 million for price contingencies and US$30.9 million for
duties and taxes. The base estimate of US$303.3 million equivalent is in January
1993 prices.   The foreign exchange component is US$135.0 million, 41S of the
estimated total cost. The estimates are summarized in Schedule A.
12.       The estimates are based on price experience with contracts under the on-
going Credit 1987-PAK. All of the water components are at final design stage. An
allowance of 7Z has been used for physical contingencies on costs of water civil
works and 3% on costs of equipment.   The annual inflation rates assumed in
estimating the price contingencies for the local currency expenditures for the water
component are 8X for fiscal year 1993 and 6% thereafter.   The assumed annual
inflation rates for the price contingencies for the estimated foreign ex4nditures
are 1.8% for FY 1993, 2.9% for FY 1994, 4.4% for FY 1995, 4.5% for EY 1996, 3.9% for
FY 1997, and 4.1% for FY 1998.
13.       The estimated total number of staff-months for engineering consultancies
is 3,625 (2,575 local and 1,050 internationally recruited). The estimated total
number of staff-months for training and technical and managerial assistance is 1,215
(875 local and 340 internationally recruited).
E.  Financin:
14.       The revised project is approximately 70% of KWSB's investment program for
water conveyance and treatment from 1992 through 1997, including on-going capital
expenditures for the projects financed in part by Credits 1374-PAK and 1652-PAK,
KMCK  annual improvement program, GOP's Annual Development Plan program and the



- 24 -
components dropped from the current project that IDA plans to help finance during
the period 1995 to 1998 as part of a future credit to KWSB (now in the preliminary
planning stages). External financing for the revised project would be provided in
parallel by the ODA and CDC in the amount of US$48.8 million equivalent in grant
funds and in loans equivalent in loans for the supply of equipment for the treatment
plant and pumping stations.  IDA would finance the civil works for both water
conveyance and treatment, the institutional strengthening program and consultant
services for design and construction supervision by providing US$216.9 million
equivalent. ODA would provide about US$10.2 million equivalent of grant funds
(excluding about US$1.5 million in grant funds spent for the first year of detailed
design and construction supervision) and CDC about US$38.6 million. The proposed
external financing of US$265.7 million will finance 802 of the estimated total
project cost, or 882 of the total net of duties and taxes. It will cover 1001 of
estimated foreign exchange costs (US$135.0 million) plus 671 of the estimated local
currency costs. This level of local currency financing is justified (a) because of
the low foreign exchange component (412), and (b) because of the high proportion of
low income beneficiaries to be served in the city who would not be able to afford
more than the projected (increasing) tariff levels. GOP/GOS/KWSB would finance 201
of total project costs (US$66.0 million). The reformulated project cost estimates
by year is presented in Table 4.
F. Status of Imolementation
15.       By December 31, 1992, works under seven contracts are expected to be under
implementation. These are the water conveyance contracts W6 and W8 (already started
in 1991) and Wl, W2 and W3 (recently awarded), as well as the equipment supply
contracts W18 and W19 (financed by ODA/CDC).   A listing of the contracts and
estimated costs are given in Tables l and 2. The total value of these contracts is
estimated at US$188 million, about 601 of the estimated cost of the Project. All
the detailed designs and tender documents for the remaining contracts are completed.
16.       KWSB  has  engaged  a  British  consulting  firm  for  the  design  and
implementation of the water component of the project. This consortium is acceptable
to the co-financiers, and IDA Guidelines were followed in engaging the firms.
17.       Terms of reference for parts of the institutional strengthening component
of KWSB have been prepared by KWSB and reviewed and approved by IDA. These include
the following subprojects: organization study; training center support; creation of
the Development Wing; management training; and reduction of system losses, metering
and systems management. Terms of reference for the remaining subprojects are in
preparation.
G. Procurement
18.       The Table on the next page summarizes the estimated project costs
categorized according to the methods of procurement to be used.   For the IDA-
supported components, procurement with an estimated value of US$260.3 million will
be in accordance with IDA guidelines. Within this total, seventeen contracts for
civil works with estimated values totalling about US$216.2 million including
contingencies will be awarded through International Competitive Bidding (ICB).
Eligible domestic civil works bidders would be afforded a preference of 7.51 under



- 25 -
ICB procurement. Small contracts (average size of approximately US$0.40 million)
for equipment and vehicles, totalling about US$1.1 million including contingencies,
will be awarded according to Local Competitive Bidding procedures (LCB) acceptable
to IDA. Consultants have already been recruited for project execution and training
in accordance with IDA guidelines.

Note: Figures In parentheses are the respective amounts to be financed by DA, including contingencies. ICB
represents 66X of total procurement. This percentage is acceptable, taking into account that ODA/CDC are
financing two major equipment contracts to be procured under their procurement requirements. H.I.F.: Not
IDA-FiMenced.
a. Cofinanced in parallel by ODA/CDC: procured in accordance with ODA and CDC regulations.
19.       IDA-financed contracts above a threshold of US$1.5 million would be
subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The review process vill cover about 90
percent of the total works contract value by ICB and LCB. With 5 major contracts
awarded so far, KWSB and its consultants have demonstrated their ability to handle
procurement acceptably.
20.        Contracts for equipment with an estimated value of about US$67.7 million
equivalent will be awarded according to ODA's procurement procedures for mixed
credits under the Aid and Trade Provision and the ODA's September 19, 1986 co-
financing Agreement with IDA. Under these agreements, procurement for funding by
CDC (approximately US$38.6 million) of both foreign and local costs of equipment for
the water treatment component is not formally tied. Arrangements are a matter for
agreement between CDC and KWSB.



- 26 -
21.       The procurement procedures followed by KWSB for the contracts awarded so
far are now fully in compliance with IDA guidelines, especially with respect to
sufficient time for bid submission, proper bid opening procedures, transparent bid
evaluation criteria and, selection of the lowest evaluated responsive bid. The
bidding documents generally follow the the Bank's standard bidding documents and the
documents produced sofar are acceptable to IDA.
22.       Most of the land required for the water treatment plants, pumping stations
and conduits is already in the possession of the KWSB. However, RWSB does not yet
have all the land needed for contract W7 (Tunnel by-pass) and a small parcel at the
new Dhabeji pumping station (W4). These lands need to be in KWSB possession before
IDA will issue its no objection to these contracts.
H. Pisbursomenta
23.       The proposed IDA credit disbursements by category and by fiscal year are
shown in Schedule B. The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in
Table 5. The credit of US$216.9 million would be disbursed in 8.5 years and is
consistent with the disbursement profile for the sector and the Region. A special
account has been established to facilitate prompt disbursements against local
expenditures and smaller foreign currency expenditures. Disbursements are already
made against certified statements of expenditures (SOE) for the institutional
strengthening component, on all civil works contracts under US$100,000, locally
procured equipment and material contracts under US$50,000, and project agency
incremental start-up costs (staff salaries, etc.) of about US$0.6 million for the
first four years of implementation of the proposed training center, the Development
Wing, and the reduction of system losses, metering and pilot systems management sub-
project.   The executing agency is familiar with IDA's SOB procedures and has
demonstrated that it can complyr '±th the IDA guidelines. Supporting documentation
for disbursements against SOEs would be retained by KWSB, made available to IDA
staff for review on request, and audited ;minually by auditors acceptable to IDA
(para. 3.27 of Staff Appraisal Report No. 7355-PAR).   As shown in Table 5,
disbursements are expected to continue until June 30, 1998, the proposed Closing
Date for the reformulated credit.
24.       The GOP has already opened and maintained in US Dollars a Special Account
for KWSB in the National Bank of Pakistan with an allocation of US$5.0 million. The
opening of, withdrawals from, and replenishment of the account are done in
accordance with procedures, terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
I. The Executing Agenc
Past and Present Financial Position
25.       KWSB is still a relatively new company, only about nine years old. Steady
progress has been made in virtually all areas of its operation since its beginning
in 1983. Revenues have been growing at a compound rate of 202 p.s. while direct
operating costs have been increasing at the more modest rate of 142 p.a. Thus,
while its operating revenues covered only 82% of direct operating expenditures in
FY85, this ratio exceeded 1102 in FY91. KWSB has also increased



- 27 -
its expenditures on maintenance and repairs more than six-fold since PY85. At
present, repairs and maintenance expenditures account for over 20S of total
operating expenditures.
26.       Most of these accomplishments have occurred since the project began
implementation in 1989--although there also have been some setbacks. Water charge
increases of 35Z (July 1988) and 70% (August 1992) and a sewerage/ conservancy
surcharge of 75S (July 1990) have been implemented but KWSB still lacks a tariff
policy that would put it on a financially sustainable basis. Excessive recruitment
practices have in general been curtailed, but more effort is still required to bring
staff costs fully under control. KWSB has made considerable improvements in current
levels of collection performance (from less than an average of 402 in 1983-84 to
about 65% in 1991-92), but there still remains a significant margin to make up
before the target of 90% can be reached. Improved systems and procedures are biung
put in place to institutionalize timely collections, and to ensure proper reporting
of arrears.
27.       KWSB has shifted from a manual single-entry accounting system to a
computerized, double-entry system, but end of the fiscal year trial balances still
take several months to complete. KWSB has also computerized and integrated its
systems for payroll, cash management, financial accounting, fixed asset accounting,
capital works in progress, and financial planning and reporting, but its management
still must learn to use these systems to shape policies in a timely and effective
manner. Notwithstanding some of the setbacks above, financial and administrative
systems' development and the introduction of a computerized billing and collection
system are having a positive impact on the running of KWSB, and management's
commitment to further impr vement continues to run high.
28.       On the next page is a summary analysis of KWSB's financial accounts for
the years FY88 to FY93. Approximately 70% of income is from the sale of water to
1.2 million households, private firms, and public institutions in the city of
Karachi.
29.       Since KWSB's organization in 1983, operation and maintenance (OU) costs
for sewerage services have been subsidized by KMC. As a part of the financial
covenant for the project, KWSB initiated in 1990 a surcharge of 75S on all water
customers as a means to recover the O&M costs for this service. Fifty percent of
the recovered funds are transferred from KWSB to the KMC to cover a part of RNC's
expenditures for the conservancy services it provides to the citizens of Karachi
(solid waste collection and disposal, maintenance of public latrines, street
cleaning, and operation of the fire brigade for the city). For FY91, total revenue
from this source is estimated to be Rs 124.0 million. The figure is low due to RWSB
levying the surcharge on retail water charges only and not on the total of retail
and bulk water charges. The remaining 50% of the recovered funds are used by KWSB
to cover its O&W cost for sewerage.
30.       Specific actions to alleviate the major constraints to better financial
performance are presently being implemented and are summarized in the following
paragraphs.

31.       Billing and Collections.   Although KWSB is legally obligated by the
Development Credit Agreement with IDA to collect 901 of all its billed revenues
within three months of the billing date, the difficulty in collecting from
Government agencies has made this goal so far unreachable.  However, KWSB is
determined to meet tnis covenant and has actively sought a solution to the accounts
receivable arrears problem through: (a) undertaking a district-by-district analysis
of its customer base to target slow payers; (b) instituting management awareness and
training exercises, as well as monetary incentive programs, to increase the
timeliness of collections from these customers; and (c) working with the GOP and GOS
to find a resolution to the interagency receivables problem that exists throughout
Karachi, indeed throughout Pakistan. On the last point, resolution was reached in
July 1992 to the multi-million rupee cross accounts receivables dispute between RWSB
and KESC. To settle the dispute, the GOP and GOS each agreed to pay, on a 50s50
basis, the arrears amount owed to RESC by KWSB for periods before July 1, 1992.
This settlement was finalized in September, 1992. After July 1, 1992, RWSB has paid
its power bills promptly on a monthly basis and its policy is to continue this
practice. After five months of operation under this policy, KWSB has successfully
met its monthly obligations and is not in arrears.
32.       RWSB is presently carrying out the recommendations of a recently completed
study to improve billing and collections operations. To support these improvements,
the study recommended improvements in the quality and provision of services. The
purchase of additional computer equipment to improve the efficiency of the billing



- 29 -
and collections department, and repair and replacement of defective bulk meters are
planned as part of KWSB's program to improve quality and provision of services.
Collection targets are expected to increase from 63Z in FY92 to 902 in FY98 (Table
8) due to computerization of the billing and collections department accounts and
monitoring procedures, installation of Improved accountebility and administrative
systems, and adoption of more assertive consumer education policies.
33.       Water Charges.  The vast majority of consumers are charged on the basis
of plot or house area (whichever is larger). Bulk and industrial consumers are
charged on meter readings.   Commercial consumers (comprising about 152 of all
consumers) are charged on a net rental value basis. Given that most residential
consumers are subject to severe physical rationing--many have water only a couple
of hours two or three times a week--volumetric metering would have little, if any,
impact on water consumption. However, KWSB intends to gradually introduce metering
in high income areas as soon as sufficient bulk water supply is available for
constant pressurization.
34.       In spite of the recent increase in water and sewerage charges, present
tariffs in Karachi are low by international standards. Most low-income households
pay only about Rs 324 (US$13) per year, or less than one percent of their annual
incomes, for water and sewerage. Water charges for bulk consumers (2,000 in number)
is Rs 25 and for retail customers it is Rs 15 per 1,000 gallons, averaging about Rs
21 per 1,000 gallons. In contrast, average incremental cost for the additional
water supply is about Rs 6011000 gallons in current prices or three times the
average water charge.
35.       ODeratina Costs. KWSB continues to have high operating costs, especially
in the areas of medical claims, staffing, wages and salaries, and tanker operations.
Specific measures are presently under review and are being implemented to correct
these problems.
36.       Personnel costs for FY92 are expected to be Ks 325 million.  Rates of
growth have been around 15.6Z per year for the period FY88 to FY91 and reflect both
rate increases as well as increases in the number of personnel. KWSB has stated its
intention to contain the growth of wages and salaries to the growth of federal
government increases. Staffing ratios in KWSB are higher by at least 30 to 402 in
comparison with similar water companies in developing countries. KWSB is presently
undergoing a major reorganization that is expected to improve the size and
composition of its personnel with curtailment of further recruiting and retraining
of redundant personnel to fill vacant positions.
37.       During FY92 KWSB provided about 1,800 tanker trips a day to serve areas
with their water supply cut-off at a cost of about Rs 50 million per annum in
transportation charges. It is believed that not all deliveries are to distressed
areas. Some supplies are also reportedly sold commercially by the tanker operators.
KWSB recently decided on a program of corrective measures to improve its tanker
operations and reduce tanker operating costs by about 202.
38.       The following issues, which also constrain KWSB's financial performance
are under review and corrective measures are expected to be adopted soon. JWSB's
accounting procedures are slow, cumbersome and not always accurate, in part due to
a lack of adequately trained personnel. A comprehensive training program for KWSB
accountants has been approved and began in July 1992. In addition, to overcome



- 30 -
storage and speed limitations, KWSB recently expanded the capacity of the computer
wing of billing and collections. The proposed supplemental credit would provide the
divisions with computers to replace currently manual operations.
Future Financial Performance
39.       The policy measures agreed under the project will enable KWSB to generate
revenue surpluses to service large and increasing amounts of debt over the next
decade.   KWSB will most likely have to iucrease its tariffs in real terms
significantly beginning July 1, 1994, reduce and contain recurrent expenditures and
improve operating and administrative capacities continuously.
40.       KWSB is expected to have a revenue shortfall of Re 200 million for FY92
(the final accounts are still being audited). KMC indicated that it will meet this
shortfall through a budgetary allocation through deposits to a special joint account
with KWSB. About Re 150 million should be already deposited by March 31, 1993 and
the balance will be paid by June 30, 1993. The financial projections (Table 6)
ensure that KWSB will continue to adhere to the cash generation covenant under the
project. Besides the 701 tariff increase (para. 10) effective in August 1992, this
will require a further increase of 55% for the FY95 followed by 301 for the PY96 and
20% for the FY97 and inflation thereafter. The covenant requires that KWSB generate
sufficient revenues to cover its expected cash operating expenses including
increases in working capital and debt service by June 30, 1992, and that KWSB
contribute 20% toward the financing of its capital investment program starting in
FY93.   This implies for FY94 that KWSB will realize cost reduction measures,
amounting to about Rs. 500 million, sufficient to ensure compliance with the
covenant without another tariff increase. If experience during the current fiscal
year indicates that these cost reduction measures would be inadequate to generate
a sufficient surplus to meet the cash generation covenant, a tariff increase by July
1, 1994 will be required. The projections also reflect an improvement in KWSB's
collection ratios in accordance with the targets shown in Table 8.
41.       KWSB's investment program consists of the following: 100 mgd from the
Indus source; 11 mgd from increasing the carrying capacity of the Hub transmission
line; 10 mgd from leak repairs to the Hub Trunk Main; and 65 mgd from a combination
of the balance of the 4th phase of the Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme,
relining of the KG Canal, and construction of Standby Syphons 19 and 20.  The
capital expenditure plan for sewerage includes upgrading of treatment plants 1 and
2 (ADB 793-P); augmentation and improvement of Karachi's sewerage system (ADB
1001/1002); and the GOP financed trunk and lateral sewer scheme.
42.       Key performance indicators for the projected three year period FY92 to
FY95 are presented in Table 7. Under the proposed tariff increases, the operating
ratio decreases from 1.2 in FY92 to 0.7 in PY95, income increases by over 250%, and
expenditures by 145%.  The reduction in expenditure growth rate is principally
achieved by containing personnel costs (including medical expenses) and tanker
operations.   The projected economic internal rate of return of the project
investments  is estimated at  11%  (Table 9).   Incremental  revenues based on
conservative estimates of consumer surplus are assumed to be an estimate of economic
benefits for the project.
43.       We would expect the above ROR figure to be higher than the figure in the
SAR because of the different methods employed. At the time of appraisal, KWSB faced



- 31 -
a lack of information availability, institutional capability, financial autonomy,
and a market-based pricing system, all of which made it difficult to quantatively
estimate a market-based maximum price consumers were willing to pay for additional
water. What was done, therefore, was to calculate an internal rate of return, based
on a assumed collective willingness of consumers to pay substantially increased
prices. This gave a return of about 82. Thus reliance was placed upon significant
institutional improvement components in the project, to substitute for the
contemporary shortfalls in market-based economic performance and to pave the way for
its ultimate introduction and enhancement.
J. Actions to Be Agreed
44.       The following assurance would be sought at negotiation from the Borrower,
with regard to proposed amendments to the Development Credit Agreement and from the
Government of the Province of Sindh (GOS), KMC and KWSB regarding the Project
Agreement. The principal proposed amendments would provide for the following:
(a) Successful operation of the Special Account for counterpart funds for the
project created by GOS to ensure timely and adequate provision of local
funds for the project. The account would start with a minimum of Re 75.0
million and would be replenished when the account balance has fallen
below Rs 37.5 million.   IDA, or its appointed representative, would
monitor the account by receiving directly from the Bank monthly
statements for the accounts (MOP para. 18).
(b) Conditions of effectiveness would require that:
(i) the subsidiary Loan Agreement has been amended and executed on
behalf of the GOS and KMC (MOP para.19); and
(ii)  for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, the KMC has contributed to
KWSB the necessary funds to cover all the Water and Sewerage Board's
FY92 operating expenses, increase in net working capital and debt
service (MOP para. 19, TA para. 40).
(c) The project description would be revised to reflect proposed
modifications under the reformulated project: delete references to
components which have been deferred and introduce three new minor
components (paras. 6 and 8).
(d) The Closing Date would be postponed by one year to June 30, 1998 (para.
23).
(e) The current procurement conditions would remain unchanged but with an
additional requirement that all land must be acquired and in the
possession of KWSB before IDA issues its no objection to award of all
remaining contract packages (para. 22).

Discount Factor 10X
Average incremental cost per 1000 gallon        RS       60
NOTES:  1) 0 & N costs are estimated at 5% of capital costs
2) Incremental revenues are estimated conservatively on the basis of
constmer surplus. Value estimated at Rs 100/1000 gallons or half
the price paid to vwndors (assuifng 60% sales at Rs 21/1000 gallons,
and 40% sales from tankers in the private market at Re 200/1000 galLons.)
3) Incremental sales (in NGD) were computed considering the wfeighted
averages of unaccounted for water and collection ratios. For example,
in 1998. considering the collection ratio is equal to 90% (Table 8)
and accounted for water equal to 63X (considering 37% losses), incre-
mental sales is equal to 57 IGD (0.90*0.63).
