THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT
PART 1: Grant and Project Summary
1.   Background. The Russian Federation, at one eighth of the world's land mass, contains an enonnous
diversity of vast ecosystems which represent some of the last few remaining areas where the dynamics of
ecological processes and wildlife populations can operate naturally. The eight biogeographic zones
encompass 54 ecological zones and contain associations of species which are outstanding in terms of
uniqueness, endemism and biodiversity. Of equal importance is the role of the huge expanses of forest and
tundra which act as a significant carbon sink. Although much of Russia's biodiversity falls outside of the
protected area system, this system which covers 6% of the country, is the largest, one of the most important
and until recently, one of the best organized in the world (see map IBRD 27085).
2.   The Government of Russia (GOR) recognizes that with the current transition of the Russian
economy there will be impacts on biodiversity and nature protection. Indeed these impacts are already
significantly undermining environmental protection and biodiversity conservation.  Agricultural and
forestry resource use occurs in changing and ill-defined administrative and legal circumstances, further
complicated by the uncertainty generated by the land reform and privatization process. Administrative and
political decentralization has assigned the responsibility of policy implementation to a local level, which has
resulted in a loss of coordination and a minimal implementation of laws and activity regulation. The
consequent unsustainable use of natural resources is augmented by the fragmented institutional structure -
particularly evident in the Protected Area administration - which is unifornly and simultaneously beset by
a lack of coordination, efficacy, finance and clarity. At the Federal level, the Ministry of Environmental
Protection and Natural Resources (MEPNR) is entrusted with the task of overall coordination of activities
related to Protected Areas, while certain types of Protected Areas are administered by other line agencies,
such as the Federal Forest Service (FFS) in the case of National Parks.
3.   Consequently, there is an urgent need for a clearly defined methodology which will reconcile the
current dynamism in economic and political development with the restraint required to prevent significant
biotic depredation.  In order for an ecologically sustainable use of natural resources to occur,
environmental concems must be comprehensively incorporated into the private, public and community
decision making process. This implies that decision makers have to understand the essential importance of
the nature of environmental objectives vis-a-vis other development objectives; the most effective means and
potential actions to attain those objectives; and the ways in which such environmental concems can be
effected in practical temis.
4.   This project is associated with the Environmental Framework Program of the Russian Federation
(EFP), and specifically with the Environmental Management Project (EMP) loan from the Bank to the
Russian Federation which has provided financing for the core components of the EFP. The EFP has been
designed to enhance the current system of environmental management in the Russian Federation. The EFP
is estimated to cost a total of US$282 million over a period of approximately four to five years. It
addresses environmental and natural resource management issues at a federal, regional and local levels in
demonstration areas across a wide spectra of natural areas. It has eight principal components: i)
institutional and policy strengthening; ii) air quality management; iii) water quality and water quality
management; iv) hazardous waste maiWgement; v) biodiversity conservation and natural resources
management; vi) conservation and management of cultural and natural heritage; vii) the National Pollution
Abatement Facility; and viii) Center for Project Preparation and Implementation (CPPI). Of these, the
EMP, with a total cost of US$ 110 million, concentrates on core elements of i, iii, iv, vii and viii. This

project, although financially distinct from the EMP, consists of the core biodiversity component of the EFP
and therefore is associated with, and will be implemented under, the same organizational arrangements as
the EMP (see Figure 1.1).
5.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The proposed project was developed in concert
with the Environmental Management Project. It draws substantially from the project's Project Preparation
Advance (PPA). The PPA (see Annex 1.2 for a sumrnmary of PPA activities) was particularly successfiul,
not only in disbursement effectiveness ($780,000 was disbursed in seven months), but also in making
significant progress in developing project methodology and organizational issues as well as initiating very
comprehensive and innovative work in Biodiversity Policy Matrices and protected area Gap Analysis. The
project also benefited from lessons learnt from other bi-lateral and NGO projects currently being
implemented in Russia. Additionally, in terms of experience drawn from other GEF Biodiversity projects, it
draws on other countries' projects during the GEF Pilot Phase. The key lessons include: (a) the importance
of a national strategic framework for biodiversity policy; (b) the need to build in financial sustainability and
long-term commitment from the Government; (c) the need to involve local people and regional
administrations in design and implementation; (d) the role of macroeconomic and sector policies in
establishing an appropriate incentive framework for resource conservation; (e) the need to expand the
protected area system and improve management technologies for unprotected habitats with high
biodiversity and environmental values. Finally, the community participation programs supported under the
project incorporate lessons learned from several on-going pilot activities in Russia managed by NGOs, the
Government and other donor agencies.
6.   Rationale for GEF Funding. Funding from the GEF is justified for three reasons.
7.   Global Importance of the Biodiversity of the Russian Federation. The vast range of endemic and
non-endemic species in Russia represents a significant percentage, which is now vulnerable, of the world's
total biodiversity. Additionally, the expanses of forest and tundra act as a significant carbon sink. The
rapid destruction of this, aligned to the high rates of tropical forest deforestation (the other major arboreal
sink) will have a significant affect on global climatic processes. The protected area system is in a process
of dissolution which is diminishing its effectiveness. Given the global importance of the country's
biodiversity, immediate action is required to halt this process and develop management regimes more
aligned to current social economic conditions.
8.   Financial Necessity. Russia's economic circumstances are difficult. The freeing of wholesale and
consumer prices, the rise in credit (16% of GDP went in the form of loans to state enterprises),
accompanied by a weakened financial position has led to high inflation rates, as high as 10% per month in
1993 and currently down to approximately 4-5% per month. Since 1991, imports and exports have declined
by 30 and 22 percent respectively, with the external balance still worsened by extensive capital flight. GDP
has declined by 40% as a result in the decrease in foreign trade and the sharp cutback in foreign investment
and defense expenditures. Fiscal policy during the past few years has been characterized by a significant
decline in budgetary revenues with Federal fiscal revenues declining from 17 percent of GDP in 1992 to 11
percent in 1994. Income distribution worsened significantly between 1991 and 1994 with the share of
income accruing to the richest fifth of the population nearly doubling in proportion to the share of the
poorest fifth. As a result, up to one third of the population may have fallen below the poverty line.
Therefore, those scarce resources which are available are used to address concerns which are perceived to
be priority issues - economic restructuring, developing a social safety net etc. National financial resources
are not likely to be available for biodiversity issues which may appear to be a long term priority even
though of global significance. Recognizing that this is a time that the economy is in transition, the GEF's



Grant and Project Smwmary                                                                3
role of focusing on these incremental issues within the framework of EFP and EMP will be of crucial
importance. Many opportunities for biodiversity conservation will be lost without short term GEF
assistance as institutions, policies and structures take time to adapt and be replaced in many cases by new
financial mechanisms and structures.
9.   Social participation. There is an urgent need to develop mechanisms to encourage the participation
of local communities into the management of protected areas. Their current exclusion from this process
has been a major factor in the protected areas' financial unsustainability. Such participation will need to
concentrate on education, training and arbitration measures as well as looking specifically at the
development of constructive relationships with indigenous peoples.
10.  Proiect Financin2. The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$ 26.0 million equivalent, for
which the GEF grant of US$ 20.1 million equivalent is proposed. The GOR will provide USS 4.8 million
equivalent to finance institutional strengthening actions and ecosystem protection services (budgeted under
the Federal Targeted Program of State Support of State Natural Zapovedniks and National Parks Up To
the Year 20001/). The Swiss Government is expected to provide a grant of US$ 1.1 mnillion equivalent to
parallel finance components on public support and education programs. This is in addition to the US$ 2.7
million equivalent provided by the Swiss Government which, under a broad framework program of
biodiversity conservation priorities, will be used to support sustainable forest management and the
enforcement of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES). Other initiatives under this franework program include support (minimum US$ 12 million
equivalent) from the US Government, EU TACIS and other donors.
11.  Proiect Obiectives. The main objective of this project will be to assist the Russian Federation
maintain optimum levels of biodiversity in accordance with the principles of economic and environmentally
sound sustainable development. The project will assist in ensuring the enhanced protection of biodiversity,
within and outside protected areas, in conformance with the Government's obligations under the Convention
on Biological Diversity. More specific objectives include: i) supporting the development of federal and
regional biodiversity strategies; ii) developing and implementing mechanisms and approaches which will
mainstream biodiversity conservation and environmental protection into the policy making process; iii)
assessing the protected area institutional framework and subsequently strengthening its effectiveness; iv)
enabling the participation of all interested stakeholders, including aboriginal peoples and local communities
into biodiversity conservation; and v) developing an inter-regional demonstration of inter-sectoral
biodiversity conservation and environmentally sustainable natural resource management. The realization of
these objectives will: i) substantially strengthen the economic feasibility and sustainability of biodiversity
conservation within the Russian Federation; ii) leave a legacy of integrated planning demonstrating the
necessity of combining financiaUeconomic policy, socio-economics and appropriate normative and resource
allocation mechanisms to ensure sustainable biodiversity conservation; iii) help safeguard numerous
endangered and vulnerable species including the Siberian Tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), Snow Leopard
(Pantheria uncia) and Pallas's Sea Eagle (Haleaetus leucoryphus Pall.); iv) provide a realistic policy to
ensure the protection of Lake Baikal; and, v) facilitate the integration of native peoples into protected area
management. These objectives will be monitored according to the Guidelines for Monitoring and
Evaluation of GEF Projects, and will include key monitoring criteria on biological, socioeconomic,
financial, institutional and other factors. These key project performance indicators have been identified
I/    Approved by a Decree of the President of the Russian Federation (Decree No. 1032, dated Oct. 10, 1995).

during appraisal (see Annex 5.1), and quantifiable evaluation criteria would be further refined during the
Project Launch Workshop, as agreed at negotiations.
12. Proiect Description. The proposed project would comprise four components.
13.   The Strategic Overview Component (13 percent of total costs) will assist in the strengthening of the
federal and regional biodiversity strategies already envisaged by the Russian Government under its
commitments upon ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity (17 February, 1995). It will
enable the development of a federal strategy and will also develop the methodologies and procedures for
regional strategies. As part of the latter activity, a model regional strategy for the Nizhniy Novgorod
region will be created. The initial strategies will consist of i) an assessment of extent, status and
vulnerability of biodiversity; ii) current normative instruments which affect biodiversity conservation; and,
iii) an action plan which will define remedial actions. After their completion, significant analytical and
participatory actions will be undertaken to mainstream environmental protection and biodiversity
conservation into federal and regional development policies. They will include a rigorous analysis of the
economic linkages between biodiversity conservation and sound economic policy and the development of
training programs to disseminate this information, as well as an assessment of potential conservation
funding mechanisms. In addition, a biomonitoring information system will be established to assist policy
makers take appropriate account of biodiversity issues. GET funds will be used to procure foreign and
local consultants' services for the above strategies, action plans and policy support assistance, as well as to
purchase specialized computer and GIS equipment for the biomonitoring information system.
14.   The Protected Areas Component (53 percent of total costs) will complement the GOR's federal
program for the support of natural protected areas up to the year 2000, and its current process of
reorganization of the institutions and mechanisms for nature protection. It will assist in increasing the
efficiency of the federal management, while assuring that appropriate management and financial functions
are devolved to the regions within a modified institutional structure. In parallel with this, the component
will improve biodiversity conservation by focusing on seven ecologically representative regions of high
biodiversity value. These include: Northwestern Russia, Center of European Russia, Upper and Middle
Volga, Northern Caucasus, Lake Baikal, Southern Siberia and the Far East. The component will implement
specific activities which will: i) systematically address training and professional development needs; ii)
extend educational outreach and community participation; iii) consolidate coverage of vulnerable areas
requiring protection; iv) strengthen the protection and enforcement services for the protected areas; and v)
develop a national protected area date base. The GET grant will finance consultants' services and
professional development/training packages for the above activities, as well as procurement of urgently
required field research and monitoring equipment, vehicles and computer and office equipment, and
miscellaneous infrastructure works for the selected protected areas.
15.   Tfhe Lake Baikal Regional Component (25 percent of total costs) will provide a practical regional
demonstration of the inter-sectoral and administrative coordination necessary for the incorporation of
biodiversity conservation into a development policy which meets acceptable and sustainable economic and
social welfare targets. The component presents an integrated three-pronged program to directly address
these issues and entails a set of inter-related initiatives to strengthen natural resource management and thus
biodiversity conservation capability and effectiveness at the inter-regional, the regional, and community
levels. It will enable the adoption and implementation of an inter-regional biodiversity conservation and
natural resource management strategy. Simultaneously, three model regional demonstration projects will
be implemented which will entail significant improvements in land and resource management practices, and
in the system of planning and decision-making for the purposes of biodiversity conservation and the



Grnt md Project Sufmary                                                                  S
improvement of local socio-economic conditions. At the community level, support will be provided for
biodiversity initiatives that will facilitate essential applied research in biodiversity conservation, as well as
small scale community initiatives, the work of environmental non-governmental organizations, and the
activities of native peoples which promote biodiversity conservation. The GET grant will finance
monitoring and computer equipment, and consultants' services for the inter-regional and regional activities,
and will finance the annual programs of small grants at the community level.
16.  Project Management and Coordination Component (9 percent of total costs) will supplement the
implementation structure established and already functioning satisfactorily under the EMP to implement the
project activities (details of this organization are set out below).
17.  Proiect ImDlementation  and Organization.   The project will significantly follow  the
implementation structure established and already functioning under the EMP. The MEPNR, with the
participation of the FFS, will have overall responsibility for execution of the project, but will delegate
certain administrative functions under the project to the CPPI established under the EMP and used during
the Project Preparation Activities (PPA) process. The CPPI will have responsibility for coordination
between implementing entities and multilateral and bilateral donors, for procurement, disbursement,
financial and technical management, and project identification and preparation.   The Project
Implementation Group (PIG) will operate as a department of the CPPI. The MEPNR will provide policy
guidance with regards to the project and oversee operations of the PIG, through a Biodiversity Supervisory
Committee chaired by the MEPNR's Deputy Minister for Biological Resources (Project Director ex-
officio). Such policy guidance will be necessarily coordinated with the Inter-ministerial Commission on
Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Use already established by the Governnent. The Project
will be led by a Project Manager selected according to Terms of Reference approved by Bank and reporting
to the ex-officio Project Director, with team managers assigned to the individual components. The Lake
Baikal component will be administered by regional teams to be established at each of the regional
administrations (Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude and Chita) which will be under the policy guidance of a working group
of the already existing Governmental Commnission for Baikal, which is chaired by the Minister of the
MEPNR and equal voting power is shared by the Federal government and the regional governnents. The
teams for the Strategic Overview and the Protected Areas components will be located in Moscow. These
teams will be supported by local and foreign consultants to be hired under the project with a high local to
foreign person-month input because of the extensive experience of Russian institutions in this field. A more
detailed description of the project management structure is provided in paragraphs 5.1-5.4 of the Technical
Annex.
18.  Proiect Sustainabilitv. Sustainability is sought to be ensured by: (i) developing a self-sustaining
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan linked to the economic, social and political decision making process
through the Inter-ministerial Commission on Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Use and the
EMP; (ii) dealing with sectorial and inter-sectorial issues and linkages at national and regional level; (iii)
strengthening institutional capacity to provide the long term basis for regulation, organization and
management, and (iv) developing comprehensive and innovative financial mechanisms to support
biodiversity conservation and protected areas. These mechanisms will include environmental trusts, fiscal
policy, resource use allocation mechanisms, mitigative license fees, cost sharing approaches, visitor
permits, appropriate development of ecotourism facilities and optimum staffing levels of protected areas to
ensure the effective implementation of management plans and biodiversity protection. While ensuring that
sustainability is a key development objective of this project, the Federal and local government levels are
already expected to contribute to the incremental costs of this project. At the Federal level the Federal
Program of State Support of Natural Protected Areas Up To the Year 2000, approved within the



6                                                                      Grnt axd Proled ct.wmary
Government, but awaiting endorsement by the parliament provides for three to five fold increase in
recurrent funding for protected areas and some related biodiversity conservation activities in the MEPNR.
Support for protected areas has been provided at local (oblast) levels and the regional components will be
exploring opportunities for the development of sustainability at this local level. As well the project
appraisal has refined a decreasing level of support for expenditures which though necessarily established by
the project will remain after project completion. These expenditures will therefore be progressively taken
up by the goverunent.
19.  Community and NGO Involvement. The project has provided for extensive involvement of local
communities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in its implementation. The PPA for this project
benefited from significant NGO involvement, not only in the preparation of the material, program and
details, but also in informal and formal consultation and discussion. At the intemational level IUCN and
WWF (US), and at the national level WWF (Russia), the Socio-Ecological Union (SEU) of Russia,
(through its various sub-organizations) played particularly constructive roles, as did local NGOs in the
Lake Baikal region, including Baikal Wave and the Baikal Fund. The project makes provision for NGO,
local community and native culture participation throughout all three of the sub-components in the
following ways: The Strategic Overview Component will make an assessment of native cultures'
relationship to biodiversity and will encourage local community and native peoples participation in the
establishment of regional biodiversity strategies. NGOs will be consulted and involved in the development
of the Federal Biodiversity Strategy. Within the Protected Areas Component, NGOs will be involved in
designing the education programs and will be an important target group in the outreach programs as well as
participating in the Regional Associations. Local communities are targeted as one of the main focal points
as community participation is considered to be essential in ensuring the continued survival of the protected
area system. In the same way, the role of native cultures in helping to find ways to protect biodiversity will
be examined and there are measures to introduce new categories of protection to reflect the importance of
this activity. In the Lake Baikal Component, a significant part of the community biodiversity initiatives
will involve NGOs, local communities and native cultures, and will include applied research by academic
institutions, community development linked to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development as
well as small scale grants to individuals to encourage integrated natural resource management which
enhances biodiversity protection (see Annex 3.6 for details of the implementation of local biodiversity
initiatives).

interactions between federal and regional protected area nanagement organizations; (ii)
clear arrangements shall be confirned by the MEPNR and the Sviss Governnent through
an exchange of letters, by June 30, 1996, to the effect that Project activities to be financed
by the Swiss Goverunent shall be supervised by the Project's Supervisory Conmnittee;
(iii) Lake Baikal Supervisory Corunittee shall be established, reporting to the
Goverrnental Commission for Baikal and to the Project's Supervisory Cofmmittee; and it
shall include six representatives of the administrative bodies of the Republic of Buryatia
and Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts and six representatives of the Baikal region's NGO
comununity; and (iv) in order to formally associate the Project with the EMP, the EMP
Loan Agreement will need to be amended to refer to the Project as a part of the EMP; the
letter of amnendment shall be signed on the day of Grant Agreement signing.
(c) Prior to effectiveness, that: (i) the Project Implementation Group will be established
with functions, procedures and staffing acceptable to the Bank; and (ii) the General
Consultant will be hired by the CPPI under terms of reference and in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
(d) Prior to disbursement, that: (i) for expenditures under the Strategic Overview
Component - a decree or other appropriate pronouncement acceptable to the Bank, will be
issued by the executive authorities of at least one relevant oblast expressing support and
providing for the implementation of the regional biodiversity strategies; and (ii) for
expenditures under the Lake Baikal Regional Component - the Governmental Commission
for Baikal will issue a general resolution enabling the Project's implementation, and the
administrations of Chita and Irkutsk Oblasts and the Government of the Republic of
Buryatia will issue clear implementing resolutions providing for the creation, staffing and
operations of the implementation bodies under the Lake Baikal component.
21.  Environmental Asmects.  The project will be subject to fornal environmental assessment
procedures for natural resource management development activities as a function of its policy and
regulatory support. In addition the project is expected to have a positive environmental impact through the
improved managmt and protection abilities of the protected area system of the Russian Federation as
well as the introduction of new land use and conservation measures through the implementation of the
Federal and regional biodiversity Strategies and in the Lake Baikal regional comnponent. The project has
been screened as Category C (no Environmental Assessment or environmental analysis is required).
However, the project may support some activities with potentially adverse minor impacts, such as
small-scale civil work construction in nature reserves and development of new enterprises. These activities
will require environmental screening carried out in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank.
22. Social Aspects. The project will not involve any resettlement. Protected area management plans and
biodiversity strategies will pay particular attention to the impact of project activities on cultural property
and the development of sound mitigation measures to ensure adequate protection. Similarly, the project
will closely monitor the needs of ethnic minorities living within or adjacent to project areas. In particular,
the terms-of-reference for biodiversity strategies, nature reserve management plans and community projects
will require detailed review of minority issues to ensure that they are not adversely affected by project
activities and that the social and economic benefits they receive are consistent with their cultural
preferences. Minorities will participate directly in the design and implementation of project activities and
all components will be screened to avoid adverse impacts for indigenous peoples. Where indigenous

peoples are affected by the sub-components then, as according to Bank requirements, an indigenous
peoples' development plan satisfactory to the Bank will be an integral part of the component.
23.  Project Benefits. The benefits from this project would accrue at four levels, global, national,
regional and local.
*    From the global perspective the project would further stabilize and secure an effective
protected area network which would ensure the viability and safety of some of the world's
most endangered species and areas of richest biodiversity. Also at this level, it would help
safeguard the vast expanses of vegetation and habitat which act as a vital carbon sink.
*    At the national level the project will ensure the protection of the Russian Federation's
biodiversity at a time of profound economic and political change which would otherwise pose
immediate and profound threats to its safety. It will also strengthen the institutional, planning
and renewable resource management capacity of the Government thereby helping to develop a
viable and sustainable economy. Moreover, it will develop a funding mechanism to ensure
that Russia is able to meet the incremental costs which arise from the responsibility of
protecting such large areas of globally important biodiversity.
*    At a regional level it will not only serve to protect biodiversity but will also form a model for
the synthesis of environmental protection and sustainable development in an area of
substantial biodiversity importance. Furthermore, it will establish a training program for
protected area administrators and managers, thereby ensuring that the requisite skills are
dispersed throughout Russia.
*    At the local level it will ensure the existence not only of particular protected areas and the
vulnerable species within them, but also by explicitly linking the welfare of communities to
the protection of biodiversity, develop greater economic self-sufficiency, so providing
regional and local socio-economic benefits and securing sustainable regional development. It
will also engender a trained core of local officials and enable concrete, visible local action for
biodiversity protection. Furthermore, it will allow for the positive participation of local and
indigenous people into resource management actiWies, which will enhance their ability to
maintain cultural identity, retain traditional association with customary practices and sustain
economic viability.
24.  Risks. The main risks include: (a) unsustainable resource use because of the present political and
economic situation which is creating adverse impacts on biodiversity; (b) weakening of the Federal
institutional structures and slow fornation of new structures with greater regional autonomy, which
compounds resource use issues; (c) wide geographic spread that adds to complexity and need for close
management and supervision; and, (d) inadequate participation of local communities in the implementation
of either the regional biodiversity strategies or the new protected area management plans, thereby
prolonging the unsustainable use of natural resources both within and outside of the protected areas. All of
the above will be closely reviewed under the project's monitoring and evaluation program and supervised by
Bank missions. The project counters these risks by:
*    developing national and regional programs which demonstrate the economic benefits in
incorporating the economic values of biodiversity conservation and other environmental
externalities into the decision making process;



Grtt md ProJect Swmxary
*    strengthening and clarifying institutional responsibility while simultaneously re-structuring
resource use allocation mechanisms and enabling local community participation to ensure
greater levels of transparency;
*    ensuring that the program has a clearly defined regional focus which involves local poople
and indigenous peoples in definite projects with tangible benefits;
*    maintaining a strong focus on developing;  (a) innovative financing mochanisms for
conservation; (b) comprehensive outreach programs by protected areas; and, (c) redefining
staff requirements to re-oriented protected area management plans will greatly improve the
protected area systems' economic efficiency and capability.
*    establishing an integrated regional model in Lake Baikal which by developing strong regional
interests to biodiversity protection, demonstrates the economic linkages of biodiversity
conservation to sustainable development and strongly supports the involvement of local
communities.
*    inclusion of a general supervision consultant to assist in the management and supervision of
the project.

BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT
CHAPTER 1: Country and Sector Background
A.    Introduction
1.1   In the past 70 years, the Russian Federation has inherited an enormously costly environmental
legacy from decades of inefficient economic development that basically failed to include environmental
factors in macroeconomic and sector development strategies and national investment plans. There are
ongoing costs across the economy from, for example, natural resource loss and pollution, that are not stated
explicitly in the national accounting process or sector budgets but are obviously a significant percentage of
GNP. The Russian Federation is not unique in this respect, most industrializing countries followed a
similar development path, although in many cases, made more dramatic structural adjustments at an earlier
stage of development. In the past, many countries in transition from a centralized state economy to a more
market orientated system, adopted a policy of economic efficiency in its limited traditional sense of ignoring
many environmental issues, to pursue the adjustment process. Currently, however, many reasons can be
found for incorporating environmental and natural resource management concerns directly into the
economic adjustment process as is being done in Russia and some other countries of the FSU.
1.2    As a country searches for new sources of growth and comparative advantage, it may (as in the
case of Russia) use natural resources such as forests, lands, oil, gas, minerals, water, and vegetation much
more intensively. It is plausible that natural resource intensive exports would be expanded and promoted to
replace the old traditional exports. In such a case, decision-makers have to cost existing natural resources
used in trade at their full opportunity cost, to avoid giving a false sense of comparative advantage in the
short and medium term. If these resources are not adequately costed at the macro level, use rates of those
resources will be much higher, and serious misallocation of resources, environmental degradation, or
depletion may occur. In some cases, irreversible damages may also occur in the country (for example,
destruction of biodiversity resources and fragile ecosystems). An important general point regarding
adjustments during such transition periods is that any set of reforms implemented at the national level (such
as privatization, industrial restructuring, monetary and market liberalization) will have a great influence
and impact on the allocation of resources, on the environment and the use and management of natural
resources ("natural capital" for short). These policies are not at all neutral with regard to natural resources,
the environment or biodiversity.
1.3    Another argument for including environmental concems in macro-planning is that the solution to
many environmental quality and resource management problems rests on major institutional and
organizational changes (for example, regarding property rights, taxes and subsidies, regulations, laws, and
private sector participation). If the reform process does not take into account these institutional realities at
the beginning, some of the most important sources of national capital depletion and degradation will be
very difficult to correct at the end of the process. For example, if property rights, user rights, or
management rights over a significant amount of forests, for instance, are given to an economic agent during
the reform process, without appropriate environmental assessment it will be almost impossible to reverse
those rights after the reform process; or if they are reversible, the reassignment will be at very high costs.
1.4    Government decision-makers in the executive and legislative branches at the federal, regional and
local levels in the Russian Federation are searching for ways to restructure and reform the economy to



2                                                                   Biodiversity Conservation Projet
promote efficient and more sustainable economic growth. This is an impossible goal without taking
environmental quality and natural resource management factors into consideration. Some important initial
steps have been taken, but much more needs to be done at all levels of legislative and executive
government, or this initial momentum will be lost, along with the enormous opportunities that currently
exist for influencing the reform process. The Environmental Framework Program of the Russian Federation
(EFP) and the Environmental Management Project (EMP), with which this project is associated, are
designed to help the Government of Russia to meet this urgent need and to take advantage of these
opportunities.
Geographic Context
1.5    The Russian Federation covers 17,075,400 square kilometers (kin2), almost twice the size of the
United States and 70% of the territory of the FSU. Its population in 1991, 148.5 rnillion, was exceeded
only by China, India, the United States, Indonesia and Brazil. Even though its population density is low on
average by world standards, it is characterized by wide regional variations from as high as 52-77 per km2
in the economically well developed regions in European Russia, to less than 1 per km2 in parts of Siberia.
Russia is home for about 120 nationalities or ethnic groups of which 82% represent ethnic Russians. This
situation is reflected in the country's complex system of administration. There are 20 republics within the
Russian Federation, as well as five autonomous regions and 10 autonomous districts. The remainder of the
Russian Federation is administratively divided into 6 territories (krays) and 49 regions (oblasts).
1.6    Extending halfway around the northern hemisphere and covering much of eastern and northeastern
Europe and all of northern Asia, the territory of Russia displays an enormous variety of landforms and
ecological systems. The major ecological/climatic zones stretch east to west across the country, and are
made up of various tundra subzones in the extreme northern areas, mostly above the Arctic Circle, that give
way to a vast forest belt covering approximately two-thirds of the entire country. The forest zone may be
further divided into two subzones: taiga forests and mixed forests. The taiga is characterized by the
preponderance of coniferous forests of spruce, larch, fir and Siberian stone pine. Deciduous species birch,
aspen and alder are of secondary importance. In the mixed forests, so called "broad-leaved" species (for
example, oak) appear together with conifers. Further south the land turns to open steppes, and finally to hot
drylands and semi-deserts (see map IBRD 27085). Massive mountain ranges such as the Urals, the
Caucasus and the mountain areas of Siberia (for example, the Altay, the Sayans, Lake Baikal and the
Trans-Baikal regions, and the mountains of the Far East) interrupt these lowland features. Positioned in
latitudes where precipitation mostly exceeds evaporation, Russia contains many long rivers, lakes and
wetlands. Rivers such as the Volga in European Russia and the Ob and Yenisey in Siberia are among the
world's longest. Lake Baikal is the deepest freshwater lake in the world and contains 20% of the world's
total freshwater, more than all of the Great Lakes of North America combined.

B.    Biological Diversity in the Russian Federation
1.7    The vast landscapes of the Russian Federation represent one of the last opportunities on Earth to
conserve relatively intact ecosystems large enough to allow ecological processes and wildlife populations to
fluctuate naturally. The country holds some of the world's most important repositories of biological
diversity in areas such as the Far East of Russia, considered one of the major "cradles of biodiversity",
where the Maritime (Primorskiy) Kray is recognized by the IUCN as a world center of plant diversity with
more than 3,000 higher plant species, as is the Lake Baikal Region which has approximately 2,500 species.
In the southem Far East of Russia, more than twelve million hectares (ha) have remained undisturbed due
to its inaccessibility; this, the largest remaining contiguous ecosystem in Russian Far East and Eurasia,
which protects habitat and complete ecosystems for an extensive range of endangered and vulnerable
species. Another extraordinarily floristically rich region is the Northern Caucasus, where approximately
3,700 species of 803 genera and 142 families of vascular flora are represented. These unique assemblages
of species surpass the diversity and level of endemism found among temperate forests anywhere else in the
world.
1.8    While the enormous size of the country and the large continuous stretches of similar habitat can
sometimes obscure the wealth of diversity, Russia hosts some of the world's rarest species as identified by
IUCN in the Red List of Threatened Animals. These include, among others, the Siberian Tiger (Panthera
tigris altaica), Anatolian Leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis), Siberian Musk Deer (Moschus
moschifereus), Asiatic Black Bear (Ursus Thibetanus), European Bison (Bison bonasus), Oriental Stork
(Coconia boyciana), Siberian Crane (Grus leucogeranus) as well as one of the most endangered of the
world's endangered species, the Snow Leopard (Pantheria uncia).
Nature Reserves in Russia
1.9    A significant proportion of this biodiversity is protected by Russia's nature reserve system which,
covering nearly 6% of the country, is the largest, one of the most important, and until recently, one of the
best organized systems in the world. It consists of Zapovedniks (strict nature reserves used for research
and biosphere conservation, occupying 1.42% of Russia), National Parks (protected, but allowing limited
tourism, agriculture, and grazing, occupying 0.38% of Russia), Zakazniks (special purpose reserves,
established to safeguard certain flora or fauna populations, usually for a specified period, occupying 4% of
Russia), and Natural Monuments (Pamyatniki Prirody) (see map IBRD 27085 and Annex 1.1).
1.10   As of December 31, 1994, Russia had 89 Zapovedniks, covering a total area of 29,120,800 ha,
and 28 National Parks, covering 6,443,100 ha. According to a 1991 inventory, there were more than 1,000
Zakazniks with a total area of 44 million ha. Federal-level Zakazniks number 69, occupying 11.5 million
hectares. Although Zapovedniks have been established in all of the thirteen of the physical-geographic
zones (Arctic, Fenno-Scandinavia, Russian Plain, Caucasus, Urals, Western Siberia, Caspian-Turgay,
Central Siberia, Southern Siberian Mountains, Yana-Kolyma, Baikal-Dzhugdzhur Mountain Region,
Amur-Sakhalin, Northern Pacific Region), they are not evenly distributed throughout these zones. For
example, 24 Zapovedniks have been established in the Russian plain region, while the Arctic zone currently
has only two Zapovedniks (see map IBRD 27267).
1.11   The 82 Zapovedniks administered by the MEPNR comprise more than 40% of the world's total of
strict scientific reserves (IUCN Category I). Russia has an extremely distinguished history of research in
these reserves, sixteen of which are part of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve program, and an enormous
amount of scientific data has been amassed in them over the decades. Russian nature reserves protect a

significant number of species, many of which are listed in Russian and International Red Data Books of
Rare and Endangered Species. Box 2.2 provides additional information on species representation in the
protected areas system.
C.    Associated Environment Management Project
1.12   This project is a part of the EFP and is associated with the Environmental Management Project
financed by a loan from the Bank to the Russian Federation. The EFP has been designed to enhance the
current system of environmental management which has been characterized as fragmented and
uncoordinated with more than ten government agencies having some responsibility for environmental
concerns. These agencies have found it extremely difficult to realize their objectives. This is mainly
explained by the legacy of a system of centralized management of the economy that emphasized production
over efficiency, concentrated pollution-intensive industries in enormous complexes, compartmentalized
decision-making, and treated natural resources as free goods.
1.13   The failure of the previous, centrally planned Soviet system to efficiently and effectively manage
regional economic development and environmental issues was implicitly recognized in the Russian Federal
Treaty of March 14, 1992', that formally devolves much of the former powers and resources of the central
ministries and committees to regional and local level agencies. The trend toward decentralization has major
implications for solving environmental and natural resource management problems. These changes, while
creating much uncertainty and confusion, also present unprecedented opportunities for providing
strategically targeted support and assistance, based on sound economic, social, environmental, and natural
resource management principles.  The Environmental Framework Program  and the Environmental
Management Project have been designed to support these changes.
1.14   The EFP is estimated to cost a total of US$282 million over a period of approximately four to five
years. It addresses environmental and natural resource management issues at a federal, regional and local
levels in demonstration areas across a wide spectra of natural areas. It has eight principal components: (i)
institutional and policy strengthening; (ii) air quality management; (iii) water quality and water quality
management; (iv) hazardous waste management; (v) biodiversity conservation and natural resources
management; (vi) conservation and management of cultural and natural heritage; (vii) the National
Pollution Abatement Facility; and (viii) Center for Project Preparation and Implementation. Of these, the
EMP, with a total cost of USS 110 million, concentrates on core elements of (i), (iii), (iv), (vii) and (viii).
This Project, although financially distinct from the EMP, represents the core biodiversity component of the
EFP and therefore is associated with, and will be implemented under, the same organizational arrangements
as the EMP (see Figure 1.1).

D.      Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement
1.15    The proposed project is able to draw on the extensive and successfuil PPA  initiated for this
programn as well as several projects which are currently being implemented in Russia. The PPA included
preparatory data analysis on: (i) an assessment of Russia!s biodiversity, including an initial gap analysis,
identification of a policy matrix and current biodiversity programs; (ii) a workshop on biodiversity
economics; (iii) a needs analysis for natural resource and protected area management training programs;
(iv) a workshop on biodiversity conservation management and ecotourism; and, (v) the definition of the
Lake Baika regional program including data on the harmonization of environmental standards,
development of the regional program and the Loca Biodiversity Initiative sub-component. The PPA was
extremly successful in defining and imnplanenting effective means to utilize project funds, and the Gap
Analysis and Policy Matrix studies were outstanding studies which are of importance and relevance beyond
Russia.
1.16    Additionally, in terms of experience drawn from  other GEF biodiversity projects, it draws on
project experience from other countries under the GEF Pilot Phase and from NGOs in Russia. The key
lessons include: (a) the importance of a national straegc fr-amework for biodiversity investments; (b) the
need to build in financial sustainability and long-term commitment from the Governmnent; (c) the need to
involve local people and regional adminisrations in design and implementation; (d) the key role of

macroeconomic and sector policies in establishing an appropriate incentive framework for resource
conservation; (e) the need to expand the protected area system and improve management technologies for
unprotected habitats with high biodiversity and environmental services values. Finally, the commnunity
participation programs supported under the project incorporate lessons learned from several on-going pilot
activities in Russia managed by NGOs, the Government and other donor agencies, particularly (a) the
importance of integrating local communities into the assessment of community needs through participatory
rural appraisal techniques; and (b) the need to establish clear, mutually agreed contracts that identify the
respective rights and responsibilities of reserve staff and local communities in resource use within and
outside reserves.



RUSSIAN FEDERATION
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT
CHAPTER 2: Project Background
A.    Strategic Overview
2.1    Experience from a variety of countries suggests that successful biodiversity strategies involve three
elements: identifying priority problems, defining priority actions, and ensuring effective implementation.
Effective implementation can only be achieved if the strategy's conservation objectives are realistic and
consistent with broader political, economic, and social conditions. Rigorous analysis of the losses of
biodiversity, their causes, and the social and economic impact of these losses on society can help to identify
and clarify the priority issues. But such expert analysis needs to be balanced with stakeholder involvement,
both in identifying problems and exploring solutions. Environmental strategies must involve those who are
either responsible for the problems or who are adversely affected by them, those who control the
instruments for solving the problems, and those who have relevant information and expertise. The more
diversified the actors involved, the greater the opportunities for exchanging information and improving
understanding.
2.2    A strategy planning framework which balances rigorous analysis with effective and broad
participation faces two major challenges in the Russian Federation. First, to convince the Govermment to
view the biodiversity strategy as a continuous, cyclical process within the overall planning framework for
sustainable social and economic development (environmental planning and policy-making cannot be
worthwhile or productive if it is viewed as a one-time event). Second, to help build local and regional
strategies, so that the details of policies and action plans promoted at a national level can increasingly be
generated by the institutions and communities who will be responsible for implementing them. A realistic
strategy for biodiversity conservation will necessarily involve trade-offs among economic, social and
ecological objectives. Such decisions cannot be determined by scientific or analytical methods alone. They
involve value judgments and political decisions, and therefore require broad participation in decision
making. Participation by stakeholder groups is critical for all major tasks within the strategy development
process. Effective participation can provide the basis for a realistic strategy built on a broad knowledge
base, with understanding and commitment from key groups, and with strong links to promising local
initiatives.
2.3    Effective planning for biodiversity conservation at a national level will require the early
involvement of regional entities.  In many cases, formulation of general policies will need to be
complemented by more specific planning and implementation at the regional level. Regional governments
should become parties of the strategy process at its early stages. The ability to create and implement
regional strategies for biodiversity conservation consistent with broad national policies is likely to be key
condition for success in such a vast country as Russia.
The Strategy Process
2.4    The traditional approach to strategies has been to carry out these major steps in sequence, one
after the other. Studies and information gathering would be followed by the publication of a strategy
document, which would be followed by action planning, which would be followed by implementation, and
finally evaluation. But experience now shows that this sequential approach has several critical weaknesses:
i) it encourages an excessive emphasis on the preparation of a strategy document; ii) there is no



8                                                                     Biodiversity Conservation Profect
commitment to periodically reviewing and adjusting the strategy; iii) implementation tends to be
unnecessarily delayed; and, iv) feedback into the next round of the cycle generally receives inadequate
attention.
2.5    Many of the problems with the traditional, sequential approach can be avoided if the strategy is
planned and implemented as a series of repeating steps within a continuing cyclical process. The following
four-phased process has been found to be the most constructive, and it is this process to which the project
will adhere:
Phase 1. Organizing the strategy: (Establishing the institutional framework and designating
leadership).
Phase 2. Launching the strategy: (Making plans for the strategy, including participation and
communications plans, setting priorities, preparing a preliminary statement of goals and objectives,
hiring staff and consultants).
Phase 3. Strategy Development, Action Planning. and Implementation:
(a)    Assessment and Study: (Gathering and evaluating information on the status and trends of
the nation's biodiversity and biological resources, laws, policies and organizations,
program budgets, and human capacity).
(b)    Strategy  Formulation: (Determining  goals  and  operational objectives, involving
stakeholders in identifying and analyzing options for future actions, consulting closely with
other environment and development plans and strategies). The first strategy formulation
being completed 2-3 years after the strategy has been launched.
(c)    Action planning - (Determining who will do what, where, how, and with what resources,
with timetables).
(d)    Implementation (launching practical activities as well as policy and institutional changes,
having stakeholders shift from being planners to implementors) should be continual.
Phase 4. Evaluation and Monitoring:
The results of evaluation and monitoring (establishing indicators of success, adjusting future action
plans based on accumulating experience, reporting progress to different audiences) are reviewed
and the entire strategy process adjusted as necessary at least every 18 months. The first two
phases, "Organizing the Strategy" and "Launching the Strategy" are necessarily sequential. But
the three elements in the third phase do not have to be carried out in sequence (with the exception
that action planning should follow strategy formulation). Any of these elements can begin once the
strategy has been organized and launched. The cyclical approach to the Biodiversity Strategy
process requires a comprehensive management regime, but this is particularly important in Russia,
where a biodiversity conservation strategy, in order to cope worth the demands of the transition
period may be best viewed as a process for managing and adapting to change.

Policy Support
2.6    While the federal and regional strategies enable a clear assessment to be made of the current status
of biodiversity conservation, they are not in themselves sufficient to ensure the mainstreaming of
biodiversity conservation into policy making. This can only occur if the economic linkages between
environmental protection and economic development are analyzed and articulated clearly.
2.7   Important economic policy decisions are being made without consideration of their impacts on
biodiversity. This not only leads to unforeseen - and often avoidable - environmental costs but causes
many potential economic benefits and viable investment opportunities linked to biodiversity to be
overlooked or underestimated. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve the quality and quantity of
economic information on biodiversity which flows to decision-makers. This means new and technically
sound economic analysis of topics such as agricultural and energy subsidies, forest management laws and
regulations, benefits from non-timber forest products, natural resource ownership and access rights, pricing
of tourism services, genetic property rights, biotechnology, international trade agreements and constraints
facing indigenous peoples. Such analyses are particular valid for the Russian Protected Area system, where
in real terms, the budgets have fallen by 70-90% over the past few years. This has placed enormous
pressure on conservationists and park managers to generate their own funding as well as to demonstrate the
actual and potential economic benefits of biodiversity conservation in comparison to development
alternatives. Innovative and significant work was undertaken in the PPA to identify major sectorial impacts
on biodiversity and the linkages between economic dynamics and ecosystem integrity. Box 2.1 provides a
very summarized matrix derived from this activity.
2.8   In economic terms, biodiversity losses can be attributed to two fundamental forces. First, the
increasing demand for unconverted land and unexploited natural resources attributable to expanding human
population densities, income growth and inequitable distributions of income and wealth. Second, the
investments being made in managing and regulating natural resource use and environmental impacts are
inadequate. This under-investment in biodiversity arises because the true rate of return earned by natural
resource owners from land conversion or resource over-exploitation is usually less than the perceived rate
of return (i.e., externalities have been ignored). This underestimation of the value of biodiversity
conservation can be attributed to (a) market failures, (b) missing markets for global benefits, and (c)
inefficient and misguided government policy interventions.
2.9    Specifically, economic approaches can be used to analyze different aspects of the biodiversity
problem in Russia, including: i) demonstrating the potentially significant economic values of the sustainable
use of biological resources; ii) exploring ways to realize the economic revenues from biological resources;
iii) explaining why biodiversity is threatened, despite these economic values; iv) finding cost-effective ways
to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of economy-wide policies; v) analyzing the impact on
biodiversity of Russian laws, regulations, decentralization, and social and economic policies; vi)
strengthening the economic case for biodiversity protection, generating additional funds for the protected
area system, and to clarify the trade-offs between conservation and development alternatives.

2.10     During the PPA, the establishmnent of a trust fund to further support the protected area system  was
explored. Conservation funds do exist in Russia, although their structure and operations do not resemble
the kinds of national conservation funds which have been established recently around the world. These
existing fimds currently provide about 5% of the total funds for nature conservation in Russia and
biodiversity is only one of many environmental activities supported by these funds. The Environmental
Protection Law of 1991 established Ecological Funds at federal, regional, and district levels. Currently,
their only sources of funds are fines and charges for violations of environmental protection laws, mainly
pollution limits. The Environmental Protection Law directed that such funds raised at the district level be

distributed as follows: 60% to remain in the district fund; 30% to go the regional fund, and 10% to go the
federal fund. The monies collected by these ecological funds are spent on programs established by local
Environment and Nature Resources Committees and by local authorities. Any surplus funds are deposited
in banks or invested in ecologically-oriented enterprises. The use of funds is decided by the fund managers,
who are appointed by Government agencies. The MEPNR appoints the managers of the Federal Fund,
while regional administrations (sometimes in cooperation with the MEPNR's regional branches) appoint the
managers of the regional funds.
2.11   A Seminar on the Economics of Biodiversity was conducted in March 1995, during the PPA phase
to explore economic approaches to biodiversity. This workshop was the first of its kind in Russia.
Preparation of case studies for the workshop brought together economists, scientists, protected area
managers, ecologists, geographers, and others to use methods of analysis which were completely new to the
country. Work initiated at this workshop will be continued and expanded in the project and in the further
development of the National Biodiversity Strategy.
B.    Protected Area Systems
Institutions and Management
2.12   The main legal enactment regulating the issues of nature conservation in Russia is the
Environmental Protection Law (1991). The law defines the major types of specially protected natural areas
and their protection regimes. Other legislative acts pertinent to the preservation of natural and cultural
heritage of Russia include the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of Russian Federation # 447-1 of December
25, 1990 "On Urgent Measures for Conservation of National Natural and Cultural Heritage". At the end of
1994 a new Law "On Protected Areas" was adopted by the RF creating a framework to strengthen
protected areas systems and increase coordination between them. This is the first national law dedicated
solely to protected areas. It describes all legal aspects for planning and management in all categories of
protected areas. The law divides responsibilities over different types of protected areas between federal and
regional authorities.
2.13   Russia's protected areas fall under the jurisdiction of several federal agencies within various
ministries, including the MEPNR, the FFS, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Agriculture, the
Ministry of Defense, and the Academy of Sciences. Most of the eighty-eight Zapovedniks are managed by
the Division of Nature Reserve Management in the Department of Biological Resources and Nature
Reserve Management which is in the MEPNR. Several other agencies also manage Zapovedniks including
two by the universities of St. Petersburg and Voronezh respectively, four by the Academy of Sciences and
one by the regional forest service of Bashkortostan Republic. The MEPNR houses a Division of Finance
which allocates funding.
2.14   National parks are established and financed by the Federal governnent, and 26 out of 28 are under
the authority of the FFS. This has, within its Department of Especially Protected Forests, a Division of
National Parks, staffed by five administrators. The National parks are directly managed by the Forest
Service's regional units, except three which are directly under the FFS. Two National parks are
subordinate to Regional administrations (Moscow city and Yaroslavl Region). Zakazniks and Nature
Monuments make up the central component of regionally administered protected areas. Zakazniks that are
established by the federal Government usually have a staff of professional game managers, or rangers. If
the Zakaznik is created at a regional level, enforcement of the protection regime is exerted by regional

2.16    Planning  for conservation programs in
individual reserves is inadequate, and  neither   __V
Zapovedniks or National Parks are required to
develop management plans. Work conducted by  scientists in nature reserves is poorly integrated into
management and policy development. Even the limited funds available for individual protected areas are not
being used effectively. Virtually all reserve budgets are now spent on wages and salaries. But staff wages
do not even reach subsistence levels. Infrastructure maintenance is ignored. Offices, laboratories, vehicles,
and other equipment are deteriorating while many protected areas have become almost defenseless against
the growing pressures around their borders. Most Zapovednik and National Park directors lack specific
experience or training in protected area management, although they often have a diverse and valuable range
of skills. There is a severe lack of training programs to build on these diverse skills, and to provide a
common understanding of the nature reserves' purpose and the tools by which this could be implemented.

coniferous forest to steppe
and semi-desert - together with the lake itself, constitutes an area of exceptional diversity with 2,500
species of flora (10% of which are endemic) and 400 species of birds. The Baikal watershed (338,770
kin2) is predominantly located in Russia where it falls under the jurisdiction of Irkutsk Oblast, Buryatia and
Chita Oblast. The IUCN Red Data Book and that of the Russian Federation (1988) indicate that 10
species are threatened or endangered, including the Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), Pallas's Sea Eagle
(Haleaetus leucoryphus Pall.), Siberian ld Dog (Cuon alpinus Pall.) and the Snow Leopard (Panthera
uncia). Currently, the protected area network in the region consists of 5 Zapovedniks (2 of which are
Biosphere Reserves), 3 National Parks, 27 Zakazniks and several dozen botanical and zoological Natural
Monuments. In addition, in 1987 a forestry protection zone was established which prevents logging from
the shore to the ridge line around the lake (see map IBRD 27268).
2.18    The region has an extremely rich and diverse cultural history as attested to by numerous
archaeological sites, many of which are also of global significance. Today, the region's native peoples are
represented by Buryats, Evenks, and Soyots. Although cultural traditions have been eroded this century,
many skills and traditional knowledge still abound. There is also a strong desire to bring back many of
these traditions today. A complex of economic, social and institutional characteristics and processes and



14                                                                    Biodiveisity Conservation Project
resulting land, water and resource use policies and practices, however, has led to considerable, yet still
largely localized, environmental degradation with attendant stresses on the region's biodiversity.
2.19   The transition period, with the attendant dynamics of decentralization and market liberalization has
deepened the administrative authorities dependence upon the natural resources in the area as well as forcing
the industrial sectors to search for wider and different markets. In common with much of Siberia, the
region is faced with an outmoded industrial infrastructure of insufficient flexibility to be readily adaptable,
the economic viability of which is further undermined by the rising cost of fuel and the declining transport
subsidies which used to enable access to far-distant potential markets. The transition period has had
contrasting impacts on the environment. On one hand, the production decreases have led to a small
reduction of 5% in pollutants, but on the other, economic exigency has substantially reduced the efficacy
and potential of environmental protection and monitoring as well as distorting resource allocation
mechanisms.
2.20   The region is faced by difficult economic and social problems and inevitably policies which seek to
address these are considered to be of the highest priority. The efforts to increase production and maintain
increasingly eroded living standards inevitably create policy options with often complex trade-offs. This
can mean that attempts to forge a development model within concepts of sustainability and reduced
environmental impact are frequently frustrated. Anthropogenic influences in the region (see map IBRD
27268) are increasingly significant and include: agriculture, now a major source of chemical discharge, has
increased steppe landscapes which are now subject to substantial soil erosion from overgrazing; significant
industrialization which began in the 1950's with the creation of the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station
(1956), followed by chemical plants and the construction of the Selenga and Baikalsk paper mills and has
led to industrial pollution whether atmospheric or of effluent, becoming a major source of environmental
degradation with at least 150,000 ha of forest affected as well as between 5-10,000 km2 of the lake;
forestry which occupies 70% of the territory and is increasingly subject to forest fires (over 1,500 equaling
50,000 ha per annum), and pests and diseases (30,000 ha destroyed by Siberian Bombyx); hunting, which
has led to significant species decline and in some instances extinction (recent data - excluding poaching
which may be of equivalence - indicates that the average annual take of sables (Martes zibellina) was
6,000, squirrel (Scurius) 450,000 and muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) 95,000).
2.21   The protection of Lake Baikal and the adjacent habitat requires a coordinated approach to resource
use in the region. Such coordination, which would assign the lake as the single unit of account, against
which all development policies would be measured, implies that a clear assessment of comparative
advantage forms the basis of regional development. This, at first, might seem antithetical to the individual
regions which are attempting to maximize revenues: To counter this, an instrument is required which can
help form the necessary conceptual, legislative and project base which helps develop the over-arching
inter-regional development plan based upon ecologically and economically sustainable criteria.



RUSSIAN FEDERATION
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT
CHAPTER 3: Project Description
A.    Project Objectives
3.1   The main objective of this project will be to assist the Russian Federation maintain optimum levels
of biodiversity in accordance with the principles of economic and environmentally sound sustainable
development. The project will assist in ensuring the enhanced protection of biodiversity, within and outside
protected areas, in conformance with the Government's obligations under the Convention on Biological
Diversity. This will be achieved by: i) supporting the development of federal and regional biodiversity
strategies; ii) developing and implementing mechanisms and approaches which will mainstream biodiversity
conservation and environmental protection into the policy making process; iii) assessing the protected area
institutional framework and subsequently strengthening its effectiveness; iv) enabling the participation of
all interested stakeholders, including aboriginal peoples and local communities into biodiversity
conservation; and, v) developing an inter-regional demonstration of inter-sectorial biodiversity conservation
and environmentally sustainable natural resource management. The realization of these objectives will: i)
substantially strengthen the economic feasibility and sustainability of biodiversity conservation within the
Russian Federation; ii) leave a legacy of integrated planning demonstrating the necessity of combining
financial/economic policy, socio-economics and appropriate nornative and resource allocation mechanisms
to ensure sustainable biodiversity conservation; iii) help safeguard numerous endangered and vulnerable
species including the Siberian Tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), Snow Leopard (Pantheria uncia) and
Pallas's Sea Eagle (Haleaetus leucoryphus Pall); iv) provide a realistic policy to ensure the protection of
Lake Baikal; and, v) facilitate the integration of native peoples into protected area management. These
objectives will be monitored according to the Guidelines for Monitoring and Evaluation of GEF Projects,
and would be expected to include key monitoring criteria on biological, socioeconomic, financial,
institutional and other factors. These key indicators will be identified and agreed to during appraisal.

been  advanced.   The Secretariat will also
oversee evaluation and monitoring activities and will be in the Policy and Regulatory Support Unit in the
CPPI. Inter-ministerial coordination will be developed by the assigning personnel in each line ministry who
will be responsible for integration and implementation of the strategy and work directly with the Secretariat
and as required in the regions, such as Nizhniy Novgorod.
3.5     A clear implementation schedule will be followed for the federal strategy. It will be carried out in
four pihases: i) initial organization (May - October 96); ii) launch (November - December 96); iii) strategy
development, action planning and implementation (January 97 - 99); and iv) evaluation and monitoring, a
continuous process with major reviews every eighteen months. The regional pilot strategy (as well as
subsequent regional strategies, which will be funded at a later stage under the Policy Support Sub-
component) will also follow this format. The GEF funding will cover consultants' services, workshops and
publications.
Sub-component (b): Biodiversity Policy Support (US$ 1, 725, 000)
3.6     This sub-component will strengthen the effectiveness of the biodiversity strategies, at federal and
regional levels, by undertaking significant analytical and participatory actions which ensure that key
concepts in biodiversity economics are introduced to decision-makers and researchers. This will support the
mainstreaming of biodiversity and environmental values into policy formulation and implementation.
Support will be provided for:
-       analysis of economic linkages and impacts on biodiversity as part of a iterative policy
support program. This will set the curricula and education programs for the regional

training courses. The former will be comprehensive and continuous and will be part of the
review of the strategies (US$215,000);
-      developing and publishing guidelines, source materials and training programs on regional
strategy development (US$200,000);
-      setting up a series of stakeholder working groups - through the NGOs and unions - which
have access to the biodiversity secretariat/regional authorities (US$75,000);
-      development of 3 additional regional biodiversity strategies, after a review 30 months after
project implementation. Samara and Rostov-on-Don have already expressed an interest
(US$435,000);
-      assessment of biodiversity economics which will i) develop a training program  on
environmental and biodiversity economics; ii) develop case studies and applied instances
around the country, focusing on protected areas and sites of critical biodiversity
importance which will develop precedent; iii) disseminate case history and methodologies
to administrations, NGOs, protected area managers and the public (US$500,000);
-      assessment of potential conservation finance mechanisms, including inter alia: i) a
feasibility study on the development of creating a National Conservation Fund. The study
would assess regional and local implementation and adaptivity; taxation liability, sources
of funding, management structure, operational and procedural rules and legal status. If,
following the feasibility study, the Government decides to create a fund, the project would
support consultants activities to enable its establishment. Such a fund, if created, would
support a range of conservation programs including protected areas, biodiversity projects
instigated by communities and NGOs and applied research into biodiversity conservation
issues; and ii) the possibility for utilizing debt conversion opportunities to finance
environmental activities may be explored, if considered appropriate (US$300,000).
Sub-component (c): Biomonitoring Information System (BIOTA) (USS 1,105,000)
3.7    The lack of accurate, recent and accessible data is one of the most critical impediments to effective
environmental policy formulation in Russia. Data must be available for all Ministries and development
agencies and a concerted effort will be made to ensure that they are actively involved in the design and
preparation of the system. The project will establish a meta-data base center in the MEPNR which will
integrate scientific data, archival materials, and maps on the state and dynamics of ecosystems and natural
communities. The center will, after project establishment rely on relatively small financial support for
maintenance from the MEPNR as major data sets will be the responsibility of the cooperating agencies and
institutions. World wide examples of such systems including the ERIN system now operating in Australia
will provide guidelines for the establishment and on going support for such a system. The center will
maintain close connections with the World Conservation Monitoring Center (WCMC) and IUCN and will
also form one of the regional hubs of the Biodiversity Data Network coordinated by WCMC. The Center's
activities will include:
-      creating a network of qualified producers and users;
-     technical and consultative support for ecological information systems;

a training program  on GIS  applications for biodiversity conservation personnel,
environmental and administrative organizations;
the distribution of data-base and GIS information;
analysis and preparation of information for applied environmental purposes;
design and distribution of methodologies and GIS approaches to assist in biodiversity
monitoring and evaluation;
establish appropriate linkages to the protected area data sets (also supported by this project
in Component Two)
Component Two: Strengthening Protected Area Systems (USS 13,819,000)
3.8    This component will strengthen the protected area system. It will address the most urgent problems
which can be summarized as: i) lack of institutional incapacity to direct and manage the protected area
system; ii) ineffective material and technical capabilities of Zapovedniks and national parks; iii) lack of
public awareness (nationally and internationally) about the need to preserve Russia's biological diversity
and protected areas; iv) poorly developed mechanisms for development of the system, i.e., creation of new
types of protected areas and supporting and maintaining those protected areas which already exist; and, v)
lack of preparation in academic institutions for professional level training in protected area management.
This component will counteract these problems and is divided into five sub-components each with a subset
of model projects that will: i) facilitate institutional change in management of protected areas; ii) improve
operational and planning capabilities; iii) build public support in Russia and the intemational community;
iv) create new protected areas; and, v) provide trainingWin all aspects of protected areas management.
Criteria for program elements and model projects (improvement in the management of protected areas,
innovation, urgency, probability of success, sustainability of results, cost effectiveness, public support
building and the potential for developing inter-organization partnerships) and in the case of model projects
also included socio-economic and biodiversity value, were established in the PPA.
3.9    A significant proportion of this component will be implemented in the first two and half years of the
project at the end of which there will be a major project review. There will be an initial focus on 7 regions -
Northwestern Russia, Center of European Russia, Upper and Middle Volga, Northern Caucasus, Lake
Baikal, Southern Siberia, and the Far East - reflecting the range of ecosystems and problems that are most
suitable models for replication helping to ensure broad understanding and applicability (see Box 3.1). Each
region will provide 4 to 8 model protected areas (a total of 27 Zapovedniks and 14 National Parks for the
duration of the Project) as sites for activities described below. The approach also ensures that a range of
biodiversity is addressed by working at the regional landscape level as well as at the species level, and the
multiple sites assure reproducibility as well as system-wide applicability of products.
Sub-component (a): Institutional Support (USS 882,000)
3.10   All institutional levels of nature reserve management require support. Although this may necessitate
some reassignment of authority, and each level - federal, regional and local - will be strengthened. One of
the current distortions of the system is that the institutions' mutual inter-dependence is obscured. This
component, while modifying and clarifying some of these relationships, ensures that financial control,
policy setting and management will be coordinated and will ensure effectiveness for biodiversity
conservation.
The MEPNR and the FFS will be strengthened by establishing mechanisms, procedures
and capacities for coordinating financial and policy responsibilities for nature reserves.



Bodwiversty Conservation Prm/ect                                                        19
Training programs will be run in personnel and financial management, dispute mediation
and data base management.
-     A Joint International Expert Council on Protected Areas will be established. This Council
will convene twice a year and serve as both a contact for the project to the international
science establishment and provide technical advice on project implementation. Extended
applied research programs for protected area activities will also be funded.
-     Regional Associations will be formed and strengthened. These will provide the formal
coordination between national parks and Zapovedniks and between Regional Zapovedniks
Directorates. The latter will have been delegated responsibility from the MEPNR for the
coordination and maintenance of policy and similar management standards. The regional
associations will ensure full stakeholder participation by being composed of
representatives of local communities, indigenous peoples, NGOs, regional Environmental
Committees, as well as Zapovednik and National Park Directors. The offices, capabilities,
and equipment of the Regional Directorates serve to house both the MEPNR and Forest
Service Regional Protected Area offices and functions. A director, technical and support
staff would be hired, an office set up and management plans reviewed. A plenary meeting
of all protected area managers will be held at the end of 2 years to review the regional
operations concept and develop methodologies for its wider application.
Also, complementary to the project activities, though not funded by the Project, a Federal Coordinating
Commission (FCC) on Protected Areas will be established by the Government to improve interagency
coordination and management.  The FCC will coordinate the Federal Forest Service, Ministry of
Agriculture's Game Management Departmnent, and the MEPNR's Department for Nature Reserve
Management. Quarterly meetings will be held to review issues, initiatives, their management, and
coordination. A small Secretariat will be established with linkages to institutions such as the Academy of
Science.
Sub-component (b): Operations and Planning (US$ 2, 745, 000)
3.11   Management of core functions in both Zapovedniks and National Parks requires major adjustments.
Facing significant budgetary cuts in real terms, protected areas must streamline research and protection
operations and monitoring and preservation of ecosystems and species diversity. These sub-component
programs improve the capacity of protected areas for goal and project-oriented planning, and for
monitoring, implementing and evaluating protection and conservation initiatives. This has seven elements:
-     establishment of an information system for 110 protected areas through the procurement of
and training on PC's and 5 regional workstation servers;
-     creation of linkages to BIOTA to facilitate planning and management. Identification of
priority areas for acquisition and model sites for the first two years of this project;
-     development of management plans and fund-raising and financial planning for 10-12 model
protected areas in 3-5 model regions;



20                                                                     Biodiversity Comnwarat ion PriOect
-      establishment of ecosystem monitoring units at each Regional Office and consist of 5 Units
(measurements and analysis, lab, communications, administration, data management - to
be mostly funded through the Federal budget);
-      further encouraging scientific research in the parks and Zapovedniks by fostering
publication and participation, via grants, in related technical communities around the
world; and,
-      support of ex-situ conservation for the most acutely threatened species, including
translocation, housing and restoration.
Sub-component (c): Public Support and Education Programs (UJSS 2,903, 000)
3.12   The PPA conference held in Sochi highlighted the need for constituency building and establishing
proactive community relations. Directors of Zapovedniks and National Parks are trying hard to improve the
visibility of their reserves locally and regionally, to start educational programs, to engage in conflict
resolution and community outreach activities, and to establish mutually beneficial relationships with local
and regional governments and other entities. This sub-component will support this process by the
following three activities:
-      establishment of a Coordinating Center for Environmental Education and Public Support
staffed by 11 professionals. They will initiate model programs in the 16 model protected
areas focusing on training trainers. Collections and exhibits will be constructed and school
projects with attendant kits and materials will be developed. This sub-component will be
funded by the Swiss Government (US$668,000);
-      publications and promotional materials will take 3 forms: a) the publication of field guides
for the biota of the 5 regions as well as brochures for the initial 16 model protected areas;
b) support the production of targeted film and television programs; and, c) publication of a
newsletter, technical Journal of Applied Conservation, and other specialist publications;
and,
one or two model ecotourism projects based on ecological carrying capacity within the
context of a regional land use plan. A package of policy and incentives will be developed
for each region.



Biodiversity Conservation Project                                                         21
Sub-component (d): Ecosystem Protecton (US$ 6,448,000)
3.13   The gap analysis component of the PPA determined that the current system of protected areas,
although extensive, is neither representative nor sufficiently comprehensive to protect many areas of
vulnerable and important biodiversity (see Map IBRD 27267). The present transition period offers a
window of opportunity for the expansion of the system to appropriate levels. However, it will have to be
extended before land privatization, which is increasing, so raises land values as to make purchase costs
exorbitant. This sub-component addresses these issues by complementing the recently adopted Federal
Program of State Support of Natural Protected Areas Up To the Year 2000, and moreover, establishing a
consistent mechanism to coordinate expansion of the protected areas network. Many large tracts of
wilderness in Russia remain unprotected. Currently, the federal Government lacks a nation-wide strategy
for planning and establishing protected areas so that negotiations during the process of designating new
protected areas are ad hoc, leading to insufficient, poor quality arrangements. As new property rights
evolve, land acquisition and the attendant issues of compensation, management agreements and equity will
become increasingly complex, so that new mechanisms for creating and designating natural areas are
urgently required to ensure that ecologically vulnerable and important areas are adequately protected from
inappropriate use and ownership. The protection of biologically integrated landscapes is significant
because while animals such as waterfowl, sturgeon, and salmon migrate across international boundaries,
institutions and protection does not. Animals bound to use such routes are excellent indicators of the
viability of nature in a region. The program will work to avoid conflicts by developing methods for
reaching compromises between all stakeholders. Among the most valuable natural areas are those
territories which are used by native peoples in the north of European Russia and Siberia. Creating
protected areas in these regions requires consideration of the needs and interests of these indigenous
peoples. The following activities will be implemented:
gap analysis in 3 areas per region (15 areas in total) over 2 years will identify poorly
represented biotic communities, followed by management plans which ensure that the
protected area is based upon the annual requirements of the region's biota. The protected
area will maintain viable ecosystems and populations based on keystone representatives of
species guilds and their carrying capacity;
activities to strengthening the protection services for protected areas by developing policy
and legislation and ensuring compliance with the law. The activities include training and
professional development in information/education/public relations/conflict resolution,
modes and management of enforcement and enforcement planning, CITES (Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) related customs
enforcement, and media production;
case reviews of successful local involvement in protected area systems around the world,
regular consultation with stakeholders, studies of attitudes and determinants of
decision-making, and professional development and training in land use planning. The
project will create sustainable economic development plans for local communities;
S site specific projects will ensure ecosystem restoration of degraded and/or fragmented
areas in critical areas which require protection, with strengthening the existing protections
service through the procurement of the lacking special equipment and vehicles;



22                                                                 Btodiversity Conservation Project
establishment of new areas requiring protection, based on criteria such the area's
contribution to the maintenance of viable wild populations, the reduction of habitat
fragmentation, value as rare species habitat and contribution to poorly represented biomes;
and,
the protection of biologically integrated landscapes as habitat for migratory species will be
supported initially in the watersheds of the Dnieper, Don, Volga, and Amur rivers.
Inventories (emphasizing tagging and ringing), international data base construction, study
tours and implementation plans will be followed by initial implementation and legal
formulation.
Sub-component (e): Training (US$ 841,000)
3.14   This sub-component will develop a comprehensive training program for protected area staff, in
order to augment the current program which is neither comprehensive nor adequate. No sustained reform is
possible without systematic training in the Zapovednik and National Park systems. A comprehensive staff
recruitment and training system is needed which: provides existing staff with essential skills, organizes
professional exchanges for protected area managers, produces and publishes handbooks and training
materials, selects students at universities and trains them to become protected area managers and, in the
long run, creates special training for managers in institutes of higher education. This system needs a built-
in mechanism that evaluates current staff qualifications, training needs, and plans staff development
policies. A large gap in the education system is the lack of curricula and training related to protected areas
management, legislation, policy, planning, and practices. A comprehensive program for improving
protected area staff qualifications and integrating conservation themes into education curricula was
developed during the PPA and is ready for immediate implementation. The training program to be
supported by the project will result in 900 personnel being trained over five years, publication of key
management handbooks and development of curricula at existing academic institutions. In addition,
annual meetings for protected area managers and staff will be helo, Both will have a focal topic. They will
rotate among the Protected Areas/Regional Headquarters, with every 4th year being held in Moscow.
The latter distinct sub-component (annual courses for protected area managers) will be financed by the
Swiss Government.
Component Three: Lake Baikal Regional Program (USS 6,340,000)
3.15   The Lake Baikal component will establish a regional model (complementary to the activities
undertaken under components I and 2 above), capable of duplication, which will demonstrate the inter-
sectorial and administrative coordination necessary to incorporate biodiversity protection into a
development policy which meets acceptable and sustainable targets of economic growth and social-
economic development. This requires a region-wide system of integrated natural resource management
which treats the lake as the unit of account by integrating biodiversity values into regional economic policy
and using biodiversity as the key indicator of sustainable development. All three sub-components will
build on the considerable volume of preparatory work undertaken during the PPA.
3.16   The component will consist of three levels of activity - inter-regional, regional and local. This will
ensure the full participation of all levels of government as well as comprehensive stakeholder and public
participation.

Sub-component (a): Inter-regionalActivities (USS 950,000)
3.17   These activities will include a set of essential actions which will be carried out in each of the
administrative areas, but which will be closely coordinated. They have also been designed to interrelate
with similar but national scale components in Component One of the project and one of the features of the
project will be to provide case experience on the linkages that will be required between similar activities at
national and regional levels. Activities to be funded (mostly as consultants' services) will include:
-      analysis of linkages between economics and environmental protection (development of
matrices);
-      biodiversity and environmental economics;
-      data collection and dissemination;
-      evaluation and monitoring;
-      analysis of sources of growth and comparative advantage;
-      policy trade-offs and determination of transparent resource allocation mechanisms;
-      development of uniform  regional legal, environmental and  economic  regulatory
mechanisms; and
-      study of biodiversity conservation issues leading to development of Biodiversity Strategies.
Sub-component (b): RegionalActivities (US$ 2,890,000)
3.18   These activities will develop model biodiversity conservation activities in the Goloustnaya River,
Tugnuy-Sukhara Rivers and Khilok River watersheds and will include agriculture, forestry and land
improvement initiatives within an ecosystem approach. It will encourage the participation of programs
implemented in remote settlements aimed at improving the use of land, water and forest resources and
environmental education, as well as the creation of essential and ecologically appropriate production and
social infrastructure. It will include:
-      sustainable forest management programs which will incorporate an extensive series of
programs on forest restoration, fire ecology and management, environmental monitoring,
analysis of sustainable forest economics and forest manager training;
-      extensive environmental education training programs;
-      model agricultural projects - grazing, animal husbandry, arable and soil maintenance -
which serve to rehabilitate degraded areas of vulnerable biodiversity;
-      development of management plans for the Zakazniks within the watersheds. This will
asses status of legislative protection and develop new regulations and implementation
procedures to ensure biodiversity conservation;
-      development of model sites within the Zakazniks which demonstrate enviromnentally
appropriate methods of land and resource use; and,
-      Each watershed will establish a management unit for the project which will ensure the
involvement of all the stakeholders, including local communities and indigenous peoples.

Sub-component (c): Local Biodiversity Activities (US$ 2,500,000)
3.19   Activities financed under this sub-component will provide small grants to institutions, NGOs, local
communities, businesses and individuals to encourage small scale or specific programs. This would include
applied research projects, environmental monitoring, ecotourism, nursery development, traditional resource
use practices, appropriate husbandry programs (horse, cattle and other livestock breeding), management of
protected areas, publication of environmental literature and development of local school programs. The
component will encourage the participation of the native populations, representatives of remote settlements,
and women.
3.20    The component will finance projects with the greatest potential to promote biodiversity
conservation and improvements in natural resource management, in relation to project cost. Other
considerations taken into account in project selection will include social and educational potential,
replicability and thus transferability, innovation, professional development and training, use of local
knowledge and capability, post project assimilation/sustainability, and linkage to other elements of the
Project. Grants under this component will range from US$ 1,000 to US$50,000. The component will not
fund: (a) projects involving direct obligations of the federal, oblast, republic, or local governments, (b) pure
research or administration projects, with limited tangible benefits for biodiversity conservation and
environmental protection; (c) projects directly involving members of the Supervisory Council or their
affiliates.
3.21    Projects will be pre-selected by each of the regional center teams and reviewed and endorsed by the
Baikal Commission for projects which meet the requirements indicated in Annex 3.6. which includes the
establishment of local advisory councils (LAC's) to ensure transparent and public participation. In short,
funding will be available to local groups, organizations, NGOs, academic institutions and other local
entities, and individuals residing or working in the Lake Baikal region, specifically the Irkutsk and Chita
Oblasts and the Buryat Republic of the Russian Federation. Funding will also be available to international
individuals and groups, particularly those working in partnership with Russian counterparts.
3.22   The component will provide short, medium, and long term financing to qualified projects. All
grant recipients will be required to provide the Supervisory Council (with copies to the CPPI) with
semi-annual, mid-term and project completion reports, describing project progress, problems, and future
activities. At the completion of each project, or annually, if the project requires more than 18 months to be
implemented, grant recipients will submit to the Supervisory Council (with copies to the CPPI) financial
statements describing the expenditures under the grant for the period in question. For grants above
US$10,000, recipients will submit audited reports issued by an independent auditing organization,
concerning the financial aspects of the project.



RUSSIAN FEDERATION
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT
CHAPTER 4: Project Cost and Financing Plan
A.    Project Costs
4.1    Total project costs (see Schedule A) are estimated at US$26.0 million, including incremental costs
eligible for GET financing estimated at US$20.1 million, or about 77 percent of total costs. These
incremental costs were calculated by (a) identifying the "baseline" investment and recurrent expenditures
that Government would have made in support of biodiversity in the absence of the project ($4.8 million);
(b) calculating the cost of implementing the new policy biodiversity conservation approach across the
country ($26.0 million); (c) subtracting the baseline expenditures from the "Global" project costs to isolate
the GEF incremental costs ($20.1 million); and, (d) subtracting earmarked funding for the project from
other donors ($I.1 million expected from the Swiss Govermnent). The baseline situation was developed in
conjunction with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the MEPNR, and was derived from public
expenditure patterns of the last three years on the assumption that they would be maintained in real terms.
4.2    The total project costs include a foreign exchange component of US$9.8 million or about 38
percent of total costs. Cost estimates are based on quantities derived from technical discussions during
preparation and pre-appraisal missions. Unit costs were reviewed during pre-appraisal based on those
currently prevailing and used in the initial work by the Canada Parks Service and the Socio-Ecological
Union of Russia. Price contingencies of US$1.8 million are included. Price contingencies for costs
expressed in US dollars are based on the average annual international escalation rate of 2.6 percent a year
projected for the 10-year period 1995-2004. Physical contingencies of US$2.0 million are included, based
on an average rate of 5 percent for goods and 10 percent for services and works. Taxes and duties are
estimated at US$4.1 million and are not included in costs. Detailed cost tables are given in Annex 4.1.
B.    Financing
4.3    The financing plan is summarized in Schedule A. The proposed GET grant of $20.1 million would
cover 77 percent of total project costs. Counterpart funding would finance the balance of project costs,
including US$ 4.8 million equivalent from the Recipient and US$ 1.1 million equivalent expected from the
Government of Switzerland. The Recipient's counterpart funding would come from budgetary revenues
and would cover procurement of special field equipment for protection services and for ecosystem
monitoring stations, certain professional and legal services aimed at institutional strengthening (committed
under the Federal Program referred to in paragraph 10 of the Project Summary), ministerial administrative
costs and, partially, project operating costs (including, inter alia, office space and overhead expenses of
Project Director and Component Directors). The Swiss Government is expected to finance technical
assistance components on public support and education prograrns.
C.    Procurement
4.4    All GET-financed items will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Schedule C
summarizes the methods of procurement. Project procurement plan and arrangements for major and
critical packages are outlined in Annex 4.2. The EMP Project Implementation Manual acceptable to the
Bank will include the GEF Project Implementation Schedules that will detail procurement administration,



26                                                                  Biodiversity Comervatim Project
procurement lists, notes, and schedules -- all subject to the Bank's approval. Donor financing of the EFP
will be on a parallel basis and procurement of these items will follow the donors' procurement procedures.
4.5   Implementation of the project will require procurement of goods, the selection and employment of
consulting firms and individuals to carry out consulting and other technical assistance services. Assisted
by a General Consultant and the CPPI, the PIG will undertake the procurement of all goods and will assist
the project's Supervisory Committee, Component Managers, and regional subcomponent teams, with the
selection of consulting firms and individuals. Similarly, it will be responsible for submitting procurement
related progress reports to the Bank, as further discussed in paragraph 5.18. For administrative purposes,
all consulting firm contracts over US$50,000 will be managed by the CPPI.
4.6    Services.  Consulting and other technical assistance services worth US$16.3 million will be
provided by both firms and individual experts (of which the GET grant will finance US$ 13.3 million). The
EMP Project Implementation Manual will be used for the GEF Project, since it includes, inter alia, generic
consultant selection schedules. All consultants will be selected and employed following the World Bank's
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and using the Bank's Standard Contracts for Consultant Services
dated June 1995. Proposals will be invited from short-listed consulting finns for all assignments with an
estimated value of no less than $100,000 each. Individual consultants will be selected from an evaluation
of the CV's of at least three candidates.
4.7    The Bank will require for its prior review, the terms of reference (TOR), the method of selection,
advertisements, letters of invitation, the proposed selection, and negotiated contract prior to award for
consultant services, except for contracts less than $100,000 each. However, this exception to prior Bank
review will not apply to TORs; single source selection of firms (if any); employment of individual
consultants with contracts above $50,000; or assignments of a critical nature.
4.8    Goods worth US$4.7 million would be required for the project, which amount to 18 percent of total
project costs and comprise vehicles, office equipment, field and research equipment. The GET grant will
finance $2.9 million worth of goods.
4.9   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement procedures would apply to all contracts for
items or groups of items estimated to cost USS300,000 or more. At least one package of specialized
professional and computer equipment at an estimated value of US$350,000 is expected to be procured
using ICB procedures. Bank's Standard Bidding Documents dated January 1995 will be used by CPPI for
the preparation of all ICB procurement packages. Final drafts of these documents, including the number
and type of packages, the lists and technical specifications of equipment, will be subject to the Bank's prior
review. Preferences for domestically manufactured goods as defined in paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 and
Appendix 2 of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines will apply to all ICB packages.
4.10   International Shopping (IS) procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank would apply to all
contracts for items or groups of items estimated to cost less than US$300,000 and US$3.0 million in the
aggregate. National Shopping (NS) procurement procedures would apply to all contracts for items or
groups of items estimated to cost US$50,000 or less and US$2.6 million in the aggregate, since small
quantities of diverse equipment are required. Contracts using shopping procurement procedures would be
awarded and administered through the CPPI on the basis of comparisons of price quotations solicited from
at least three qualified suppliers, as described in the Bank Guidelines.

4.11   Each contract for goods estimated to cost US$100,000 or more, as well as the first contracts for
goods procured under IS and NS procedures, regardless of their value, will be subject to the Bank's prior
review. The Bank will also review in advance general technical specifications of all groups of items to be
procured using shopping procedures.
4.12   Other project elements to be financed under the GET grant include community investment grants
and incremental operating expenses.
4.13   Community investment grants worth of US$2.5 million under the Baikal Local Biodiversity
Activities sub-component will be governed by the implementation and procurement procedures acceptable
to the Bank that are outlined in Annex 3.6 and paragraphs 28-32 of Annex 4.2. The exact composition of
these grants cannot be known at this stage, however, they are expected to include US$1.6 million estimated
to be spent on international and national shopping for small packages of equipment and goods, and US$0.9
million estimated to be spent on technical assistance services.
4.14   Incremental operating expenses worth of US$1.4 million to be financed by the GEF will include
additional project implementation expenses incurred by the PIG and the component/subcomponent teams
and not covered by the Government contribution, such as incremental staff salaries, office rental and utility
costs, communication, stationary and copying expenses. With respect to incremental staff (estimated at
US$1.1 million throughout the life of the project), the Bank's Consultant Guidelines will apply; whereas
other items will be procured under the National Shopping procedures.
D.    Disbursement
4.15   Disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE's) for all expenditures
relating to: (a) contracts for goods, research services, training and study tours, and incremental operating
expenses not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent per contract; (b) contracts for consultancy services with
firms not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent per contract, and contracts for consultancy services with
individuals not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent per contract. The supporting documents for SOE's would
be retained by the CPPI.  In the case of contracts for goods and services above these thresholds,
disbursements would be made against the full documentation with the contracts themselves and other
supporting documents.
4.16   The project will include the following conditions of disbursement: (a) for expenditures related to
the regional biodiversity strategies under the Strategic Overview Component, a decree or other appropriate
pronouncement acceptable to the Bank, has been issued by the executive authority of at least one relevant
oblast expressing support and providing for the implementation of the regional biodiversity strategies, and
(ii) for the Lake Baikal Regional Component, the Governmental Commission for Lake Baikal should have
issued a general resolution enabling the project's implementation and the administrations of Chita, Irkutsk
and the Government of Buryatia will have issued clear implementing resolutions (decrees) providing for the
creation, staffing and operations of the implementation bodies under the Lake Baikal component.
4.17   In order to disburse the grant proceeds efficiently, a special account would be opened by the
MEPNR for the Project Implementation Group in US dollars in a commercial bank to be selected following
the formal procedure established by the Bank. (For the purposes of the Lake Baikal Regional Component,
four project bank accounts would be opened by the Baikal Component Supervisory Committee and by the
Project Teams in Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude and Chita). The initial deposit for the Special Account will be US$0.5
million, equivalent to the grant's financing of average three months' expenditures for small foreign



28                                                                  Biodiversity Conservetiox Proect
payments (under US$50,000) and all ruble payments. After the GET Grant has cumulatively disbursed
USS4.0 million, the Special Account deposit will be increased to US$0.75 million. Applications fbr
replenishment of this account will be submitted monthly, or whenever the account is drawn down by 50
percent, whichever comes first.
4.18   The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001, and the closing date would be June 30,
2002. The estimated schedule of disbursement is given in Schedule B. About 61 percent of all
disbursements will be made during the first three years, reflecting the large arnount of technical assistance,
training, and planning required to build capacity and prepare improved management plans during the early
years of the project; relatively small amounts will be disbursed for specific investment requirements during
the final two years.



RUSSIAN FEDERATION
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT
CHAPTER 5: Project Organization and Management
A.    Organization and Management
5.1    The project is associated with the EMP and will essentially use the EMP's organizational structure.
The GOR established a high-level interagency Commission for Natural Resource Management chaired by a
Deputy Prime Minister to oversee the overall policies for the implementation of the EMP components and
the associated EFP projects. The MEPNR was designated as the lead agency for the management of the
EFP projects and the coordination of their implementation. On a more technical level, several interagency
Supervisory Committees are established to provide guidance for individual EMP components and
associated projects. The project's issues are to be specifically addressed by a relevant Project Supervisory
Committee comprised of the Deputy Minister of the MEPNR (Chair), a high-level official of the FFS
(Deputy Chair) and technical representatives of these and other agencies and institutions. The Supervisory
Committee's Chair will also be appointed to work in the capacity of Project Director. Other appointed
positions within the project will be those of Component/Subcomponent Directors and FFS Coordinator, all
of whom will continue to perform official duties in their respective agencies. This is distinct from the
project management staff who will be competitively selected by the Supervisory Committee and hired on a
full-time basis by the CPPI following the agreed upon terms of reference (see Annex 5.3).
5.2    The principal role of the CPPI as a separate non-commercial legal entity govemed by the MEPNR
is to assist the project management groups of the Bank financed components of the EFP, as well as GEF
funded projects, to follow Bank procurement, disbursement, accounting, auditing and reporting procedures
and requirements. The professional and technical management of the project will be exercised by the
Project Implementation Group - an autonomous unit of the CPPI, although the CPPI's core team will
exercise the following administrative functions: (i) providing overall project coordination; (ii) disseminating
information regarding Bank and donor financed EFP components; (iii) liaising with other funding agencies;
and (iv) facilitating project training activities. The CPPI will be responsible for executing contracts with
all advisers and experts at international, national and regional levels - both individuals and firms.
5.3    The Biodiversity Project Implementation Group (PIG) will be administratively established as a
department of the CPPI, but will report on technical matters to the Biodiversity Project Director (PD), a
Government-appointed senior official who will be responsible for approving policies and providing
guidance on critical aspects of component design, operation, and review; the PD, in coordination with the
Supervisory Committee, will also appoint key staff of the PIG and will be assisted by a Special Adviser
and a General Consultant (see Fig. 5.1 for an outline of the Project's organizational structure). The PIG
will be headed by the Project Manager (PM), an individual competitively selected and hired on a full-time
basis. The PM will report to the PD and will be fully responsible for the day-to-day management of the
PIG, including: staff/consultant selection and performance; budget management and approval of
expenditures; planning, organizational federal/regional coordination of the technical work, scheduling and
quality control; reporting and reviewing of work in progress. The CPPI's Accounting and Procurement
Units will work together with the PM (assisted, if needed, by an Assistant Project Manager) on issues
related to staff/consultants selection and performance; consolidation of the overall project budget and
financial records; management of the project's Special Account and payment of invoices that have been
approved by the PM under the budget; provision of procurement and logistics services for the project;
information management and reporting; and, bilateral donor program coordination.

5.4    Similarly, at the project component level, the heads of the appropriate departments of the MEPNR
will be appointed by the Minister to perfoxt the fMnctions of Component Directors (CD) who will report
to the PD and will each be supported by one mo nre Component Managers (CM) selected and hired
through the CPPI by norgal Bank procedures. While the CD's, in consultations with the Forest Service
Coordinator, will provide operational and policy guidance for their respective component activities and
facilitate coordinated provision of the agreed-upol on with tribution to the project, the CM's will
report to their CD and to the overall PM and will be responsible for component/regional teaof budgets,
work programs and schedules, staff/tconsultant selection, hiring and performance and progress reporting.
The following organizational arrangements have been made for each GEF component, the details of which
will be supplied in the GEF-related annexes to the EMP Project Implementation Manual:
The Straaegic Overview teat will work  under the guidance of the head of the MEPNR's
Departmnent of Biological Resources Conservation who will performn the CD functions for the
whole component. Component Managers will provide day-to-day management of activities. The
whole tearn wfi work in close collaboration with the EMP's Policy and Regulatory Support
Component to maximize the complementarity between the components. A group of independent
experts will also be brought together under an International Scientific and Technical Cornunittee,
chaired by IUCN, to provide suggestions drawn from comparable programs around the world.

The Protected Areas Component team will work under the guidance of the head of the MEPNR's
Departrnent of Protected Areas who will perform the CD functions for this component and, in close
consultations with the Forest Service Coordinator, will prioritize specific Government contributions
including those under the framework of the "Federal Targeted Program of the State Support for
State Natural Reserves and National Parks for the Period up to 2000". The CD will also
coordinate education and training activities funded under the Swiss grant. The CM will report to
the CD and will be responsible for day-to-day management of the component activities.
The Lake Baikal Regional Component teams will be directed by their own Supervisory Committee
that will report to the already existing Governmental Commission for Baikal and to the overall
project's Supervisory Committee. The Baikal Supervisory Committee, that will meet 4-5 times a
year, will be chaired by the Executive Secretary of the Baikal Commission (Component Director).
The Baikal Supervisory Committee will also include a total of six representatives of the
administrative bodies of the Republic of Buryatia and Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts and six
representatives of the Baikal region's non-governmental organization (NGO) community. The six
administrative representatives will include the Regional Subcomponent Directors nominated by the
government of the Republic of Buryatia and administrations of Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts and
appointed by the MEPNR. The heads of the regional bodies of the MEPNR in the Republic of
Buryatia and Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts or their designees will be among these six representatives.
The six NGO representatives would be nominated by the NGO community for a one-year term on a
rotation basis. Each Regional Subcomponent Manager, selected and hired by the CPPI, will be
supervised by the respective Regional Subcomponent Director. The Regional Subcomponent
Directors and Regional Subcomponent Managers will be responsible for the regional and local
activities under this component. The inter-regional activities will be supervised and directed by the
Baikal Supervisory Committee. The Inter-regional Subcomponent Manager, selected from outside
the region and hired by the CPPI, will be responsible for day-to-day inter-regional activities under
this component, and will be supervised by the Component Director.
5.5   In addition, a General Consultant (GC), an internationally selected individual, will assist the
Project Director and the Project Manager in the management and supervision of the project. Services of a
Special Adviser (SA), an independent highly reputable professional specialist, will be occasionally used by
the Project Director for project activities' review and quality control.
Project Implementation Manual and Schedule
5.6    A detailed Project Implementation Manual is being developed by the CPPI under the EMP to
provide detailed instructions to project component teams on all aspects of project management and
organization. In addition a detailed project activity plan, a list of key development and monitoring
indicators and Schedule will be established by CPPI to serve as a baseline against which the overall project,
its individual components and subcomponents, and the integration across them can be evaluated in terms of
the progress in meeting the project's objectives. The Project Launch Workshop held shortly after the Grant
signing will review the schedule as well as prepare, with the assistance of the General Consultant, TOR's
and work plans for any of the outstanding subcomponents. This will expand the summarized table of the
monitoring and evaluation indicators provided in Annex 5.1 .B.

B.    Involvement of NGOs and Local Communities
5.7    NGOs in Russia consist mainly of professional, academic, and scientific organizations; unlike
NGOs in most other countries, many have close administrative ties to government agencies. Russian NGOs
directly contribute $0.32 million per annum (p.a.) to biodiversity protection and an immeasurable amount
in kind. The PPA of this project benefited from significant NGO (international and national) involvement,
not only in the preparation of the material but also in informal and formal consultation and discussion. The
Socio-Ecological Union of Russia, through its various sub-organizations played a particularly constructive
role as did local NGOs in the Lake Baikal region, including Baikal Wave and the Baikal Fund.
5.8    Several international NGOs have been involved in conservation in Russia, the total contribution of
which is approximately US$2 million per annum, although this is increasing. The World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) helped to identify conservation priorities as well as playing a pivotal role in the PPA. This
is in addition to their own programs which include extensive projects in the Russian Far East to maintain
biodiversity and habitat as well as Siberian Tiger protection. Other NGO activities include among others:
IUCN, which maintains an increasingly strong presence which is mostly directed towards assisting in
policy reform for protected areas; The International Crane Foundation (ICF), which been working on
projects including Siberian Crane reintroduction and protection, study of Siberian Crane breeding grounds
on the Ob river and assistance to the Muraviovka Nature Reserve; TRAFFIC Network International, which
is working on three projects to help promote the sustainable trade in wildlife; Eurasia Foundation which is
funding environmental management and protected area projects in Karelia, Ussuri River Watershed and the
Far East; and, ISAR which through its subsidiary, the International Clearinghouse in the Environment
(ICE), has funded 19 projects and over 100 local environmental groups. The lessons learned from NGO's
implementation experience have been reflected in the design of the project.
5.9    The project makes provision for NGO, local community and native culture participation
throughout all three of the sub-components in the following ways:
5.10   The Biodiversity Strategy will make an assessment of native cultures' relationship to biodiversity
and will encourage local community and native peoples participation in the establishment of regional
biodiversity strategies. NGOs will be formally and informally involved in the development of the Federal
Biodiversity Strategy.
5.11   Within the Protected Areas component, NGOs will be involved in designing the education
programs and will be crucial element in the outreach programs which are planned. Local communities are
targeted as one of the main focal points, in that community participation is considered to be essential in
ensuring the continued survival of the protected area system. In the same way, the role of native cultures in
helping to find ways to protect biodiversity will be examined and there are measures to introduce new
categories of protection to reflect the importance of this activity.
5.12   In the Lake Baikal component, a significant part of the Local Biodiversity Initiatives sub-
component will be available for NGOs, local communities and native cultures. This sub-component has
been specifically designed to enable such participation which will include applied research by academic
institutions, community development linked to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development as
well as small scale grants to individuals to encourage integrated natural resource management which
enhances biodiversity protection.

C.    Environmental and Social Aspects
5.13   The project will be subject to formal environmental assessment procedures for natural resource
management development activities as a function of its policy and regulatory support. In addition the
project is expected to have a positive environmental impact through the improved management and
protection abilities of the protected area system of the Russian Federation as well as the introduction of
new land use and conservation measures through the implementation of the Federal and regional
biodiversity Strategies and in the Lake Baikal regional component. However, the project may support some
activities with potentially adverse minor impacts, such as small-scale construction in nature reserves and
development of new enterprises as part of the Lake Baikal Local Biodiversity Initiatives. Therefore, the
project in general, and these activities in particular, will: (i) be subject to approval by the State Ecological
Expertise, and (ii) require the preparation of environmental screening carried out in accordance with
guidelines acceptable to the Bank. Technical reviewers will screen the projects to determine whether they
include any of the following activities, which could have a negative environmental impact: road
construction, dam construction, use of pesticides and fertilizers, deforestation, timber extraction, civil
works, large animal husbandry, wild animal husbandry, commercial fishing, ecotourism, use of exotic
species, product processing, use of large quantities of non-degradable materials, dredging and/or filling. If
the sub-project includes activities which may have a negative environmental impact, the technical reviewer
will analyze the impact and characterize it as significant or negligible. If considered significant, the
reviewer will determine whether mitigating measures could be taken which would decrease the
environmental impact of the activity to ensure environmental sustainability. For all projects involving
potentially negative envirorunental impacts, this will be monitored during implementation.
5.14   Protected area management plans and biodiversity strategies will pay particular attention to the
impact of project activities on cultural property and the development of sound mitigation measures to
ensure adequate protection. Similarly, the project will closely monitor the needs of ethnic minorities living
within or adjacent to project areas. In particular, the terms-of-reference for biodiversity strategies, nature
reserve management plans and community projects will require detailed review of minority issues to ensure
that they are not adversely affected by project activities and that the social and economic benefits they
receive are consistent with their cultural preferences. Minorities will participate directly in the design and
implementation of project activities.
D.    Project Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision
5.15   The project will implement a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation progran (the overall
program is summarized in Annex 5. 1). Each protected area will monitor impacts of project activities, using
the results of inventories, community consultation, and applied research. The project monitoring process
will be written into the individual management and development plans of each reserve.
5.16   Each nature reserve management plan will include a section on monitoring and evaluation
requirements. In addition to the primary gathering of background information at each site during the
planning process, each plan will specify additional surveys or inventories that are needed to complete the
resource inventory to form the baseline data against which future project success and impact can be
measured. Indicator parameters will be identified for regular (at least annual) resanpling and will form the
basis for monitoring trends in biotic and socio-economic factors and evaluating the effectiveness of the
management prescriptions being applied or tried in the project. Each management plan will be required to
identify its own specific goals and success indicators which can serve as targets against which to measure
project progress. In addition, each management plan will specify an annual review and revision meeting



34                                                                  Biodiversity Conservation Project
and a final evaluation in the last year of implementation. These final evaluation reports will be brought
together to form the overall project evaluation report.
5.17   Overall monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the Project Supervisory Committee with
assistance from intemational experts. The project has provided 10 person-months for this activity. To
ensure effective monitoring and evaluation, the following assurances were achieved at negotiations: (a)
adequate policies and procedures will be maintained to monitor and evaluate project implementation and
achievement of objectives on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators satisfactory to the Bank; and
(b) a monitoring and evaluation plan will be prepared and fumished to the Bank for comment by August
31, 1996, and implemented thereafter taking into account the Bank's comments.
5.18   The Project Director, assisted by the Project Manager and in coordination with the CPPI, will be
responsible for reporting progress according to the agreed implementation timetables, which are
summarized in Annex 5.2. Semi-annual reports will be submitted to the Bank showing progress assessment
of all activities against agreed annual work programs and targets and will include a review of procurement
activities. These reports will serve as a basis for Bank supervision missions and for preparation of the next
year's work program and budget. To ensure effective reporting, the following agreements were reached at
negotiations: (a) progress reports will be furnished to the Bank for review by July I and January 1 of each
year, beginning with January 1, 1997; and (b) an annual work plan and financing plan for project activities
for the next calendar year will be furnished to the Bank for review by November I of each year, beginning
with November 1, 1996.
5.19   The project will be supervised by the Bank twice a year. Supervision will be more technically
oriented, with a core team consisting of a task manager and a biodiversity specialist. As required, the core
team will be supplemented by other specialists, in such areas as institutional development, parks
management, and management information systems.  Whenever possible, local professionals and
non-governmental organizations will be recruited as short-term consultants to assist Bank supervision
missions. The first supervision mission is proposed for July 1996 to launch the project and ensure the
timely preparation of the work plan and budget for the following year. A mid-term review of the project is
planned by July 1, 1998. To ensure effective preparation of the mid-term review, the following assurances
were obtained at negotiations: (a) a mid-term report that summarizes the results of the monitoring and
evaluation program, assesses progress achieved in project implementation, and makes recommendations to
ensure efficient implementation of the remainder of the project and achievement of project objectives will be
prepared and furnished to the Bank by July 1, 1998; and (b) the government will review the mid-term
report with the Bank by September 1, 1998, and thereafter take all measures required to ensure efficient
completion of the project and achievement of project objectives, taking into account the conclusions and
recommendations of the mid-term report and the Bank's comments on the report.
E.    Project Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing
5.20   The Project Implementation Group will utilize the appropriate accounting systems established for
the project by the CPPI to ensure timely and accurate accounting of all transactions under the project. The
Project will share services of a disbursement/financial officer retained by the CPPI under its staffing plan,
which will enable the PIG to maintain all project accounts in accordance with intemationally acceptablc
accounting practices and in line with the EMP system of accounts.

5.21   The annual financial statements and reports of the Project (including the Special Account) would
be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank. The annual audit report is to be submitted to the Bank by the CPPI on behalf of the PIG within
four months after the end of each fiscal year.

BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT
CHAPTER 6: Benefits, Justification and Risks
A.    Project Benefits
6.1    The benefits from this project would accrue at four levels, global, national, regional and local.
From the global perspective the project would further stabilize and secure an effective protected area
network which would ensure the viability and safety of some of the world's most endangered species and
areas of richest biodiversity. Also at this level, it would help safeguard the vast expanses of vegetation and
habitat which act as a vital carbon sink. At the national level the project will ensure the protection of the
Russian Federation's biodiversity at a time of profound economic and political change which would
otherwise pose immediate and profound threats to its safety. It will also strengthen the institutional,
planning and renewable resource management capacity of the Government thereby helping to develop a
viable and sustainable economy. Moreover, it will develop a funding mechanism to ensure that Russia is
able to meet the incremental costs which arise from the responsibility of protecting such large areas of
globally important biodiversity. At a regional level it will not only serve to protect biodiversity but will
also form a model for the synthesis of environmental protection and sustainable development in an area of
substantial biodiversity importance. Furthermore, it will establish a training program for protected area
administrators and managers, thereby ensuring that the requisite skills are dispersed throughout Russia. At
the local level it will ensure the existence not only of particular protected areas and the vulnerable species
within them, but also by explicitly linking the welfare of communities to the protection of biodiversity,
develop greater economic self-sufficiency, so providing regional and local socio-economic benefits and
securing sustainable regional development. It will also engender a trained core of local officials and enable
concrete, visible local action for biodiversity protection. Furthermore, it will allow for the positive
participation of local and indigenous people into resource management activities, which will enhance their
ability to maintain cultural identity, retain traditional association with customary practices and sustain
economic viability.
B.    Justification for GEF Involvement
6.2    The proposed project meets the eligibility criteria and program priorities of the GEF as follows: the
project strengthens conservation, management, and sustainable use of ecosystems and habitats that have
been identified as national priorities by the government in the EFP and EMP; increases the involvement of
local communities in the planning and management of nature reserves; introduces a new, innovative
economic incentive program to reduce biodiversity land-use conflicts in critical habitats; builds institutional
capacity for preparation of conservation plans and implementation of sustainable land-use programs;
develops new research mechanisms and priorities to encourage scientific excellence and facilitate
international exchange; expands the role of local and international NGOs in sector planning and
management; and promotes conservation of endemic species, such as the Nerpa Seal and other plants and
animals unique to Russia. GEF involvement in the development of EMP has made possible a combined
approach to resource use in Russia that integrates national and global benefits into sector planning and
management. Without GEF funding, the MEPNR would continue to maintain a minimum level of reserve
protection and management on the basis of ad hoc, unprioritized responses to the sector's needs.
Recognizing that this is a time that the economy is in transition, the GEF's role of focusing on these
incremental issues within the framework of EFP and EMP will be of crucial importance. Many

opportunities for biodiversity conservation will be lost without short term GEF assistance as institutions,
policies and structures take time to adapt and be replaced in many cases by new financial mechanisms and
structures.
C.    Risks
6.3    The main risks include: (a) unsustainable resource use because of the present political and
economic situation which is creating adverse impacts on biodiversity; (b) weakening of the Federal
institutional structures and slow formation of new structures with greater regional autonomy, which
compounds resource use issues; (c) wide geographic spread that adds to complexity and need for close
management and supervision; and, (d) inadequate participation of local communities in the implementation
of either the regional biodiversity strategies or the new protected area management plans. All the above will
be closely reviewed under the project's monitoring and evaluation program and supervised by Bank
missions.
The project counters these risks by:
*      developing national and regional programs which demonstrate the economic benefits in
incorporating the economic values of biodiversity conservation and other environmental
externalities into the decision making process;
e      strengthening and clarifying institutional responsibility while simultaneously re-structuring
resource use allocation mechanisms and enabling local community participation to ensure
greater levels of transparency;
*      ensuring that the program has a clearly defined regional focus which involves local people
and indigenous peoples in definite projects with tangible benefits;
*      maintaining a strong focus on developing:  (a) innovative financing mechanisms for
conservation; (b) comprehensive outreach programs by protected areas; and, (c) redefining
staff requirements to re-oriented protected area management plans will greatly improve the
protected area systems' economic efficiency and capability.
establishing an integrated regional model in Lake Baikal which by developing strong
regional interests to biodiversity protection, demonstrates the economic linkages of
biodiversity conservation to sustainable development and strongly supports the
involvement of local communities.

ANNEX 1.2
OVERVIEW OF ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT UNDER THE PPA
AND KEY CONTRIBUTING EXPERTS
A. Outline of Activities
The Project Preparation Advance (PPA), initiated by the GEF and conducted by numerous
Russian and international experts for the preparation of the Russian Biodiversity Conservation Project, was
extremely successful in identifying priority areas needing focus for biodiversity initiatives. The PPA
included preparatory data analysis concerning:
1) an assessment of Russia's biodiversity, including an initial gap analysis, identification of a
policy matrix and current biodiversity programs;
2) a workshop on biodiversity economics;
3) a needs analysis for natural resource and protected area management training programs;
4) a workshop on biodiversity conservation management and ecotourism; and,
5) definition of the Lake Baikal regional program including data on the harmonization of
environmental standards, development of the regional program and the Local Biodiversity
Initiative sub-component.
The PPA was extremely successful in defining and implementing effective means to disburse
project funds, with the Gap Analysis and Policy Matrix components producing exceptional studies
considered of high importance and relevance among the international community. Summaries of individual
components are listed below.
Biodivesuy Gap Analysis.  Experts, under the direction of the designated Deputy Minister,
provided an analytical framework for the assessment of Russian Biodiversity. This included, among other
things, the formulation of a policy matrix enabling the identification of policies and issues impacting
biodiversity; and, a gap analysis which by examining the current extent of the protected area system will
indicate the need for further protective measures. It also entailed collating a data base on all current or
proposed natural resource management and biodiversity protection technical assistance programs.
A rapid conservation evaluation mehd for assessing the current status of biodiversity - gap analysis -
provided a systematic approach for evaluating the protection afforded biodiversity in given areas. PPA
participants used geographic information systems (GIS) as well as existing floral and faunal documentation to
identify "gaps" in Russian biodiversity protection that might be filled by the establishment of new preserves or
changes in land-use practices.
Biodiversity Economics Workshop. In a short timm period, a number of case studies were prepared on
the economics of biodiversity conservation in Russia, economic evaluation in protected areas, and assessments of
economic investments in biodiversity conservation. Experts reviewed case studies prepared by international



50                                                                                      Aeaze
economists to provide a basis for developing Russian case studies. As a result, several innovative ecomic
approaches were developed.
The results of the case studies were shared at the seminar on "Econmics of Biodiversity", held in
Moscow from February 29 to March 3, 1995. Intemational specialists were invited to give presentations and
provide expertse; these included, among others, John Dixon of the World Bank and Anil Markandya of the
Hard Institute for Intemational Development. Russian participants included representatives of Russian
protected areas, the MEPNR, scientists from economic and natural resource management institutions, Moscow
State University, and non-governmental organizations. In all, approximately 50 people actively participated in
tteseminar.
Analysis of Protected Areas Training Programs.   The goal of this component was to analyze
current staff qualifications and recommend priority measures in staff training for protected areas management.
No meaningfu reforn is possible without introduction of systematic training in the Zapovednik and National
Park systems. Currently there are no existing educational institutions to prepare personnel in nationally protected
areas. At the same time, university and forestry institute curriculums, not including pedagogical institutes, do not
contain either theoretical issues of nature protecion, or practical conservation aspects.
The PPA defined priority measures to be included in a comprehensive staff recruitment and training
providing existing staff with essential skills; organize professional exchanges for protected area managers;
produce and publish handbooks and training materials; and a long term focus on creating special management
programs within institutes of higher education. The results culminated in the creation of a complete three-year
series of short-term courses designed to involve all personnel managing Zapovedniks and National Parks.
The courses will provide, among other benefits, an excellent opportunity for managers to create
active discussion sessions on similar management problems. Courses will also act as a stimulus for future
prospects concerning these reserves and how they can organize other interactive exercises inter-regionally
Sochi Biodiversity Conservation Management and Ecotourism Workshop- In accordance with the
Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on Febxuazy 4, 1994 (Decree # 236, "Conceming Strategy of
the Russian Federation for Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development'), one of the key focuses of
the country shioud be the increased support of public education ecological programs.
Currtly, directors of Zapovedniks and National Parks are trying hard to improve the visibility of their
resaves locally and regionally by initiating educational program, to engage in conflict resolution and community
outeach activities, and to establish muually beneficial relationships with local and regional governments and
international entities. Protected area staff have never been trained to undertake most of these activities, relevant
experience is starting to accumulate.
PPA participants developed and held a conservation management and ecotourism workshop
focusing on managers' concerns. This workshop identified central issues needing to be addressed at a
national, regional and local level by protected area managers, planners and numerous other entities, to
ensure that protected areas ecological carrying capacity is not exceeded by the ad hoc development of
ecotourism policies. Research conducted in the Needs Analysis for Natural Resource Management and
Training Program was used as background material for this workshop.

Definition of the Lake Baikal Program and Lake Baikal Workshop on Inter-regional Natural
Resource Management This section provided essential information for the future development of the
regional biodiversity conservation and natural resource management (NRM) sub-component of the Russian
Federation Biodiversity Conservation Project, and in establishing a supportive data network to facilitate
operations. The Lake Baikal Workshop on Inter-regional Natural Resource Manaaement was also held
which identified and determined the fundamental economic and policy issues necessary for a comprehensive
biodiversity strategy.
Topics addressed in this component included:
a)    assessing the current available data bases, and design of information systems,
relying on current data sets and institutions to enable the harmonization of
environmental standards as preparation for the Evaluation and Monitoring
component of the Lake Baikal Regional Program;
b)    identifying key indicators, institutional and administrative, in the decision making
process for NRM and development;
c)    establishing a data communication network and process between these indicators
which ensures policy decision making relates to such inputs;
d)    collating available data on the region's ecology and biodiversity, including
preceding policy and legislative instruments with particular emphasis on those
which related to forestry, agriculture and commercial fishing;
e)    gathered and created a data base of available economic data, especially that on the
current status of utilization, yield and importance of natural resources and
associated biodiversity use - particularly the traditional utilization of the native
peoples - within the regions.

ANNEX 3.1
STRATEGIC OVERVIEW COMPONENT
SUy OMPONEiN  (A): NATioNAL AND REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY SRATEGIiEs
Organization and Management
1     The management structure will consist of a Committee chaired by the Component Director and a
Secretariat headed by the Strategy Sub-Component Manager. The main tasks of these bodies will be to
coordinate, facilitate, and support the work of the participants, i.e., the organizations inside and outside
government who prepare and implement the strategy.
Role of the Secretariat
2     The Minister of the MEPNR will provide overall direction for the strategy and will operate at an
inter-ministerial level, with full authorization and support from the country's existing inter-ministerial
institutions (e.g. the Commission on Sustainable Development). This would include: i) facilitating
intersectoral cooperation; ii) ensuring that participation and coverage of the key issues are adequate; iii)
consider the policy implications and refine policy recommendations of the strategy; and, iv) keeping
high-level political authorities and participants informed.
3     The Secretariat (the Sub-Component Managers and support staff) will be operating in
collaboration with the Policy and Regulatory Support Unit of the CPPI under the EMP and will be
responsible for the following: i) assembling and analyzing information; ii) facilitating and supporting the
fullest participation from all sectors of the population; iii) assisting in policy drafting, especially
cross-sectoral policies; iv) assisting in action planning; v) identifying areas for capacity-building is most
needed, and providing training for developing capacities in various aspects of strategy preparation and
implementation; vi) launching demonstration projects and programs in collaboration with sectoral agencies,
NGOs, and communities to build capacity, develop policy, and guide implementation; vi) running a
communications program; and, viii) coordinating strategy implementation and monitoring and evaluation.
Launching the Strategy
4     Initial meetings of the Secretariat, involving wider groups of participants where necessary, will
concentrate on: i) defining the scope of the strategy and the main issues to be addressed; ii) reviewing
existing strategic planning processes in the country (or elsewhere); identifying the highest priority
capacity-building and training needs; and, iv) preparing a work plan and schedule of responsibilities,
including plans for participation and communications.
5     On the basis of these initial discussions, the Secretariat will prepare a strategy proposal in order to
develop an early understanding of and support for the strategy. The participatory nature of the strategy
will be demonstrated by allowing the prospectus to be worked on by a wide range of key potential
participants for future phases of the process.



56                                                                                  Amexes
Regional Aspects of the Biodiversity Strategy Process
6     The declaratory nature of federal legislation, combined with the increased decentralization of
political authority and financial responsibility, means that effective implementation of the Biodiversity
Strategy will depend upon its adoption and adaptation by regional administrations. The Project will support
this process by developing the steps to establish the institutional framework for regional conservation
strategies, including the following:
(a)    prioritizing the early development of Guidelines on Planning and
Implementing Regional Biodiversity Strategies.
(b)    supporting the development of framework documents, guidelines, and
action plans developed nationally by government agencies participating in the Biodiversity
Strategy process to be passed to these agencies' regional offices.
(c)    advocating that Regional administrations or a federal agency such as the
MEPNR to be authorized to request subordinate regional agencies to gather appropriate
stakeholders in Regional Biodiversity Conservation Committees which would coordinate
development of regional strategies.
(c)    encouraging the role of Conservation NGO networks in developing and
implementing the regional strategies.
7     While Regional Biodiversity Conservation Committees would emphasize local issues and
problems, they would coordinate closely with the National Biodiversity Strategy process, to avoid
incompatibilities between regional action plans and national policies. Such coordination will be facilitated
by: i) assigning staff in the National Biodiversity Strategy Secretariat the specific responsibility for
supporting national-local linkages and coordination; ii) having National Biodiversity Strategy
representatives within each of the key national ministries.
Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Strategy
8     A pilot regional biodiversity strategy has already begun in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region, where
much of the necessary groundwork has been done. The priority task is working with an amenable local
administration to establish a nature reserve system that can be fully implemented towards the end of the
decade, in the face of massive land privatization. Certain key elements have already been delineated,
including documentation of more than 200 areas cited for preservation, development of a database for
endangered species, and development of a conservation enforcement service. Elements of a comprehensive
30-year regional conservation progran have also been drafted.
9     The Regional Biodiversity Strategy project in the Nizhniy sub-component include the following:
(a)    Strengthening the Strategy's institutional and managerial framework.
(b)    Launching the Strategy.
(c)    Undertaking a series of sectoral and intersectoral studies identifying the principle linkages
between economic activity in the region and biodiversity use and conservation. On the basis of these

studies, options should be explored for mitigating the currently harmful effects of current forestry and other
industrial practices on biodiversity.
(d)    Explore the social and economic issues surrounding the establishment of new nature
reserves, to identify the costs and benefits to various local stakeholders, to seek compromise solutions, and
to explore different forms of reserve management.
(e)    Establishing evaluation and monitoring procedures.
SUB-COMPONENT (B): BIODIVERSITY POLICY SUPPORT
10    Economics of Biodiversity Conservation.  Specifically, economic approaches can be used to
analyze different aspects of the biodiversity problem in Russia, including: i) demonstrating the potentially
significant economic values of the sustainable use of biological resources; ii) exploring ways to realize the
economic revenues from biological resources; iii) explaining why biodiversity is threatened, despite these
economic values; iv) finding cost-effective ways to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of
economy-wide policies; v) analyzing the impact on biodiversity of Russian laws, regulations,
decentralization, and social and economic policies; vi) strengthening the economic case for biodiversity
protection, generating additional funds for the protected area system, and to clarify the trade-offs between
conservation and development alternatives.
I 1   The sub-component, for which an organization such as the Department of Environmental
Economics at Moscow State University would be suitable to act as the focal point, will consist of the
following:
(a)    Development of a technical training program  in environmnental, and particularly
biodiversity, economics.
(b)    Support for further applied work to be linked to the training program:
(i)    The development of further case studies in selected protected areas, for
which guidelines will be developed. With support from interested protected area
managers and local officials, these cases will be used to combine rigorous
economic and technical analysis with actual management problems, leading to
research findings which are immediately applicable. Dissemination of the studies'
results will provide important models for similar studies to be undertaken
elsewhere, and as examples for future training courses.
(ii)    The sites chosen for case studies or applied research will, wherever
possible, overlap with areas selected for implementation of other components of
the GEF and EMP project, to maximize the opportunities for demonstrating
synergies between economic and other approaches to biodiversity conservation.
(iii)   Socio-economic  case  studies will evaluate  land  use/development
alternatives during the protected areas planning process as an input to negotiations
with regional authorities.

12    Conservation Finance Mechanism. The project would initially undertake a feasibility study for the
development of a National Conservation Fund for Russia and/or regional funds to support biodiversity
conservation. If following the feasibility study, the Government decided to create such a fund, the project
would assist the Government by providing consultant services to establish the fund's legal, administrative
and financial structure. The major objectives of such a fund would likely be: i) to secure adequate and
sustainable financial support for the protected area system; and ii) to support biodiversity conservation
projects developed by local communities and NGOs. The Conservation Fund could be financed from a
variety of sources, including among others grants, debt swaps, fiscal contributions and investment
premiums. Critically, the lengthy and expensive legal and administrative work needed to establish such
funds need only be undertaken once, to establish the umbrella mechanism. Like any other trust-like
arrangement in Russia, such an arrangement would require special legislation. Such a conservation fund, if
set up under the guidance of the GEF program, would provide significant additionality to current funding
sources. Equally, such a fund, by pooling resources would provide substantial leveraging possibilities,
both in terms of investment opportunity and operation potential.
SUB-COMPONENT (C): BIOMONITORING INFORMA TION SYSTEM (BIOTA)
13    The project will establish a meta-data base center in the MEPNR which will integrate scientific
data, archival materials, and maps on the state and dynamics of ecosystems and natural communities. The
center will, after project establishment rely on relatively small financial support for maintenance from the
MEPNR as major data sets will be the responsibility of the cooperating agencies and institutions. World
wide examples of such systems including the ERIN system now operating in Australia will provide
guidelines for the establishment and on going support for such a system. The center will maintain close
connections with the World Conservation Monitoring Center (WCMC) and IUCN and will also form one of
the regional hubs of the Biodiversity Data Network coordinated by WCMC. The Center's activities will
include:

ANNEX 3.2
Strategic Overview. Policy Support Sub-Component
Terms of Reference
1. Economic Aspects of Biodiversity
Background
1.    The Russian Federation is currently making the transition from a centralized state economy to a
more market oriented system. During this transition there exists the temptation to use its natural resources
such as forests, lands, oil, gas, minerals, water, and vegetation more intensively. The decisions to use these
resources are often made without inclusion of the full social costs in the decision-making calculus. Without
properly taking into account negative externalities resulting from pollution or diminished biodiversity, a
misallocation of resources will result.
2.     Presently there does not exist adequate expertise to provide the appropriate economic insights when
economic policy decisions are being made in natural resource use. As a result it is necessary to develop the
appropriate expertise to introduce key concepts in the economics of biodiversity to decision-makers and
researchers and to support the use of economic analysis in developing and implementing of the Biodiversity
Strategy for Russia
3.    In recognition of this, the Russian Government has approached the World Bank and received funds
to help address this issue. A grant from the Global Environment Facility of approximately $20.1 million
equivalent will be used to support the Biodiversity Conservation Priority Response Program for the
Russian Federation.
4.     The Program contains three main components: A Strategic Overview component, Protected Areas
component and Lake Baikal component. A subcomponent of the Strategic Overview is the Economics of
Biodiversity.
Objectives
5.     The specific subcomponents, for which the Department of Environmental Economics at Moscow
State University might be appropriate to act as the focal point, will consist of the following:
a)      Develop of a technical training programn in environmental and
biodiversity economics.
b)     Develop case studies and applied instances around the country, focusing
on protected areas and sites of important biodiversity, which will develop legal precedent;
and
c)     Disseminate case history of methodologies to administrators, NGOs,
protected area managers, and the public.

Tasks
A. Train-the-Trainer Economics Theory/Environmental Economics Training
6.     Currently academic economic staff possesses little, if any, formal neoclassical economics theory
education. Informal training in the form of self-education, scholar exchange programs, and occasional
seminars has provided the basis for academic staff. Their western counterparts typically have achieved a
Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D. in economics, with special emphasis on natural resources, environmental and
biodiversity economics. It is, therefore, recommended that a strong economic theory foundation be
established. This should include instruction in principles of micro and macro economics theory,
augmented by advanced micro and macro economics theory training. The most cost-effective approach to
fulfilling this task would be to invite a Ph.D. economist to provide in-house training. To maximize the
effective of this resource it would be preferable that this individual also specializes in
resource/environmental economics. This would leverage the use of this resource by allowing for the
continual association of resource/environmental issues during the theory training. Such an individual would
also be available to provide instruction for students as well as possibly engage in joint research efforts with
faculty. This training will occur within the first 6 months to 1 year from date of funding.
7.    The foregoing is to be augmented by enrollment in relevant workshops, such as offered by the EDI
of the World Bank, short-term environmental courses (see Directory of Short-Term Environmental
Courses, U.S. Environmental Training Institute), sabbaticals abroad, and scholar-exchange programs.
B. Environmental and Biodiversity Economics Training Workshop
8.    The objective of this task is to improve the quality and quantity of economic information on natural
resources use and biodiversity which flow to decision/policy makers. It is envisioned that there are three
distinct audiences to be targeted: Ministries, Federal, Regional and Local Agency decision makers who
may or may not possess the necessary economic insights with respect to natural resources and biodiversity
impacts associated with their decisions, economists whose responsibility is to provide the proper economic
perspective of proposed regulations and policy to decision makers, and graduating economic major
students embarking on careers in the government, research institutions, and NGOs. It is further envisioned
that this workshop will have transferability and be carried forward by other institutions and universities
throughout Russia.
9.    a) Decision/Policy Makers. Course content for decision makers should be designed to sensitize
decision/policy makers to the natural resources/biodiversity conservation ramifications associated with
decisions.  Recognition by decision makers that the potential exists for their decisions to impact these
resource areas will encourage them to request supporting economic analyses. Course content should include
a broad overview of the ramifications from both a macro and micro economic perspective. Macro-level
topics should include implications of fiscal and monetary policy. For example, implications of sectoral
policy, especially that which is focused on the natural resource use-intense sectors such as agriculture,
forestry, and energy; the relationship between property rights and resource utilization; and, the role of
taxes, credit, and interest rates on the rate of resource utilization; and trade policy defining tariffs, custom
duties, and quotas. Micro-level topics should include discussion of the role and effects of economic
instruments such as user fees, subsidies, emission charges, fines, marketing permits, etc. Such a course
should be designed for one or two days duration as it is unlikely to obtain a time commitment in excess of
this from decision/policy makers.

10.    b) Economists.  Although the course content for the economists of the various government
agencies, institutes, and NGOs will address the same range of topics provided for the decision makers
training course the depth of instruction will be much greater. In addition, there will be tow additional
segments to course: economic theory and valuation techniques. Since there is a high probability that the
participants in these workshops will have had little or no training in neoclassical economic theory the first
segment of this workshop will be structured to address this deficiency. The third segment of the course
will include exposure to the various valuation techniques that are available to economists to aid in the
valuation of non-market goods, e.g., contingent valuation methodology to estimate willingness to pay
(accept) to consume, avoid, or maintain a good, service or reduction in risk; travel-cost method; and cost-
of-illness approach. Also the concept of option values, existence values and opportunity cost will be
examined This list is not exhaustive--there are numerous texts available that should be consulted to insure
all the relevant methods and concepts are presented to the students.  The training of trainers workshop
Political economy of the Environment developed by the Economic Development Institute of the World
Bank provides a good template for the workshop. Given the existence of the affiliate of the Institute in
Moscow it is recommended that the MSU faculty seek cooperation of the Institute in the development of the
course. The length of this workshop should be a minimum of one week, preferably two weeks.
11.   c) Prospective Government. Institute, and NGO Economists. The course described in paragraph
10 will be provided to graduating economist embarking on a career in government, institutions or NGO
community. Recently the Economics Department of Moscow State University graduated its first class of
neoclassically trained economists. By incorporating the Workshop into the curriculum of future graduating
economists will eventually eliminate the training identified in paragraph 10.  Once this training is
institutionalized, a form of sustainability will be established that will foster a perspective that properly
incorporates the natural resources and biodiversity implications associated with policy making.
C. Develop Case Studies
12.   This subcomponent will develop additional case studies (these are in addition to those developed
for the Biodiversity Workshop) in selected protected areas (and also in unprotected areas of high
biodiversity value where resource use conflict exists) for which guidelines will be developed and applied
instances around the country, focusing on protected areas and sites of critical biodiversity importance
which may help establish legal precedent.
13.    The primary criteria for selection of case studies sites will be presence of priority issues, e.g.,
biodiversity preservation in a protected area. Sites chosen for case studies or applied research will,
wherever possible, overlap with areas selected for implementation of other projects of the GEF and EMP
project, to maximize the opportunity for demonstrating synergies between economic and other approaches
to biodiversity conservation. In addition, alternative valuation methodologies will be employed to
demonstrate those circumstances when most appropriate. If sufficient information avails itself more than
one valuation technique to allow for a comparison of results and thereby provide insight to potential over-
or underestimates of impacts.
14.   In addition to providing the case studies reports, a summary of valuation methods developed under
Task 2 will be included. This section, or chapter, of the report will identify which technique is most
appropriate for the research of interest, discuss data requirements, survey design, and recommended
statistical analysis to be performed.



62                                                                                      Annexes
15.    The services of a western trained economist with extensive applied research experience will be
secured to work closely with the MSU economics staff to aid in conducting the case studies (e.g., project
selection, project design, survey design, data collection and analysis, and writing of the case study), and
the development of the summary of valuation methodologies to be included with the case studies
publication. The presence of an experienced economist will not only provide a quality check on the
project, but provide additional training for the Russian counterparts.
D. Disseminate Case History and Valuation Methodologies
16.    This component will assemble the results of the applied research and case studies and disseminate
to administrations, NGOs, protected area managers and the public. The promulgation of this infomnation
will leverage the results of Task 3 by providing important models for similar studies to be undertaken
elsewhere, and to serve as examples for future training courses such as defined in Task 2..  Particular
attention will be given to the valuation methodologies employed, as this publication will provide guidance
to economists and decision/policy makers in agencies throughout the country. This will be viewed as a
living document and continually updated as additional case studies are completed or as new valuation
methodologies are introduced.

2. Evaluation of Economic Linkages Between Current Process of Economic Reforms
and Biodiversity
Background
I.    The Russian Federation is currently making the transition from a centralized state economy to a
more market oriented system. During this transition there exists the temptation to use its natural resources
such as forests, lands, oil, gas, minerals, water, and vegetation more intensively.
2.     The Russian government is sensitive of the potential for degradation of its resource base and
environment during this process and is therefore forging a biodiversity strategy at the federal level.
However, during this process there are also macro-economic decisions, both fiscal and monetary, property
rights reforms, and trade policy are being implemented at the national level. Many of these initiatives, and
remaining policies and institutions from the pre-revolution period, will have a significant impact on natural
resources and biodiversity. Therefore, it is imperative that knowledge is made available to decision/policy
makers of the possible ramifications of their decisions with respect to natural resources and biodiversity.
3.     The beneficiaries of this information include not only the Ministry for Protection of the
Environment and Natural Resources but also those agencies responsible for natural resource management,
legal, economic, and macro-economic policy.
Objectives
4.     Past and current macro policies have played an important role in depleting biodiversity resources in
the Russian Federation. These policies have been biased against the preservation of those resources, and
some of the new reforms may not be "biodiversity neutral." In order to provide guidance to the
development of the Federal Biodiversity Strategy as well as to macro-economic decisions an evaluation of
the linkages between the current process of economic reforms and biodiversity is required. Therefore, the
main objective of this component is to understand how the process of economic reforms is affecting, and
will affect, biodiversity related resources in the country.
Tasks
i.     Evaluation of Economic Linkages
5.     To satisfy the above objective the consultant(s) shall complete the following three tasks: i) identify
and ascertain the influence of the economy wide macro-economic policies; ii) identify the degree of
influence of sector specific economic instruments, with particular emphasis on the natural resource-based
sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, etc.; and iii) determine what economy wide macro-economic
policies and economic instruments of sector-oriented policy are antagonistic or complementary in nature.
6.     Macro-economic policy. The various relationships between economy wide policies and the
environment will be systematically reviewed to identify the potential impacts on the environment. A
preliminary analysis was conducted for the project preparation component employing an Action Impact
Matrix Approach (see "Analysis of Social and Economic Factors Influencing Biological Diversity"). It is
recommended that this effort be revisited updating, amplifying, and clarifying where appropriate. Also,
particular attention must be devoted to discussion of the analysis' findings and the current and future policy
implications to maximize the analysis' usefulness to policy/decision makers.



64                                                                                        Amexes
7.     Sectoral Policy. In addition to economy wide policy reforms being pursued by the Russian
Government there also exists broad sectoral activities such as agricultural intensification, industrial
protection, and energy use that hold the potential to impact the environment and biodiversity. An analysis
will be conducted to ascertain the impacts of these forms of sectoral policies; particular attention will be
given to the natural resource use-based sectors, e.g., agriculture, forestry, mining, fishing, etc. It is
recommended that the Policy Analysis Matrix approach be used to analyze the pattern of incentives at
micro-economic level and to provide quantitative estimates of the impact of policies on this pattern. Input
data should be obtained from the relevant ministries, but adjusted where necessary to reflect the full social
costs.
8.     It is recognized that economy wide macro-economic policy impacts sector resource use decisions.
Conversely, policies in an important sector of the economy can also influence the macroeconomic setting.
Therefore, the results of the two analyses will be integrated to ascertain the interplay between national and
sectoral policy. At a minimum it will be ascertained in policies are antagonistic or complementary. The
results of these findings will help shape a biodiversity strategy and provide valuable guidance to economy
wide macro-economic policy.
9      In order to minimize the costs of this analysis, secondary information will be drawn upon when
possible and augmented where necessary. The identification mission felt that there exists significant data
necessary to carry out such a study. Government agencies and institutes will be canvassed to obtain as
much of this information as possible.
Resource Requirements and Timetable
10.    This study will need the participation of local as well as international consultants. In addition,
there will be a need to set up an interdisciplinary team that will be able to address sectoral as well as
intersectoral issues in an inter-regional context. Attached to these consultants, a study leader will be
identified, who will be in charge of managing all the associated tasks of the study. In addition, two
researchers and a secretary will be needed. Within this context, it is expected that the study will be one
year. Funds will also be made available for the use of computer facilities and other needed tasks.

3. Analysis of Linkazes Between Economics and Environmental Protection
and Sources of Growth and Comparative Advantaee
Background
1.    The successful management of natural resources and biodiversity in the Lake Baikal region will, by
necessity, require interventions at the inter-regional level. These interventions will increase awareness
about the magnitude of existing natural resource linkages (e.g., between increased deforestation and
sedimentation of the lake); the necessary policy-making mechanisms to reach consensus, and the creation
(or intensification) of development distortions associated with ecological, institutional and economic
externalities. These externalities often translate into negative impacts on the environment including, for
example, air and water pollution which, by their very nature, do not respect geopolitical boundaries. These
external effects are exacerbated by the adoption of policies and instruments (e.g., taxes, leases, property
rights) that are inconsistent -- both across the oblasts and between the oblasts and the country level --
creating new threats to the natural resource base and the environment.
2.    It is central to any development assistance process to know the potential of different sectors or
activities in the economy. Several economic models and procedures have been developed to assess the real
comparative advantage that a region or a country has in terms of production and trade. By estimating such
advantages (or disadvantages), policy makers will be able to allocate scarce financial and human resources
into those activities for which the maximum comparative advantage is present. Within this context, it
would not be advisable to allocate resources into sectors that are not economically viable (in a broad
sense), because most resources will be wasted. Correspondingly, such an analysis would also reveal that
sector or sectors that provide the greatest potential for growth, again providing guidance or direction for the
allocation for scarce investment resources.
3.     To be perfonned correctly, a comparative advantage analysis must consider the real (social)
benefits of the goods and services to be generated and the real (social) costs of the resources employed to
generate those goods and services. For example, it would be inappropriate to estimate revenues based upon
government supported prices, rather than the prices that would be established by the supply and demand
forces of the market. Correspondingly, any externalities generated by an economic activity must be
accounted for, e.g., the social cost of generating electricity with low grade brown coal must include the cost
of treating emissions to an environmentally acceptable level.
4.     The foregoing requires knowledge of the linkages that exist between nationaVregional macro-
economic policies, micro-economic mechanisms and instruments and resource utilization. Macro policies
t:iat define property, taxes, trade policy, etc. will create a milieu in which the various economic decision
makers perform. For instance, the absence of properly defined property rights may produce a situation
whereby resources such as air or water may be viewed as a free good and easily exploited, high taxes may
promote accelerated resource consumption, or a protective trade policy that, say, limits imports may result
in products with inflated prices. Economic instruments often provide perverse incentives that result in
nonoptimal resource use. It is imperative that the role of these mechanisms, instruments and institutions
play is understood. Correspondingly, an understanding how economic incentives can be used to direct
behavior in a desired direction is equally valuable.

Objectives
5.     The main objectives of this component are: i) an analysis of the linkages between existing macro-
and micro-economic policy and instruments, and resource use and environmental protection;  ii) a
comprehensive inter-regional study on the sources of growth and comparative advantage in the Lake Baikal
region; and iii) to identify the most important instruments of intervention (e.g., economic incentives,
institutions) that would keep the level of biodiversity and natural resource use optimal over space and time.
6.     Subsidiary objectives will be: i) to see the extent to which regional disparities will determine new
pattems of development in response to the reform process; ii) to conduct a public expenditure and
investment review at the level of Irkutsk, Chita and Buryatia, and advise the governments of the main
results; and iii) to estimate the real values of the natural resources embodied in production and trade and
advise policy makers of the key issues and constraints the region is likely to face in the near future.
Tasks
i.     Analysis of Macro- and Micro-Economic Factors and Externalities
7.     The actual analysis of economy wide policies and the environment will not be performed in this
component. However, the analysis will be performed under a separate work assignment and thus will be
available to provide insight to those policies impacting the Lake Baikal region. It is imperative that this
information is taken into account when conducting the comparative advantage analysis and analyzing the
micro-economic instruments impacting resource decisions.
8.    It is recommended that the Policy Analysis Matrix approach be used to analyze the pattern of
incentives at the micro-economic level and to provide quantitative estimates of the impact of policies on this
pattern. Input data should be obtained from the relevant ministries, but adjusted where necessary to reflect
the full social costs.
9.     Also the micro- and macro-economic policy decisions of the individual regions comprising this
inter-regional-wide analysis will also be identified and assessed and incorporated within the PAM where
appropriate.
10.   In addition to ascertaining which instruments that are currently employed have the greatest
potential to direct resource use in the desired direction, a brief review of the literature will be conducted to
identify other economic incentives that may be useful in helping direct resource use toward optimal
utilization levels.
ii.    Inter-regional Comparative Advantage Analysis
11.    The contractor shall conduct an inter-regional comparative advantage analysis. There are several
traditional methods for assessing sources of growth and comparative advantage that are acceptable, e.g.,
partial equilibrium analysis (like the estimation of domestic resource cost coefficients), general equilibrium
models, and input-output and programming models. Regardless of the approach employed the input data
will be adjusted to correct for market distortions resulting from existing national and regional macro- and
micro-economic influences. Also, the externality costs will be accounted for where appropriate.



Amexes                                                                                       67
12.    The analytical capacity at the regional level seems to be satisfactory, however, there is a lack of
unifying knowledge on areas like "resource economics." This is a recent field of inquiry in Russia and
expertise is not currently present in most areas of the country. Therefore, it is important to note that
resource economists with expertise in comparative advantage analyses should be involved in this task. This
input will be particularly valuable in areas dealing with biological resources and biodiversity. In this
regard, the study will consider the hiring of international consultants that have the necessary expertise and
experience to carry this type of study. Several university and research centers in the United States devote
most of their resources to this type of study. It would be useful to consider the inclusion of Russian
resource economists in this task so that experience is gained in this methodology.
13.   In order to minimize the costs of this analysis, secondary information will be drawn upon when
possible and augmented where necessary. The identification mission felt that there exists significant data
necessary to carry out such a study. Government agencies and institutes will be canvassed to obtain as
much of this information as possible.
Resource Requirements and Timetable
14.    This study will need the participation of local as well as international consultants. In addition,
there will be a need to set up an interdisciplinary team that will be able to address sectoral as well as
intersectoral issues in an inter-regional context. Attached to these consultants, a study leader will be
identified, who will be in charge of managing all the associated tasks of the study. In addition, two research
assistants and a secretary will be needed. Funds will also be made available for the use of computer
facilities and other needed tasks. Within this context, it is expected that the study will be one year.

4. Evaluation of Economic LinkaRes Between Economic DeveloDment and Biodiversitv
Background
1.    During the process of economic reform in the Russian Federation there exists the potential for
degradation of its resource base and environment. There are macro-economic decisions, both fiscal and
monetary, property rights reforms, and trade policy being implemented at both the national and regional
level, as well as remaining policies and institutions from the pre-revolution period, that have a significant
impact on natural resources and biodiversity. The Russian government is sensitive to this and is forging a
biodiversity strategy at the federal level.
2.     Due to the size of Russia as well as the continued process of political and economic
decentralization it is of paramount importance that there is also regional adaption and implementation of
the Biodiversity Strategy. It is, therefore, imperative that knowledge of these influences be made available
with respect to natural resources and biodiversity to regional decision/policy makers responsible for the
development of regional biodiversity strategy and economic policy.
Objectives
3.     The ecological diversity characteristics of biodiversity in Russia requires the formulation and
implementation of "regional" approaches and strategies. Furthermore, a successful regional biodiversity
strategy requires not only that a region consider its own initiatives and policies, but also have an
understanding other regions and national economy wide micro- and macro-economic and sectoral policies.
The objective of this study are to develop knowledge and understanding of the economic linkages of
national, inter-regional, regional, sectoral, intersectoral, and cross-sectoral policies and institutions to
provide guidance for a regional biodiversity strategy. .
Tasks
4.     To properly account the economic aspects into a Regional Strategy the following tasks will be
performed: I) identify and ascertain the degree of influence of national economy wide macro- and national
microeconomic sectoral policies; ii) identify and ascertain the degree of influence of own regional micro-
and macro-economic policy; iii) identify and assess the influences of inter-regional activities; and iv)
assess the sectoral issues (with particular emphasis on the resource-based sectors including biodiversity as
a sector), inter-sectoral issues (including, forestry, agriculture and rural development, transport corridors
and infrastructure, industry, water supply and irrigation and, mining and energy, and cross-sectoral issues
(including watershed management, waste generation and disposal, poverty and biodiversity conservation,
technological change and biodiversity).
i.     Federal and Inter-regional Macro- and Micro-Economic Factors
5.     The actual analyses of economy wide policies and the environment will not be performed in this
component. However, this analysis will be performed under a separate work assignment and thus will be
available to provide insight for formation of regional policy and strategy. Inter-regional policy assessment
-till be peculiar to the region and will be performed as specified in Task 2 below.



Annexes                                                                                      69
ii.    Analysis of Macro- and Micro-Economic Factors and Externalities
6.    It is recommended that the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) approach be used to analyze the pattem
of incentives at the regional micro-economic level and to provide quantitative estimates of the impact of
policies on this pattern.
7.     To the extent that inter-regional and national micro- and macro-economic policy decisions impact a
region these effects will be incorporated within the PAM where appropriate.
8.    Input data should be obtained from the relevant ministries and institutions, and adjusted where
necessary to reflect full social costs.
Resource Requirements and Timetable
9.     The initial studies will need the participation of local as well as international consultants.
However, once sufficient expertise has been developed among Russian resource economists it should not be
necessary to employ international consultants.  In addition, there will be a need to set up an
interdisciplinary team that will be able to address sectoral as well as intersectoral issues in a regional and
interregnal context. Attached to these consultants, a study leader will be identified, who will be in charge
of managing all the associated tasks of the study. In addition, two research assistants and a secretary will
be needed. Funds will also be made available for the use of computer facilities and other needed tasks.
This will be an ongoing exercise required by each region prior to development of a biodiversity strategy. In
general, it is expected that each study will require about a one year.

ANNEX 3.4
GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING MANAGEMENT PLANS
FOR NATIONAL PARKS AND OTHER PROTECTED AREAS
Introduction
1     Management Plans are documents which guide the use and control of resources within protected
natural areas. It is important for each national park or other type of protected area to have some type of
management plan, to help ensure adequate and effective management of the area's natural resources, as well
as to minimize potential conflicts among different resource users. This annex outlines the types of
information which protected area management plans should generally contain and intended to facilitate the
preparation of management plans by protected areas agencies (particularly in developing countries). It also
seeks to facilitate the evaluation of draft management plans by the staff of agencies which provide financial
or technical assistance for protected area establishment and management (including the World Bank).
2      In general, all management plans should incorporate certain basic features. These include: A
description of baseline conditions; statement of the specific management objectives for the protected area;
definition of appropriate uses and zones within the protected area; and a detailed program of management
activities which is to be carried out over a specified time period. However, each management plan will vary
in format and specific content, according to the type of protected area and its special management
objectives and needs.
Description of Baseline Conditions
3      Each management plan should include a description of currently existing or "baseline conditions
within the protected area. An accurate description of baseline conditions is important because it provides a
series of reference points against which progress in achieving management objectives can be monitored and
evaluated.
4      As part of the description of baseline conditions, management plans should indicate major
information gaps which could impede effective protected area management (such as the habitat needs of
certain endangered species, or whether particular natural resource use levels are sustainable). After
identifying these gaps, the management plan should propose how and when they could be adequately filled,
through some type of research or monitoring.
Important natural features
5      A management plan should describe the important natural features of the protected area, including:
Climate; soils; water resources; geological formations; outstanding scenic areas; vegetation and ecosystem
types; and flora and fauna. With respect to the latter category, the management plan should provide lists of
the plant and animal species known or suspected to exist within the protected area. In particular, the plan
should indicate (as available data permit) which species are of special management concern because they
are endangered, threatened, or rare; ecological keystone species (upon which many other species depend);
pests or nuisances (including introduced species which may threaten the native biodiversity); foci of human
use (whether consumptive or non-consumptive); or otherwise merit special attention. A management plan
should also describe any significant cultural propertv found within the protected area, such as
archaeological ruins or sacred religious sites.



74                                                                                    Annexes
Human settlement and natural resource uses
6      A management plan should discuss the extent and history of any human settlement in or near the
protected area. The plan should specify: Whether or not the people living within the protected area are
permanent residents; whether they are recent colonists, long-established residents, or indigenous; the legal
and de facto status of their land tenure; and the types of subsistence or commercial activities which they
carry out.
7     In addition to human settlement (if any), a management plan should discuss the ongoing human
uses of the protected area, both within and outside its borders. Within the protected area, such uses might
include: Scientific research; environmental monitoring; tourism and recreational activities; environmental
education; subsistence, sport, or commercial hunting, fishing, or gathering; wood extraction (involving tree
cutting or merely the collection of fallen wood); livestock grazing; agriculture; or mining. The management
plan should comment on the degree of impact (including the areal extent, amount of damage, and degree of
reversibility) of these human uses on the protected area's natural resources, including its plant and animal
life, soils, and waters. Outside the protected area, human uses which either depend upon or affect resource
management within the protected area might include water use, fishing or other harvesting, agriculture, or
mining. The management plan should discuss which human uses are presently legal and illegal, which are
de facto controlled or regulated, and, most importantly, which are desirable or tolerable (and which are
not), in terms of the management objectives for the protected area.
Statement of management objectives
8     Each management plan should discuss the principal management objectives of the protected area,
i.e., the main purposes for which the protected area exists. Defining these management objectives properly
implies (among other things) identifying the important natural resource and environmental values which the
protected area seeks to conserve in perpetuity. In this context, the management plan should identify any
particularly sensitive natural or cultural features of the protected area which may require special
management.
9     A management plan should indicate the specific official categorv of protected area (such as
national park, biological reserve, wildlife refuge, ecological station, forest reserve, indigenous reserve, or
other). It is important to remember that the meanings implicit in protected area nomenclature vary from
one country to another. (For example, a "Forest Reserve" in one country may imply strict preservation,
while in another it implies regulated commercial logging.) For this reason, each management plan should
discuss the management implications of the chosen category of protected area. The management plan
should also indicate the legal framework under which the protected area was established, including the
relevant law(s) and implementing decree(s) (which should be included as an annex).
10    A management plan should indicate the size of the protected area, including the extent (in hectares
or other units) of different ecosystem types or vegetation zones, as well as different prescribed use zones
(discussed below). The official boundaries of the protected area should be described and indicated on a
sufficiently large-scale (detailed) map.
11    Another factor which needs to be considered in defining management objectives is the land tenure
situation of the protected area. A management plan should discuss (and show on a map, if needed) the
extent to which the land encompassing the protected area is owned by the government, private individuals,
or collective associations (tribal groups, elidos, etc.).



Aimexes                                                                                    75
Definition of Anuropriate Uses and Zones
12    The management plan should define, indicate on a map, and justify the selection of specific zones
where different types of human activities and infrastructure would or would not be permitted. Examples
include: A core, strictly protected zone surrounded by a buffer zone (where more intensive human uses are
permitted); zones where roads and trails may and may not be constructed; intensive recreational use zones
where campgrounds, shops, visitor centers, or other facilities are concentrated (to minimize impacts upon
the rest of the protected area); areas critical to the survival of particular rare species where human
visitation is highly controlled (particularly during the breeding season); and zones to which hunting, fishing,
wood gathering, or other consumptive activities may be restricted.
Proaram of Management Activities
13    A management plan should identify all the special management activities which are proposed for
achieving the plan's objectives. Aside from direct protection activities needed to ensure the integrity of the
protected area's boundaries, such management might include (for example): Captive propagation and
release into the wild of threatened animal or plant species; prescribed burning to maintain the desired
successional stages of native vegetation; environmental education, extension, or other assistance programs
for nearby local communities; and research and monitoring activities.
14    A management plan should list and justify those investments in infrastructure (such as physical
demarcation, control posts, visitor centers, staff housing, laboratories or other research facilities, roads,
p.arking areas, trails, observation platforms, boardwalks, and boat docks) which appear necessary for
achieving the management objectives for the protected area. The same applies to a wide variety of field and
office equipment, including 4-wheel drive vehicles, motorcycles, boats and outboard motors, horses, office
furniture, camping equipment, binoculars, radios, and tools. The management plan should also have a
chronoitam  (timetable) which indicates the phasing of each management activity (including any
construction work) over the next 5 or so years.
15    A management plan should specify and justify the number of protected area staff (including any
volunteers) needed for effective plan implementation, along with their functions, titles, occupational
specializations, and required abilities and expertise. The plan should also indicate where the staff would be
deployed within the protected area (or in buffer zones or administrative centers outside the protected area),
and where they would be expected to live.
16    A management plan should have a detailed budget, which should specify clearly those expenditures
which are one-time investments (civil works and equipment) and those which are recurrent cots (salaries,
fuel, supplies, and spare parts). The management plan should also identify the expected sources of
financing to cover all of the planned investments and recurrent costs. These funding sources can include
(among others): Annual (national and sub-national) government appropriations; special earmarked
government funds, such as hotel tax, electric power, fishing license, or other special revenues; visitor user
fees; proceeds from controlled resource extraction and NGO in-kind contributions. To the extent possible,
the management plan should discuss the apparent reliability of these financing sources: For example, how
likely are annual government contributions to continue at the current level of support?
17    A management plan also needs to specify the institutional framework for managing the protected
area. If more than one agency is responsible for different aspects of management, the management plan
should indicate the precise institutional responsibilities of each agency. The plan should also state whether



76                                                                                  Amexes
any specific legal inter-agency agreements (such as convenios) are needed. If NGOs are assigned
particular management functions, these should also be defined (as precisely as possible) within the
management plan.
18    If significant resource use conflicts exist between local people and the conservation objectives of
the protected area, the management plan should propose actions which would reduce or eliminate such
conflicts. Such actions could include (for example): Agreements with the local people to confine their
activities to specified intensive-use zones of the protected area; regulations to prohibit those activities which
would seriously damage the sensitive natural resources of the protected area; provision of alternative
income opportunities (including direct employment related to protected area management); or re-drawing
the boundaries of the protected area to exclude the settled or intensively-used portions. Involuntary
resettlement of people from financial and social costs are involved. (In the case of World Bank-assisted
protected areas, any such resettlement would need to comply with the Bank's rigorous Involuntary
Resettlement Policy.)
19    If there are conflicting or unresolved land claims, the management plan should recommend steps
for eventually resolving them. If private inholdings exist within otherwise public (government-owned) land,
the management plan should discuss whether land purchase by the government is needed, or whether
alternative mechanisms (such as regulations and agreements with landowners) can be used to ensure
compatible resource uses on the private lands.
T'he Management Planning Process
20    Management plans should be the result of an interactive and Participatorv ,  of planning
resource uses within each protected area (and outside of it, where the uses would affect the protected area).
The management planning process should include the participation of scientific specialists, interested user
groups, and representatives of local communities, as well as government officials. Management plans
should be living documents, subject to periodic revision as management needs change, or as more is learned
about management needs and constraints. Some parts of a management plan can be completed in a few
days, while others may take months (or even years) to define. While a long-terTn management plan is being
developed, and "interim management plan" or "operational plan" can be used.



ANNEX 3.5
LAKE BAIKAL REGIONAL COMPONENT
A) INTER-REGIONAL COMPONENT                                                 (USS 950,000)
I     This component includes measures which address the fundamental obstacles to the adoption and
implementation of an inter-regional biodiversity conservation and natural resource management strategy for
the Baikal region. The initiatives to be undertaken include:
(i) Data and Information Flow (USS 300,000)
2     This will entail undertaking the following initiatives in order to improve the quality and
accessibility of data necessary to develop sound environmental policies:
-     Establishment of a meta-database. (US$ 60,000)
-     Establishment of a database management system. (US$120,000)
-     Data Analysis and its use in biodiversity conservation. (US$80,000)
-     Development of a protocol of access to data among the regions. (US$ 10,000)
-     Improvement of communication and data exchange. (US$30,000)
(ii) Policy Evaluation (USS 150,000)
3     Policy makers in the region are confronted with major trade-offs between economic development,
environmental protection, and social welfare. Integrated and sustainable natural resource management
requires a comprehensive evaluation of the policy formulation process, and of the consequences of policy
implementation on biodiversity and the natural environment. Preliminary work on this was already
performed during the PPA phase, but this will be extended to:
-      ldevelop public participation, implementation and compliance mechanisms;
-     recommend procedures to incorporate environmental externalities into the decision making
process;
-     develop a training component in environmentally sustainable resource management.
4     This initiative will require international expertise in environmental policy development and
analysis, but will rely largely on local expertise. The study will be conducted during the first two years of
the project.
(iii) Strengthening of Legal/Regulatory Base (USS 200,000)
5     The inconsistency of the legal and regulatory base is compounded by poor enforcemnent and
inappropriate fines. Given the lack of transparency in resource use allocation mechanisms and a poorly
developed incentive structure biodiversity conservation is badly served by current resource use practices.
To address this issue, this sub-component will:
-     analyze documentation prepared during the PPA phase, as well as additional materials, and
will recommend improvements to the normative system, including the regulatory and compliance
regime at the inter-regional and regional levels, and institutional strengthening.



78                                                                                      Anxexes
-      define the measures necessary to harmonize environmental standards, and their
application, for resource usage and pollution levels. This would include concrete proposals on the
improvement of information gathering, analysis and use, improvement of the regulatory and
enforcement regimes on both inter-regional and regional levels, and strengthen institutional
capacity of the relevant agencies (through training, education and reorganization)
6      The study will take 175 staff weeks and will primarily be undertaken by local specialists but an
intemational consultant will be required in the initial stages. This initiative will be undertaken during the
first three years of the project.
(iv) Economic Perspectives on Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource
Management (US$150,000)
7      This sub-component will carry out a comprehensive study of the potential sources of growth and
comparative advantage in the Baikal region. It will include:
-      Assessment of the effects of regional disparities on potential development pattems;
*     Review of public expenditure and investment;
*     identify the most important economic instruments of intervention capable of
ensuring optimum resource use; and,
*     estimate the real values, and therefore impacts, of the natural resources used in
production and trade
8      The study will take 40 staff weeks, including domestic and intemational consultants. 25 staff
weeks of researchers, secretaries, translators and editors will be needed. Funds will be available for
computer facilities and workshops, information dissemination and publication. The first draft should be
completed within the first year, at which time the study arrangement will be reviewed.
(v) Regional Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (US$150,000).
9      The above initiatives, and those from the PPA, will provide a foundation for a biodiversity
conservation strategy and action plan for the Baikal region. The Baikal strategy will be developed along
the same lines, and in close cooperation with, the federal Biodiversity Strategy. The Biodiversity
Conservation Action Plan (BCAP) will define specific tasks, timelines, costs and responsibilities, as well as
monitoring and evaluation procedures.
10     The strategy and action plan will be developed and implementation will begin during the project.
Foreign consultancy will be required, but the strategy will be developed by local experts. The
administrations of the three regions, various institutes, protected area representatives, community leaders,
and NGOs will also be actively involved in its development and implementation.
(B)    REGIONAL ACTIVITIES (US$2,890,000)
11    Three model demonstration projects, one each in Irkutsk Oblast, the Republic of Buryatia and
Chita Oblast, will be implemented to demonstrate a range of adjustments in land and natural resource
govemance and practices for effectively dealing with a complex and diverse set of environmental and
socio-economic problems. This will be done on the basis of watersheds, each one characterized by its own
environmental, land and resource use, economic, social, and institutional characteristics and issues. This



Amtexes                                                                                        79
will demonstrate a range of potential mechanisms for addressing a variety of issues, and thus will ensure
the wider applicability of the results.
(i)    Goloustnaya River Watershed - Irkutsk Oblast (USS890,000)
(a)    Sustainable Forest Management (US$390,000). Forestry operations in
the watershed have resulted in the fragmentation of habitats and environmental
degradation. Forestry, however, remains an industry upon which the mnajority of local
residents depend. A continuing economic downturn in the industry will force an
increasingly larger number of people to exploit the forest's natural resources further. The
following measures which will developed under a forest management plan will reverse
environmentally destructive practices, and   re-orient the forest management to a
sustainable, ecosystem based regime.
-      Forest Restoration  (US$150,000). Past clear-cutting patterns have
resulted in large areas of deforested land which cannot be reforested by natural
regeneration. The forest management plan will include; an evaluation of harvesting and
regeneration techniques and the construction of a nursery for seedling propagation. This
initiative will be performed in the first three years of the project. It will require foreign
consultancy, local technical staff and support, equipment, and supplies.
-      Fire Management (US$100,000). A  fire management plan will be
developed which will consider the area's fire regime, the current extent of the problem
(spatial, ecological, economic), the causes of fires, the role of fire in the ecosystem, the
effects of fire suppression. It will define options for fire management. The options will be
costed as well as the potential to attract external financing for the implementation of the
plan. Foreign consultancy with the assistance of local consultants, the Forestry Committee,
the Forestry Enterprise, and the local administration and population of the watershed. This
initiative will be performed in the first two years of the project.
-      Environment-Economy Linkages (US$100,000). This initiative will
support the definition and evaluation of options to create an economically viable yet
environmentally sustainable forest industry. The economic and socio-economic dynanics
of the forestry industry will need be assessed, as will the possibilities for diversifying the
watershed's economic base. The study will concentrate on the linkages between economic
activities and social and environmental conditions. This initiative will be implemented over
the first two years of the project. It will require a foreign resource economist. The Forestry
Enterprise, Oblast, regional and local administrations, and the local population will be
directly involved in proposing and evaluating alternative development proposals.
-      Training for Forestry Managers  (US$40,000). The re-orientation of
forest management will be rely on appropriate training in forest management. Joint training
for selected foresters from the three regions will be organized. This initiative will develop a
training program which will address key elements of biodiversity conservation theory; fire
management and the role of fire in ecosystems; technical aspects of harvest management;
ecosystem based management of the forest; and, non-timber and other values of forests.
This initiative will be undertaken in the first two years of the project. It will require foreign



80                                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A,mexa
and local consultants, and provide for the development and production of educational
materials.
(b)    Environmental Monitoring  (US$125,000). This will develop and
implement a cost-effective, manageable, and goal oriented monitoring program for the
watershed which will be strongly related to management capability. The initiative will
support: the definition, current use, drawbacks and parameters of available monitoring
projects and techniques in the watershed; the establishment of baseline conditions among
these parameters; and, the definition of essential material requirements for implementing a
biodiversity conservation monitoring and training program. This initiative will be
undertaken over the duration of the project. It will require foreign consultants, local
expertise familiar with the watershed (Institute of Geography in Irkutsk), local residents
and NGOs. Material requirements will be defined after the first year of the initiative and
those that are essential to the implementation of an effective monitoring program will be
supported.
(c)    Watershed Management Capability (US$85, 000). The resolution of land
and resource use conflicts, and the mitigation of stresses on the watershed's environment
and biodiversity requires a comprehensive land use plan. Such a plan is currently being
prepared under the Russian-German (GTZ) landscape planning project. This initiative will
support: an assessment of existing natural resource management responsibility and
capability; the definition of key obstacles and solutions to integrated management. Options
will include potential changes in land ownership, organizational and decision-making
procedures. It will be undertaken in the first 18 months of the project. It will require a
foreign and domestic consultant, and the assistance and participation of the Oblast,
regional and district and local administrations, the Oblast Forestry Department, the
Forestry Enterprise in the watershed, and the principals of the Russian-German landscape
planning project.
(d)    Recreation Management Plan (US$75,000). The watershed is subjected
to increasing levels of unorganized recreational use with visitor numbers exceeding 30,000
per year. This, unless regulated will have significant environmental impacts upon
ecologically vulnerable areas. The initiative will support the development and partial
implementation of a recreation management plan focusing on areas of recreational
potential where conflicts with biodiversity conservation already exist. It will be based on
the study carried out under the Japanese Personnel and Human Resources Development
Grant (PHRD) which occurred at the same time as the PPA. The PHRD grant developed
an ecotourism management plan for Lake Baikal based upon its ecological carrying
capacity. This initiative will be integrated with others in the Bolshoye Goloustnoye area
that are being pursued under funding from USAID, such as the creation of a landscape
park and trail construction, as well as the landscape planning work being conducted under
the Russian-German (GTZ) project. This initiative will be undertaken in the first two
years of the project. It will require a foreign consultancy, and will draw upon expertise and
information available in Irkutsk (Institute of Geography, Pribaikalskiy National Park,
Institute of Biology).
(e)    Environmental  Education  Program   and  Information   Center
(USS100, 000). The success of any local program ultimately depends upon the involvement



Aexes                                                                                        Jl
of people directly affected by it. This initiative will raise the awareness and interest of the
watershed's population in their environment, their roles and potential contributions to
improving environmental conditions and project implementation, and will provide
opportunities for direct public input. It will support: the development and implementation
of an environmental education program; the development of environmental curricula for
primary and secondary schools, as well as the general population; and the establishment of
a public environmental education center. It will assess: the information requirements;
identify existing information; potential information delivery mechanisms; and, the
possibility of utilizing already existing environmental information centers such as the
Baikal Center for Citizen Initiatives, which has an office in Irkutsk. This initiative will be
realized over the duration of the project. It will require a local specialist in environmental
education and communication, and the active involvement of local community leaders.
69     Grazing and Biodiversity Conservation (US$65, 000).
-      Establishment of Botanical Reserve for Endangered Species (US$15,000)
The laciniate violet (Viola ircutiana Turcz.) is an East Siberian endemic listed in the Red
Book of the RSFSR. In 1994, a rare dense population of the plant was discovered in a
degraded state in an area of intense unregulated recreation. The creation of a 1.5 ha
botanical reserve in this area will enhance the protection of this extremely rare species.
This initiative will develop an effective management plan for the reserve. This initiative
will be undertaken in the first 18 months of the project. It will require local expertise in the
plant's ecology and habitat rehabilitation, and will involve Pribaikalskiy National Park, the
Institute of Geography in Irkutsk, and Irkutskenergo Company, which has an interest in the
land of concern.
-      Establishment of Grazing Regime (US$50,000). Unregulated grazing
around the villages of Maloye Goloustnoye and Bolshoye Goloustnoye has led to the
degradation of soil and vegetation cover over approximately 3,000 ha. This initiative will
develop a grazing regime in the two areas. Attention will be given to: evaluation of the
environmental condition and potential carrying capacity of the rangeland, the selection of
environmentally appropriate sites for pasture; rotation of grazing; alternatives to range
feeding and their economic implications; economic incentives and other instruments to
promote the adherence to the grazing regime; and, the development of a rangeland
monitoring program. On the basis of the results of the study, this initiative may provide
limited funding to help establish pastures. This initiative will be undertaken in the first
three years of the project. It will be led by a foreign consultant and will involve local
expertise from the Agricultural Institute, and residents of the two affected villages.
(g)    Management Organization (USS50,000). An organizational structure for
implementing the project above was developed during the PPA. A detailed feasibility study
is now required. Once structural and procedural characteristics have been determined, this
initiative will support incremental costs for the duration of the project. The initial appraisal
will be conducted after six months by domestic specialists and will involve the Oblast,
local administration, the land users and residents of the watershed. Detailed incremental
costs will be determined during the first stage of this initiative but will include travel,
communication, publication expenses, and any necessary hardware and software.

(ii)    Tugnuy-Sukhara Rivers Watershed - Republic of Buryatia (US$1,135,000)
(a)    Land Use Plan (US$200,000). A comprehensive land use plan will be
developed for the watershed. The land use plan will include: the definition and mapping
(GIS) of land cover, physical characteristics of the watershed, species distribution, land
and resource uses, areas of environmental sensitivity and their significance to development,
functional or process information such as erosion, deposition, species migration routes and
others. The draft document will include recommended zoning and its implications. The
plan will specify clear goals, measurable objectives, and an implementation mechanism.
Close contact will maintained with the residents and resource users, as well as the
government, academic community, and non-governmental organizations. The plan will be
developed over the first three years of the project and will require the input of numerous
domestic specialists and an international consultant.
(b)    Monitoring Program  (US$100,000). As for the Goloustnaya River
watershed, there is a need to develop and implement a goal-oriented, manageable, and
cost-effective monitoring program for biodiversity conservation. The design of the
monitoring program will follow the outline presented in the Goloustnaya River watershed.
(c)    Agriculture (US$165,000).
-      Alternative Crops and Breeds (US$75,000). Considerable environmental
degradation has occurred due to the planting of crops and husbandry of cattle maladapted
to the environmental limitations of the watershed. This initiative will support: an analysis
of the problem due to the introduction of non-native livestock and forage; and, the
development of specific recommendations for changing the forage base and types of
livestock so that less environmental damage occurs. It will entail a cost/benefit analysis
and will consider the implications of a change to a more traditional form of animal
husbandry. The initiative will require local expertise and an international resource
economist specializing in range management. This initiative will be undertaken over the
first two years.
-      Soil Erosion (US$90,000) Nearly 50%  of agricultural land exhibit
varying degrees of erosion due to inappropriate management and cattle breeding practices.
This initiative will develop applied measures to arrest soil erosion. The initial phase will
analyze the issue, after which different sites will be selected to demonstrate varying
options. The Lenin collective farm in the watershed already has some experience in
utilizing anti-erosion measures, and could serve as an model project. The initiative will
disseminate the results to the agricultural community by means of an extension service.
Local expertise will be utilized in the realization of this project. The project will be
undertaken over the first two years of the program.
(d)    Sustainable Forest Management (US$340,000). Many of the problems
associated with past and current forestry policies and practices discussed in reference to
the Goloustnaya River watershed are evident in this watershed as well. As in the case of
the Goloustnaya River watershed, the main purpose of the forestry related initiatives will
be to re-orient forest management from the exploitation of timber resources to a more
comprehensive, ecosystem based forest management regime by the development of an



A~xes                                                                                     83
environmentally sustainable forest management plan. Cost savings will be realized by
coordinating the implementation of identical initiatives such as training of forest managers,
and the demonstration of forest restoration techniques for all three watersheds.
-      Forest Restoration (US$100,000). The requirements under this initiative
are similar to those described under the Goloustnaya River watershed component.
-      Fire Management (US$100,000). A fire management plan will be
prepared for the watershed, following the outline presented under the Goloustnaya River
watershed fire management component.
-      Environment-Economy Linkages (US$100,000). This will define and
evaluate, as in the Goloustnaya River watershed, the options by which economic gains can
be realized by environmentally sustainable forest management.
-      Training of Forestry Managers (US$40, 000). A training program will be
provided for forestry managers in the watershed covering the topics described under the
Goloustnaya River watershed component on forestry management training.
(e)    Managingfor Biodiversity Conservation and Use in a Protected Area (US$190,000).
-      Management Plans for Zakazniks (US$75,000) There are two large
Zakazniks in the watershed of high biodiversity values due to their vegetation types
(Transbaikalian steppes and forest steppes). However, considerable resource use conflicts,
including grazing, ploughing, poaching, fires, and forest harvesting, increasingly threaten
the reserves' biodiversity values. This initiative will prepare management plans for the two
Zakazniks. This will be innovative in that although there are hundreds of Zakazniks in
Russia, apparently no management plans have been implemented which have done other
than set production levels and some protection regime for the specific resource for which
the Zakaznik was originally established. The experience gained from a more
comprehensive management plan will be transferable to other vulnerable Zakazniks.
Consideration will be given, among others things, to the status and distribution of
resources and uses, their trends, resource use conflicts and their effects on biodiversity and
zoning. The plans will specify the management goals and measurable objectives for reserve
management, the resourcing requirements for implementation, as well as responsibilities,
and will prescribe a monitoring program which will be focused on assessing the status of
biodiversity in the reserves. The preparation of the management plans will be undertaken
by local experts and representatives of the administration, and will necessarily closely
involve the resource users themselves. A short-term foreign consultancy may also be
required. This initiative will be implemented over the first two years of the project.
-      Legislative Protection for Zakazniks (US$45,000) Concurrent with the
preparation of management plans for the Zakazniks, this initiative will support the
strengthening of legal protection for the Zakazniks. It will suggest regulations, and
implementation procedures, to effectively determine appropriate resource and land use with
reference to maintaining biodiversity values. The legislation will be regional, and will
regulate resource use in the Zakazniks in accordance with the management plans. Clearly,
the support of authorities at the regional and local levels will be required. This initiative



Axnexes
will be implemented over the first two years of the study, and will require domestic legal
expertise.
-      Environmentally Appropriate Methods of Land and Resource Use
(US$70,000). The severity of resource conflicts in the Zakazniks, as well as their site
specificity require model projects on environmentally sustainable land use to be developed.
Sites will be selected in which existing land, water and forest uses can be improved
through the demonstration of altemative techniques. An educational program for resource
users in the Zakazniks will be developed and implemented. The projects will review
restoration processes and define rational regimes for steppes and forested steppes resource
use. It will be implemented over the first three years of the project, and will develop and
publish information materials. Local expertise will implement this initiative.
Wo    Development and  Implementation  of Environmental  Education
Programs and an Extension Consulting Service (US$90,000). The initiative presented
under Environmental Education Progran and Information Center for the Goloustnaya
River watershed will replicated in this watershed. Although the specific information
requirements of the local populations will differ slightly, a coordinated approach will result
in considerable savings across the three watersheds.
(g)    Watershed Management (US$50, 000). An organizational structure for the
management of this project was developed the PPA. It involves the establishment of a
Committee for Natural Resources Management, a horizontal management structure
including all responsible agencies in the watershed. It represents a marked departure from
the traditional resource management framework and will make decision-making more
integrated. The incremental costs of this new structure, established as a model specifically
for this project, will be supported, including travel, communication, publication expenses,
and essential hardware and software.
.'iii) Khilok River Watershed - Chita Oblast (USS865,000)
(a)    Land Use Plan (US$225,000). The development and implementation of a
comprehensive land use plan for the Khilok River watershed will resolve many aspects of
the watershed's environment degradation, and associated losses of biodiversity. The plan
will essentially replicate the Tugnuy-Sukhara Rivers watershed project. The plan will
evaluate the environmental carrying capacity and develop an ecologically based zone plan
of the watershed. The plan will require the conversion of essential information into an
electronic format. Since a GIS platform already exists, training of selected individuals is
essential at the outset of the project. As before, the planning process will be participatory.
International expertise will be required, although the majority of the participants in the
preparation of the plan will be domestic specialists. The plan, will include an
implementation mechanism, will be prepared during the first three years of the project.
(b)    Monitoring Program  (US$150,000). A monitoring program  will be
developed and implemented in the watershed. The design of the program and the steps in
its development and implementation as for the other watersheds.



(c)    Sustainable Forest Management (US$370,000). The Khilok River
watershed exhibits some of the same forestry and forest management problems of the other
two watersheds. The project will support the development of a forest management plan
with similar initiatives to re-orient the management of the forests towards environmentally
sustainable management, including:
Forest Restoration (US$150,000)
Fire Management (USS 100,000)
Environment-Economy Linkages (USSIOO,000)
Training for Forestry Managers (USS40,000)
(d)    Environmental Education and Extension Consulting Service (US$70,000)
(e)   Institutional Strengthening for Watershed Planning and Management
(USS50, 000). A new organizational structure has been proposed for the implementation of
the project during the PPA phase - the Department of the River Khilok. This body would
coordinate the implementation of various elements of the project, and would provide for
integration in decision-making through a horizontal structure. The value of such a
structure is clearly evident. The incremental costs associated with the establishment and
operation of this Department will be supported for the duration of the project. These
include costs such as those associated with transportation, communications, publication,
and information dissemination specific to this project.
(C)    LOCAL BIODIVERSrrY INIATIvEs (USS2,500,000)
12    The main objective of this sub-component is to provide financial support, on a grant basis, to
competitively selected small-scale projects, programns, and other initiatives which will directly help promote
biodiversity conservation and improvements in natural resource management in the Lake Baikal region. It
is intended to encourage the active participation of local communities, native peoples, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), academic institutions, and individuals in biodiversity conservation and natural
resource management.
13    Variable size grants ($1,000 - $50,000) will be provided to researchers conducting applied work in
biodiversity conservation, environmental NGOs, commnunity organizations, small businesses, and
individuals. Potential initiatives would include: applied biodiversity conservation research, community level
environmental monitoring and pollution control initiatives or cooperatives for organic food production;
re-introduction of traditional resource use practices and techniques which aid biodiversity conservation by
helping to restore the land conditions; publication of environmental literature and introduction of
environmental education programs in schools; and, biologically sustainable economic ventures of a small
scale such as the commercial production of medicinal plants. Native peoples, villagers, and women will be
particularly encouraged to participate in this program.
14    A single financing mechanism will be established in the Baikal region to facilitate the funding of
the above initiatives. The mechanism will be administered in the region by a Supervisory Committee
composed of equal representation from the governmental and NGO/scientific communities. Representation
from the three regions will also be equal. The use of the funds will be transparent through the use of a
thorough reporting and auditing process.

ANNEX 3.6
LAKE BAIKAL COMPONENT
IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVES SUB-COMPONENT
1     Projects will be pre-selected by the project teams established in each of the regional centers
(Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude and Chita) and reviewed and endorsed by the Lake Baikal Supervisory Committee
which will consist of a total of six administrative representatives of the Government of Buryatia and
Administrations of Irkutsk and Chita Oblast (including three regional subcomponent directors), six
non-government representatives (from the local, academic, scientific, social, or NGO communities), and
one national representative from the Governmental Commission for Lake Baikal, all with strong experience
in the Baikal region and in biodiversity conservation. The managers of regional subcomponents from the
Buryat Republic, Irkutsk Oblast, and Chita Oblast will be non-voting members of the Committee.
2     Each regional team will be headed by a Manager, assisted by one to three technical and operational
assistants. Each team will receive advice and non-binding recommendations from a local advisory council
(LAC), appointed by the relevant oblast/republic administration and composed of representatives of the
local academic and scientific community, NGOs, social organizations, civic leaders, natural resource/land
users, and other non-governmental representatives with an interest and experience in the field of
biodiversity conservation and natural resource management. Members of the LACs will serve on a
voluntary, pro-bono basis. Each LAC will, in consultation with the each regional center team, determine
the LAC's intemal rules of procedure.
3     The Lake Baikal Supervisory Committee will adopt a standard application formn which will be
made available through the regional center teams to all interested parties free of charge. Interested
applicants will submit completed application forms to the regional teams. Applications will be required to
be submitted by a specific date to be considered in that year's grant program. (For the first year, no more
than 20 percent of the funds available under this component would be commnitted.)
4     Each application will, among other things, describe: (a) the proposed project and goals for which
grant funding is being sought; (b) the specific work to be carried out and its organizational arrangements;
(c) the specific products to be produced; (d) the timetable of the proposed project and all products; (e) the
breakdown of the financial requirements; (f) a cost/benefit analysis; and (g) the applicants' experience and
qualifications.
5     Within 30 days of receiving a grant application, the regional center team will decide whether to
pre-approve, reject or return such an application in order to obtain further information. All such decisions
will be communicated to the applicants in writing and will describe, in the case of the application's rejection
or request for additional information, the reasons for such a decision.
6     If the application is pre-approved by the regional team, it will be forwarded by the regional center
tearn, together with any supporting information or materials deemed relevant by the regional team, to the
Supervisory Committee for formal review and approval. The Supervisory Committee's decision (approval,
rejection, or request for additional information) will be made in writing within 45 days of receiving the
pre-approved application.
7     Upon the approval of the Supervisory Committee, the regional center team will, within 15 days,
invite the applicant to execute a grant agreement on behalf of the Supervisory Committee. A typical grant
agreement will contain, among other things, terms and conditions related to: (a) the usage of the funds; (b)
the maintenance of records and accounts and, if applicable, auditing requirements; (c) the procurement of



88                                                                                          Annexes
goods, services, and works; (d) inspection by the Supervisory Committee and/or the regional team; (e)
counterpart contributions, if applicable; (f) penalties for breaches of agreement covenants; (g) reporting
procedures; (h) taxation procedures for the grant funds; (i) tranche or other methods of disbursement; and
(j) dispute resolution. Funding under this component will be available to local groups, organizations,
NGOs, academic institutions and other local entities, and individuals residing or working in the Lake Baikal
region, specifically the Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts and the Buryat Republic of the Russian Federation. The
component will encourage the participation of the native populations, representatives of remote settlements,
and women. International firms, individuals and institutions will also be eligible to participate providing it
is on a partnership basis with a Russian counterpart.
8      The component will finance projects with the greatest potential to promote biodiversity
conservation and improvements in natural resource management in the Lake Baikal region, in relation to
project cost. Other considerations that will be taken into account in project selection will include social and
educational potential, replicability and thus transferability, innovation, professional development and
training, use of local knowledge and capability, post project assimilation/sustainability, and linkage to other
elements of the Project. Grants under this component will range from $1,000 to $50,000. The component
will not fund: (a) projects involving direct obligations of the federal, oblast, republic, or local governments,
(b) pure research or administration projects, with limited tangible benefits for biodiversity conservation and
environmental protection; (c) projects directly involving members of the Supervisory Committee or their
affiliates, unless the member so involved abstain from voting or any other decisions related to the project in
question.
9      The component will provide short, medium, and long term financing to qualified projects. All
grant recipients will be required to provide the Supervisory Committee (with copies to the CPPI) with
semi-annual, mid-term and project completion reports, describing project progress, problems, and future
activities. At the completion of each project, or annually, if the project requires more than 18 months to be
implemented, grant recipients will submit to the Supervisory Committee (with copies to the CPPI) financial
statements describing the expenditures under the grant for the period in question. For grants above
$10,000, recipients will submit audited reports issued by an independent auditing organization, concerning
the financial aspects of the project.
10            The component will finance goods (including equipment, office materials) and incremental
operating costs (including office rent, incremental salaries, communications expenses, travel expenses)
related to the administration and implementation of this component, and the cost of qualified sub-projects.
The latter will cover the cost of goods, services, operating costs, and works specified in the grant agreement
between the grant beneficiary and the Supervisory Committee.
11            Funds under approved projects will be made available to the recipients based on
expenditures incurred (supported by adequate documentation), or likely to be incurred in the near future. In
the latter case, the grant agreement will specify the terms and conditions of tranche financing. Examples of
possible projects include, but are not limited to, projects in the areas of applied research, environmental
monitoring, ecotourism, nursery development, traditional natural resource use practices, publication of
environmental literature and development of local school programs, and improvement of land and natural
resource management.

ANNEX 4.2
PROCUREMENT PLAN
I. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENTS
A.    General
1.    Procurement Administration. The procurement plan and schedule for the project are summaized
in Schedule B. The Project Implementation Group (PIG) at the CPPI will be responsible for all equipment
procurement and for the administrative aspects of the employment of consultants in accordance with the
Grant Agreement. In meeting this responsibility, the CPPI will be assisted by a General Consultant (GC)
and one of the GC's first tasks will be assist in complying with the established procurement procedures
currently in use by CPPI in the EMP, and training additional PIG staff in detailed procurement planning
and scheduling, preparation of documents, inviting bids and quotations, setting up procedures for receipt,
public opening and recording of bids, evaluation, awarding of contracts, and complying with the Bank's
review and "no objections" requirements. The GC will also assist in setting up the PIG office and computer
equipment.
2.    Procurement Planning. Typical procurement schedules covering ICB equipment and consultant
selection will be given in the Project Implementation Manual. These schedules are consistent with those
being used on other Bank projects in the Russian Federation.  Specific equipment and consultant
procurement schedules will also be given in the Project Implementation Manual. Over time, the PIG will
refine these schedules based on actual experience.
B.    Equipment
3.    Equipment procurement will be timed to meet the needs of the particular component. Thus, while
it might seem attractive to procure all computers in one package, because of storage difficulties and
possible security risks, some computers will be procured later in the implementation phase.   The
alternative of phased delivery by the supplier might not allow users to take advantage of technology
upgrading.
4.    Documents. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (dated January 1995) in English will be
used for the procurement of equipment. Working translations of these into Russian are available for
facilitating use of the Standard Documents and will be held on computer by the PIG.
5.    Methods of Procurement. Packages of equipment above US$300,000 will be procured through
ICB. Russian manufacturers competing under ICB would receive a preference in bid evaluation as detailed
in paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Bank Guidelines and Appendix 2 thereof. For equipment and goods
below an estimated contract value of US$300,000, procurement will be through International Shopping.
National Shopping will be used for items and packages below US$50,000 including regular office and
technical supplies.
6.    The lists and specifications of regular equipment to be procured for the project (excluding the
Baikal Local Biodiversity Activities sub-component) will be prepared by the PIG. However, because of
their specialist nature, specifications for technical equipment (e.g. GIS and monitoring equipment) will be



98                                                                                    Annexes
prepared by the technical consultants for the subcomponents. The timing of specification preparation is
given in the relevant equipment procurement schedules.
7.     The project will require three different levels of computer. First, "scientific" level computers will be
required for the BIOTA Information Network sub-component. These will require high level, open operating
systems of the UNIX type, or equivalent. They will also be using software for which annual license fees
are required.  Second, most sub-component implementation teams also require computers with fast
operating systems (586, Pentium or equivalent), 8MB RAM and memory well in excess of 200MB. These
have been termed "higher level" computers. Third, offices will require both stand alone and linked
"workstations".
8.     Depending on the size of the packages, most computer procurement will be through ICB and will
require specifications which allow reputable suppliers to bid. However, there are specific requirements for
the project computers. All the workstation computers must be capable of running the same applications,
interchanging data in a compatible fonnat and, in some cases, sharing the same applications. Higher level
computers must also be capable of running workstation applications plus those for which they are designed.
Thus, all operating systems must be compatible and must also be able to run MS-DOS applications. The
computers must also be able to run widely recognized word processing, spreadsheet, project management
and data base applications. It would also be an advantage if these applications were identical or
compatible with those used by the Bank. Thus, while the computer's operating system will not be specified,
its required characteristics will be based on the above requirements.
9.     Given the "off the shelf' nature of the higher level and workstation computers, a two stage bidding
procedure will not be adopted. However, technical merit will be taken into account in the evaluation of
bids.  The technical merit parameters will include (inter alia): speed of processor running applications
designed for it and also running in an "emulation" mode for other applications; the length of time the
supplier has been in business; and the servicing arrangements in Russia.
10.    Component equipment lists will be given in the GEF annex to the Project Implementation Manual.
11.    'he Bank's Prior Review Requirements. For equipment procured for the technical assistance
components of the Project: for all contracts greater than US$ 100,000, the Bank's prior review will be as
specified in Appendix 1 to the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Also the first contract in each
procurement category will be subject to the Bank's prior review regardless of its value.
C.     Consulting Firms Contracts
i2.   Procedures and Administration. Consultants will be selected and employed in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The PIG will be responsible for developing and
administering this policy and will produce detailed procedures which all component management groups
(CMGs) will follow. However, the procedures will be designed such that the project's Supervisory
Committee, Project and Component Managers will have the major input into the actual selection of
consulting firms and the professional management of their contracts. Thus the PIG will be responsible for
administrative aspects of the selection and employment process and for the routine administration of
consultant contracts, with the PM being: (a) responsible for the professional management of the consulting
firm's assignment; and (b) the recipient of the consulting firm's output.



Almexes                                                                                   99
13.    Estimated Costs. For budget purposes, foreign consulting services have been estimated on the
basis of US$10,000/month (US$15,000/month for managers) inclusive of social costs, overhead, fee and
overseas allowance. An additional amount of USS10,000/month has been allowed for living costs, foreign
and local travel and contingencies. Russian consulting firm rates have been estimated at US$1,500-
2,000/month.
14.    Consultants' Terms of Reference. The status of preparation of terms of reference for the major
consulting assignments is given in the Project Implementation Manual. Prior to inviting proposals, with the
exception of the strategic overview component consultants, the terms of reference for each subcomponent
technical assistance assignment will be reviewed by the General Consultant (expected to be appointed in
May/June 1996), in conjunction with the PSC, the PIG and the PM, and cleared by the Bank. The terms of
reference for assignments later in the project cycle will be drafted nearer the time when they are required.
15.   Selection Procedures. Above an estimated value of US$100,000, proposals will be invited from a
short list of consulting firms. Proposal evaluation will be on technical merit. However, a budget for the
assignment will be included in the Letter of Invitation as outlined in the Bank's Guidelines.
16.   Selection Committees. Selection Committees will be convened jointly by the Project Supervisory
Committee (or Baikal Supervisory Committee) and by the Project or Component Director responsible for
the assignment in accordance with CPPI procedures. The Director will work closely with the PIG in
conducting the affairs of the Selection Committee. The PIG will act as a resource, will provide
administrative support for the Committee, and will be represented on the Committee. However, the
appropriate Supervisory Committee will have majority representation on a Selection Committee.
i 7.   Data on Consulting Firms. The PIG will be responsible for building and maintaining data on
consulting firms. The Bank will make available to the CPPI data from the DACON system. The data will
also be made available to CM's.
18.   Documents.  The Bank's standard documentation will be used for consultant selection and
employment. As for equipment, the working translations of these into Russian will be held on the PIG
computer data base to facilitate the use of the Standard Documents.
19.   Contracts. In general, contracts with consulting firms will be of two years duration. However, a
contract over two years duration will include a provision requiring a major review after the first 21 months
to assess the consulting firm's performance and to determine the need for and/or scope of the future work.
20.   Bank's Prior Review Requirements. For all consulting firm contracts over US$100,000 the Bank
would wish to receive for its review and clear the following:
Prior to Invitation.
(i)    The short list of firms proposed to be invited for an assignment;
(ii)    The Invitation Package including:
(a)   the proposed Terms of Reference and details of the assignment budget;



100                                                                                     Annexes
(b)    the Letter of Invitation and Supplementary Information for Consultants
with full details of the proposed evaluation procedure; and
(c)    Any variations from the Bank's standard contract.
Prior to contract Negotiations:
(a)    a copy of the winning proposal with the right to request copies of all
proposals if required.
Prior to contract signature:
(a)    a copy of the proposed contract with the final terrns of reference.
After contract signature:
(a)    two confirmed copies of the signed contract.
D.    Contracts With Individual Consultants
21.    GeneraL The costs of project personnel specifically engaged to prepare and implement the project
will be financed under the project. The project personnel include the PM and staff of the PIG, the
component and subcomponent teams' staff, and individual experts advising the Supervisory Committee.
22.   Policies.  The PIG will be responsible for developing personnel policies such that there is
reasonable consistency in terms, conditions and benefits for all project consultants. A consultant scale
consistent with scales under other Bank financed projects, is to be determined by the MEPNR.
23.    Selection. Selection of consultants under individual contracts will be on the basis of three CVs
with the selection being made by the PSC. For higher level positions, the "no objections" of the PIG will be
required. The Bank's "no objections" are required for all individual consultant contracts above $50,000.
24.    Contracts. A contract for the employment of the Project Manager (in Russian and English) has
been agreed with the Bank and, with appropriate modifications, will be used as a basis for all individual
consultant contracts. Where individual Russian and foreign experts are employed on a subcontract basis
with the main subcomponent technical assistance consultants, the latter's contract will be designed to cover
these subcontracts. Individual consultant contracts will be of one year's duration, but may be extended by
mutual agreement.
25.   PayrolL To facilitate Bank replenishments of the Special Account, the PIG together with the CPPI
will set up a payroll accounting system and require CM's to set up similar payroll accounting systems
acceptable to the PIG and to the Bank. Rather than require documentation to support payment to each
individual consultant, the Bank will accept the documentation certified by the PIG covering payroll
accounts. With the exception noted in para. 24 the Bank will not require its prior review of specific
individual consultant contracts, but reserves the right to review such contracts on a random basis.



Mmes                                                                                     101
E.    Professional, Research and Legal Services
26.   The project includes for professional, research and legal services to be undertaken under each
component. While the general scope of most of these services is known, preparation of detailed terms of
reference will be carried out by the Supervisory Committees, CM's and subcomponent consulting firms.
Selection and employment of consultants to carry out these services will be in accordance with the CPPI's
procedures and the Bank's guidelines.
F.    Training
27.    All three project components include training activities. With the PIG, the General Consultant will
be the focal point for facilitating training activities to achieve economies of scale and to avoid duplication
of effort. Above US$100,000, proposals would be invited from at least three training institutions and these
would be evaluated as for consulting firm assignments with the Bank's prior review requirements being
met. The Project Implementation Manual includes equipment lists, costs, schedules and consultant
selection schedules.
II.    THE BAIKAL LOCAL BIODIVERSITY ACTIVITIES SUB-COMPONENT
28.   Procurement Administration. Detailed procurement procedures for the Baikal Local Biodiversity
Activities (including selection and award of small grants) were discussed at negotiations and relevant
provisions included in the GEF Grant Agreement. The Lake Baikal Supervisory Committee (BSC) will be
responsible for procurement by small grant recipients in close liaison with the General Consultant. The
Bank's standard procurement documents will be used with appropriate modifications to reflect the Lake
Baikal Supervisory Committee as the grants' administrator.
29.   Methods of Procurement. Because of the nature and size of small grants (typically between
US$1,000 and US$50,000) ICB procurement will not be applicable for this sub-component. Packages
above US$50,000 per contract will be procured by International Shopping on the basis of price quotations
obtained from at least three suppliers from at least two countries eligible under the Guidelines, in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Below $50,000 per contract procurement of goods
will be by National Shopping awarded on the basis of a comparison of price quotations obtained from at
least three suppliers from the Russian Federation eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Procurement of minor civil works in communities, if included by a
grant applicant as a separate component in a small grant package (all below $10,000 per grant), may be
done under fixed price, lump sum sub-contracts on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified
domestic contractors in response to a written invitation which shall include detailed description of works,
including basic qualifications, the required completion date, basic form of agreement acceptable to the
Bank, and relevant drawings, etc. For sub-contracts in scattered and remote locations (under $3,000 per
grant), sole source contracting may be considered, if otherwise impractical.
30.   Items to be Procured The items and packages to be procured are likely to be infrastructural and
consultative in nature. To maximize the impact of the small grants in supporting biodiversity conservation
and natural resource management, the sub-component is likely to finance equipment, civil works and
services.
31.    7he Bank's Prior Review Requirements. For each annual small grants program, the Baikal
Component Supervisory Committee would develop standard grant application package (detailing the



102                                                                                Axxexes
proposed advertisement, application format, proposal evaluation criteria, award procedures and monitoring
and reporting requirements), which would have to be reviewed by the Bank.
32.   Consulting Frm Contracts. The Small Grant recipients will have to follow its procedures for the
selection and employment of consultants. These procedures will follow the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of
Consultants. The BSC will also follow the Bank's Guidelines when employing technical assistance for its
own use. Working with the PIG, the BSC will build up its own data base on technical expertise and will use
the DACON information as an input.

ANNEX 5.1
MONITORING AND EVALUATION PROGRAM
Monitoring and evaluation will occur throughout the project and is a key component of supervision
(see Annex 5.1 .B). Additionally, mission members will be selected to provide specific expertise to evaluate
aspects of individual components.
The project has built-in monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure that the project evolves
and is responsive to changing circumstances. These mechanisms include a mid-term review and workshop
which will enable project implementation to be modified appropriately. The project also provides for the
establishment of a Joint International Expert Council on Protected Areas to evaluate and provide a forum
for the review of project implementation in the global context. Individual project components, such as the
Biodiversity Strategies and protected area management plans, will develop and specify monitorable
indicators, responsible institutions and a monitoring and evaluation schedule.
The Government has established an inter-ministerial Commission for Environmental Protection and
Nature Resource Management, which will, inter alia, support the integration of project outputs and
maximize their utility in effecting the sustainable development of natural resources and biodiversity
conservation in the Russian Federation. The table below (Annex 5.1 .A) summarizes the approach that will
be taken in the project in respect to monitoring and evaluating individual components.
