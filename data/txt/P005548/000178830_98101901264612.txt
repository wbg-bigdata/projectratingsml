APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND MEHARDEH THERMAL PROJECT
SYRIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Second Mehardeh Thermal
Power Project of the Etablissement Public de l'Electricite'(EPE), the
government-owned entity established in 1965 to be responsible for generation,
transmission and distribution of electric power throughout Syria.
ii.       The first stage of the Mehardeh steam-electric generating station
is being jointly financed by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development
(US$33 million) and the Bank (US$25 million, Loan 986-SYR, 1974). Because
the unit size has been increased from 125 MW to 150 MW the Bank has agreed
to amend this loan, increasing the loan amount by US$8.6 million. The cost
estimate now is US$101 million, or 61% above the estimate at the time of
appraisal.
iii.      The Project comprises the second 150-MW unit at the Mehardeh station
on the Orontes river near Hama, eight 230-kV substations, headquarters build-
ing, training and studies. The Project is estimated to cost LS 326 million
(US$89.4 m equivalent), with a foreign exchange cost of LS 263 million (US$72
i). A loan of US$72 million is proposed to finance the estimated foreign
exchange cost.
iv.       The Project forms part (13%) of EPE's large (US$704 million) 1974-
1980 development program. The first and second Project together would con-
stitute 27% of this program.
v.        The contracts for the first project, which were signed in October-
November 1974 with Bank concurrence, include a provision for an option allow-
ing EPE to order a second 150-MW unit and additional 230-kV substations within
6 months after contract effectiveness. It is EPE's intention to exercise this
option, which will provide considerable savings in cost of plant, expected to
be not less than 15%, and in operational costs due to reduced gas turbine
operation made possible by accelerated completion of the second stage. The
proposed loan would retroactively finance expenditures incurred since August
31, 1974 and estimated to amount to US$6-7 million for down payment on the
second Mehardeh unit and engineering services.
vi.       Other contracts to be financed from the proposed loan (except con-
sulting services) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding consistent with Bank G!oup Guidelines for Procurement, except special
teaching equipment to be procured for the training school, estimated to cost
about US$750,000, recommended by Electricite' de France as part of the train-
ing program.



- ii -
vii.      Most of EPE's plant damaged during the recent Middle East war is
being repaired. The technical effects have been rapidly overcome. A number
of gas turbines which were already on order in 1973 have been installed, and
the installation of a further 240 MW in gas turbine capacity donated by other
Arab States has been substantially completed. Because the government also
ordered 5 additional 100-MW units for the Thawra hydro station on the
Euphrates, which recently commenced operation with 3 units of this size,
EPE's capacity in generating plant is estimated to be more than adequate
until the earlier years of the next decade. By 1977/78, however, generat-
ing costs would be extremely high due to required gas turbine operation.
The addition of the Mehardeh station to the system will decrease these costs
to a reasonable level.
viii.     EPE's sales forecast has been reduced slightly compared with the
previous appraisal in view of more comprehensive information now available
with respect to the industrial development program. Nevertheless sales are
still forecast to increase by an average of 20% per annum over 1972 through
1980. In order to meet its responsibilities the company, under Loan 986-SYR,
has engaged management consultants for improving its organization and pro-
cedures. It also plans to construct a new head office building, to be fin-
anced by the proposed loan, to replace the present inadequate facilities.
The proposed loan would also provide further assistance in the financing of
a training center at Damascus for EPE's technical staff. A number of studies
in the power sector will be undertaken, to be financed from the proposed
loan. They include a rural electrification study and a feasibility study
for interconnecting EPE's system with neighboring countries.
ix.       Although the scope of EPE's 1974-1980 development program has not
changed substantially, costs have increased considerably and it now appears
likely that a tariff increase in the order of 33% will be required to meet
the rate of return of 9% from 1978 covenanted under Loan 986-SYR. A tariff
study, financed by Loan 986-SYR, is expected to be initiated soon and the
gradual implementation of new tariffs from 1976 onward would meet the above
objective.
x.        Agreements having been reached as set forth in Section VII, the
Project would be suitable for a Bank Loan of US$72 million equivalent to EPE,
repayable over 25 years, including a grace period of 3 years, under guarantee
of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic.



APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND MEHARDEH THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(SYRIA)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, on behalf of
Etablissement Public de l'Electricite' (EPE), has asked the Bank to finance
the second stage of the Mehardeh Thermal Power Project, comprising a 150-MW
unit, eight 230-kV substations, headquarters building, training and studies.
The Project is estimated to cost LS 326 million (US$89.4 million), with a
foreign exchange component of LS 263 million (US$72 million) which would be
financed by the proposed loan. The local cost would be financed by internal
cash generation and government contributions.
1.02      A first loan (986-SYR) for the construction of the first stage
of the Mehardeh thermal station was made in 1974. This project was financed
jointly with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. Because the
unit size has been increased from 125 MW to 150 MW, the Bank has agreed to
amend Loan 986-SYR, increasing the loan amount from US$25 million to US$33.6
million.
1.03      The contracts for the first stage, which were signed in October-
November 1974 with the Bank's concurrence, include an option allowing EPE to
order a second 150-MW unit and additional substations within 6 months after
contract effectiveness. By exercising this option EPE expects to realize
savings in capital cost, expected to be not less than 15% of the coo;t of
the second unit, and also in operational costs through reduced gas turbine
operation made possible by accelerated completion of the second stage.
1.04      The Project has been prepared following a feasibility study by
EPE's consultants, SOFRELEC of France, and an appraisal mission in November/
December 1974 by Messrs. W.F. Kuipper (Engineer), D.J. Bissland (FinLncial
Analyst) and A.J.D. Hutchins (Financial Consultant).
II. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Power and Energy Resources
2.01      Syria's main indigenous energy resources are oil, gas and hydro
power.   Oil reserves amount to about 1,200 million m3 of which about a
quarter would be economically recoverable with present techniques. Annual
oil production, which was about 6 million m3 in 1973, is expected to be
doubled by 1976. A refinery is located at Homs, where Iraqi oil (transported



- 2 -
by the oil pipeline connecting the Mosul area in Iraq to Banias on the
Syrian coast and to Tripoli in Lebanon) is blended with oil from the Syrian
oilfields in the north-east (the pipeline connects these fields with the
terminal at Tartous on the Syrian coast). Two additional refineries ai:e
under consideration for construction at Banias with an aggregate capacity
of some 11 million t/a, to be completed in 1978.
2.02      No significant gas fields have been discovered, but gas reserves,
associated with oil production in the eastern part of the country, may amount
to some 32,000 million m3.  This gas is presently flared but in the future
most of it could be used for power generation and other purposes. In -view of
the high sulphur and inert gas contents a feasibility study is required --
which inter alia would assess the measures to be taken and the cost to collect,
clean and separate the gas -- for the construction of one or more power
stations in the area (a 230-kV line is scheduled for construction to connect
the area to the EPE system). Funds for such a study have been included in
the proposed loan. An outline of the terms of reference for this study is
provided in Annex 1. EPE will engage consultants by September 30, 1975 to
complete this study, which is expected to require some 30 expert-months,
within one year.
2.03      The Euphrates is Syria's most important resource for hydropower
and irrigation, accounting for 88% of the country's water resources. The
first phase of a large Euphrates Basin development scheme is already being
constructed, with assistance from the USSR. It comprises the Assad reservoir
near Thawra, with a live storage capacity of about 7,400 million m3, a 60-m
high earthfill dam and a power station with an installed capacity of 8xlOO MW,
of which 3 units are already in operation and the 5 remaining units are to be
installed through 1979. The station will provide about 2,000 GWh of energy
annually to EPE's network, decreasing commensurate with increased diversion
of water for irrigation and pumping requirements for the same purpose. Pos-
sibilities for other hydro developments in addition to Thawra are small. A
preliminary study envisions the construction of a dam and reservoir on the
Khabour river, a tributary to the Euphrates, but no firm plans have been pre-
pared. The power benefits of the Khabour project would be small because most
of the waters would be diverted for irrigation.
B. The Power and Energy Sector
History
2.04      EPE was established in 1965 by Decree Law No. 8 to consolidate
and take over full responsibility for the entire electricity sector of Syria,
as the successor to former local and foreign companies (which had been
nationalized in 1951). From 1966 to 1974 EPE was placed under the authority
of the Minister of Petroleum, Electricity, and Industrial Projects. Recently,
a Ministry for Electricity was created and EPE transferred to this Mintistry.



-3-
Organization
2.05      The detailed organization of the Ministry for Electricity has still
to be determined. According to information obtained during appraisal, crea-
tion of 7 departments under 2 Deputy Ministers (one technical, already appoint-
ed, and one administrative) is envisaged. The Technical Deputy Minister would
head the departments for research, planning and statistics, training, and
supervision (of execution of projects), and the Administrative Deputy Minister
would head the departments for administration, finance and legal. The Minister
would have direct authority over EPE and two construction companies, one for
transmission networks and one for rural electrification. Because these changes
may infringe on the organization and functions of EPE, which at present is re-
sponsible for the entire electric power development of Syria (see 4.01), the
subject was discussed with the Minister and EPE during negotiations. The
Minister informed the Association of his intentions that: (a) EPE's respons-
ibilities for planning and accountability for the day-to-day operations would
not diminish, the Ministry regulating the sector, providing overall guidance,
and handling intergovernmental relations particularly with respect to the
presentation of EPE's 5-year plans, financing, and the supervision of perform-
ance; and (b) duplication of efforts and wastage of scarce manpower will be
avoided; new personnel are being recruited and internal regulations will be
prepared outlining the ministerial responsibilities. EPE's management con-
sultants, in reviewing EPE's organization have, inter alia, been instructed
to make recommendations for internal regulations defining the relationship
with the Ministry (see 4.03).
.Facilities
2.06      Statistical data on the power sector for 1963-1973, particularly
EPE, are shown in Annex 2. Annex 3 gives available data on power installa-
tions in Syria at the end of 1974 (and as forecast for 1975 through 1980).
The annual growth rate of sales for 1963-1972 (i.e. excluding 1973 in view
of war conditions) was about 17.5X. Development has been primarily in in-
dustry. No historical data are available showing the trend in consumer
growth, but in 1972, consumers totalled 494,000, including 15,300 industrial
consumers.
2.07      In 1968 EPE completed a 230-kV transmission system linking Aleppo,
Hama, Homs and Damascus, and in 1969 the hydroelectric station at Thawra was
connected to Aleppo. This station started operation with three 100-MW units
in 1974. EPE's interconnected system includes a 120-MW steam-electric
station at Kattineh near Homs, the 25-MW Ain Tell steam-electric station
at Aleppo, the 45-MW Hameh station at Damascus, some 15 gas turbines, a
diesel station at Damascus and Aleppo, and some small hydro plants. EPE
also operates numerous diesel plants, aggregating some 60 MW, and one gas
turbine in isolated systems. The company's networks comprise about 480 km
of 230-kV lines, some 650 km of 66-kV lines, about 2,000 km of 20-kV lines
and some 7,500 km of low voltage distribution lines. The rated distribution
voltage throughout the country is 127/220 V three phase, four wire, 50 Hz.



- 4 -
2.08      A total capacity of 150 MW was damaged during the recent Middle
East war at the Kattineh and Hameh stations. The stations are being repaired
and Kattineh is expected to be in full operation again in 1976. At Hameh,
2 (out of 3) small units of about 5 MW each will be written off; repair of
the remaining capacity of about 35 MW is expected to be completed in early
1977. The short-term impact of the war on power supply has been severe but
not prolonged, thanks to assistance from Lebanon, delivery of a number of
gas turbines ordered before the war, and delivery of 10 gas turbines which
have been donated by various Arab states. By the end of 1974 EPE's total
effective capacity in the interconnected system was about 340 MW, compared
with about 230 MW in 1972. There will be a continued need for gas turbine
operation, with the associated high fuel costs, until steam electric plant
has been fully repaired and the Mehardeh station (including the expansion
by the unit included in the Project) has been completed.
2.09      Public power supply has lagged behind demand, particularly in the
the industrial sector, and captive generating capacity has proliferated to
some 480 MW, almost double EPE's overall effective capacity in 1972. The
government intends to curb the replacement and expansion of captive plant
located near EPE's facilities and in time captive plant will close down in
favor of more economic EPE supply. With the expansion of the interconnected
system most of the existing loads of the national oil company would be sup-
plied by EPE, which may decide to acquire most of the oil company's gas tur-
bine plants (about 85 MW) for operation in its system.
Access to Electricity
2.10      Of the total population of 7 million, about 2.6 million (37%) live
in towns and villages supplied from EPE's interconnected system, about 1.1
million (16%) on EPE's isolated systems, and 3 million (43%) at present have
no access to electricity, representing about 3,000 villages with 2,000
inhabitants or less (two-thirds of which constitute villages of 500 inhabit-
ants or :Less). Assuming about 5-6 persons per household, EPE's 0.5-0.6 mil-
lion connections represent 2.5-3.5 million inhabitants, i.e. connection den-
sity in the areas having access to electricity would exceed 65%. Per capita
consumption is low, being about 150 kWh annually, compared with about 310 kWh
in neighboring Turkey.
Finances
2.11      The respective Ministries have generally taken all major development
decisions on the basis of recommendations made by the related government en-
tities and, once included in the official development plan, the "Caisse de la
Dette Publique" (CDP) has arranged external financing for the entities and
has assumed responsibility for any resulting debt service. CDP also is re-
quired to provide any additional local funds as may be necessary for the
projects. This policy is expected to be continued.



-5-
Tariffs
2.12      EPE's tariffs, which are shown in Annex 4, differ widely from one
area to another. They generally comprise flat kWh rates for domestic and
general lighting connections, block kWh rates for smaller industrial and
commercial consumers, and time-of-day kWh rates for the larger industrial
connections. With the objective of unifying and modernizing the tariff
structure EPE is studying the unification of its 20-kV tariffs and an overall
tariff study financed by Loan 986-SYR is scheduled to be executed. EPE is
engaging consultants for this purpose under terms of reference shown in Annex
4 and the work is expected to start in July 1975. EPE has confirmed that, on
the basis of the recommendations of these studies, it will promptly take all
necessary and appropriate actions to institute a new tariff structure, to-
gether with a sequential increase in tariffs to meet, by 1978, the rate of
return target of not less than 9% covenanted under Loan 986-SYR (see 5.13).
Planning
2.13      General:  EPE generally prepares broad outlines of facilities to be
executed, which are then - in the case of major facilities - studied by con-
sultants with respect to technical requirements. Except for the facilities
financed by the Bank loan for the first power Project, economic considerations
have not played an important role in EPE's decisions. Much of EPE's past
extensions have been financed through USSR and German Democratic Republic
(GDR) credits and, as is customary with such credits, contracts are signed
which include a study for the particular facilities to be financed.  Detailed
engineering of 230-kV lines and 66-kV substations, related to the first and
proposed Project, has substantially been completed by USSR and GDR experts
and the respective projects are now in execution. EPE intends to expand its
planning staff (presently about 20 people) and improve their training, in
connection with the implementation of the first and second Bank Project.
2.14      The Project:  With the concurrence of the Bank, EPE has engaged the
services of SOFRELEC of France for the feasibility studies, design, prepara-
tion of bid documents, evaluation of bids, and supervision and administration
of both the first and second stages of the Mehardeh Project.
2.15      Rural Electrification.  EPE intends to increase its rural electri-
fication program from the 1974 level of LS 13 m (US$3.5 m) to LS 21 m (about
US$6 m) annually, for which Bank assistance is expected to be sought. No de-
tailed program is available and funds have been included in the proposed loan
for the execution of a study. EPE will engage consultants for this study as
soon as possible on the basis of terms of reference shown in Annex 5. The
study, which is expected to require some 60 expert-months, is to be completed
before June 30, 1976.
2.16      International Interconnection.  Discussions are under way, on the
basis of agreement already reached in principle, for strengthening the inter-
connection with Lebanon through the Bank financed 230-kV substation (Loan
986-SYR) to be constructed at Tartous. EPE has also opened discussions with



- 6 -
Turkey, Iraq and Jordan on the possibility of interconnection with these
countries, and has requested the Bank to finance a feasibility study for the
purpose. Funds have been included for such a study in the proposed loan,
for which an outline of the terms of reference is provided in Annex 6. Con-
sultants for the study, requiring some 70 expert-months, will be appointed
not later than December 31, 1975, to complete the study within one year.
2.17      Coordination of Energy and Power Development Programs.  Although
EPE is aware of the problems, planning for the energy and power sector is not
coordinated between the various ministries or entities. It became apparent
during appraisal that the Ministry for Petroleum and Mineral Resources is
contemplating including power stations of 48 MW and 10 MW respectively in the
contracts for the construction of the two refineries at Banias in addition
to a 60-MW generating unit (providing both heat and power) for the expanding
fertilizer plant adjacent to EPE's Kattineh power station. The later plant
will be financed by the fertilizer company but installed in the Kattineh
power station in order to ensure reliable supply.  The 60-MW unit is economic-
ally justified (and has been taken into account in the justification of the
Project, see Annex 14) in view of the reduction in high cost gas turbine ope-
ration.  The addition, however, of refinery plants and other similar future
plants, may not necessarily be economic in view of the large capacities which
will be available in EPE's system.
2.18      In view of the above, the proposed loan would finance a study of
the industrial energy and general power requirements of EPE's system including
the industrial plant connected to it, conducted by consultants, on the basis
of terms of reference shown in Annex 7, in order to assess when an addition
to plant capacities (beyond Mehardeh) can be justified economically. This
study, expected to require some 20 expert-months, will be completed by June
30, 1976 and its recommendations will be discussed with the Bank. The Gov-
ernment has confirmed that, prior to completion of this study and before
permitting any action to be taken on the installation of larger generating
facilities for industrial plant, excepting plant solely for reserve purposes,
connected or to be connected to EPE's system, it will discuss with the Bank
the economic justification of any proposals for such plant.
C. The Development Program
2.19      EPE's large development program (see Annex 8) comprises, in addi-
tion to the first Bank Project and the proposed Project:
(a) Addition (to the existing three units) of two 100-MW units in
1976 at the Thawra hydro station, and of the remaining three
units in the period 1977-1979. Financing is by the USSR from
credits made available to the Ministry of the Euphrates for
the Euphrates development.



(b) Reconstruction of the power stations at Kattineh and Hameh
(see 2.08), and the addition of a 60-MW unit at Kattineh
to be financed by the adjacent fertilizer plant, which will
require most of the capacity and heat produced (see 2.17).
(c) Completion of installation of the gas turbines donated by
various Arab states (see 2.08).
(d) About 1,300 km of 230-kV lines to strengthen and expand the
existing system, financed from a general development credit
made available to the country by the USSR, and to be completed
by 1977/78.
(e) A dispatch system, financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund, to be
completed in 1977, for efficiently and adequately operating
the extensive 230-kV system and generating facilities. The
dispatch center will be located at Damascus.
(f) An ongoing and future program of 60-kV development. The
ongoing program comprises 14 substations (including the
60-kV sections of 230-kV substations financed and proposed
for financing by the Bank) and 625 km of lines. The future
program comprises 34 substations and some 1000 km of lines,
most of these being required for rural development. All of
these facilities are being financed from two development
credits made available to EPE by the GDR.
(g) A continuing program of distribution expansion (20-kV and low
tension networks). In 1974 about 500 km of lines have been
completed including about 150 substations allowing connection
of some 25,000 consumers. These figures are expected to in-
crease annually and reach by 1980 a level of about 70% over
1974. Part of the equipment is being financed from credits
provided by the GDR, and a further credit is under consider-
ation.
(h) An annual rural electrification program increasing from about
40 villages in 1974 to 100 villages in 1975 and remaining at
that level until the end of the decade. Financing of part of
the equipment is from the GDR.
2.20      The 1974-1980 overall development program (including the Bank
projects) is estimated to cost about LS 2.57 billion (US$704 million) which
includes some LS 0.6 billion (US$165 million) in Government contributions in
kind (Thawra hydro, gas turbines). The first Bank project, estimated to cost
LS 368 million (US$101 million) would constitute about 14% of this develop-
ment, and the proposed Project (LS 326 million; US$89.4 million) about another
13%.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      Together with the first Bank project, the proposed Project would
have as its main objective the improvement of EPE's organization (including
administration, accounting and planning), in order to assure economical and
reliable service to the public.
B. Description
3.02      The Project is described in detail in Annex 9.  It consists of:
(a)  The second 150-MW stage of the steam-electric station at
the Mehardeh reservoir on the Orontes river, near Homs.
(b)  The construction of 6 new substations (Deir-Ez-Zor, Souedie,
Hassakeh, Maskene (No. 2), Adraa and Lattakia) and the exter-
sion of 2 existing substations (Kaboun 1 at Damascus and Meskene
(No. 1)).
(c) A new head-office building at Damascus.
(d) Engineering and consultant services and training.
3.03      The second 150-MW unit is identical to the first unit, i.e. of the
conventional semi-outdoor reheat type. Most of the common facilities have
been included in the supply for the first stage, except the 21-km 150 mm oil
pipeline between Hama and Mehardeh. This pipeline, together with railway
unloading and transfer facilities at the dispatching site, would be financed
by the proposed loan.
3.04      EPE's central offices, which are located in numerous buildings in
Damascus, have become increasingly unsuitable for the satisfactory housing of
staff and facilities, and hamper coordination between departments. EPE's
consultants have prepared a preliminary design for new headquarters, to be
constructed at a new location in the suburbs which has been acquired recently.
A dispatch center will be installed in the basement of the new building.
3.05      Consulting services would be provided for final engineering, admin-
istration and supervision of the Project (see 3.07); a feasibility study for
the use (including power plant firing) of gas available in the east of the
country (see 2.02); a rural electrification study (see 2.15); a study of the
future interconnection of EPE's power system with those of its neighboring
countries (see 2.16); and a study of least cost means of meeting the power
requirements of EPE's system and the heating requirements of new and expanding



- 9 -
industries (see 2.18). EPE will continue to employ consultants for engineer-
ing, supervi.sion of construction, and administration of the Project under
terms of reference and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
3.06      Electricite de France (Direction des Affaires Exterieures et de la
Cooperation) is presently preparing a final comprehensive program for the
creation of a training school. The objective of the school, to be located at
Damascus, is to train and to provide annually about 64 higher technicians,
including 16 for steam-electric plant. Part of the required funds (US$250,000)
was included in the first Bank project, for financing by Loan 986-SYR, under
the assumption that bilateral assistance would be made available. It now
appears that such bilateral assistance cannot be obtained and for this reason
it is proposed that the remaining required foreign cost (US$750,000) be
financed from the proposed loan. The present cost estimate indicates that
overall costs have increased to about LS 8 million (US$2 m).  It is now
expected that training under the program will be initiated at the end of this
year, or early 1976.  Adequate technical training of staff is crucial to the
satisfactory operation of power plants, and training for this purpose has the
highest priority.  Under Loan 986-SYR, management consultants have been en-
gaged to provide substantial on-the-job training and other appropriate train-
ing for the major changes necessary to improve EPE's management efficiency.
C. Status of Engineering
3.07      SOFRELEC of France has been engaged, with the concurrence of the
Bank, for all aspects of the feasibility study, bidding, supervision, and
administration of both the first and second Project. Costs for the first
stage are being financed by Loan 986-SYR, and those for the second stage
would be financed by the proposed loan.
D. Cost Estimate
3.08      The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during con-
struction, is US$89.4 million, of which US$72 million would be in foreign
exchange, based on effective parity rate of LS 1 = US$0.274. Annex 10 shows
the estimated cost of the Project, which is summarized as follows:

/1   See Annex 10 for details of Project contingency components, which result
in averages (including studies) as follows:
Physical: local 7.9%, foreign 8.6%
Price:     local 23.6%, foreign 9.3%.
3.09      The above costs are based on the contracts signed for the first and
second stage (option) of the Mehardeh thermal station and the substations and
the parity rates of the foreign currency costs at the time of the negotiations,
and the consultants estimates for the other Project components. For pnysical
contingencies, 8% on direct local and foreign costs have been taken into ac-
count for the power station and 10% for the substations and head-office build-
ing. Price contingencies for foreign costs reflect the contractual escala-
tion ceiling of 10% for the Mehardeh station; firm prices as provided in the
contract have been taken for the substations, and 25% has been assumed for
the head-office building.
3.10      On the basis of the above estimate, the second unit at the Mehardeh
power station would cost US$58.2 million or US$388/kW. It should be noted,
however, that this cost should be considered in the light of the estimated
overall cost (US$137.6 million) and capacity (300 MW) of the Mehardeh power
station, resulting in about US$460/kW. This is about 55% above the original
estimate (fall 1973) of US$295/kW, and 35% above the estimate (US$340/kW made
during appraisal for the first stage, but still reasonable.



- 11 -
E. Financing
3.11      The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of
the Project. Local costs would be financed by internally generated funds
and by Government contributions through CDP to cover any costs not covered
by internal cash generation and loans (see 2.11).
F. Implementation
Procurement
3.12      The main contracts for the first power project,'which have been
awarded under international competitive bidding, were signed (with trie Bank
concurring) in October-November 1974. These contracts allow EPE to exercise
options to order, within 6 months of effectiveness (December 1974), the second
unit for the Mehardeh power station and 5 additional 230-kV substations. The
Bank has not objected to EPE exercising the option because although some 10%
of the contract price for the first stage of Mehardeh may be related to facili-_
ties common to both units, the financial benefits of ordering the second stage
of facilities for continued manufacturing and erection together with the first
stage are expected to be not less than 15% of its cost. There are further
benefits based on economic considerations (see 6.08) indicating that the
second Mehardeh unit should be completed as soon as possible after the first
unit.
Construction Schedule
3.13      Work at the site is expected to commence before mid-1975.  The
first unit is scheduled for completion early in the second half of 1977, to
be followed by the second unit 6 months later. The schedule appears tight
and allowing for possible delays, it is expected that the last substation
would be commissioned by mid-1977, the head-office building in 1979, and the
Project completed not later than June 30, 1979.
3.14      EPE, for purposes of both Bank Projects (and the dispatching system
financed by Abu Dhabi) has been exempted from the payment of import duties,
which has been taken into account in the revised estimates.
3.15      Contracts to be financed from the proposed loan (except consulting
services) have been, and would be, awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding, consistent with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement,
except the special teaching equipment to be procured for the training school,
estimated to cost about US$750,000 and recommended by Electricite'de France as
part of the training program.



- 12 -
G. Disbursements
3.16      Disbursements would be made for the foreign exchange costs of the
steam station and substations, for the cost of training equipment, and for
the foreign costs of consultants. The estimated disbursement schedule for
the proposed loan is shown in Annex 11. Should the foreign exchange cost
to complete the Project be less than estimated, any undisbursed amount of
the proposed loan should be reallocated to consultant services for the next
stage of development or, if not required for that purpose, the undisbursed
amount should be cancelled at the closing date. The closing date would be
June 30, 1980, to allow for final payment of retention moneys.
3.17      Because under its contracts with manufacturers (see 3.12) EIE is
expected to exercise the options on the second stage of the Mehardeh station
and the substations in June 1975, retroactive financing is proposed for ex-
penditures incurred since August 31, 1974 (in order to include payments from
the date of signing of the contract for engineering services), for the down
payments for the second stage and engineering services, estimated to amount
to US$6-7 million.
H. Environmental Impact
3.18      The environmental impact of the Mehardeh station is expected to be
minimal.  It will be located in the hilly and less cultivated region beyond
the gorge of the Orontes river, about 2 km north of the town of Mehardeh.  A
125-m high chimney would assure diffusion of noxious fumes and particulates.
Nevertheless, sufficient space would be provided on the site to install exhaust
gas cleaning facilities if found to be necessary in the future. Forced draft
cooling water towers with a low profile would ensure minimum use of cooling
water and avoid the heating of the Orontes waters.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Background
4.01      Since its creation in 1965, EPE has been responsible for the entire
electric power sector of Syria and has exclusive rights to generate, trans-
mit and distribute power in the country. It can authorize other organiza-
tions to generate electricity in appropriate circumstances; excess power,
however, is to be supplied to EPE. Prior to EPE's establishment, the power
sector was fragmented in numerous isolated systems, private and municiLpal.
The sector, although nominally under EPE, is still substantially regional
in its organization.



- 13 -
B. Organization and Management
Organization
4.02      Due to lack of experienced staff and the priorities required in
the technical sector, EPE has not yet achieved the goal of a comprehensive
sector organization in which the regions, although fairly autonomous between
defined limits, would adhere to common principles of sound management organiza-
tion and administration. For this reason, under Loan 986-SYR, EPE has engaged
the services of management consultants, with the objective of improving its
organization, including administration and planning, and to provide an econom-
ical and reliable service. This will require a combination of interrelated
actions to achieve the necessary institutional reforms.
4.03      The effects, if any, on EPE's organization or reorganization due
to the creation of the Ministry for Electricity (see 2.05) are expected to be
modest but under their assignment the management consultants will study EPE's
organization and its ties with the Ministry. The results of the study, and
the action EPE proposes to take, will be discussed with the Bank.
Management and Staff
4.04      EPE's day-to-day management is the responsibility of the Director
General assisted by a Management Committee, which meets weekly under the
chairmanship of the Director General and is made up of the four departmental
directors (Finance, Planning, Production, Transmission and Distribution) a
representative from the Ministry and two elected members from the Workers
Union. The Director General is appointed by the Prime Minister and the
other directors by the Minister for Electricity. All appointments are for
an unspecified period, i.e. until a new appointment is made. The present
Director General (who is also the Production Director) has been in office
since April 1972.
4.05      In 1973 EPE had 7,408 employees, an increase of 923 over 1972.  At
least half of the increase is due to the manpower requirement for repair of
war damage and personnel for operating the numerous gas turbine stations,
and the stepped-up program initiated for rural electrification. It is ex-
pected that by 1980, EPE's personnel would number about 10,000, representing
an average annual increase of about 5%, which appears reasonable in view of
its continued rapid growth.
Training
4.06      Despite these increases, EPE lacks experienced staff and a number
of interrelated actions are being taken to improve the situation:
(a) Through its engineering consultants EPE will engage 4-5 experts
to be financed by Loan 986-SYR) who will carry full executive
responsibility for the operation of the Mehardeh station for



- 14 -
two years, assisted by a number of chief operators who will
be provided by the contractors constructing the station.
These measures include long-term training of EPE staff re-
sponsible for operating the station.
(b)  The management consultants will provide "on the job" and other
appropriate training for the major changes necessary to improve
EPE's management efficiency. Several higher technical and
administrative employees are expected, with the assistance of
the consultants, to obtain specialized training in their fields
(planning, accounting, dispatching) outside Syria.
(c) The training school (see 3.06) would provide continuous train-
ing of lower technical staff.
C. Operations
Historic
4.07      Information on EPE's existing facilities, and historical data for
sales, generation, maximum demand and installed capacities are provided in An-
nexes 2 and 3 for 1963-1973. Increase in sales in the interconnected system
has been dynamic, showing a trend growth of 17.5%/a. over the years 1963-
1972 (i.e. excluding 1973 which was affected by the war). The sales in
isolated systems, in relation to overall sales, is small; they declined from
about 12% of total sales in 1963 to about 9% in 1972. Installed capacity
in the interconnected system, 122 MW in 1963 and 227 MW in 1972, did not
increase commensurately with sales and, pending completion of the Thawra hydro
station, no new major generating capacity was added since the completion of
the Kattineh thermal station in 1969. Consequently, demand has been suppres-
sed since 1971. The hydro station has now become operational and taking into
account the added gas turbine capacity (some 140 MW effective) at the end of
1974, effective available capacity already exceeds pre-war capacity, with
considerable additions to be expected in early 1975. EPE now has adequate
capacity to meet forecast demand, albeit at a high operating cost due to the
use of gas turbines at high load factors.
4.08      Reliable statistical data byond those provided in Annexes 2 and
3 are not available, so no monitoring targets can be set at present. How-
ever, EPE will include annually in the Progress Report for the Project, a set
of statistical data as outlined in Annex 12. During supervision the subject
would be reviewed regularly in order to discuss and define appropriate moni-
toring targets in cooperation with EPE.
Load Forecasts
4.09      In 1974 SOFRELEC reassessed future power requirements (see 6.01).
The resulting balances of energy and capacities, indicating, inter alia,
sales per consumer category, generation and capacities of individual plant,

are shown in Annex 13.   The expected changes from past trends are consider-
able; the share of industry (including the National Oil Company) in the
market, which has shown little variation in the past 10 years, would increase
from 43% in 1972 to 74% in 1980 with an average annual growth rate of about
29%. The overall average annual growth rate on the system would be about 20%.
Part of this large increase, however, is due to blocks of existing load (mainly
oil company load, factories and irrigation) being connected to the system in
1976/77, when growth rates would respectively be 50% and 30%. This overall
growth rate is lower than that forecast in the appraisal of the first loan
(about 13% less), but is reasonable.
V. FINANCE
A. Past Performance and Present Position
Reorganization of Accounts
5.01      Under the first loan, reorganization of EPE's accounting system is
being undertaken by consultants. At present accounting records are kept in
a number of centres (Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, Latakia, etc.) where the levels
of accounting skill and methods vary considerably. Returns are serLt only
annually to the head office in Damascus and the consolidated accounts are
therefore produced late.  This makes it difficult for head office to control
the accounting function and to ensure the completeness and consistency of the
consolidated accounts. In EPE's historical balance sheets, for example, the
assets for the 8-MW Rastan hydrolectric station and for the supply area of
the Latakia generating and distribution facilities, with a net value of some
LS 10-12 million, are not included although their sales and expenditures are
included in the income statements from 1971. Consultants for the reorganiza-
tion of EPE's accounts and accounting procedures were appointed undler a con-
tract dated March 31, 1975.
Balance Sheets
5.02      EPE's 1971-1973 balance sheets are shown in Annex 15.  Gross fixed
assets for the 5 main cities are stated at their 1968 values, the year when
the accounts were consolidated for these cities. Smaller systems were brought
in at the value at which they were appraised on acquisition. New assets are
included at cost but, when financed through a foreign loan or credit, inter-
est for the whole life of the loan or credit has been included in the cost
of the asset. EPE has agreed (Loan 986-SYR) that in future, interest or other
debt charges will be charged against revenue except during the construction
period (see 5.21). It would be desirable to rectify the past mistake of
including the entire interest in the cost of the asset; this matter is expect-
ed to be considered by the consultants in connection with the asset revalua-
tion review.



- 16 -
5.03      Very little construction work was completed during 1971-1973 and
the value of gross fixed assets remained relatively unchanged. Substantial
work is being undertaken in 1975 especially on EPE's general distribution
program and gas turbine installations.
5.04      At end of 1973, consumers' outstanding electricity accounts reflected
an overall average of 156 days of sales. This is high, although consistent
with previous years. Pre-1973 municipal accounts amounting to LS 4.4 million,
representing debts due from the municipalities (Belediyes) of various small
towns and villages, are still outstanding. They remain unpaid as the result
of a dispute between EPE and the municipalities over the valuation of, and
non-payment by EPE, of the purchase price for their local electricity systems.
The Minister for the Municipalities had instructed all municipalities, whether
in dispute with EPE or not, to withhold payment of their electricity bills
for street lighting or works. In May 1973, an informal understanding was
reached with the Minister according to which municipalities would pay their
electricity bills promptly. The municipalities and other governmental agen-
cies are paying their current bills since January 1975. In respect of the
period to December 31, 1974 EPE has prepared a schedule of their indebtedness
up to that date and the Ministry of Local Administration has prepared a final
valuation of the municipal assets transferred to EPE. At a meeting to be
held in May 1975 between the Ministries involved, the net amount due to EPE
from the Municipalities and a schedule for the payment of this amount is to
be defined. The government has stated during negotiations that full payment
of such amount shall be made to EPE within about one year of the said meeting.
5.05      At the end of 1973, EPE's long-term debt had increased to LS 89.1
million from LS 45.7 million in the preceding year. This largely reflects
increased foreign loans for which promissory notes had been signed for the
financing of gas turbines.
5.06      The 1973 debt equity ratio is shown as 19:81.  This reflects the
treatment of certain interest-free debts as government equity (see 5.19).
Income Statements
5.07      EPE's income statements (Annex 16) show that net operating revenue
increased from LS 20.4 million in 1972 to LS 22.4 in 1973. The rate of
return on average net fixed assets in operation correspondingly rose from
8.4% to 9.2%, the calculation in each case excluding the operating surplus
of Latakia (LS 0.5 million) since the Latakia assets will not be included in
EPE's accounts until 1975 (Loan 986-SYR). EPE's average sales price also
improved, from 12.0 ps/kWh (U$43.3/kWh) in 1972 to 12.8 ps/kWh (U$43.5/kWh)
in 1973. Electricity sales, as heretofore, have been credited with the value
of electricity supplied free to places of worship as required by law, a cor-
responding and equivalent amount being charged as expenditure.
5.08      The agreement under Loan 986-SYR provides that EPE will maintain
its overall average electricity tariffs at a level at least as high as that
of May 31, 1973, until December 31, 1977, and that from that date EPE shall



- 17 -
earn a return of not less than 9% on average net fixed assets in operation.
Overall the trend on income account over the three years ended December 31,
1973, was reasonably steady and produced a satisfactory rate of return of
around 8-9%. The position however changed radically in 1974 when supply had
to be restricted and the generating costs of gas turbines installed to replace
the lost steam and hydro capacity were considerably higher than for equivalent
steam generation. EPE's operating results for 1973 were only minimally affect-
ed, the impact of additional costs and lost revenue not taking their full ef-
fect until 1974 when the rate of return dropped to 2.5%.
5.09      In 1973, the cost of the losses at Kattineh and Hameh (LS 36.8 mil-
lion) were written off as a special charge. There was a resultant net
deficit for the year of LS 13.6 million.
B. Future Performance
Construction Program
5.10      The estimated cost of EPE's construction program (see 2.20) has
increased by 38% since the first appraisal mainly due to the general in-
crease in prices in 1974. Gross fixed assets will amount to approximately
LS 2.7 billion (US$739 million) in 1979 (compared with the previous estimate
of LS 2.2 billion) and LS 2.8 billion in 1980 (US$777 million).
Future Operating Results
5.11      The short-term effect of the October 1973 war on electricity sales
and operating costs was less p=olonged than expected. Although EPE's net
operating revenue fell from LS 22.4 million in 1973 to LS 8.1 million in
1974 for the reasons given in 5.08, net operating revenue for 1975 is ex-
pected to recover to approximately LS 24.6 million. In the longer term,
however, the high fuel costs, increased salaries and wages, lower revenues
from less sales and increased capital charges will depress EPE's future
earnings below the previously expected levels despite exemption of EPE by
Government from the payment of income tax as from 1973. Although EPE has
confirmed the institution of a new tariff structure, together with a sequen-
tial increase in tariffs, in order to meet the 1978 target (see 2.14 and 5.13),
the timing and level of the increases are unknown.  For this reason average
1974 tariff levels were assumed for 1974-1977 increased by 10% only for in-
dustry; this increase appears likely in the second half of 1975.  On the basis
of the present forecasts the sequential increases would have to result in an
average total increase of some 33% by 1978, over 1977.  EPE's forecast operat-
ing results are shown in the income statements in Annex 16.  Annexes 18
through 20 show the major assumptions made in the forecast balance sheets
and income statements.
5.12      Due to availability of indigeaous oil resources EPE enjoys the
benefit of below-world-market fuel prices as a result of the Government's



- 18 -
national policies. It is expected that the new tariff schedule resulting
from the study (which would be based on marginal costing principles (.,ee
Annex 4)) would provide for automatic adjustments of rates in the event of
increase in the price of fuel.
Rate of Retumn Covenant
5.13      The existing rate of return covenant provides a satisfactory basis
for assuring EPE's financial performance. During 1974-1980, it would secure
EPE a cash generation of 28%, which is adequate considering EPE's huge expan-
sion program. This covenant is therefore repeated in the agreement for the
proposed loan. In order that inflation may not result in depressing the level
of self-financing, it would be necessary to assure that the return is computed
on revalued assets. EPE has been advised that the duties of the management
consultants, appointed to review and where necessary revise their accounting
procedures, should include recommending a standing procedure which will pro-
vide for a revaluation of EPE's assets in their 1975 accounts and thereafter
on an annual basis as may be necessary.
Financing Plan and Funds Statement
5.14      EPE's sources and applications of funds statement for 1973 (actual)
and for 1974 through 1980 (forecast) are shown in Annex 17. They assume a
future foreign loan of LS 126.4 million (US$34.6 m) at 8-1/2 over 25 years
including a grace period of 4 years for the construction of the third
Mehardeh unit.  The financing plan, which assumes an average tariff increase
of 33% as of January 1, 1978, is summarized as follows:

- 20 -
5.15      The plan shows that EPE will be able to finance through internally
generated funds about 28% of its construction program from 1974 through 1980
which is an acceptable level of self-financing; 36% of the program will re-
quire to be financed by or through the government. Of the total govermsent
1974-80 contributions, LS 589.0 million will be in "kind", i.e. the fcrm of
assets, foreign loans or credits passed on by the Government to EPE. These
will principally be in respect of Thawra, gas turbines and the construction
of transmission lines financed under a USSR credit to Syria. The balance of
financing will require tLo be in cash (see Annex 20) and the bunching cf the
program makes it necessary for government to inject the considerable sum of
LS 610 million (US$167 m) in cash in the four years ending in 1977. Ihis will
be in accordance with government's agreement (Loan 986-SYR) to provide EPE
with such liquidity contributions as may be necessary to permit EPE to retain
funds sufficient to provide reasonable working capital to meet its needs for
operating expenses, investment program and debt service. This agreement has
been repeated for the proposed loan. Government capital contributions are
interest-free but are termed "development loans" under Syrian law since they
are considered to be repayable if surplus funds are available for this pur-
pose. On present assumptions it is expected that in the period under review
EPE will be able to refund LS 290 million in the years 1979 and 1980. Since,
however, the bulk of the contributions are unlikely ever to be repaid in view
of EPE's continuing need for expansion, the government's capital contributions
are included as increases in equity in the balance sheet and for the purposes
of the debt service covenant.
Forecast Balance Sheets
5.16      A major feature of EPE's forecast balance sheets during the period
1974 through 1980 is the rate of growth of its gross fixed assets in opera-
tion which, from LS 551 million (US$151 m) in 1974, are expected to reach
over LS 2.8 billion (US$777 m) by the end of 1980. A statement of estimated
gross fixed assets in operation at December 31, 1980, is shown in Annex 19.
5.17      Due to the expected relative increase in the number of industrial
consumers, who generally pay their bills promptly as compared with municipal-
ities, and to improved methods of collection, it is estimated that the overall
level of electricity accounts owing by consumers will fall from the equivalent
of 156 days sales in 1973 to 60 days by the end of 1980.  Inventory levels
reflect the normal expansion of holdings required to sustain the enlarged
operation.
5.18      There is a substantial increase in the long-term debt of EPE,
which rises from LS 95 million (US$26 m) in 1974 to LS 751 million (US$206
m) by 1980. This reflects the financing of EPE's expansion program from
sources other than the government. The debt equity ratio indicates low
borrowings but, as previously stated, the classification of government fi-
nance as equity distorts the ratio. On a current yearly basis the debt
service coverage is close to 1.4 in 1975, 2.0 in 1976, 2.3 in 1977 and
around 4.0 thereafter. The standard debt service covenant in Loan 986-SYR,
which requires prior concurrence of the B2nk for fresh borrowing of long-term
debt unless the debt service coverage is at least 1.5, has been extended to
the proposed loan.



- 21 -
C. Accounts and Audit
Accounts
5.19      Foreign exchange funds for EPE's projects included in the official
development plan are provided by CDP (see 2.11). However, foreign long-term
debts are shown in EPE's Balance Sheets separately only if a promissory note
has been issued to the lender. All other long-term debt is included under
the heading of "Government Construction Grants". This is the govenmnent
current or CDP account. No interest is paid on the account and it iia repay-
able only if EPE has surplus funds available (see 5.15).
5.20      When funds are provided to EPE against a promissory note, che CDP
debits EPE's current account. CDP also has the right to withdraw fuads from
EPE's bank account without prior reference to EPE if it considers that EPE
has funds in excess of its requirements. In practice such withdrawals have
been limited to minor amounts. The exercise of such authority and respons-
ibility by the CDP tends however to reduce the degree of self discipline and
responsibility which EPE can exercise over its financial and accounting
affairs.
5.21      The government has reconfirmed the previous undertaking (Loan 986-
SYR) to notify EPE the terms of all funds advanced as loans, in agreement with
EPE, and EPE reconfirmed that it will appropriately record the liabilities;
all interest or other debt charges will be charged against revenue except
that interest on loans or credits for the construction of the asset will be
charged against the cost of that asset during the construction period.
Uniform System of Accounts
5.22      Decree No. 21 issued March 19, 1974, by the Ministry of Finance
provides for a new uniform accounting system for public establishments and
national companies. In accordance with the decree EPE has applied for post-
ponement of the provisions until 1976. It is unlikely, however, that the
structure of the accounts as required by the decree will be suitable without
amendment for the accounts of an electrical utility. The contract with con-
sultants appointed to review EPE's accounting procedures will therefore in-
clude the formulation of proposals for the reorganization of the accounts and
the government has undertaken to take all necessary steps to cause EPE in
consultation with the Bank to adopt a new uniform accounting system as may
be necessary to provide for a separate accounting structure and code suitable
for utilities.
Audit
5.23      The Ministry of Finance has been responsible for auditing EPE's
accounts, the last audit having been carried out in 1969 for the five years
ended December 31, 1968.  However, under Loan 986-SYR, EPE has to submit its
accounts to the Bank duly audited by independent auditors acceptable to the



- 22 -
Bank. EPE is presently studying a number of proposals to appoint external
auditors and has made a tentative selection. Subject to receiving assurances
from EPE regarding the scope of work, the quality of audit staff to be assign-
ed and the degree of cooperation necessary between the auditors and the man-
agement consultants, the Bank has informed EPE that there would be no objec-
tion to the appointment as auditors of the firm proposed. The covenant under
986-SYR regarding audit arrangements has been repeated in the proposed loan.
D. Insurance
5.24      Insurance of EPE's major assets against the usual hazards of fire,
explosion, third party, etc., is considered to be adequate. It is effected
through the Syrian Insurance Company, the sole Government insurance ag,ency.
This company in turn reinsures through the Western insurance market.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Forecast of Sales and Demand
6.01      For their revised forecasts, SOFRELEC first established exponential
regression curves for total historic demand and generation in the intercon-
nected system, correcting for demand suppression and short-term suppl:.es to
meet Thawra construction requirements. The resulting past growth rates were
12.1% for demand and 15.1% for generation. The consultants then built: up
their load forecast as described in Annex 14 and summarized as follows;: First-
ly, they estimated "background" trend growth rates of 8.8% for demand and 11.3%
for sales from the interconnected system. Secondly, they added to th:is loads
attributable to identified major new industrial and other projects, connection
of villages to the main system, electrification of about 100,000 inhabitants
annually (at 30 kWh per capita increasing at 10%) through extension of supply,
reconnection of captive plant which is expected to phase out (except for plant
which also has to meet heat requirements), oil company pumping requirements
(except direct pumping), for which EPE would take over the supply, and irri-
gation (some 10% of total sales by 1980, mainly in conjunction with the
Euphrates agricultural development plans). It was also assumed that from
1975 onward Lebanon (which suffers from a capacity shortage) would be provided
with some 40-50 MW and that by 1978/79 power would also be supplied to the
Mosul area in Iraq.
6.02      As a final measure of caution, the resulting forecast figures for
sales were adjusted downwards by about 20% as shown in Annex 14. The growth
trend - by least squares - in the period 1972-80 is about 20%, with a maximum
of 50% in 1976 due to the compounded effect of the connection of isolated
systems, oil company facillities and new industry.



- 23 -
6.03      The increase in relative importance in industrial sales (see Annex
13) is shown in the following table of consumer cazagories:
Consumer Category                   1963         1972          1980

247    100   837   100 3,710    100
6.04      The corresponding forecasts for operational costs and revenues are
also shown in Annex 14. Cost of fuel and purchases (from some captive plant,
and hydro generation until the Thawra assets are transferred to EPE by mid-
1976) is expected to decrease substantially from ps 3.69 per kWh total gen-
eration and purchase (US11.01/kWh) in 1975 to a minimum of ps 0.45/kWh
(USdO.12/kWh) in 1977 when hydro generation would be 70% of total generation.
By 1980, however, cost would about double to ps 0.97/kWh (US40.27/kWh) due
to the rapid increase - to 65% - of the proportion of thermal generation, in-
cluding gas turbine operation, which would still meet some 10% of overall re-
quirements.
B. Economic Evaluation
Comparison of Alternatives
6.05      In view of the government's intention to exercise the contractual
option to order the second Mehardeh unit within six months of the order of
the first unit, the question to be decided is whether, taking into account
the higher costs of a separate contract for the second Mehardeh unit (if
the option to purchase within six months of the first unit is not exercised)
and the consequential additional gas turbine operation, it would be economic-
ally justified to postpone the unit by one or more years. Two main alterna-
tives were therefore compared:
Alternative 1 (the Project) - Mehardeh 2 would be ordered within 6
months of the first unit and Alternative 2 - Mehardeh 2 would be
deferred by one year (i.e. ordered 1-1/2 year after the first unit).
To test the sensitivity of these alternatives to changes in load growth, the
comparison was repeated but more gradual growth was assumed, down to a level
where for reasons of energy Mehardeh could be postponed by an additional year
(i.e. ordered 2-1/2 years after the first unit). The alternatives assumed
for these conditions were designated Alternative 1A and Alternative 3.



- 24 -
6.06      Alternative 1 has been compared (see Annex 14) with Alternative 2
(Mehardeh 2 postponed by 1 year), assuming that the second Mehardeh unit
would cost 10% less than the first unit (or about 14% more than the second
unit not postponed). Alternative 1 would have least present value up to a
discount rate of about 25%. The equalizing discount rate is insensitive to
variations in the price of fuel and total maintenance cost. The equalizing
discount rate is highly sensitive to the cost of the second (postponed)
Mehardeb unit, but its price would have to be decreased by about 15% (below
the assumed price of LS 231 million), to decrease the equalizing discount
rate to the level of the opportunity cost of capital in Syria, assumed to
range from 10-12%. Such a price (US$198 m) is highly unlikely because the
required cost would be only 5% above the cost of the second unit not postponed
(LS 188 million).
6.07      Comparison of Alternative 1A and Alternative 3 shows that by 1983
generation would have to be about 24% below the estimate to decrease the
equalizing discount rate to the level of the opportunity cost of capital.
Because the 1983 reduction would be about 1,470 GWh (about equal to the 1978
generation required for industry excluding the National Oil Company), such
decrease would imply in effect that most of the large blocks of industrial
plant would not materialize. For this reason, the probability of this
reduced development is small.
Return on Investment
6.08      The internal economic rate of return (IER) on the Project is the
discount rate which equalizes the present values of the time streams of the
attributable costs and benefits over the assumed Project life of 25 years.
The costs are the capital costs, a proportion (20%) of the development costs
of the 230-kV and 66-kV transmission system, and a share in the cost of
distribution expansion (two-thirds of the years 1979/1980) plus the operat-
ing costs of the additional facilities. The benefits consist of incremental
sale revenue due to the Project plus the proceeds of a 15% Government tax
on each bill.
6.09      As shown in Annex 14 the resulting IER is about 12%.  However, the
incremental revenues understate the benefits consumers receive from the
Project because it is considered that a tariff increase of up to say, 3C0Z
would not reduce demand significantly. The willingness of consumers tc pay
more to be assured of uninterrupted supply is illustrated by the fact that
large capacities in costly captive plant have been installed - and more would
be instaLled were the Project not executed - to meet electricity needs.
Assuming a 30% tariff increase by the time the Project becomes operational
and the cost of the Project to be in accordance with the estimate without
price contingency (which is about 10%), the IER would be 16%. Further sen-
sitivity tests indicate that with all costs increased by 10%, the IER would
be 10.5% (13% assuming a tariff increase of 30%). Assuming 20% error (plus
or minus) in the attribution of other transmission and distribution costs to
the Project, the IER would range from 14.5% to 11%. The range of the IER
(assuming an appropriate tariff increase and contingency allowance) appears
to be 12-15% with a most likely average value of 13.5%.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      The Government has agreed that the following covenants under Loan
986-SYR also be included in the Guarantee Agreement for the proposed loan:
(a) Section 2.03, assuring that arrangements will be made,
satisfactory to the Bank, for providing funds for carrying
out the Project and the Borrower's authorized expansion pro-
gram if funds available to the Borrower would be inadequate
to meet such expenditures (5.15); and
(b) Section 2.04, permitting EPE to retain each year from its
funds amounts required for working capital, renewal of its
facilities and other investments required, and for meeting
its debt service (5.15).
7.02      EPE has agreed that the following covenants under Loan 986-SYR also
be included in the Loan Agreement for the proposed loan:
(a) regarding adjustment of the rates for the sale of electricity
to yield an annual return of 9% from 1978 onwards (5.13);
(b) the debt service covenant stipulating a factor of 1.5 (5.18);
(c) regarding treatment of interest charges on debt (5.21); and
(d) regarding audit of EPE's accounts (5.23).
7.03      EPE has confirmed that, on the basis of the ongoing study and the
tariff study financed from Loan 986-SYR, it will promptly take all necessary
and appropriate actions to institute a new tariff structure together with
a sequential increase in tariffs to meet by 1978 the rate of return target
of not less than 9% (2.12).
7.04      EPE has agreed to engage consultants, under terms of reference and
conditions acceptable to the Bank, for the execution of a study for industrial
energy and power requirements in EPE's system and plant connected or to be
connected to it, and subsequently discuss with the Bank the actions it pro-
poses to take. The Government has confirmed deferring decision on the execu-
tion of such plant until the results of the study are knownl(2.18).
7.05      The Government has agreed to take all necessary steps to cause EPE
to adopt in consultation with the Bank a new uniform accounting system as may
be necessary to provide for a separate accounting structure and code suitable
for utilities (5.22).
7.06 (a) EPE will continue to employ consultants for engineering, super-
vision of construction and administration of the Project under
terms of reference and conditions acceptable to the Bank (3.05).



- 26 -
(b)  EPE will engage consultants for execution of the following
studies (and review with the Bank any action it proposes to
take as a result of such studies) in accordance with the time
schedules indicated:
(i) a feasibility study for the availability and use
of gas in the eastern part of the country for power
generation and other purposes. Consultants will be
employed not later than September 30, 1975 for com-
pleting the study before September 30, 1976 (2.02).
(ii)  a rural electrification development and feasibility
study for completion prior to June 30, 1976 (2.15).
(iii)  a feasibility study for interconnection of EPE's sys-
tem with its neighboring countries. Consultants for
this study will be appointed not later than December
31, 1975 for completing the study prior to December 31,
1976 (2.16).
7.07      During negotiations:
(a)  The Government has stated that the reorganization of EPE due
to the organization of the new Ministry for Electricity will
not result in decreasing EPE's responsibilities for planning
or accountability for day-to-day operations (2.05);
(b)  EPE has stated that it will include annually in its Progress.
Report for the Project a set of appropriate statistical and
monitoring data (4.08);
(c)  The Government has stated that arrangements have been made
for settling the past debts of municipalities and Govern-
ment agencies for electricity supplied by EPE and for ensur.-
ing prompt payment of electricity bills by them in the future
(5.04).
7.08      In view of the above agreement, the Project would provide a suitable
basis for a loan to EPE of US$72 million over a period of 25 years inzluding
a 3-year grace period, with the guarantee of the Syrian Arab Republic.

ANNEX I
Page 1 of 2
APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND MEHARDEH POWER PROJECT
SYRIA
Outline of Terms of Reference for the Use of Gas
for Power Generation and Other Purposes
1.        The study should make recommendations for the various feasible pos-
sibilities of using the gas (oil associated and non-associated) in the eastern
part of Syria for commercial purposes, in particular for the generation of
electricity by means either of a new station or of gas turbines available in
the country (but to be relocated to the area), which are not required for
emergency and standby purposes.
2.        An inventory of all identified gas sources, quantitatively and qual-
itatively, shall be made in close cooperation with the Ministry of Petroleum.
The data shall be evaluated with the objective of making a probabilistic as-
sessment of the annual quantities available through the year 2000.
3.        An economic evaluation shall be made (in several stages to be de-
fined in the final terms of reference, covering the identification, discus-
sion, and evaluation of the alternatives) of the various possibilities (or
combination of possibilities) and strategies proposed for the use of the gas
for commercial purposes, e.g., local or remote use; extraction of by-products
chemically unsuitable for the proposed uses of the gas; generation by steam-
electric means or gas turbines, or combined; distribution by pipeline (or
bottling and transport) for use as a fuel in industry, commerce and house-
holds; utilization as feedstock for production of chemicals; etc. For each
alternative or combination of alternative uses estimates shall be prepared
of the annual cost and benefit streams over time. The cost should include
the construction costs and operational costs (both broken down into local
and foreign exchange cost). The benefit streams should include forecast
revenues from sales of the output associated with each alternative plus any
other quantifiable benefits to the economy. Unskilled labor shall be shadow
priced at an appropriate value.
4.        The comparison of alternatives (and subsequent calculations) shall
be made using appropriate present worth methods for a reasonable range of dis-
count rates (say 6-14%), and using constant prices as of the date of the study.
A sensitivity analysis shall be made with respect to reasonable assumptions
regarding variations in the main parameters or combination of parameters,
e.g.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 2
construction cost,
collection and treatment costs of gas,
operational costs,
depletion time of wells,
forecast revenues,
value of foreign exchange.
For decision-making, i.e. the ranking of alternatives, a test discount rate
of 10% shall be used, the assumed opportunity cost of capital in Syria, but
sensitivity of the result to a variation +2% and -2% in the discount rate
shall be assessed.
5.        As an approximation, the benefits of using gas for power shall be
assumed equal to the marginal replacement cost of power in EPE's system, i.e.
the cost of power generation elsewhere in EPE's system that could be avoided
by generating power at the proposed plant. A simulation study of monthly (or
seasonal) operation of EPE's system would be useful, if not imperative, in
determining marginal replacement costs.
6.        For the alternative, or combination of alternatives, recommended
for execution, it shall be established that the proposed development is the
least cost means of meeting demands for power, gas and chemical products.
This may be done by making a present worth comparison of the costs of the
proposed development with the sum of the costs of the most economic alterna-
tive means of meeting the forecast demands. In the case of power, the cost
of the alternative should be obtained through comparing the cost of the best
development program with and without the power project as the first stage of
such a program. For gas, either treatment and pipeline distribution or bot-
tling (including transport) of refinery gas or imports and pipeline distribu-
tion or bottling (including transport) shall be considered as an alternative.
For chemical products a distinction shall be made between local market re-
quirements (import substitution) and exports (benefits foregone in the event
of the project not being executed).
7.        To complement the study, a traditional economic rate of return for
the least-cost development program shall be calculated, using either produc-
tion costs avoided or consumer willingness to pay (as measured by tariffs and
estimated market prices) to evaluate benefits.
8.        Preliminary individual global designs shall be provided including
global descriptions and specifications for distinct plant included in the
recommended project.

B. Outline of Terms of Reference for a Tariff Study
(Loan 986-SYR)
Introduction
1.        Etablissement Public de l'Electricite (EPE) is considering modern-
izing and unifying its tariff structure with the object of introducing revised
tariffs gradually throughout its system. For this purpose a tariff study
shall be executed in accordance with the guidelines set out below.
Objective
2.        The purpose of the study is to derive a tariff structure which re-
flects as closely as possible the costs to the economy of meeting the demand
for electricity subject to any constraints imposed by the revenue requirements
of EPE to meet its financial objectives and by any income distribution objec-
tives (e.g. subsidizing poorer consumers) which the electricity tariffs may
be required to serve.
Execution
3.        It is expected that the study would be executed in two stages as
follows:
Stage 1
(a) The consultant shall visit Syria for a period of 2-3 weeks as
soon as possible, but not later than June 30, 1975, to inform
himself of existing tariff-setting procedures, tariff structures
and levels and collect other relevant data. If as a result of
his findings he decides that a reasonably comprehensive study
would not be possible without the collection by EPE of addi-
tional information, he shall prepare a plan of action to be
taken by EPE for this purpose (including the necessary data
forms for completion within a period to be agreed upon with
EPE, but not exceeding 6 months). In this case the consultant
shall prepare a preliminary report on his findings, recommenda-
tions, action plan for EPE, and proposals for final Terms of
Reference for the main study (Stage 2).
(b) Should the consultant decide he is able to start work on Stage 2
on the basis of information available or obtainable to his satis-
faction during Stage 1, he shall either do so immediately, or
within a period not exceeding 2 months, after submitting his
proposals for the final Terms of Reference for review and agree-
ment. The study should be completed not later than six months
after initiating Stage 2.



-ANNEX 4
Page 5 of 7
Stage 2
If EPE has collected additional information under Stage 1 (see 1(a)
above), the consultant shall review the results and make recommendations as
necessary for any further action before proceeding to execute the tariff
study in accordance with the agreed Terms of Reference. He shall prepare a
full report on the study containing all pertinent information and making re-
commendations regarding a unified staff structure applicable throughout the
country, together with the detailed tariff schedules of rates to be adopted.
4.        Suggested guidelines for the execution of the study are as follows:
Analysis of Cost Structure
(a) The relevant costs are not the financial costs to EPE of ex-
panding and operating its system to meet the demand but the
incremental costs to the economy. Strictly speaking, therefore,
shadow prices (for capital, labor and foreign exchange) rather
than actual prices to EPE should be used as appropriate for
measuring costs and any taxes on EPE's inputs should be deducted
and subsidies added back. However, the consultant cannot be ex-
pected to calculate the appropriate shadow prices to use but
must rely on guidance from the authorities. Failing this, he
will have no alternative but to use the actual prices of inputs
(duly corrected for taxes and subsidies), although it is suggest-
ed that, in any case, the opportunity cost of capital for dis-
counting future costs should be taken as 10%.
(b) It is expected that the first step would be to analyze the mar-
ginal costs of generating, transmitting and distributing elec-
tricity at different places, times and voltage levels to differ-
ent consumers over the next few years, defined for the purpose
as the period 1976-79. This would require due attention to the
daily and seasonal variations in forecast system demand and,
to the extent possible, in forecast demands of various consumer
classes. Much of the required information for this purpose may
have to be specially collected e.g. by taking substation readings,
by enquiring about shift-working, seasonal work-patterns, etc.
and by statistical analysis of available load curves. The basis
for the estimates of marginal costs would be the development pro-
gram for the period 1976-79, the proposed operating regime and
proposals for subsequent expansion.
(c) For time periods when demand does not come up against the system
capacity constraint (allowing for the reserve margins set to
maintain security of supply) marginal costs would be simply mar-
ginal running costs grossed up to allow for losses at the differ-
ent voltage levels and, where relevant, in different regions.
The relevant losses are incremental losses, even if they can be
estimated only approximately, not average losses.



ANNEX 4
Page 6 of 7
(d) At periods when an increase in generation would bring the
system up against the security constraint, the marginal cost
of meeting demand would be the addition to all system costs
resulting from adding to generation capacity and/or storage,
transmission and distribution in order to provide the in-
creased supply with an unchanged probability of failure.
(e) It would also be necessary to study the incremental costs at-
tributable to poor power factors for those types of consumer
(the larger ones) who can be expected to improve their power
factor in response to suitable tariff incentives. The most
important cost to concentrate on is the extra MVA capacity
required to cater for these poor power factors.
Existing Tariffs
(f) It is envisaged that the next step would be to examine the
existing tariff structure and rates and compare them with the
structure of marginal costs of supply derived from the fore-
going analysis. Large differences between the two may be an
indication that the existing system is giving the wrong price
signals to consumers. Examination of the existing system should
pay particular attention to the types of metering in use and the
quality of meter maintenance, since this would provide some
guidance to what types of tariff are feasible. Other features
to look for in examining the existing system are whether it is
difficult to administer, conducive to disputes or conducive to
fraud, since these will provide useful pointers to improvement
in devising the new tafiff structure.
New Tariff Proposals
(g) With the information thus collected, it should be possible to
make a first set of proposals for changing the existing tariff
system so that the incentives (and disincentives) it provides
to consumers correspond more closely to the schedule of mar-
ginal costs derived. These proposals would consist of a classi-
fication of consumers and a tariff (or set of tariffs) for each
class, together with any connection charges and charges for
reactive power which can be justified. They would have to be
modified as necessary to take account of the following:
(i) Any strong arguments for slanting electricity tariffs
because of price distortions (e.g. of substitutes for
public electricity supply) elsewhere in the economy which
are likely to affect electricity sales in the absence of
such slanting.



ANNEX 4
Page 7 of 7
(ii) The need for EPE to secure a rate of return on net assets
in operation of not less than 9% by 1978. This would gen-
erally mean, if the revenues based on marginal cost pricing
are insufficient, raising those elements of the proposed
tariffs where demand is least elastic.
(iii)  Any income and redistribution objectives (e.g. through
subsidizing poorer consumers) to which electricity
tariffs may be required to contribute in Syria.
(iv) Practicality and cost. There is a trade-off between the
cost of administering any tariff structure (which depends
largely on the cost of metering and billing) and the ex-
tent to which it can reflect the structure of marginal
costs. Complex metering, for example, is likely to be
worthwhile only for larger consumers, since the response
of small consumers to the extra incentives (or disincen-
tives) it offers would not justify the expense.
(h)  Modifications of the strict "marginal cost" tariffs should be
designed to cause the least possible disturbance to the in-
centives they offer to consumers in relation to the costs of
supplying them.
(i)  The new tariff schedule should provide for the automatic
adjustment of rates in the event of increases in the price of
fuel for EPE's steam-electric generating plant. The price
level above which this fuel-adjustment clause comes into
effect should be defined.
Implementation of New Tariffs
(j)  The consultant should give careful consideration to the problem
of transition from the old to the new tariffs in order to make
the changeover more acceptable. He should prepare a plan, in
close consultation with EPE's management, for the implementation
of the new tariff structure in stages, possibly introducing some
of the new tariffs as options in the first instance. The plan
should include provision for publicity, meter acquisition and
installation, meter reading and billing, and all necessary staff
training to ensure a smooth transmission to the new system.
(k)  The consultant should also provide comprehensive recommendations
for General Conditions for Supply of Electricity, which would
inter alia include regulations for payment of indemnifications
by consumers (for damage to any part of the installations, un-
authorized use of electricity, unmetered supply, breaking of
seals, etc.), payment of indemnification to consumers (e.g.
for inaccurate metering), connection and disconnection charges,
and similar subjects.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND MEHARDEH POWER PROJECT
SYRIA
Outline of Terms of Reference for a
Rural Electrification Study
General
1.        The purpose of the rural electrification study is to examine the
technical, financial and economic feasibility of a program for substantially
providing electricity to rural areas throughout the country in the period
mid-1976 through 1985, taking into account projects now in execution and
the forecast requirements for electricity in the areas to be served. Eco-
nomic and social objectives incorporated in the program shall be defined and
form the main background assumptions for executing the study. Recommendation
for standardization of construction and operating methods shall be prepared
to provide electricity at least cost with an acceptable degree of security
of supply to be defined by the study.
Execution
2.        The study is generally limited to distribution from the 66-kV and
lower voltage networks but facilities required to provide supply to these
networks shall be outlined.
3.        Present practices and policies shall be investigated, and a tech-
nical inventory made of facilities already executed, evaluating their ade-
quacy with respect to the objectives stated above.
4.        Villages, and their surrounding areas, already electrified for a
period of years long enough to indicate trends in different regions of the
country and varying economic conditions shall be studied to collect the
following information for each village. (If practicable, the information
should be provided for all such villages, but if this is not possible, for
a representative sample of at least 20):
(i) The growth in number of consumers, demand (kWh and kW) and
revenue per consumer (including, if possible, statistical
analysis of individual consumer growth) since each village
was electrified. Consumers are to be classified as follows:
Residential
Commercial
Government and Municipal
Public Lighting
Industrial
Irrigation
Other



ANNEX 5

sumers, indicating types and numbers of appliances installed.
(iv)  The cost of supply in as much detail as possible.
(v) How revenue and cost have changed over time (e.g.: is load
factor per consumer category and overall improving?; have
investment costs per consumer been decreasing or increasing
over time?).
(vi) Types and number of dwellings, numbers connected to "networks".
(vii) Trends in socio-economic factors such as:
population growth
migratory flow
household incomes (giving the range as well
as the average)

schools, health centers).
(ix)  Details of any new economic activities (commercial, industrial
or agricultural) which have developed since the electrification
of the village.
(x) The projected demand (kWh and kW), revenue and costs over the
next 15-20 years, and justification of the projections.
5.        For the electrified villages studied, a comparison shall be made
of the cost of electricity and electrical appliances and equipment with the
costs of substitute energy sources and equipment in rural areas, particularly
for non-domestic uses. Taxes and credit facilities for the various energy
sources and types of equipment (electric and non-electric) should also be
looked at in this context.
6.        The electrified villages selected for the above study shall cover
as wide a range of situation as possible, e.g. large and small, relatively
advanced and backward.
7.        The information collected shall be analysed statistically to the
greatest extent possible with a view to establishing trends and correlations
for forecasting purposes and cost-benefit analysis in connection with the
country-wide rural electrification program to be developed.
8.        The following information shall be collected for the villages to be
electrified in the future, which may have to be grouped for this purpose by
regions or districts:



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 6
(i) Size of population and growth rate.
(ii)  Household incomes (average and range).
(iii) Number and types of dwellings.
(iv)  Average number of people per dwelling.
(v) Main economic activities (agricultural, industrial, commercial).
(v:i) Details of existing infrastructure (roads, water-supply,
schools, health centers, etc).
(vii) Existing fuels used and their costs.
(viii) Major identifiable electricity loads (e.g. irrigation, drinking-
water supply, agro-industries) for (a) existing, and (b) pros-
pective new operations (taking account of any Government develop-
ment plans for the area).
9.        Preliminary 15-20 year forecasts of demand (kWh and kW) and re-
venues shall be prepared for each of the villages, not yet fixing dates of
electrification. The forecasts shall be based on the analysis of the data
for existing electrified villages (para 7) and the information collected
on the new villages (para 8), together with any other information judged
relevant (e.g. relating to rural electrification developments in other
comparable countries). A full justification for the forecasts should be
given, including details of the methodology adopted.
10.       The next step is to determine the least-cost means of meeting
the forecast demand. The main alternatives to be considered are:
(i) public supplies from the main grid;
(ii)  the same, but with alternative network layouts, equipment
capacities and expansion plans; and
(iii) local generation (e.g. by diesel sets) serving local distribu-
tion networks.
The comparison of the feasible technical alternatives should be made over
an appropriate period of time (at least 20 years), using DCF methods. The
time-streams of costs should cover the following items:
-    Running costs (related to kWh sales):  mainly fuel and variable
cost of maintenance.
Capacity costs (related to kW peak demand):  generators, local
distribution networks and, in the case of public supplies from
the grid, transmission and substransmission capacity.



ANNEX 5
Page 4 of 6
-    Fixed overheads:  mainly administration.
Taxes should be deducted from inputs subject to taxation, and subsidies
should be added back. Shadow prices should be used in valueing foreign
exchange costs and unskilled labor, if guidance is provided to the consult-
ants on what shadow prices to use; otherwise, they will have to use unadjust-
ed market prices (corrected for taxes and subsidies). The use of 10% dis-
count rate for the comparison is suggested, although the sensitivity of the
results to higher and lower rates (e.g. from 6% to 14%) should also be tested.
The effects of varying the assumptions on load forecast, capital and fuel
costs should also be tested.
11.       The final stage in the economic analysis is the calculation of the
economic return of the proposed program by finding the discount rate which
equalizes the present worth of the time-streams of costs and benefits (over
a period of at least 20 years). The relevant costs are those already deter-
mined for the least-cost analysis (para 10). The benefits comprise:
(i) Direct benefits in the form of the projected revenues from
forecast electricity sales;
(ii) Surplus benefits to non-household consumers (agro- and other
industries, farms, commerce). These may be in the form of
cost-savings through the substitution of publicly supplied
electricity for other energy sources, or extra output result-
ing from the use of electricity.
(iii) Extra Government tax revenues e.g. through increased sales of
electrical appliances, if these are taxed (less any reduction
in revenues due to reduced use of electricity substitutes)
or from taxes on electricity consumption.
Again, the sensitivity of the economic rate of return to varying the assump-
tions on capital and running costs, load forecast and value of foreign ex-
change should be tested.
12.       An electrification program shall then be defined taking into account
the forecast electricity requirements (applying suitable diversity factors)
costs and revenues and ranking the villages (or groups of villages) in rough
merit order for electrification. This ranking cannot be determined 6n purely
economic grounds e.g.:
(i) Pure economic merit order cannot be applied in those cases
where physical constraints would delay connection (e.g.
villages, economically high on the list, but so remotely
located that a transmission line cannot be expected to reach
them for some time.



ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 6
(ii) It is of obvious financial merit to connect villages with
high immediate revenues (and internal generation of funds)
which may in part be due to demand from existing industry,
the economic merit of connecting which cannot be evaluated
with any degree of certainty.
It will be necessary, therefore, to strike a reasonable balance between
financial, technical, economic - and possibly organizational - considerations
in scheduling the electrification of villages, or groups of villages, to be
served, although departures from the economic merit order will require
specific justification in each case.
12.       Detailed supply (lower voltage lines and substations) and distribu-
tion facilities shall be designed to meet forecast demand in accordance with
the following requirements:
(a) Minimum number of simple standardized components (including
service connection, consumer drop with service box and meters).
(b) Simple network structure, on the LT side generally of the
radial type.
(c) Reasonable continuity of service; the economic merit of any
automatic devices proposed for restoring service shall be
adequately justified.
(d) Drawings shall be provided showing generally how the main
villages are expected to expand and what measures should be
taken to meet the growing demand.
(e) Use shall be made of locally manufactured components to the
greatest extent possible.
(f) An outline drawing for each standardized component shall be
provided together with a specification sheet, suitably codi-
fied.
(g) Similarly, outline erection drawings (showing a list of codi-
fied components) shall be provided for main construction
items (various types of pole assemblies, service connections,
service boxes and meters, transformer stations, etc.).
(h) The system shall be generally of the European type, three
phase 220/380 V, executed in single phase only in appropriate
circumstances, modified only (i.e. applying mixed European/
American design standards) where costs would be appreciably
lower.



ANNEX 5

(i) The preparation of a guideline for construction and erection
which, on the basis of fixed rules, would provide useful
information for the selection of main components in a distri-
bution network (type of substation transformer sizes, network
configuration, conductor sizes, service entrances, protection
coordination, etc).
13.       Lists of facilities and materials required for the execution of
the proposed program shall be provided, broken down into 3-year periods.
14.       Recommendation shall be made for an organization to execute the
proposed rural electrification program with a central office in Damascus
and satellite offices to be established throughout the country as appropriate,
in accordance with the time schedule. Estimates of manpower requirements
(whether EPE's own staff or contractors' staff) should be provided.
15.       Detailed cost estimates for the proposed program and each consecu-
tive 3-year period shall be made, broken down into local and foreign cost,
together with schedules of annual expenditures, suitably broken down into
main system components.
16.       During execution of the study quarterly reports shall be prepared
indicating progress of work, problems encountered, decisions reached in
agreement with EPE, outline of work expected to be completed in the next
quarter, and difficulties expected requiring a solution or decision.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND MEHARDEH THERMAL POWER PROJECT
SYRIA
Outline of Terms of Reference for an
International Interconnection Study
1.        The objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of
interconnecting Syria's power system with those of its neighboring countries,
to assess the various alternative possibilities and their costs and technical
requirements, taking into account also -- and reviewing existing plans for --
the interconnection with the power system of the Lebanon on which a decision
in principle has been reached.
2.        The study shall investigate all major aspects of international
interconnection which need to be taken into account for the preparation of
recommendations, such as:
-    the various stages of power development, particularly trans-
mission, envisioned for the respective countries until 1990,
including forecast demand and energy requirements;
-    the equipment and protecting devices installed or to be install-
ed and their characteristics;
-    the daily load curves, periodic changes, and long-term expected
trends;
-    transmission line maintenance requirements;
-    unscheduled outages expected (particularly in relation to
climatic conditions);
-    reestablishment of interconnection; and
-    requirements for dispatching facilities.
3.        The study shall pay particular attention to system regulation, and
define for the various substations and branches of the systems the transient,
periodic and stable phenomena to be expected with respect to:
-    voltage levels
-    active and reactive power
-    power angles

Recommendations shall be made for the actions and facilities required for the
network to perfrom within limits to be defined by the study.
4.        Symmetrical three-phase and single-phase to earth short-circuit
calculations shall be made for the main stations and modes of the network.
Recommendations shall be prepared for the standards to be met by the facili-
ties in the light of these calculations, and for the measures to be taken to
keep short-circuit levels of older portions of the network below new design
limits.
5.        The stability of the proposed alternatives shall be studied taking
into account the possibilities of outages of individual branches or combina-
tions of branches. Outages could be single or three-phase depending on the
reclosing system adopted.
6.        For each alternative estimates shall be prepared, through time, of
the annual construction costs, operational costs, revenues and other benefits
(e.g. benefits of scale, reduction in reserve requirements). Shadow prices
shall be used as appropriate (e.g. for the value of foreign exchange and
unskilled labor).
7.        The comparison of alternatives shall be made using appropriate
present worth methods for a reasonable range of discount rates (say 6-14%),
and using constant prices as of the date of the study. A sensitivity
analysis shall be made of the effect of variations in the main parameters,
or combination of parameters, e.g. construction cost, operational costs and
value of foreign exchange. Throughout, economic values shall be used (parti-
cularly for fuel) rather than market prices, but the sensitivity analysis
will allow for ranges covering the economic values of the items so priced.
For decision-making, i.e., the economic ranking of alternatives, a discount
rate of 10% shall be taken, the assumed weighted opportunity cost of capital
in the countries, but sensitivity of the result to a variation +2% and -2%
in the discount rate shall be assessed.



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
8.        For the-alternative recommended for execution, it shall be estab-
lished that the proposed scheme is the least cost means of meeting power
requirements in the group of countries to be interconnected. This is done
by comparing (in present worth terms) the sum of the cost of the best devel-
opment programs in the countries, with and without the interconnection project.
9.        To complement the study, a traditional economic rate of return of
the project selected shall be calculated using production on the basis of
attributable costs and revenues plus other quantifiable benefit.
10.       For each country a preliminary individual global design shall be
provided in the report, as well as cost estimates (broken down in local and
foreign cost), and global descriptions and specifications for distinct plant
included in the recommended project.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND MEHARDEH POWER PROJECT
SYRIA
Outline of Terms of Reference for an Energy/Power Study
1.        The objective of the study shall be to define the least cost devel-
opment program for meeting forecast overall energy requirements (electricity
and heat) in EPE system and industrial plant connected to this system. The
study shall cover the period 1975-1990.
2.        For several industrial projects it is contemplated to include cap-
tive generating plant which would meet overall heat and electricity require-
ments of the project and sell excess power to EPE.
3.        An economic comparison shall be made of the various alternative
ways of meeting the combined requirements over the study period, taking intc
account as given only plants already under construction or contracted for
1975-1979, and considering alternative developments for the period 1979/80-
1990.
4.        Industrial energy requirements may be met in various ways:
(a) industry could install facilities required for meeting heat
requirements only, EPE meeting all power requirements (except
standby capacity) at marginal cost of supply;
(b) industry could install facilities required for meeting all
heat and power requirements, any excess power being sold to
EPE (at marginal cost of supply);
(c) facilities could be installed (by industry, and/or by EPE)
meeting overall requirements by means anywhere between the
extremes (a) and (b). This includes the possibility of
installing, at a later date, or of including in an expansion
project for industrial plant, facilities to meet not only
the additional heat requirements, but also part or all of the
industry's power requirements. Any excess power would be
sold to EPE.
5.        The comparison of alternatives shall be made at constant 1975
prices using present worth methods for a reasonable range of discount rates
(say 6-14). Shadow prices shall be used as appropriate (e.g. for the value
of foreign exchange and unskilled labor). A sensitivity analysis shall be
made to show the effect of variations in the values assumed for the main
parameters, e.g.:

forecast requirements
construction costs
operational costs
fuel costs
value of foreign exchange
For decision-making, i.e. economic ranking of alternatives a discount rate of
10% shall be used, the assumed opportunity cost of capital in Syria, has
sensitivity of the result to a variation +2% or -2% in the discount rate
shall be assessed.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND MEHARDEAH IHERMAL PROJECT
SYRIA
Project Description
The Project comprises the supply and erection of the second 150-MW
unit at the Power Station to be constructed at the Mehardeh reservoir on the
Orontes, about 20 km north of Hama, 230-kV substations, located at Deir-Ez-
Zor, Souedie, Hassakeh Meskene (No. 2), Adraa and Lattakia, the expansion of
the existing Kaboun I 230-kV substation at Damascus and Meskene (No. 1), and
consulting services.
Mehardeh Power Station
2.        The proposed second unit will be installed at the new thermal power
station to be constructed (under Loan 986-SYR) a few kilometers north of the
town of Mehardeh near the flood control reservoir (about 60 million m3 stor-
age capacity) of the same name, at an elevation of about 270 m, 70 m above
the Orontes river and the Ghab plain. The site was chosen because of: (a)
the availability of sufficient water for cooling purposes in the Mehardeh
reservoir and abundant subterranean sources to meet requirements even in
extremely dry years, (b) its location (on a relatively flat plateau) inter-
feres lea[st with the irrigated and cultivated area in the neighborhood since
the site is rocky and not used for agricultural purposes, and (c) the amount
of rock to be removed is minimal. Although the capacity of the power station
is to be 300 MW initially, the ultimate size of the power station is only
limited by the availability of water. Development of some 500-600 MW appears
possible depending on the availability of subterranean water sources. The
extent of these sources is still to be investigated, but they are expected to
be high.
3.        The generating unit, which is of the same type as the first unit,
will consist of a semi-outdoor reheat type 150 MW boiler/turbo alternator
set together with all additional ancillary equipment. The boiler, which
will operate at 143/131 bar abs. (2074/1900 psi) and 543/5430C (1010tF), will
be designed to burn residual oil. The fuel will be transported by railway
tankers to Hama from the refinery at Homs. Between Hama and Mehardeh a 21
km 150 mm oil pipeline will be constructed, with railway reception facilities
at the dispatching end. Stocking capacity at Mehardeh will be subterranean,
two tanks of 10,000 m3 each for each unit providing at least 30 days require-
ments. Por starting-up and banking purposes two 1500-m3 light industrial oil
tanks will be provided for each unit. The firing aisle will be incorporated
in the building housing the turbogenerator and auxiliary equipment. The
solid staLte controlled hydrogen cooled generator will rate about 187 MVA at a
power factor 0.80, and operate at 3000 rpm, 50 Hz, 15kV, 3 phase. The gene-
rator will be connected to a 187-MVA outdoor transformer for step-up to 230
kV in unit connection.



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 2
4.        For standby purposes, the house service supply (5.5 kV/220/360 V)
will be connected to the second 66-kV line presently under constructioni be-
tween Hama and Mehardeh and the existing Shezar hydro station nearby (opera-
tion of which normally depends on irrigation requirements).  Additionally, a
standby diesel plant will be provided. Water for boiler and drinking pur-
poses will be taken from wells to be constructed and treatment plants will be
provided for both purposes. Except for office space, etc. required for ope-
rating the plant, all other auxiliary service rooms and buildings will be
separate from the main building. A total of about 50 housing units will be
provided for senior staff. Some personnel are expected to obtain hous.ng in
the nearby town of Mehardeh (15,000 inhabitants).
5.        The cooling system will be of the wet type, using forced air cool-
ing towers, requiring about 0.4 m3/s at full load per 150 MW unit (annuial
water use per unit is estimated to be about 6 million m3). The coolin;, water
intake will be at two levels in the reservoir (and, once wells have been
sunk, at the appropriate groundwater level) to allow for minimum cost w:et
and dry season operation, near the Mehardeh dam. Two pumps will be provided
at each level. Maximum pumping head is about 60 m.
6.        No means for cleaning exhaust gases would be installed because the
wind is predominantly to the east. Each unit will be provided with a c:himney
125 m high ensuring that exhaust gases escape about 200 m above the surround-
ing cultivated areas. Sufficient space will be left between boiler and
chimney to allow future installation of exhaust gas facilities, should they
be required.
230-kV Lines and Substations
7.        Similar to the first unit, the second will be connected to the
substation Hama (a distance of about 20 km) by means of a separate 230-kV
line, i.e. the unit connection comprises generator, step-up transformer and
230-kV line up to Hama. Each substation will generally comprise a 230-kV
double bus bar system (part of which may already exist in some locations),
one or two transformers 230/66/15 kV or 230/10 or 6 kV, 70, 50 or 40 MVA,
metering transformers, and the necessary line bays. All equipment, except
line isolators, would be operated from a control building. A detanking
building is to be provided in most cases for maintenance and repair. The
230-kV neutral will be earthed directly, and the 66-kV neutral by means of
a neutral reactance. Line charge compensation reactances will also be
connected at the tertiary of the transformer. Provision will be made for
communication facilities and telemetering and control.
8.        The construction of the 66-kV part of new substations or the
extensions to existing ones are being financed by DDR credits.

A. Forecast of Sales and Demand
1.        EPE's consultants have made two approaches in forecasting the 1974-
1985 power requirements. The first was a multiple regression analysis using
power and socio-economic data (using for the latter the 1974 "Syrian Statis-
tical Abstract" for the period 1963-1972) showing reasonable correlation with
power data, such as population, gross value added for mining and manufacturing
industry, value added for transport and communications, GNP, net value added
for the construction industry and communications, GDP, the consolidated budget,
and consumption. The results were doubtful at best because the 1974 genera-
tion should have amounted to about 1,800 GWh, compared with an estimate of
about 1,400 GWh neglecting the effects of the war, i.e., using the historic



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 8
trend of about 13%/a over 1972 for the years 1973/74 and (b) average growth
would be 10.3%/a, considerably below the historic trend thus negating the
expected considerable increase in supply to new industries.
2.        Next the consultants established exponential regression curves for
total historic demand and generation in the interconnected system, correcting
for suppression, but excluding the Thawra construction requirements. The
trends are: 12.1%/a for demand and 15.1% for generation. This appears
reasonable in view of the trend of 17.5%/a indicated by the raw generation
data 1963-1972 (see Annex 2). This, however, also neglects the forecast
additional industrial requirements, the existing and future isolated loads
(including the stepped up rural electrification).
3.        The consultants in discussions with ministries identified 83 indus-
triel projects (or 91 including hospitals and hotels) in execution or under
consideration for completion before the end of the decade. These projects
which are summarized as to type of plant in Appendix 1, represent an installed
capacity of about 630 MW by 1980 with an estimated non-coincident demand in
the order of 440 MW. The consultants interviewed most of the large potential
consumers, assessing the status of planning and construction, and comparing
the local assumptions of maximum demand and energy requirements with actual
requirements of similar factories elsewhere. They have concluded that con-
siderable delays in plant construction are likely, but assumed that most plant
would be in operation by 1980. Taking into account whether or not plant would
operate during the peak and applying appropriate diversity factors for those
operating during the peak, the estimates resulted in the following (including
hospitals and hotels):
1974  1975  1976  1977  1978  1979  1980
Additional non-coincident demand  15    25    59    139    93    15    90
Cumulative additional non-
coincident demand                15    40    99    238   331   346   436
Forecast additional coincident
demand                            2    12    30      63   116   161   193
This assumption appears realistically prudent; by 1980 coincident peak demand
(193 MW) would be about 30% of installed capacity. This modest assumption
would still allow for considerable unforeseen slippage in plant completion.
4.        In order to avoid over optimistic assumptions, the consultants
calculated the 1963-1973 "background" growth trend in the interconnected sys-
tem (8.8%/a for demand and 11.3% for energy) to which they added the identi-
fiable new connections as follows (see Appendix 2 for the period 1974-1980):



ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 8
(a) Isolated systems - Annual trends were used to forecast growth
in groups of villages for which a plan is available for con-
nection to the main system. They were then added to the main
system in sequence with the plan; the load factor was assumed
to gradually increase from the present 35% to 39% by 1980.
(b) New Electrification - About 100,000 inhabitants annually are
expected to gain access to electricity at an average of 15 W
each (demand presently is about 30 W/inhabitant), 2,200 h/a
(or 30 kWh/a which appears modest), increasing 10% per year.
(c) Captive Plant - Linear replacement in the period 1976-1990 of
captive plant generation; captive plant expansion is assumed
to be substantially prohibited by the Government from 1975
onward in view of the lower economic cost of public supply
(particularly due to a fair amount of future hydro generation).
(d) Existing Industry - Industry which has been prohibited in the
last few years from operating in the peak and would return
again because restrictions have now been removed.
(e) Oil Company Pumping - EPE is expected to meet all future local
oil company requirements for pipeline pumping, taking over
the gas turbine plants for least cost dispatching.
(f) Hospitals and Hotels - Additional demand is expected to
increase to about 9 MW by 1980, at a load factor increasing
23% presently to 40% (mainly due to air conditioning require-
ments).
(g) New Industry - These have been discussed above. Appropriate
operating hours were taken into account, but the initial
load factor has been assumed a low 55%. Through 1980 the
load factor would grow to about 73% due to the heavy industry
becoming operational.
(h) Irrigation - Assumptions are in accordance with a study
prepared by EPE and based on the plans outlined by the Ministry
for the Euphrates.
(i) Interconnection - During the initial years 40-50 MW would be
made available during the peak hours to Lebanon, which has a
shortage in capacity. By 1978/79 a connection to the Mosul
area in Iraq would provide some assistance to that area.
5.        It should be noted that the above forecasts were made for consump-
tion. However, in view of the uncertainties in historical data and in the



ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 8
programming of construction, it was considered prudent to assume that the
figures represent forecast generation, rather than sales. This implies a
factual additional reduction in the estimates in the order of 20%. Annex 13
shows inter alia the details for the resulting forecast 1974-1980 sales--both
for the interconnected and isolated systems (slightly adjusted during ap-
praisal for division into consumer categories). Growth trend--by least
squares--would be about 20%/a, with a maximum of 50% in 1976 due to the com-
pounded effect of interconnection, the connection of oil company facilities,
for which EPE would take over supply, and the connection of new factories.
Comparison with the previous estimate shows the following:
EPE Total Sales              1974   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   1980

The average reduction is about 13%.

in the following table of consumer categories and their purchases:

B.  Scheduling of Plant and Operations
1.        Annex 13 shows all plant in operation or to be added until the end
of the decade (either under contracts already signed including the second
unit at Mehardeh, reconditioning of war damaged plant, a 60-MW unit at Kattineh
to be financed by the adjacent fertilizer plant company to meet its additional
power and heat requirements for expansion, and plant to be acquired from the
National Oil Company after connecting taese plants to the system).  It is
obvious that, because of the low plant factor not exceeding 30% by 1980, ex-
cess capacity is extremely high, particularly in view of the availability of
the large capacity in gas turbines (338 MW effective, or 20% of total, in 1980)
and the 800 MW at the Thawra hydro plant (47% of total). It is obvious that
the plant mix is abnormal, and that for some time to come generation in EPE's
system will be inefficient until (a) additional steam plant is installed and
(b) some gas turbine plants are sold once security considerations would allow
this. This is best illustrated by the following table for 1980:

Capacity        Generation      Plant Factor
MW              GWh           % - hours

Steam                        540             2,380        50.3 - 4,410
Gas turbines                 338               260          8.8 -   770
Diesels                        75               50          7.6 -   654
1,763            4,640         30.0 - 2,630
Peaking capacity would be amply available in Thawra, but energy requirements
cannot be completely met by the steam plant for which conservative assumptions
were made with respect to availabi2.ity because Mehardeh's unit size is large
compared with the maximum unit size presently available (30 MW), and for EPE
constitute a new type of plant (reheat). Even if more optimistic allowances
would be made in this respect, gas turbine operation would be considerable by
1981, when additional requirements would have to be met mainly by operation
of gas turbines or new steamelectric plant (Mehardeh 3).
2.        Appendices 3 through 7 show the detailed forecasts for operational
costs (fuel, personnel, maintenance), based on the above assumptions, as
well as revenue based on historic trends for the various consumer categories
(Appendix 6). Fuel cost would decrease from a maximum of piaster 3.37/kWh
(US40.92/kWh) of thermal production to a minimum of piaster 1.51/kWh
(US40.40/kWh), after which they would gradually rise again during the next
three years by some 30% due to the increased requirement for gas turbine
operation unless new steam electric plant would be commissioned in 1981.
Total cost of fuel and purchases (some captive plant generation, and hydro
generation until the Thawra assets are transferred to EPE assumed by mid-1976)
per kWh total production (i..e., generation, and energy purchased including
Thawra) is expected to decrease substantially from piaster 3.69/kWh (USd1.01/kWh)
in 1975 to a low of piaster 0.45/kWh (USJD.12/kWh) in 1977, when hydro genera-
tion would constitute 70% of total generation. By 1980 cost would, however,
more than double (to piaster 0.97/kWh or US40.27/kWh) due to the rapid decrease
to 35% in the proportion of hydro generation. The estimate for operational
cost of the gas turbines, excluding fuel (see Appendices 4 and 5) total about
piaster 2.30/kWh generated (USd0.63), or some LS 11/kW (US$3.0/kW) of installed
capacity.
C. Comparison of Alternatives
1.        Because Syrian hydro potential is limited and no hydro plant can
be developed in time, and the gas turbine capacity is already far in excess
of requirements well into the next decade, the question to be raised with
respect to the second unit at Mehardeh (and subsequent units) is simple:
what would be the appropriate timing for the second unit to become operational,



ANNEX 14
Page 6 of 8
in view of the high cost of operating gas turbine plant already available in
the system? In other words: taking into account the higher cost of a
separate contract for Mehardeh 2 and the consequential additional operation
of gas turbines would it be economically justified to postpone this unit by
one or more years?
2.        The cost of the Power Station Mehardeh, at 1974 prices, (i.e.,
excluding price contingency, for which the contract allows with a ceiling of
10% for the foreign cost, but including physical contingencies) as contracted,
is as follows:
Mehardeh first unit   -  LS 257 million
Mehardeh second unit - LS 188 million
The price for the second unit is subject to an order within 6 months of the
order on the ffrst unit. It was assumed that the second unit, in the event
of a separate contract (i.e., the second unit would be deferred by one year),
would cost _S 231 m, or 90% of the first unit, because common facilities
would be supplied under the first contract. This is 15% above the cost of
the second -mit if ordered in accordance with the option.
3.        Two alternatives are now defined for comparison:
Alternative 1 - Mehardeh 2 would be ordered within 6 months after
the order for the first unit.
Alternative 2 - Mehardeh 2 would be deferred by one year, i.e. it
will be ordered 18 months after the order for the first unit.
In investigating sensitivity to the rate of growth, it became
apparent that two additional alternatives should be considered:
Alternative 1A - Similar to Alternative 1 (i.e., Mehardeh 2 would
be ordered within 6 months of the first unit), but the system
effect due to reduced load growth is investigated.
Alternative 3 - Due to a considerable decrease in load growth (1983
generation would be 24% below the basic estimate), Mehardeh 2 would
be deferred by two years, i.e. it would be ordered 30 months after
the order for the first unit.
4.        Appendix 8 shows the basic assumptions for the comparison of
alternatives as to growth rate, capital cost, economic cost of fuel, and
maintenance cost. With respect to growth rate it was assumed that by 1983
(when new plant would have to be added at the latest because of capacity
requirements to be met under the basic forecast) generation could be a
maximum of 24% below the estimate. Reductions at 8% and 16% have also been
taken into account (but not shown in Appendix 8).



ANNEX 14
Page 7 of 8
5.        Because up to early 1980, no capacity problem would arise (due to
the availability of the large gas turbine capacity) the comparison of alter-
natives considers only the balance of energy, as shown in Appendix 9. Most
efficient plant (including gas turbines at Souedie, operating on gas) is
assumed to be base loaded followed by Kattineh (including 60 MW to be in-
stalled on behalf of the adjacent fertilizer plant), less efficient plant
meeting the remainder with gas turbine plant operating as little as possible.
Because the equalizing discount rate is the discount rate which equalizes the
total cost (capital and operational cost) of two alternatives, the net costs
of fuel and maintenance are also shown, to facilitate the computations. The
resulting net present values of Alternative 1 less Alternative 2, and
Alternative 1A less Alternative 3, are shown in Appendix 10. Under the basic
forecast of load growth, Alternative 1 (the option on the order of the second
Mehardeh unit within 6 months of the first unit should be exercised), would
have least present value up to a discount rate of about 25%.
D. Sensitivity Analysis
1.        The equalizing discount in rate is insensitive to variations in the
price of fuel and maintenance cost (both together would have to be zero to
decrease the equalizing discount rate by 1 percentage point).
2.        The equalizing discount rate is rather sensitive to the growth rate,
but generation in 1983 would have to be about 24% below the estimate in order
to decrease the equalizing discount rate to the level of the opportunity cost
of capital (estimated to be in the range of 10-12%), because the second
Mehardeh unit could be postponed by two years. Since this would constitute
1,470 GWh less generation (about equal to the 1978 generation required for all
industries except the National Oil Company) such reduction in effect assumes
that most of the rather large blocks of new industrial plant would not mat-
erialize. For this reason, the probability of the reduced forecast appears
low.
3.        The equalizing discount rate is highly sensitive to the cost of the
second Mehardeh unit if postponed by one year and separately contracted. At
the opportunity cost of capital in Syria (i.e. 10-12%), a price of about 15%
above the assumed price of LS 231 million would be required to decrease the
equalizing discount rate to the level of the opportunity cost of capital.
Such price (LS 198 m) is highly unlikely because the cost of the second unit,
postponed, would be only 5% above the cost of the first unit not postponed,
which is highly unlikely.



ANNEX 14
Page 8 of 8
E.  Return on Investment
1.        The internal economic rate of return (IER) on the Project is the
discount rate which equalizes the present value of the time streams of the
attributable costs and benefits over the Project's assumed life of 25 years.
The costs are the capital cost of the second Mehardeh unit, a proportion of
the development cost of the 230-kV and 60-kV transmission system, a share in
the cost of distribution expansion, plus the cost to operate the additional
facilities. Willingness to pay, measured mainly through the revenues (includ-
ing taxes), has been used as a first approximation of the attributable bene-
fits. These revenues understate the benefits consumers receive from the
Project because it is considered that a tariff increase of reasonable magnitude
(say 20%) would not reduce demand significantly. This is further illustrated
by the fact that large capactties in costly captive plant have been installed
(and would be installed were the Project not executed) to meet the electricity
needs.
2.        The attribution of transmission and distribution facilities is shown
in Appendix 11: 20% of the 1975-1978 investments in 230-kV and 60-kV trans-
mission have been allocated to the project, which is the approximate per-
centage that Mehardeh 2 (150 NW) represents in overall capacity additions
before 1980 (Mehardeh 1/2: 300 NW; Thawra 500 MW). Two-third of the distri-
bution program 1979/1980 was attributed to the project (for the first
Mehardeh project the 1977/78 investment in distribution was attributed, and
a full allocation of a further two years was felt to be excessive since too
little would remain for allocation to Thawra if an economic rate of return
for that project were to be made). Attributable operational costs and
revenues are based on the appraisal estimates. As to revenues, an estimated
15% in taxes, which EPE levies on each bill on behalf of the government, has
been added to the revenue as they are a demonstration of the willingness of
the consumers to pay.
3.        The IER is about 12% on the basis of present tariffs.  Assuming a
30% tariff increase by the time the Project becomes operational and the cost
of the Project to be in accordance with the estimate, without price con-
tingency (which is about 10%), the IER would be 16%. Sensitivity tests fur-
ther indicate that the IER would be about 10.5% (assuming present tariffs) in
the event all costs should have been underestimated by 10%, which appears
unlikely (most facilities have been contracted); the IER under these assump-
tions of increased total cost would increase to 12% taking into account a
tariff increase of 20%. -It appears also unlikely that major inaccuracies
have been made in the attribution of other facilities (transmission and dis-
tribution). Assuming a 20% error (over or under estimate) in these attribu-
tions, the IER would range from 13% to 11%, not taking into account a tariff
increase. In view of the above, and assuming an appropriate tariff increase,
the most likely range of the IER is 12-15% with an average of 13.5%.

Assumptions made for Comparison of Alternatives
Growth Rate
1. *For purpose of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the growth
rate, 3 assumptions were tested in addition to the normal growth rate as
assumed for appraisal: required 1983 generation (no plant additions would be
required prior to 1983 for reasons of lack of capacity under conditions of
normal load growth) respectively reduced by 8%, 16%, and 24%. Little sensi-
tivity was found to reduction by 8% and 16% (equalizing discount rate ranging
between 20 and 22%). For 24%, however, the second Mehardeh unit could be
postponed by another year. Consequently two growth rates were retained for
final comparison of alternatives, as follows:

eign cost, but including physical contingencies) as contracted, is as follows:
Mehardeh first unit LS 257 million
Mehardeh second unit LS 188 million



ANNEX 14
Appendix 8
Page 2 of 3
The price for the second unit is subject to an order within 6 months of the
order on the first unit. It was assumed that in the event of a separate
contract, required if Mehardeh 2 would be postponed by 1 year, the cost of
the second unit would be 90% of the first unit, i.e. LS 231 million. Facil-
ities common to both units (grading, cooling water piping, etc.) have been
contracted with the first unit. The approximate expenditure schedules would
be the following in LS million:
1974  1975  1976  1977  1978  1979  1980  Total
Mehardeh 2 not postponed 13.1 20.8  52.6  52.7  39.4   9.4             188

Fuel Cost
3.        EPE present costs for fuel are (see Appendix 3)
Residual Oil                         LS/t
Aleppo                               61.15
Kattineh (Homs)                      49.30
Hameh (Damascus)                     61.15
Mehardeh (Forecast)                  59.00
Light Industrial Oil
Throughout the Country              115.00
The economic cost of fuel, to be used in the comparison of alternatives has
been calculated as follows:
Residual Oil                         $/barrel
Deflated Saudi Arabia 1974 price
for Crude                             9.40
Freight Premium for Syria               0.60
10.00
Residual Oil Discount 33%               6.60
High Sulphur Penalty 5%                 6.27
Specific Gravity 6.30 bbl/t           $39.50
Local Economic Price Syria at
US$1 = LS3.65                       LS 145/t
It is assumed that EPE succeeds in operating all gasturbines using residual
oil (as a consequence higher maintenance cost will be assumed). Syria
presently imports practically all of its light industrial oil at an appa-
rently subsidized price, and retails it at LS 115/t. This implies that the



ANNEX 14
Appendix 8
Page 3 of 3
cost to the economy would be equal to this price. Using either this economic
price and adding the relatively low cost of maintenance of gasturbines fueled
by this type of oil, or the economic price of residual oil but adding the
higher cost for maintenance if gasturbines are fuled by residual oil, cost
per GWh produced would be about equal.
4.        The economic cost per GWh generated is the following (see Appendix
3 for heat-rate information.)
Mehardeh, 0.280 kg/kWh, at LS 145/t: LS 40,600/GWh
Existing Steam-Electric Plant Residual Oil Weighted Average Price
(at LS 145/t)
kg/kWh         LS/GWh    GWh      LS106

Kattineh    0.296         42,920    790    33,907

Gasturbines
Residual Oil   0.4 kg/kWh, at LS 145/t:  LS 58,000/GWh
5.        Maintenance costs are assumed as follows:
Mehardeh
30% of fuel cost at Syrian prices (see Appendix 3) of LS 16,520/GWh
LS 5,500/GWh
Existing Steam Plant
30% of weighted fuel cost at Syrian prices:
GWh       Fuel Cost LS 106

1,055              17.0
Average cost of fuel, about: LS 16,100/GWh

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND NEHARDEH THERMAL POWER PROJECT
SYRIA
Economic Rate of Return on Project
Assumptions for Costs and Attribution of Costs to the Project Capital
-    Steam thermal plant:  100% of capital cost (LS 188 m, excluding
price contingency). EPE does not pay import duties.
-    230-kV and 60-kV transmission:  20% of investments (LS 359.7 m)
1975-1978 (when Mehardeh 2 will be commissioned), in accordance
with the ratio of the Mehardeh second unit capacity (150) and
total capacity to be added: 500 MW in Thawra and 300 MW for
Mehardeh 1 and 2.
-    Distribution:  Two-thirds of the 1979, 1980 investments (1977,
1978 were already fully allocated to Mehardeh 1). Demand
would grow by some 100 MW during the period, i.e. the attribu-
tion should not exceed a proportional part of the investments
for these years.
Fuel Cost
-    Fuel #2 Unit:  Generation as forecast during appraisal and
remaining level at 680 GWh from 1980 onward at LS 16,520/GWh.
-    Savings in fuel cost old plant:  Generation 500 GWh for 3
years (1979-1981) and reducing linearly to zero by 1986, at
LS 16,770/GWh.
Operating Cost
-    Personnel #2 unit:  30% (i.e. assumed additional personnel
required for this unit of cost forecast during appraisal and
kept constant until the end of economic life.
-    Maintenance:  15% of fuel cost.
-    Personnel and maintenance of lines and substations:  20%
(equal to percent attribution of investment) of appraisal
estimate and kept constant until end of economic life.



ANNEX 14
Appendix 11

Distribution:  two-thirds of the previous assumption for
the first Mehardeh Thermal Power Project.
Sales (GWh):  generation less 20% to reflect assumed losses.
Revenue:  in accordance with appraisal estimate for 1978-1980,
increased by 15% to reflect the minimum average tax, for which
EPE acts as the Government's withholding agency.

APPRAISAL OF
- 'HE SECOND MEHARIEH THERMAL P@WR PROJECT
SYRIA
Main Assumptions for the
Financial Forecasts 197  z-1980
Balance Sheets
1.  Gross Fixed Assets:             See Annex 19
2.  Depreciation:                   Rates are fixed by law and are slightly
on the high side. No rate has yet been
legally fixed for gas turbines, which we
have assumed will be depreciated over 15
years (6 2/3%). Typical annual rates
used are:
Steam generating stations          4%
Diesel generating stations         4%
Gas Turbines                       6 2/3%
Hydroelectric plant                3y4
Transmission, Distribution
Systems                          WrA
Studies and Training expenditure
have been assured to be written
off over 3 years. 50% of
depreciation has been assumed for
the first year in operation.
3. Accounts Receivable:             Electricity 146 days (1974) reducing to
80 days (1980) of sales due to increased
industrial proportion and results of better systems
following implementation of consultants' recommend-
ations.
4.  Inventories:                    From 1976 7% of gross fixed assets excluding
Thawra and Training School. 1974 drop
assumedasa result of sales of small standby
generators to hospitals, etc.
5.  Sundry Debit Accounts:          Assumed $1 million growth per annum  after
1974 and 1975 when payment assumed received
for small generators sold to hospitals,etc.
6.  Accounts Payable:               Supplies:  2 months fuel usage and 1 month's
local construction cost.
Other   : Assumed static at 1973 level.
7. Regional Balances:               These vary from year to year between net
credit and debit balances so nil balance
has been assumed.



ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 4
8. Construction Grants:            See Annex 20
9. Consumers Contributions:        Average about Ls 4 million per annum
assumed rising to Ls 5 million by 1980.
10. Long-Term Liabilities:          Consumers security deposits assumed to
increase by b 1 million annually.
11.  Long-Term Debt:                See Annex 20 for 1980.  See 18 below for
terms of loans assumed and actual.
Income Statements
12.  Electricity Sales:             See Annex 4
13.  Personnel Costs:               On 1972 basis increased by 6% for actual
1973 pay increase plus additional staffing
estimated to be required for the expansion
at an overall average of bslO,OOO per man/year
to include the 1974 pay increase but without
further escalation. Training staff for the
training school have been included from
1976 at an average of Ls15,000 per man/year.
14. Fuel:                           Calculated on the expected requirements of
each station (see Annex 14) at existing fuel
prices and transport costs.
15.  Spares and Material:           Mehardeh based on 30% of fuel cost (which
is maintained at a low price in Syria);
Gas Turbines were calculated with the
consultants on the basis of expected
working and idle time.
16.  Other Expenses:                These are relatively small and unimportant
and were slightly increased over 1973 levels.
17.  Income Tax:                    No income tax is payable by EFE as from 1973.
Only some minor taxes still apply.
18. Terms of Long-Term Debt of EFE:
