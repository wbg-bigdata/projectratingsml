INTERNZATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
ETABLISSEMENT PUBLIC DF L'ELECTRICITE WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOR THE SECOND MEHARDEH THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Etablissement Public de l'Electricite (EPE) with the guarantee of
the Syrian Arab Republic for the equivalent of US$72 million to help finance
the Second Mehardeh Thermal Power project. The loan would have a term of
twenty-five years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2% per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects for
Syria" (552a-SYR, January 30, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Directors
in February 1975. An economic mission visited Syria in March/April 1975 and
an updating report is currently under preparation. Country data sheets are
attached as Annex I.
3.        Since the attainment of independence in 1946, Syria has had numerous
changes in regime which resulted in a shift of power from groups of land-
owners, traders and industrialists to a rising class of officers, technicians
and civil servants, and a shift of the economy from a laissez faire system to
a largely publicly owned and regulated one. The Ba'ath Socialist Party--the
ruling party since 1963--has provided substantial continuity of emphasis on
economic and social development policies, which have prevailed in spite of
Government changes and external tensions. During the 1960's an agrarian reform
was completed, with redistribution of land to large numbers of formerly land-
less peasants. In November 1970, General Assad became President of the
Republic. His regime has been characterized by a balance of firmness and
conciliation in domestic policies; economic pragmatism; search for a better
defined role for the private sector in the centrally regulated economy; and
diversification in foreign economic relations. In March 1973, a permanent
constitution was approved by referendum. General-elections for the legisla-
ture in May 1973 gave the majority of the vote and seats to the Ba'ath
Socialist Party. A national referendum reconfirmed President Assad for a
seven-year term.
4.        In the last decade, Syria has achieved diversification of production
and rapid growth under fairly stable prices. Gross domestic product in real
terms increased by an average of 9.8 percent per year between 1970 and 1972



- 2 -
compared to 5.8 percent between 1965 and 1969. GDP, however, grew by only
2 percent in 1973 mainly due to a large decline in agricultural output brought
about by the severe drought conditions of late 1972 and early 1973. The dis-
appointing performance in 1973 was also partly due to the effects of the
October war and the resulting damage, particularly to power stations, refin-
eries and pipeline terminals. The economy has almost completely recovered
from the dislocations caused by the war and, in 1974, GDP is estimated to have
grown by almost 13 percent, as a result of increased production of oil and
phosphates as well as a large increase in agricultural output. With reported
favorable weather and rainfall, GDP may grow by about 10-12 percent in real
terms in 1975. On the other hand, prices which increased at a modest rate
(averaging 4.5 percent per annum) between 1962 and 1973, rose by about 36
percent in 1974. This was due, on the demand side, to an increased level of
Government expenditures, including additional expenditures on reconstruction
after the October war, and a rise in foreign exchange reserves. Further
pressure on prices was generated from the supply side through short-falls in
agricultural production and increases in the cost of imports. However the
Government is increasingly concerned about inflationary pressures in the
economy and is considering further import liberalization as well as fiscal
and monetary measures.
5.        Despite its clearly declining share in exports and employment, agri-
culture remains an important sector of the economy accounting for about 21-
23 percent of GDP during 1970-74, and provides employment for over half of
the labor force. Mainly because of heavy dependence on uncertain rainfall,
the agricultural sector in Syria is characterized by wide fluctuations in out-
put. Industry accounted for about 21-24 percent of GDP over the period 1970-
74, and about 10 percent of employment. The sector's average rate of growth
was about 6.0 percent per year during 1969-72, mainly as a result of the
growth of oil, electricity, phosphates and chemicals. After less than 2 per-
cent growth in 1973, value-added in industry grew by 25 percent in 1974, as
manufacturing and construction recovered sharply in that year.
6.        After a modest decline of about 4 percent in 1970, total investment
increased steadily both in absolute and relative terms. Aggregate investment
as a percentage of GD)P increased from under 16 percent in 1969 to an estimated
23 percent in 1974. Public investment was about two-thirds of total investment
in 1974. The growth of consumption though rapid was still below the increase
in GDP. Consequently, total consumption as a proportion of GDP fell from
about 89 percent in 1969 to an estimated 84 percent in 1974. Averaging about
12 percent of GDP between 1969 and 1972 the gross domestic saving ratio in-
creased to about 16 percent in 1974, and financed about 70 percent of aggregate
investment. Gross national savings Increased more rapidly from about 16.6
percent to an estimated 29 percent of GDP, mainlly because of the substantial
rise in grants and aid from other Arab states particularly in the past two
years. The resource gap as a percentage of GDP declined from an average of
about 5 percent between 1969 and 1972 to an estimated 2.2 percent in 1973,
but rose to almost 7 percent in 1974. The decline was mainly due to an appre-
ciable increase in exports of non-factor services, particularly oil transit
dues; but import growth in 1974 outpaced the growth of current receipts.



-3-
7.        The Syrian Government budget has been characterized by rising over-
all deficits for a number of years. Domestic revenues have been slightly
higher than current expenditures so that the larger part of the development
expenditures have been financed through external project assistance or through
borrowing from the banking system. Since 1970, grants and other aid from Arab
countries have assumed greater importance and have financed a substantial
share of the overall deficits of the public sector in Syria. Estimates for
1974 indicate that the public sector accounts registered a large overall
deficit. However, official transfers from Arab countries also rose substan-
tially and recourse to the domestic banking system for financing the overall
budget deficit was not necessary. The 1975 budget envisages almost the same
level of revenues as in 1974 and an almost twofold increase in expenditures
with development expenditures amounting to more than half of the total. Over
the past two years, military expenditures represented 40 percent of the over-
all Government expenditure and about 14.5 percent of GDP. The anticipated in-
crease in the overall deficit is expected to be financed from current trans-
fers from abroad.
8.        Government development expenditures are carried out in the frame-
work of the Third Five Year Plan 1971-75. So far, development expenditures
have fallen below the set targets and, for the first three years of the Plan,
were about 38 percent of total planned expenditures. However, there has been
a significant improvement in the rate of implementation in 1974, and further
improvement is expected in 1975. Nevertheless, the rate of implementation
for the Plan period is not likely to exceed 55 percent. This short fall is
the result of weaknesses in project preparation and follow-up procedures as
well as shortages of manpower and of foreign exchange to import necessary
materials. However, implementation rates are expected to improve in the medium-
term as the current efforts of the Government at strengthening the planning
machinery, particularly project preparation and administration take effect
and as the foreign exchange situation of the country improves. Absorptive
capacity may also be expected to improve as the necessary infrastructure and
other basic facilities are established, thereby permitting a more accelerated
development of the productive sectors.
9.        The balance of payments, which had been in surplus for several
years through 1967, developed relatively large deficits in the following four
years. A widening of the trade gap resulting from lagging growth of exports
in relation to imports, was the main reason behind the deterioration. In the
last two years, however, the trend was reversed once more and surpluses (par-
ticularly large in 1973 and 1974) emerged. Such surpluses were made possible
by a rapid growth of exports and by an appreciable increase in official aid
and grants received from Arab countries particularly in 1973. Thus, from a
deficit averaging US$32 million during 1969-71, the balance of payments devel-
oped a modest surplus of US$7.3 million in 1972, US$279 million in 1973, and
an estimated surplus of US$297 million in 1974.
10.       Besides the recent large transfers from other Arab countries, im-
portant new developments have taken place in the last two years that may
have a favorable impact on the future prospects and structure of the balance



- 4 -
of payments. The rise in prices (to an average of $7 per barrel of oil and
about $35 per ton of phosphates) and the expected increase in production and
exports of oil (to 10 and 12 million tons by 1976 and 1978 respectively) and
phosphates, the increase in oil transit dues as well as anticipated improve-
ment in earnings from tourism should lead to more diversification of exports,
and reduce the trade gap. This improvement may be attainable in spite of the
expected increase in imports resulting from increased spending by both the
public and the private sectors.
11.       Future prospects of the Syrian economy appear to be good and would
be greatly enhanced if peace is restored to the area. As a result of recent
changes in the direction of economic policies, the private sector should be
able to increase its contribution to the future development of the Syrian
economy. Private sector investment is likely to be in agriculture, small
scale industries and the services' sector, while public sector investment is
likely to be mostly in agriculture--particularly the Euphrates basin and other
irrigation facilities - in oil, particularly exploration, pipelines, and re-
fineries, and in phosphates development. It is anticipated that a large part
of these investments may be financed by domestic savings which may grow by
over 10 percent per year. In real terms GDP may be expected to grow by an
average of around 8-9 percent between 1974 and 1980.
12.       Despite the expected improvement in economic performance over the
next five years, the planned large expansion in development expenditures will
make Syria continually in need of borrowing abroad to finance projects, partic-
ularly in the public sector. Syria's external debt (excluding military)
amounted to $677 million by the end of 1974, and debt service payments were
estimated at about $52.7 million, equivalent to 5 percent of exports of goods
and non factor services in 1974. With the prospect of rapidly increasing
export earnings, the future debt service ratio is expected to decline despite
an expected increase in the level of borrowing. In view of these improved
prospects, Syria remains creditworthy for borrowing substantial amounts on
conventional terms.
13.       Following Iraq's nationalization of the facilities of the Iraq
Petroleum Company (IPC), Syria nationalized the section of the IPC pipeline
running through its territory, in June 1972, with a provision for compensation.
At the time of nationalization, the company asked the Government to submit to
arbitration, pursuant to the original convention, the question of Syria's
right to nationalize the properties. While reasserting its willingness to
compensate IPC, the Government questioned the company's interpretation of the
arbitration clause and its applicability to nationalization as such. This
led to a deadlock on the issue of arbitration rather than a discussion of
compensation. Since then, Government officials have informed our staff on
various occasions that the Syrian Government was prepared to discuss the
amount of compensation with the company, and this position has been relayed
to IPC and its shareholders. In view of substantial counterclaims on the
part of the Government related to past IPC dues the Company informed the Bank
that it preferred not to press for compensation for the time being.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SYRIA
14.       Syria has to date received four IDA credits totaling $47.3 million
and two loans totaling $96.6 million, (including $8.6 million of supplementary
financing for the first power project, approved on April 29, 1975) for projects
in highways, water supply, irrigation and electric power. The first highway
project is about to be completed satisfactorily after many delays. The other
projects are expected to progress satisfactorily after some initial delays
caused by lack of experience in competitive bidding and consultant's selec-
tion; however, substantial changes in the Damascus Water Supply project
(CR 401) have been required as a result of large increases in costs and were
approved by the Association on May 12, 1975. Though Syria is a member of the
Corporation, IFC has made no investments. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1975, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
15.       In recent years, the Bank Group has established a close dialogue
with the Government which has resulted in greater mutual understanding and
increased Syrian interest in Bank financing. The Government's emphasis on
economic management, and on austere, pragmatic and socially-oriented economic
policies, provides an appropriate setting for the Bank to make a contribution
to the country's economic development. Syria's relatively developed adminis-
trative structure, the Government's efforts to increase administrative effi-
ciency and absorptive capacity, adequate public investment allocation and in-
creasing interest in cooperating with the Bank Group have made it possible
for Syria to absorb in the last two years increasing amounts of Bank Group
financing. In line with the needs of the economy and the Govement's invest-
ment strategy, the Bank Group plans to focus its future lending on (i) irriga-
tion and rural development, to increase agricultural employment, production
and exports while reducing food imports and the dependency on weather fluctua-
tions; (ii) institution building in the public sector, by assisting water
supply, sewerage, transportation and power projects of high priority. A Bank
mission is in the field appraising a livestock project for FY76, focusing on
the establishment of a feed reserve for drought years and for animal require-
ments, which would benefit about 17,000 semi-nomadic families which are among
the poorest in the country. Other lending operations whose preparation is
under way are a second water supply project, a telecommunications project, a
tourism project and a sewerage project for the cities of Damascus, Homs and
Hama. Studies for the latter are financed from Credit 401 (Damascus Water
Supply Project).
PART III - ELECTRIC POWER IN SYRIA
16.       Growth of power supply has played a key role in the economic growth
of Syria in the sixties. The trend growth rate of sales for the period
1963-72 (i.e., excluding 1973 in view of war conditions) has been about 17.5
percent per year. Development has primarily been for industry. Per capita



-6-
energy consumption increased rapidly, from 76 kWh in 1960 to about 150 kWh in
1974. In spite of the progress made, however, public power supply has lagged
behind the demand, particularly in the industrial sector, resulting in the
proliferation of captive plants.
17.       Until the mid-sixties, the power sector was fragmented in a large
number of isolated power systems. The Government started a program of
rationalization and expansion by creating in 1965 a Government-owned entity,
Etablissement Public de l'Electricite, to consolidate and take over full res-
ponsibility for the entire electricity sector in Syria, as the successor to
former local and foreign companies (which were nationalized in 1951). Con-
siderable progress was made with the completion of a 230-kV transmission sys-
tem linking the large urban areas of Aleppo, llama, Homs and Damascus in 1968,
the Thawra dam in 1969, and Lebanon (at 66 kV) in 1972. Before the October
conflict, EPE owned only about 290 MW compared with the country's total in-
stalled capacity of about 780 MW.   The balance (490 MW) represented captive
plant capacity mainly in industry.   About 47 percent of the population, living
in about 3,000 villages with 2,000 inhabitants or less, has no access to
electricity. Further progress in interconnection and expansion of the power
system is required to meet the demand arising from continued industrial growth
and to increase the supply of electricity in rural areas.
18.       The Government's long-term strategy is based on the maximum use of
the hydroelectric potential of the Euphrates river, which accounts for al-
most 88 percent of Syria's water resources, and on the expansion of thermal
capacity employing indigenous fuel. The development of the Euphrates basin
is expected to add 800 MW to the capacity installed in the country and to
increase the country's irrigated land from the present 500,000 ha to about
1.2 million ha over a 40-50 year period. The first phase of the development
began in 1968, with financial assistance from the USSR, and comprises the
construction of a 60-m high earthfill dam at Thawra with a live storage capa-
city of about 7,400 million m3 and a power station with an installed capacity
of 8 x 100 MW, of which 3 units are already in operation and the 5 remaining
units are to be installed through 1979. The availability of power from Thawra
is estimated to reach a peak of 2,200 GWh in 1978 and gradually decline there-
after, to about 1,100 GWh in 1990, since an increasing share of the available
water will be used for irrigation. The possibilities of other hydro-power
developments are limited, and further power development will be predominantly
thermal, with oil as the main source of primary fuel.
19.       Since 1971, EPE has been implementing an expansion program financed
by the German Democratic Republic, to be completed substantially by 1975/76,
of 66 kV and lower voltage transmission facilities to interconnect towns and
villages and about 20 MW in new diesel plant. In early 1973, the Government
embarked on a crash program to install 160 MW in gas turbine capacity. During
the October 1973 conflict, a total capacity of 150 MW was damaged at the
Kattineh and llama thermal stations. The stations are being repaired and
Kattineh is expected to be in full operation again in 1976. At Hama, 2 (out
of 3) small units of about 5 MW will be written off; repair of the remaining



-7-
capacity of about 35 MW is expected to be completed in early 1977. The short-
term impact of the war on power supply has been severe, but not prolonged,
due to assistance from Lebanon, delivery of the gas turbines ordered before
the war, and delivery of 10 gas turbines (240 MW) donated by various Arab
states; already at the end of 1974, EPE's total effective capacity was about
415 MW, compared with a pre-war capacity of about 290 MW. With the addition
of 800 MW in Thawra, the expansion of captive plants, and other ongoing changes
in the system (including Bank projects) amounting to a net increase of about
720 MW total installed capacity in the country is expected to exceed 2,300 MW
by 1978. In addition, the Government intends to increase its rural electrifi-
cation program from about 40 villages in 1974 to 100 villages in 1975 and
maintain the program at that level until the end of the decade. Funds have
been included in the proposed loan for the execution of a study for a rural
electrification program. EPE expects to start a 10-year program to convert
the present 127/220-V distribution voltage in the major cities to 220/380 V.
The Government intends to curb the replacement and expansion of captive-plants
located near interconnected facilities. About 1,300 km of 230-kV lines will
be constructed to be financed out of an existing credit from the USSR, for
completion by 1977/78, and a dispatch system, financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund,
is to be completed in 1977. Discussions are under way for interconnecting
Syria's power system with those of neighboring countries and funds have been
included in the proposed loan to finance the necessary feasibility study.
Funds have also been included in the proposed loan to finance a study on over-
all long-term energy requirements of EPE's system, including industrial plants
presently connected, or to be connected with it.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Mehardeh Thermal Power
Project - Syria" (No. 707a-SYR dated May 30, 1975) is being distributed
separately. A loan and project summary is attached in Annex III. The project
was appraised in the field in November/December 1974. Negotiations for the
proposed loan were held in May 1975. The Syrian delegation was led by H.E.
Hany Sawaf, Minister of Electricity.
21.       The proposed project is an extension of the project financed under
Loan 986-SY of May 23, 1974, the start of which was slightly delayed because
of difficulties in the award of the equipment and construction contract, due
mainly to the high price of bids. The timing of the proposed project is in-
tended to allow EPE to exercise an option under the contracts for the first
project which will result in considerable savings, both in investment and
operating costs (para 28 below). The project forms 13 percent of EPE's $704
million 1974-1980 development program. The first and the second project to-
gether would constitute 27 percent of this program. The proposed project
consists of the second 150-MW stage of a thermal power station to be con-
structed at Mehardeh reservoir on the Orontes river; construction of six new
and expansion of two existing 230-kV substations, construction of a new head-
office building at Damascus; consulting and engineering services and training.
The second 150-MW unit is identical to the first unit financed under the first
Bank Loan. Most of the common facilities were provided for under the first



-8-
project except the 21-km oil pipeline between Hama and Mehardeh, which, to-
gether with unloading and transfer facilities at the dispatching site, would
be financed by the proposed loan. The required transmission lines to be fi-
nanced under an existing credit from the USSR, are to be in operation prior
to the completion of the Project.
22.       The proposed plant will be constructed about two kilometers north
of the town of Mehardeh. No problem with dust emission is expected. The
wind is predominantly easterly and a 125-m high chimney would assure diffu-
sion of particles. Sufficient space would be provided on the site to install
exhaust cleaning facilities if necessary in the future. Underground water
would be used instead of water from the Orontes for cooling and other purposes
during dry periods to assure that the requirements for irrigated areas fed
from the Orontes are met.
The Borrower
23.       During the relatively short period it has been in operation, EPE
has focused mostly on the technical problems of integrating and operating
numerous separate systems. Due to lack of experienced staff, the necessary
reorganization of EPE has not yet been achieved. In view of the rapid expan-
sion of its activity, the Company now plans to focus on improving its tech-
nical and administrative capacity. For this purpose, EPE has engaged con-
sultants to be financed under Loan 986-SY to prepare a study for the improve-
ment of its organization and operational and accounting methods, and will en-
gage consultants shortly for a study for the unification and modernization
of its tariff structure. The creation of a training school for technicians,
on the job and other training programs, are also provided for under the first
Loan, to improve EPE's management efficiency.
Project Execution
24.       W4ith the concurrence of the Bank, EPE has engaged the services of
SOFRELEC of France for the feasibility studies, design, preparation of bid
documents, evaluation of bids, supervision and administration of both the
first and second stage of the Mehardeh project. Work on the proposed Project
is expected to begin by mid-1975 and the Project completed by June 30, 1979.
Because EPE's installed capacity is expected to rise from about 700 MW in
1975 to about 1800 MW in 1980, EPE has agreed to employ consultants to be
financed under the proposed Loan, to prepare feasibility studies on (i) overall
long-term energy requirements; (ii) use of flare gas for power generation at
Souedie; (iii) interconnection with neighboring countries; and (iv) a rural
electrification project. The proposed Loan also includes $750,000 to comple-
ment the financing, provided for under Loan 986-SY, of the cost of the tech-
nician training school since bilateral assistance originally expected has not
been obtained.
Project Cost and Financing
25.       The estimated cost of the project excluding interest during con-
struction is US$89.4 million, including $72 million in foreign currency. The
overall cost of both stages of the Mehardeh power station, at about $460 per



-9-
kW, is substantially above original estimates but still reasonable. The pro-
posed Bank loan of $72 million would finance the estimated foreign cost com-
ponent of the project, equivalent to 81 percent of the total cost. Local
expenditure would be financed by EPE's internal resources and Government con-
tributions. The Government would supply EPE with funds to carry out the proj-
ect and EPE's authorized expansion program, whenever such funds are unavail-
able from other sources. (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02). EPE is expected
to provide 28 percent of the financing for its overall 1974-1980 investment
program from internal sources, after debt service payment and working capital
increase. The balance will be provided by net capital contributions by the
Government (about 36 percent), consumers' contributions (about 2 percent) and
long-term borrowing (about 34 percent).
Financial Performance
26.       EPE's net operating revenue increased from LS 20.4 million in 1972
to LS 22.4 in 1973; the rate of return on average net fixed assets in opera-
tion correspondingly rose from 8.4 to 9.2%. Although EPE's net operating
revenue for 1974 was severely affected by the 1973 war, its financial position
remains basically sound. Damage to steam generating stations required re-
strictions of power supply and this, with a larger assets base resulting from
increased prices and additional investments, will require a rate increase of
at least 33 percent by 1978, in order to meet the rate of return covenant of
the proposed Loan Agreement (Section 5.05) that is not less than 9 percent
from 1978. This increase will be gradually introduced when EPE's tariffs are
revised as a result of the tariff study to be carried out as part of the first
Mehardeh Project.   The Government has informed the Bank that all arrears from
Municipalities and other Government agencies would be settled within about one
year. These arrears represented debts unpaid as a result of disputes over the
valuation of assets taken over by EPE. EPE's debt service coverage is pro-
jected to be satisfactory, increasing from 1.4 in 1975 to about 4 from 1978
onwards. Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement provides that EPE would not incur
any medium- or long-term debt without the Bank's approval, unless its net
revenues cover debt service at least 1.5 times.
Economic Justification
27.       EPE's sales are expected to increase at about 20 percent p.a. on
the average through 1980. The share of sales to industry (including the
National Oil Company), which has shown little variation in the past 10 years,
would increase from 34 percent in 1963 to 74 percent by 1980 partly as a
result of the incorporation of captive plants in the interconnected system.
EPE's expansion program has been demonstrated by comparison with alternative
programs to be the least-cost solution for meeting Syria's incremental elec-
tricity needs through 1980, even after taking into account the higher cost
of equipment and somewhat lower sales than forecast during the first appraisal.
The rate of return on the Project is estimated at about 13.5 percent, assum-
ing an appropriate tariff increase.

Procurement
28.       Except for teaching equipment, costing about $750,000, which would
be supplied as recommended by Electricite de France, as part of its training
program, goods and services financed by the Bank have been or would be pro-
cured after international competitive bidding under the Bank's guidelines.
EPE intends to purchase the power station and the substations by exercising
an option obtained, in agreement with the Bank, from the bidders of identical
equipment procured for the first Mehardeh project after international competi-
tive bidding. EPE had initially requested a 16-month option which was sub-
sequently reduced to six months, with the Bank's concurrence, to permit a
reduction on the price charged to EPE for the second stage equipment by the
lowest bidder. The advanced contracting for the second project would result
in substantial savings and is also justified by a reduction of the high costs
of operation of EPE's gas turbines, which the new generating unit will replace.
Retroactive financing for downpayments for the power station and the substa-
tions and for engineering services will amount to about $6-7 million.
Disbursement
29.       The Bank would disburse 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the
steam station and substations, training equipment and consultants. The esti-
mated schedule of disbursement of the Bank's loan is in Annex III.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and EPE, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Ratification
of the agreements by the legislature is required under the laws of the Syrian
Arab Republic and, owing to the lengthy legislative process involved, a period
of six months has been allowed after the date of signature for the fulfillment
of the conditions of effectiveness. The draft agreements conform to the normal
pattern for loans for power projects. Features of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 25 and 26 of this
report.
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 298 - Second Highway Project; US$13.8 million Credit of April 17, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This project includes improvement and construction of 153 km of
roads, linking Damascus with the Lebanese and Jordanian borders, and improve-
ment of the road Tartous-Homs. It also includes feasibility studies and de-
tailed engineering for bypasses for the cities of Homs, Hama, Aleppo and
Deraa and the Aleppo-Tall Kojak road (about 470 km). No response was received
to invitations to submit bids for the Damascus-Jordanian border road in 1974,
and bidding will be repeated in 1975. Project construction started on the
other sections in early 1975. Consultants for the studies are expected to be
selected shortly.
Credit 401 - Damascus Water Supply Project; US$15 million Credit of June 22,
1973; Closing Date: December 31. 1978.
This project consisted of four main elements: (i) installation of
water mains to improve and expand the existing distribution system; (ii) con-
struction of a 15-km tunnel to improve the supply of water to the city; (iii)
pumping and storage facilities; and (iv) studies of pollution and sewerage
problems in Damascus, Homs and Hama. In May 1973, the total cost was appraised
at $32.5 million with a foreign exchange component of $17.8 million. The
lowest evaluated bid for the first phase of the distribution works was about
four times the appraisal estimate; the lowest bid for the tunnel was about
ten times. Because of these high bid prices and since the tunnel may no
longer be the least cost solution as compared with an overland pipeline or
a multi-purpose dam, the Credit Agreement was amended on May 12 to exclude
the source works, the main supply works and part of the distribution works
not included in the priority phase, the Bank has proposed to the Government
to consider financing them under a later loan after appraisal of possible
alternatives. The remaining parts of the project are urgently required to
increase the amount of water available to users by reducing distribution
losses, and the Credit amount is sufficient to cover their foreign cost. The
contract for the first phase of the distribution system has been awarded last
April and construction will start shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 469/Loan 975 - Balikh Irrigation Project; US$10 million Credit and
US$63 million Loan of April 6, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
The Project is the development of irrigated agriculture in an area
of 48,000 ha gross or 41,000 ha net in the Balikh River Basin, including the
resettlement of farmers that will be displaced by the filling of Lake Assad.
The project includes use of consultants' services for the preparation of a
master plan for the rehabilitation of agriculture in the Euphrates Valley
between the Halabie-Zelabie Gorge and Abou-Kemal at the Syria-Iraq border, for
the preparation of a feasibility study of a rehabilitation project covering
about 55,000 ha on the right bank of the river in the valley and for the pre-
paration of detailed designs and contract documents for the said area. The
Loan and Credit became effective on September 12, 1974. Bids received for a
first 10,000 ha stage are much higher than expected at the time of appraisal
in February, 1974.
Loan 986 - Mehardeh Power Project; US$25 million Loan of May 23, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This project consists of the first 150-MW unit of a new steam elec-
trical power station at Mehardeh; eight 230-kV substations, consultant ser-
vices and training. This project is co-financed by a US$33 million loan by
the Kuwait Fund, which includes a second portion of $15 million to cover the
considerable cost overrun of this project due to the increased level of world
prices. The Bank has amended this loan on April 29, 1975 to increase it by
$8.6 million in order to finance the foreign exchange cost of the increase in
capacity of the first power unit from 125 n4 to 150 MW. Progress has been
slow because the main contracts were awarded about 5 months late, due to dif-
ficulties in the evaluation of bids whose price was much higher than esti-
mated. Management consultants were appointed in March 1975, and consultants
for a tariff study are expected to be engaged before July 1975. This loan
became effective on February 28, 1975.
