WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
BORROWER:              Republic of Uganda
BENEFICIARIES:         National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) and
Water Development Department (WDD) of the Ministry of
Lands, Mineral, and Water Resources (MLMWR), the
Ministry of Health (MOR) and the city councils of
seven major towns through the Ministry of Local
Government (MLG).
AMOUNT:                SDR 26.9 (US$ 28.0) million equivalent.
TERMS:                 Standard.
RELENDING TERMS:       Of the proceeds of the credit, the Government would:
(a) (i) onlend US$10.8 million equivalent to NWSC
for 20 years, including four years of grace
at a variable interest rate; and
(ii) channel US$ 4.6 million equivalent as
equity to NWSC; and
(b) allocate:
(i) US$ 8.4 million equivalent to WDD;
(ii) US$ 0.4 million equivalent to the
Ministry of Health; and
(iii) US$ 3.8 million equivalent to the
Ministry of Local Government.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The proposed project is designed to assist the
Government in financing the rehabilitation of the
water supply and sanitation facilities of seven major
towns; and provide training and technical
assistance.
RISKS:                 The main risks facing project implementation are weak
organizations and the limited capacity of local con-
tractors. They have been addressed: by providing
technical assistance and designing procurement pack-
ages which would attract strong contractors for the
mechanical/electrical, and civil works; and by
retaining consultants for the supervision of con-
struction work. The remaining risk is the still
unsettled political and security situation in the
country. Under prevailing conditions, the project as
designed is feasible. A deterioration, however,
could have adverse effects on project implementation,
both in terms of cost and completion, and in a severe
case may require revisions of the project scope.

UGANDA
WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE DISPOSAL SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Uganda lies astride the Equator in East Africa.  It is bounded by
Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zaire and Sudan and has no direct access to the
Indian Ocean. It has a total area of approximately 240,000 km2, about 20%
of which is lalces and swamps. Most of Uganda is on a plateau varying
between 900 m and 1,300 m above sea level.
1.02      Uganda's altitude moderates the tropical climate; mean maximum
temperatures range from 20°C at night to 35°C during the day, and mean
minimum from 8°C to 23°C. Annual rainfall varies considerably within the
country. The northeast has an arid climate averaging of 500 am of rain
annually, while the south receives about 1,400 mm. There are normally two
dry spells per year, one from December to February, the other in June and
July.
1.03      The population in Uganda is predominantly rural.  The 1980 census
showed a total population of 12.6 million of which only about 1.1 million
(8.7%) resided in urban areas. At an estimated overall population growth
rate of 3% and an urban growth rate of 5%, the 1983 population is estimated
as follows:
Total population       13.8 million    100.O0
Urban population        1.3 million       9.5X
Rural population       12.5 million      90.5%
1.04      Uganda has a wealth of natural resources with favorable soils and
climatic conditions for agricultural production, a rich mineral base to
support the industrial sector and ample water for energy production.
However, the Ugandan economy was shaken by a series of internal and
external shocks: the emigration from the country of many of the most highly
skilled personnel after the military coup in 1971; the sharp rise in the
price of petroleum in 1973; the break-up of the East African Coimnunity in
1977; and the damage and looting which occurred during the 1978/79
war.
Water Resources
1.05      Uganda lies virtually within one major river basin, the
upper White Nile Basin, and is generally rich in surface water resources.
Only a small area (about 5% of the total area of the country) in the east
and north drains to Lake Turkana in Kenya. The minimum flow of the White
Nile at its out-flow from Lake Victoria is 680 m3/s. There are also six
major lakes in Uganda. In all, about 20% of the total area is covered with
bodies of water. Comprehensive river basin studies have not yet been
carried out. However, a survey was carried out for the catchments of Lake



-2-
Victoria, Lake Kyoga and Lake Mobutu Sese Seko (Lake Albert) from 1967 to
1981. The survey was a joint venture of Uganda and eight downstream
riparian countries (excluding Ethiopia) of the Nile River and was financed
by UNDP.
1.06      Since Uganda lies on a "basement complex" of pre-cambrian rocks
consisting of schists, marbles, granites, gneisses and quartzites, ground
water resources are generally poor. Groundwater occurs in limited yields
along fissures, cracks and joints of the granite-gneiss formations.
Springs are common in some parts of the country, i.e., south in the Kabale
area, west along the slopes of Rwenzori, and east along the slopes of Mount
Elgon. Low yield boreholes, protected springs and shallow wells provided
with hand pumps (drilled or dug wells, sometimes with swamp-side
filtration) are believed to be suitable for wide application in water
supply of small rural communities.
Sector Organization
1.07      The Ministry of Land, Minerals and Water Resources (MLMWR) has
the sole responsibility for water resources management and development as
well as operation and maintenance of water supply and sewerage systems in
Uganda. The Water Development Department (WDD) of MLMWR carries out this
responsibility in urban water supply and sewerage and in rural water
supply. In 1972, with Bank/WHO/UNDP assistance, a parastatal body, the
National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) was established to gradually
take over all urban water supply and sewerage operations on a
self-sustaining basis. It initially took over operations of Kampala and
Jinja and, also, in 1973, the system of Entebbe. After this, no other
systems have been added to the three urban centers that NWSC currently
operates. The present intention of MLMWR is that NWSC should take over the
remaining towns as soon as WDD has rehabilitated the systems and NWSC has
been strengthened.
1.08      Until recently, protection of springs and wells in rural areas
was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health (HOH). This was
transferred to WDD in 1982. Sanitation is, in general, monitored by MOH.
To this effect, it is responsible for ensuring proper control of effluent
qualities of urban sewerage systems ana developing sanitation of rural
areas as well as, in collaboration with town councils, improving low cost
sanitation in unsewered urban areas. MOH is also responsible for
initiating and delivering health education in the country.
1.09      City municipal, and town councils, which are under the Ministry
of Local Government (MLG), are responsible for refuse collection and
disposal. Within the city and town councils, the Public Health Department
is in charge of these services. The MLG has a supervisory function,
advises on standardization of equipment in order to facilitate operation,
spare part supply and training, and has to approve the purchase of
equipment.



-3-
Levels of Service
1.10      Urban Water Supply: There are altogether 56 towns in Uganda (with
population over 2,000) out of which 11 have a population over 15,000.
Thirty-three towns have central water supply systems. NWSC operates the
systems in Kampala, Jinja and Encebbe and WDD in some 30 urban centers.
Due to their poor state of repair and need for rehabilitation, the existing
schemes serve at present only about 40% of the total urban population. The
averge water consumption of the served population is estimated to be in the
order of 75 lcd. This indicates shortage in water supply.
1.11      Rural water supplies consist of boreholes equipped with
handpumps, protected springs and small dams and valley tanks. Uganda used
to have an extensive network of boreholes, over 5,000 in total and some 950
dams and valley tanks. Over the last decade, as very little maintenance
work was done, boreholes became largely inoperative and some surface
reservoirs silted up. Mainly with UNICEF assistance which began in 1981,
WDD has been able to restore these supply systems and today about 60Z of
the boreholes are again in operation. UNICEF has also belped WDD to
construct new shallow wells equipped with hand pumps as well as protecting
some 200 springs. It is estimated that there are well over 5,000 springs
in Uganda which could be successfully protected to be used as water supply
points or water source for small scale gravity systems. Population
coverage in rural water supply is estimated to be in the order of 7 to
8%. Walking distances to improved water sources are in the range of 0.5 km
up to 10 km which results in people using polluted sources whenever there
is such a source nearer than the improved source.
1.12      Sewerage/Sanitation: Out of the 56 towns, some 13 have sewer
systems although most of :hem are not in full operation today. Eleven of
these 13 towns have populations over 15,000 and 2 are smaller towns, namely
Iganga and Lira. It is estimated that only some 20% of the total urban
population in these 13 towns would be served even if these systems were
rehabilitated to operate at their design capacity. Taking into account
properly constructed and maintained alternative methods of excreta
disposal, mainly septic tanks, it is estimated that some 30% of Uganda's
total urban population has appropriate sewerage/sanitation service. The
use of pit latrines is rather common in Uganda as building regulations
traditionally require construction of appropriate excreta disposal
facilities at each individual house. In general, however, the standard of
latrines and other facilities needs to be improved. In rural areas the
main method of excreta disposal is pit latrines although it is not as
common as in urban areas to have a latrine in the household. Distribution
of pit latrines greatly varies from area to area. However, generally
latrine facilities have deteriorated due to neglect and conditions in the
past decade. There is no proper statistical material available of actual
sanitation coverage but it is estimated that some 10% of the rural
population have adequate sanitation facilities.
1.13      Solid Waste Disposal: Before 1972 all major Uganda towns had a
well organized refuse collection and disposal system. In Kampala and Jinja



-4-
refuse was collected from dustbins by compacting refuse trucks. In all
cases refuse was disposed of on land.ill sites. Today only a fraction of
the 1972 refuse equipment is available, services are not regular and cover
only the central areas of town. Refuse is therefore disposed of anywhere,
in streets, backyards, vacant plots and sanitary lanes or people bury or
burn it. Besides flies and rats, refuse heaps also atLract domestic
animals. Due to the exodus of the Asian community from the towns there was
also a significant change in the nature and quantity of refuse from a "dry"
and less bulky to a "wet" (vegetable and fruit) and more bulky type which
decomposes very quickly and would need to be collected more frequently.
Cost Recovery
1.14      There is no clearly set government policy on recovering
investment and operating costs from the consumers of water supply and
sanitation services provided by WDD. The draft Decade Action Plan for
Uganda provides little guidance in this regard, as it suggests that "the
actual charges to be levied should not be based solely on the recovery of
investment, operation and maintenance costs but need to be broadly based on
social benefit/cost consideration." In other words, a right balance
between financial and social/health consideration should be found when
pricing the water/sanitation services. In practice, rural services are
provided free of charge and public standpipes in urban areas were decreed
free of charge since the early 1970s. Most of the urban supplies run by
the WDD rely on government support (subsidies) to meet their operation and
maintenance costs. NWSC which presently is responsible for three urban
centers (Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja) is required by its founding law,
(section 14(1)) to ensure that its revenues provide adequately for the
overall cost of operation and maintenance of its services as well as for
depreciation, debt service and a reasonable return on investment, but,
because of low tariffs and poor collections, has also had to rely on
government subsidies to cover its operation and maintenance costs. For
refuse collection, government policy is full cost recovery by local
authorities, but in practice block grants provide from 60-85Z of operating
expenditures.
Sector Objectives
1.15      The Government endorses the goals of the International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade and is giving high priority to the water
sector. The Government has put together a recovery program, which was
recently updated and published in October 1983. This Revised Recovery
Program (RRP) maps out a coherent short-term development strategy,
embracing macro-economic and sectoral policies as well as individual
projects. The basic objective is to revive the productive sectors through
rehabilitation and improved utilization of existing capacity. For the
water supply and sewerage sector, the basic objective is to restore the
basic services through rehabilitation of existing water supply and sewerage
facilities. The investment program for the sector is shown in Annex 1.
With the assistance of UNDP and the Bank Group, an updated water sector
study/action plan will be produced in 1984 using various previous studies



-5-
prepared by WHO, SIDA and UNICEF. This study will help the Government to
improve its planning capabilities in the water sector. Considering the
enormous backlog in services (paragraphs 1.10 to 1.13), the weak
institutions and poor implementation capacity, high degrees of service
coverage by the end of the decade will be difficult to reach. The proposed
project, which is focusing on rehabilitation of existing facilities of
water supply, sewerage and refuse disposal in seven major towns of Uganda
will be of great importance and has high priority within the sector
objectives.
Sector Development
1.16      With the present ongoing and proposed projects of the Bank, EEC,
ADB, IDB, the Federal Republic of Germany and France almost all major
existing urban water supply schemes in Uganda will be rehabilitated by
about 1987/88 and the respective organizations strengthened by the
provision of technical assistance, improvement of billing and collection
and introducing appropriate water tariffs.
1.17      UNICEF is active in rural water supply programs up to 1986. The
program is mainly focusing on rehabilitation and it is estimated that it
will benefit the following incremental rural populations:
(a)   rehabilitation of boreholes               1.00 million
(b)   spring and shallow well program           0.35 million
(c)   new borehole drilling                     0.15 million
1.50 million
It is estimated that this would raise the coverage in service in rural
areas from about 7 to 15 X.
1.18     At the same time the urban water supply systems will be improved,
the existing sewerage systems will be rehabilitated under the proposed Bank
Group and ADB projects. Major extensions of the sewerage systems ln the
near future are not anticipated because of their costs. The proposed Bank
Group project will also provide septic tank emptiers for all urban centers
in order to restore previous standards. No major external or internal
programs are at present in the pipeline to improve/construct pit latrines.
The low cost sanitation demonstration and health education component of the
proposed Bank project would assist in developing future Investment
programs.
Sector Constraints
1.19      The major constraints to the improvement and expansion of the
water supply and sanitation services are: (i) the scarcity of local
currency resources; (ii) staffing problems due to a shortage of qualified
and experienced engineers and administrative staff and to extremely low
salary levels which provide little lcentLve to existing staff; (iii)
inadequate local construction capacity and output of building materlals;
and (iv) weak institutions in the sector.



-6-
1.20     Relieving these constraints will take considerable time and
effort, especially staffing and institutional problems. Restoring the loss
of qualified manpower which has taken place over the past ten years, and
developing the additional trained manpower required for planned sector
expansion, will inevitably take years to accomplish. The comprehensive
sector manpower and training study funded under Engineering Credit lllO-UG
provides a detailed breakdown of current and future manpower requirements
by specific job categories, and recommends an action plan to recruit and
train the required staff over the remainder of the decade. The proposed
project will begin to address the sector manpower constraint by financing a
substantial training component, the main elements of which are described at
Annex 12.
Sector Legislation
1.21      Existing legislation for the water sector is fragmentary.
Several pieces of legislation deal with various aspects of water use.
Principal among these are the Water Works Act (Cap. 137), (the Water Boards
Act (Cap. 138) has been repealed, the Mining Act (Cap. 248), the Public
Health Lct (Cap. 269) and legislation concerning the principal project
executing agency, the National Water and Sewerage Corporation Decree (No.
34 of 1972).
1.22      The Water Works Act regulates the supply of water to the public
and subsidiary legislation under it provides for the supply of water to all
the major towns in Uganda, including the towns whose water supply works are
to be rehabilitated under the Project. Under this law, the Minister
responsible for water resources may designate water authorities to
construct and take over water works required or provided for the supply of
water to a designated area. The power of levying rates is vested in the
linister under the Act except that such power is now exercised by the
National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). This Act is limited
in that it covers only the supply of water; it does not deal with the
control and management of water resources generally in Uganda.
1.23      With the repeal of the Water Boards Act, the NWSC was created
with the main function of developing and operating "in any specified area
of Uganda, water and sewerage services on a national and self-supporting
basis. NWSC has a Board of Directors, comprising public figures and
representatives from various governmental organizations, and a Managing
Director who is appointed by the Minister. Although as is usually the case
for parastatal organizations, the Minister may give directions of a general
nature to the Corporation, Section 14 provides that the corporation 'shall
cause its functions to be carried out so as to ensure that its revenues
provide adequately for the overall cost of operation and maintenance of its
services, and for depreciation, amortization, interest and a reasonable
return on investment. In addition to this provision, NWSC is given the
power (with prior approval of the Minister) to fix, impose and collect
rates, charges and fees for water and sewerage services and to regulate the
remuneration and conditions of service of officers and employees of the



-7-
Corporation. The NWSC Act also provides that NWSC may, with the prior
approval of the Minister responsible for finance, borrow money from
domestic and foreign sources for the purposes of its operations and it is
fully authorized to enter into contracts.
1.24      Other legislation dealing with the water sector includes the
Public Health Act which provides in part for the public health standards
applicable to sewerage and drainage and the Mining Act which provides for
the regulation of the use of water in mining operations.
1.25      In order to assist the Government In the formulation of its Water
Sanitation Decade Plan, the Government requested the World Health
Organization (WHO) to prepare the basic format works for such plan. In
connection with this plan and In view of the fragmentary nature of the
legislation in this sector, a consultant was employed under WHO's auspices
to review the existing legislation and to recomn-nd and draft appropriate
legislation. The first volume of the consultant's work has been reviewed
by the Bank and the second volune will be reviewed to ensure that the
recommendations of the report are appropriate for the sector. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that the Government would
make available to the Association for its review and comment the
recommendations it proposes to implement and the legislative changes to be
introduced prior to their promulgation.
1.26      Notwithstanding the above statements, existing legislation for
the water sector in Uganda is adequate for the purposes of the project,
particularly as it relates to the role of NWSC. The recommendations which
would be implemented in accordance with para. 1.25 above sbould enable the
role of various sector institutions to be clarified and should consolidate
all relevant legislation.
The Bank Group's Role
1.27      Other than the Water Supply Engineering Project (CR lllO-UG), the
proposed project would be the first Bank Group activity in the Uganda Water
Supply and Sanitation Sector. The Bank Group current lending strategy
places emphasis on fast-disbursing assistance to finance the import
requirements for economic development and rehabilitation. In the water
supply and sanitation sector, the Bank aims to assist the Government in the
rehabilitation of existing urban water and sewerage facilties and improve
the operating efficiency of the principal sector institutions, NWSC and
WDD. After this rehabilitation phase the Government will immediately need
further assistance in extending the existing facilities in order to service
a much higher percentage of the rapidly growing urban population.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location-Special Features
2.01      The project areas (Map IBRD No. 17806) comprise 7 major towns
including Kampala, the capital of Uganda, Jinja, Ehtebbe, Masaka, Mbarara,
Tororo and Mbale. While Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe draw their raw water
from Lake Victoria which is of good quality, the-other four towns depend on
river water which requires extensive treatment. The seven towns have a
combined population of about one million, that is about 75% of the total
urban population of Uganda.
Existing Water Supply and Waste Disposal Systems
2.02      All project towns have central water supply systems consisting of
conventional water treatment works, reservoirs and distribution network.
Supply is either through house connection, private or public standpipe.
The water consumption is not metered at present; existing water meters are
either out of order or are not read. Water from Lake Victoria (Kampala,
Jinja and Entebbe) is usually treated in rapid gravity filters and
chlorinated while river water (Masaka, Mbarara, Tororo and Mbale) is
additionally pretreated by aluminum sulphate and sedimentation. All these
water supply systems have been badly neglected in the past 10 years and
necessary replacement has not taken place. As a result, all existing
systems are operated below their desiga capacity. Water losses in the
distribution systems are high (25% to 40%) and water is wasted due to
absence of water metering and too low tariffs. The unserved population
obtains its supplies from usually unprotected sources (wells, rivers,
lakes). The indivudual water supply facilities of the project towns and
their deficiencies are described in detail in Annex 2.
2.03      Sanitary sewage schemes with central sewage treatment works have
been developed in all seven project towns between the 1940s and
Independence, covering predominantly the commercial town centers, the
industrial areas (Kampala, Jinja, Mbale) and some residential areas.
During the past decade, however, operation and maintenance of all existing
sewerage facilities has been neglected. Sewers are blocked, mechanical and
electrical components of pumping stations and sewage treatment works are
out of operation. The local authorities lack adequate equipment, funds and
trained staff to operate the schemes satisfactorily. As a result raw
sewage overflows from sewers and by-passes treatment works, finally
polluting water oDurses and creating health hazards. Many septic tanks
have not been emptied for years and are often overflowing. The individual
sewerage facilities are described in detail in Annex 2.
2.04      Pit latrines are very common in urban centers.  In general there
is capable public health personnel in MOH as well as in the Town Councils



-9-
(Public Health Department) for supervising and organizing latrine
construction programs. However due to lack of funds and materials,
r'-isting pit latrines are generally of poor standard or are only temporary
structures.
2.05      More than ten years ago all seven project towns had functioning
solid waste collection and disposal systems. Most of them used collecting
vehicles of the compacting type. Over the years, most of the equipment
fell into a state of complete disrepair; replacements did not take place.
Today only a fraction of the previous equipment is available and there is a
serious lack of spare parts.  In additio.l the composition of the waste has
changed from light and bulky to more dense and higber moisture content
(vegetables, fruits). At present only three compacting trucks are in use
in Kampala, Jinja, !bale and the waste collecting system is running on a
very small scale.  Kampala uses skips (5.5 m3) and containers (15 m3) in
the inner town and at some markets. The other towns use open trucks which
are also used for other activities of the city council. All the towns have
small landfill sites and they are not operated as sanitary landfills. The
existing facilities are described in detail in Annex 2.
Population Served and Standards of Service
2.06      The table below summarizes the data on population served in 1983

2.08      Refuse collection is limited at present to the central town areas
and market places. It is estimated that at present (1983) only 38% of the
total urban population is served. The service is not regular. People have
to carry the refuse to containers or central refuse dumps from where it is
removed by skip loaders or loaded onto trucks.
Population Projections and Water Supply Demand
2.09      Given the present economic conditions in the country, estimating
the future urban population growth trends is difficult. Based on the 1980
census and population growth studies carried out by the Town and Regional
Planning Department of the Government and available previous studies, the
population has been projected as follows:



-1l-
--Population in 000's-    Projected
Town      1980   1983   1986   1990   Annual Increase
Kampala    500    686    792    962           5%
Jinja       95    119    141    172   7.2% in 1983/1984
thereafter 5%

thereafter 5%
Masaka      32      35     38      46   2.6% up to 1985

Tororo      25      27     30      36
Mbale       31      34     37      45
733    955  1,095  1,335
2.10      The future water demands of the seven towns are contained in
Annex 3. The demand projections are based upon unit water demands for
house connections, private standpipes (one tap in front of the house) and
public standpipe users, projected served population and demands by
industrial, commercial and institutional water consumers. Average
projected domestic unit water demands for the project towns are:
Public standpipe users       20 1/cd
Private standpipe users      80 1/cd
House connections           180 1/cd
These consumption levels have been estimated by the consultants and found
satisfactory by the Bank Group. Losses are estimated at 25% to 35% of the
total production. It is assumed that these losses will be reduced by 5-10%
in 1988 by the proposed leak detection works. Such works can only be
carried out after the water pressure in the network has been restored.
That means that in many parts oE the distribution system leak detection
will only be possible after the rehabilitation of the water works. The
tables in Annex 3 demonstrate very clearly not only the present emergency
situation for water supply and the urgency of a second project which would
focus on extension of the water supply systems. This second project should
start immediately after this rehabilitation project and not later than
1986/87 in order to eliminate the water shortage and to serve a larger
portion of the population.
III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      Shortly after the war in 1979, the Government invited the Bank
Group to help reactivate a project initially examined in 1970 to expand the
water supply and sewerage systems in Kampala and Jinja. When the status of
the earlier work was reviewed, it was concluded that the available



-12-
information should be updated and additional work be undertaken to cover
other priority towns as the Government had requested. Recognizing the
Government's manpower constraints, the engineering project was proposed and
approved in March 1981 (CR lllO-UG). It assisted the Government with the
preparation of master plan updates, feasibility and preliminary engineering
studies for the rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply and
sanitation (sewerage, low cost sanitation and solid waste disposal)
facilities of seven major towns, Kampala, Jinja, Entebbe, Mbarara, Hasaka,
kbale and Tororo. At that time, Arua could not be included in the project
because of the security situation in the far northeast West Nile province.
Through the engineering credit the preparation of the water supply and
sanitation rehabilitation project has been advanced so that appraisal could
take place in October/November 1983.
Project ObJectives
3.02      The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to alleviate the existing emergency situation in the seven
major towns through rehabilitation of existing water supply
and sewerage facilities and of refuse collection and
disposal;
(b) to demonstrate the benefits of low-cost sanitation tbrough
the introduction of a pilot scheme, combined with a health
education program; and
(c) to strengthen the two water sector agencies, NWSC and WDD,
with the main emphasis on NWSC in light of the Government's
commitment to expand its role through provision of technical
assistance and training.
The focus of the proposed project is on rehabilitation. Refuse collection
would remain the responsibility of local councils. Inclusion of this
project component is considered important for reasons of public health.
The level of proposed IDA financing (para. 3.07) and the desiga of
procurement packages reflects the Government's limited ability to
contribute to the project and the serious shortage of contracting capacity
in the country. Highly unattractive employment conditions make it
difficult for NWSC and WDD to attract and retain qualified staff, and thus
the rehabilitation of these two organizations, including their finance and
accounting functions, will take several years, even with technical
assistance and training.
Project Description
3.03      The project would cover seven towns in Uganda (Kampala, Jinja,
Entebbe, Masaka, Mbarara, Tororo and Mbale) and would comprise:
(a)   the rehabilitation of existing water and sewage treatment
works;



-13--
(b)   the replacement of corroded water mains, reservoirs, and the
construction of oxidation ponds;
(c)   the supply of the most urgently required equipment for
refuse collection and disposal, and for septic tank
emptying;
(d)   a pilot latrine construction and public latrine
rehabilitation program and a health education component; and
(e)   the implementation of a training program and the provision
of technical assistance and consultancy services for
supervision and engineering designs for a follow-up project.
A detailed description of the project components is given in Annex 4.
Coordination With Activities of Other Donors
3.04      Activities of other donors in this sector have been fully taken
into ace-ount in the preparation of the project. The European Economic
Commluity (EEC) is rehabilitatingthe Kampala waterworks, financing the
laying of water mains and installation of pumps (pipes and pumps have been
supplied by the Islamic Development Bank), and providing technical
assistance to NWSC (one technical advisor to the managing director, one
finance manager, one workshop trainer and a mobile workshop). Within the
framework of the project, the Federal Republic of Germany (executing agency
GtZ) is providing the following technical assistance to NWSC: One
waterworks superintendent, based in Kampala but responsible for operation
and maintenance and training on the job in all seven project towns, one
sewerage works superintendent with same responsibilities, one low cost
sanitation engineer based in Kampala in the Ministry of Health or Local
Government and one low cost water supply engineer based in the headquarters
of WDD in Entebbe as advisor to the Commissioner. It will also provide
spare parts, pipe material and workshop equipment. The African Development
Bank (ADB) is financing the completion of the sewer/oxidation pond system
in Mbarara. The total value of the above activities of other donors
amounts to US$16.5 million (parallel financing).
Cost Estimates
3.05      The total project cost is estimated at US$30.8 million excluding
taxes and duties. Approximately 74% or US$22.7 million would be foreign
costs.  A summary of the cost estimate is given on the following page; a
detailed cost breakdown is given in Annex 5.
3.06      The base cost estimates are expressed in January 1984 prices and
are based on revised and updated data of preliminary design reports
prepared by the consultants. Physical contingencies have been taken as 20X
of the base cost for rehabilitation works and 10% for supply of material
and all other project components.   Foreign price contingencies have been
assumed at 3.5% in 1984, 8% in 1985 and 9% thereafter. Local price

contingencies have been assumed at 201 in 1984, 10 in 1985, 81 in 1986 and
6% thereafter. Goods and services imported for the project will be free of
duties and taxes. In the program for project expenditure (Annex 6) the
following project implementation schedule has been assumed:

Project Financing
3.07      Considering the great importance of the project for the recovery
of the country, the high priority given to it by the Government, and the
fact that the nature of the project (rehabilitation) requires quick
implementation, that foreign contractors will need to be involved in nmst
of the works, and the acute shortage of local funds, it is proposed that
the Bank Group finance about 90% of the total cost. The proposed project
financing, net of taxes (averaging 12%), would then be as follows:
Sources of Funds              US$ Million    X
IDA Credit                        28.00       90.8

Total                       30.83       100
1/   Participation by other donors is possible, e.g., by EEC, UNDP and ODA
in financing parts of the training component of the project. No firm
comuitments are available at present.



-16-
The IDA Credit would finance 10OZ of the foreign cost (US$22.7 million) and
65% of the local cost (US$5.3 million equivalent). Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Government would provide the balance
of the project costs in accordance with the program of project expenditure
as shown in Annex 6 and that the Government would apply the "Window 2" rate
(UShs300=US$1 at present) for all transactions of Bank Group funds (US$)
into UShs for payments made in local currency.
Project Implementation
3.08      The following agencies would be responsible for the
implementation of the project:
(a)  The Water Development Department (WDD) of the Ministry of
Lands, Mineral and Water Resources (MLMWR) which is
responsible for national water resources, and the
development, operation and maintenance of all water supply
and sewerage systems.
(b)  The National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), an
autonomous parastatal organization. At present NWSC operates
only the systems at Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe.
(c)  The Ministry of Health, for implementing the health education
component. The Ministry has fully endorsed this project
component and is adequately staffed to mDnitor the
implementation.
(d) For the refuse collection component, the local councils
concerned, under the supervision of the Ministry of Local
Government. A refuse expert of the Project Coordination Unit
(provided through this project) will ensure the successful
implementation.
3.09      The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which was established
under the engineering project and reports directly to the MLMWR would be
responsible for the coordination between the various agencies and for the
total project accounting. In order to perform this job the PCU will be
reinforced by technical assistance (financed under the Engineering Credit
1110-UG). The PCU would prepare quarterly "Project Progress Reports' and,
after completion of the project, a "Project Completion Report' on the basis
of Bank guidelines.
3.10     MILMWR, with IDA approval, will retain the consultants H.P. Gauff
KG and Parkman Ltd. (who are responsible for preparation of detailed
engineering and tender documents under the engineering project, CR 1110-UG)
for supervision of construction. Gauff will remain responsible for the
projects in Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe and Parkman for Masaka, Mbarara,
Tororo and Mbale.
3.11      According to the project implementation schedule (Annex 7)
tender documents would be issued in June 1984. The General Procurement



-17-
Notice was published on Jan. 16, 1984. Pre-qualification documents from
contractors have been sumitted on iMarch 16, 1984. All major contracts
would be awarded by October 1984. Construction of the project would be
substantially completed by July 1988. Closing date for the credit would be
September 30, 1989. The acute need for the services requires quick project
implementation and a construction time of only four years has been
allowed. Appropriate measures. are built into the various contracts and
project management procedures to ensure that this relatively quick
implementation program will succeed. Financing (para. 3.07) and
procurement packages (para. 3.12) have been designed to reach the target.
Procurement
3.12       Since quick implementation of the project is essential and
since appropriate local contracting capacity is not available, procurement
packages have been prepared which are attractive to large international
contractors (who may subcontract part of their work to small local
contractors) and stringent prequalification procedures will be applied.
Strong Government support, technical assistance, and stringent supervision
are expected to ensure smooth project implementation.
3.13    Contracts would be grouped as follows:
(a) To be procured under ICB:
(i) Contract IA and 1B 2/ (Mechanical & Electrical Works):
Comprising all mechanical and electrical work (supply of
plant and materials and installation) for water works, sewage
treatment plants, and water and sewage pumping stations
rehabilitation/extensions. The contracts would include the
preparation of detailed installation drawings and a six-weeks
training of local staff in operation and maintenance after
completion of the works. Contracts 1A and lB would be
awarded separately or to one contractor--estimated total cost
is US$6.4 million.
(ii) Contract 2A and 2B (Civil Works):  Comprising all civil works
(including supply of all required materials) for replacing
water and sewer mains, rehabilitation/construction of
sewage oxidation ponds, construction of concrete reservoirs,
relining of existing steel water pipes, repair/construction
of public latrines and minor building works required under
contracts IA and IB-the estimated total cost is US$9.7
2/   'A' would be for Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe, under NWSC, with
consultancy services provided by Gauff. 'B' would be for Masaka,
Mbarara, Tororo and Mbale, under WDD, with corsultancy services by
Parkman.

million. The coordination between civil and mechanical works
contractors will be specified in the tender documents.
(iii) Contract 3 (Supply Contract Package for All Tbwns):
Comprising the supply of refuse disposal vehicles and
equipment, septic tank emptiers, sewer maintenance equipment
and spare parts, supply of vehicles and of one mobile
workship. The contract will include training of local staff
by the supplier in the use of the equipment-the estimated
total cost is US$6.0 million;
(b)   To be procured under LCB or limited ICB:  Local competitive
Bidding (LCB) would apply to the following contracts
estimated total cost US$2.4 million representing about 8X of
total project cost:
(i) construction of houses and offices (designed and
supervised by local architect);
(ii)   supply of material for low cost sanitation;
(iii)   supply of office material, material for health education
and training;
(iv)   supply of furniture for houses and offices, supply of
chemicals, bicycles and motor cycles and supply of leak
detection equipment; and
(c)   "Other" procurement arrangements would be made for parts of
the low cost sanitation component, for technical assistance,
for consultancy services and for overseas training. The
estimated total cost is US$6.10 million.
(i) Construction of pit latrines (low-cost sanitation)
will either be by force account of local authorities
--town councils -or by small contractors.
(ii)   Technical assistance will be part of a package
presented by the Federal Republic of Germany
(executing agency GtZ).
(iii)   Consultancy services for supervision and final design
for a follow-up project will be provided by the
consultants (Gauff, Parkman) which have prepared the
engineering designs and tender documents for the
project. The estimated cost is US$2.7 million.



-19-
All bidding documents for contracts awarded under ICB will be reviewed by
IDA prior to issue. Minor contracts to be awarded under LCB will be
reviewed on a selective basis after award. The total value of contracts to
be awarded is estimated at:
(a) ICB US$22.3 million;
(b) LCB US$2.4 million; and
(c) "Other" US$6.10 million.
3.14    Procurement arrangements, cost of packages and source of finance
are summarized in Annex 8. Lo4.al bidding procedures were examined durlng
appraisal and are acceptable to IDA (the appropriate documents are
available on file).
3.15      All bidding packages for goods estimated to cost over US$150,000
equivalent and bidding packages for works over US$500,000 equivalent would
be subject to IDA's prior review of procurement documentation resulting In
a coverage of about 90% of the total estimated value of contracts for goods
and 95% of all works contracts. The balance of contracts would be subject
to random review by IDA after contract award.
3.16      Disbursements for works carried out by force account would be
made against Statements of Expenditures (SOE), the documentation for which
would not be submitted for review but would be made available for
inspection by IDA during the course of supervision mlssion.
3.17      Preference for domestic manufacturers and contractors may be
granted by the borrower but will only apply for minor works and supplies
(Annex 8). Qualifying domestic manufacturers would receive a preference in
bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty whichever Is lower. For civil
works, qualifying domestic contractors would receive a preference in bid
evaluation of 71%.

international Water Rights Issues
3.20      Water for three towns included in the project, Kampala, Entebbe
and Jinja, is drawn from Lake Victoria which is part of the Nile River
system. Prior to 1959, the utilization of Nile River waters was governed
by agreements or exchange of letters between the United Kingdom (acting on
behalf of several of its colonies) and Egypt. However, since that year,
the validity of these agreements has been questioned by several of the
riparian states and there do not appear to be international agreements
binding on all riparians which cover the use of such waters.
Nevertheless, the Governient of Uganda has informed all down-stream
riparians of the proposed project. They voiced no objection.
3.21      Water for the town of Tororo has been drawn since 1948 from the
River Nalaba which forms part of the boundary between Kenya and Uganda.
The Government of Uganda sought and received the Government of Kenya's
agreement to an increased abstraction of water from the river for the water
supply of the town of Tororo.
Health and Environmental Aspects
3.22      By rehabilitating the existing water supply facilities in the
seven major towns of Uganda the project is expected to reduce the incidence
and risk of diseases attributable to lack of safe and adequate water. The
increase in water supplies will lead to an increase in waste water. Since
the existing sewerage systems are not funetioning well or at all, the
project will also include the rehabilitation of these facilities. The
financing of urgently required septic tank emptiers and refuse disposal
equipment for all seven towns will also contribute considerably to reduce
present health risks.
3.23      The project is also focusing on the improvement of health
education especially in connection with the construction and use of low
cost sanitation facilities (pit latrines). An outline of the proposed
health education component of the project with its objectives, proposed
strategies, action, evaluation and monitoring mechanisms is given in
Anney. 10.
Manpower and Training
3.24      Uncompetitive employment conditions will continue, possibly for
some years, making it difficult for iIWSC and WDD to attract, motivate and
retain qualified staff. Technical assistance and training by themselves
will not remove this constraint to the institutional development of the two
sector agencies. Despite this the project will begin to establish sector
training capability while at the same time ensuring that training needs
related directly to the project are met.



-22-
3.25      The training program will focus on the training of:
(a) existing and new staff to manage, operate and maintain the
water supply and sewerage facilties to be rehabilitated;
(b) accounts and revenue collection staff at headquarters and
branch offices;
(c) leakage detection and control staff; and
(d) a cadre of counterpart training staff as the nucleus on
which to build and expand the training program tbrough
possible future project(s).
Land Acquisition
3.26      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NLMWR has
acquired the land necessary for the construction of waste stabilization
ponds in Mbale and Jinja and for the construction of four houses in
Kampala.
IV. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
Lending Arrangements
4.01      The Borrower would be the Government of Uganda. About USh
3,241.8 million (US$10.8 million) of the Credit would be onlent to NWSC for
20 years, including 4 years of grace, at a variable interest rate, to be
adjusted annually, equal to the minimum rate established by the Government
for commercial bank loans plus 3%. The onlending rate has been assumed at
17% for the first three years and, in light of the expected decline in the
rate of inflation, at 10% thereafter. About USh 1,389.0 million (US$4.6
million) would be passed to NWSC as government equity. USh 2,530.2 million
(US$8.4 million) would be allocated to WDD, while the balance would be
allocated to the Ministry of Health for implementing the health education
component, and to the local councils for implementing the refuse collection
component under the supervision of the Ministry of Local Government.
Completion of the subsidiary loan agreement between Government and NWSC
would be required as a condition of effectiveness.
Organization and Management
4.02      NWSC and WDD would have prime responsibility for implementation
of the physical components of the project (paras. 3.03-3.10).
4.03      NWSC, an autonomous parastatal reporting to NLMWR, was
established in 1972 to develop and operate water supply and sewerage
systems in any area specified by MLMWR. The Minister of MLMWR has direct



-23-
responsibility for overseeing the activities of NWSC, which is headed by a
Board of Directors comprising public figures and Government
representatives. Day-to-day control over NWSC's activities rests with the
Managing Director and his Deputy. NWSC is organized into three functional
departments at headquarters in Kampala: Engineering, Finance and Accounts,
and Personnel and Administration. These departments are headed
respectively by the Chief Engineer, the Chief Accountant 3/ and the
Corporation Secretary, all reporting to the Managing Director through his
Deputy. The two field branches, Kampala/Entebbe and Jinja, each have three
sections corresponding to the departments at headquarters. An organization
chart of NWSC is shown as Annex 11. The present Managing Director is well
qualified and conscientious. The Chief Accountant is qualified and the
Finance Manager and other professional staff being provided by the EEC and
Germany (GtZ) (para. 3.04) assumed their duties in March 1984. However,
NWSC is hampered by a lack of trained staff in all of its departments.
Unattractive terms of employment, the result of low tariffs and inadequate
levels of billing and collections, are the main explanation for NWSC's
inability to attract and retain competent staff in sufficient numbers
(paras. 4.05 and 4.06). To improve the situation to a point where its
compensation package could be considered competitive with those offered by
financially healthier parastatals, NWSC in July 1983 presented to its Board
a proposal that would have raised its annual salaries and wages bill from
USh 44.0 million to USh 75.0 million and provided a further USh 89.0
million in various allowances (transport, lunch, etc). Approved by the
Board, the proposal was rejected by the Minister, NLMWR, as both too
expensive and untimely in light of unchanged tariff levels and requests by
NISC in past years for government subsidies to meet its payroll. A 26%
increase in basic salary was awarded, with no adjustments to allowances,
although the staff at WDD had in the meantime received increases of 20% and
50% in April and July 1983 respectively. Based on the increases in tariffs
(para. 5.07) and on improvements in billing and collections, already in
progress (para. 4.14), Government has now adjusted NWSC's staff
remuneration so as to restore parity with WDD.
4.04      An organization chart of WDD is also shown in Annex 11.  Four
Assistant Commissioners for Water Resources; Construction and Development;
Planning, Design and Documentation; and Operation and Maintenance
respectively, and the head of Accounts and Administration report to the
Commissioner through his Deputy. Essentially, WDD's problems are similar
to NkWSC's, although in many instances manpower shortages can be overcome by
transferring staff from other ministries. As the towns of Masaka, Mbarara,
Tororo and Mbale are scheduled to be transferred to NWSC's control by July
1988, the proposed project seeks to strengthen WDD primarily in terms of
its accounting and finance functions by requiring the implementation of
major organizational, staffing and procedural changes (para. 4.13).
3/ The Finance and Accounts Department will be formally headed by the
Finance Manager after his post has been officially established (para.
4.09).



-24-
Training
4.05      Based upon a comparison of the number of existing employees with
the number required to man existing water supply and sewer systems at a
level which will ensure uninterrupted operation and adequate maintenance,
serious manpower deficiencies and shortages exist for engineers, qualified
accountants, skilled craftsmen and treatment plant operators.
4.06      The major constraint to the sector's ability to recruit, train
and retain the staff it requires is the extremely low level of pay and
employment benefits provided. This situation is exacerbated by a shortage
of professional personnel staff and the total lack of any trained full-time
training staff. Despite these constraints, the inexperience of some higher
level staff and the adverse circumstances in which the sector is required
to operate, the level of staff motivation and enthusiasm is relatively
high. The competence of the longer serving sub-professional staff appeared
to be adequate; on-the-job refresher training programs should level out
such skill variations as currently exist among these staff.
4.07      The planned output of Uganda education and training institutions
will not be adequate to meet the substantial manpower and training needs of
the sector. For example, of Makerere University's annual output of 60
engineering graduates (20 of them civil) only three or four can be expected
to join the sector against an average requirement of twice that number.
Largely through the initiative of WDD in 1979, a three-year water
technician program was established at the Uganda Technical College (UTC).
Although the program now graduates about 20 technicians per year, the
current sector deficiency of this category is several hundred, with an
estimated requirement for an additional fifty technicians per year until
1991. Moreover, in its present form the program is inadequately
water-oriented, weakly staffed, predominantly academic, and provides no
supervised planned practical experience or project work during the
six months allocated for this purpose. Over the past few years limited
overseas training for professional and sub-professional staff has been
provided, mostly through bilateral arrangements but, of the recipients
remaining in the sector, few are currently occupying positions for which
they received such training.
4.08      NLMWR and the implementing agencies were convinced of the
necessity to augment the output of local education and training
institutions through the progressive development of sector in-service
training capability. Sector commitment to human resource development was
clearly evident. The project therefore will finance a substantial training
component which, based on the results of the Manpower and Training Study
financed under the Water Supply Engineering Project (CR lllO-UG), is
designed to meet the short-term training needs related to the project and
to prepare the ground for the development and implementation of a long-term
training strategy. The main elements of the training component are
detailed in Annex 12.



-25-
Accounting
4.09      NWSC: Although NWSC's accounting procedures are basically
adequate to provide information needed for financial control, and planning
and management information reports, its accounts have not been finalized
since 1978. This has been due mainly to NWSC's difficulty in keeping the
position of Chief Accountant filled with a suitable person, to the general
shortage of accounting staff on account of unattractive employment
conditions (paras. 4.05 and 4.06), and to the widespread destruction of
records during the war. NWSC's auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, prepared
qualified accounts up to fiscal year 1978; the firm of V.R. Shah & Co.
attempted to continue, but found the task impossible without the missing
records. Having obtained approval from the Minister, MLMWR, as well as
agreement from the Association that the audit requirements of Section 4.02
of the Project Agreement covering Credit 1110-UG be waived, NWSC has
prepared a new set of accounts based on a "statement of affairs" as of June
3U, 1983, yet to be audited, as a first step in rehabilitating the Finance
and Accounts Department. NWSC now has a qualified Chief Accountant who
does, however, still lack the experience and self-assurance to be fully
effective. The EEC had originally intended to provide a Financial Advisor
to the Chief Accountant for a period of 18 months but, following
discussions among all concerned, the terms of reference were amended during
the appraisal mission to change the position to that of Finance Manager,
with line responsibility for all activities of NWSC's Finance and Accounts
Department. The Finance Manager joined NWSC in March 1984, but his post
has not yet been formally established. He will be required for a mInimum
of three years; the EEC has indicated its willingness to finance him beyond
the original 18 month term. An advertising campaign, launched in May/June
1983 to fill a large number of vacancies in NWSC's Accounts Department,
resulted in the recruitment in September 1983 of five accountants and 23
accounts clerks and assistants, arrears inspectors and meter readers. This
success was due largely to the promise of improvements in the terms of
employment. NWSC's subsequent failure to gain approval for a revised
compensation package has resulted in the departure of several of the new
staff, including one accountant. It is expected that further losses will
be averted by the most recent improvements in staff compensation (para.
4.03).
4.10      WDD:  WDD's accounting records have been maintained at MLMWR's
headquarters and are prepared on a cash basis in accordance with government
accounting procedures. The operating expenditures and collections for the
water supply schemes operated by WDD are consolidated to show an annual
comparison of actual with budgeted expenditures and collection targets. A
breakdown of recurrent expenditures for WDD's various activities (rural and
urban water supply, sewerage, etc.) is not provided, and information on
receivables and collections is not consolidated; thus a complete evaluation
of WDD's overall financial performance and position is not possible.
4.11     Meter reading, billing and revenue collections, and the payment of
wages and salaries are the responsibility of WDD's branches. Each branch



-26-
Accounts Section is headed by an Executive Officer, Accounts and typically
staffed with four accounts clerks. Revenue collections are required to be
deposited into the bank account of MLMWR. In practice, tariffs are often
incorrectly applied, customer records are incomplete, few meters exist,
billing is done mDnthly but standards are poor in terms of accuracy and
timeliness, and the ledgers maintained are inadequate. The level of
revenues and accounts receivable at any given time is not readily
ascertainable.
4.12      Procedures concerning WDD's budget allocations and expenditure
control need to be improved. The area engineers do not participate in the
budget preparation process and are not advised of their budget allocation.
Consequently, there are no parameters within which they may authorize
expenditures. They are instead required to forward vouchers for items
other than salaries and wages to WDD's Accounts Department, where
expenditures are checked against budget allocations. The actual accounting
records are maintained and payments are made by MLMWR's Accounts
Department. Inventory records are maintained by the branches in quantity
only. Recurrent budget funds are made available to MLMWR by the Ministry
of Finance in 12 equal mDnthly installments, but since sub-allocations to
WDD do not follow the same regular pattern and WDD's Accounts Department is
often by-passed when branches send vouchers to MLMWR for payment, the
accounts kept by WDD are difficult to reconcile with those maintained by
3MAWR. Furthermore WDD's actual allocations are often below budgeted
levels because funds are diverted by MLMWR headquarters to other
departments. Funds for capital expenditures are released by the Ministry
of Finance to WDD though MLMWR on a project basis, following review, during
the proposal stage, by the Ministry of Planning to ensure consistency with
the National Development Programme. In the case of more routine capital
investments, WDD is required to justify its requests only to the Ministry
of Finance. Purchases valued at more than USh 200,000 are required to be
made through the Central Tender Board.
4.13      Since WDD's Accounts Department had reached a situation where,
due to staff constraints and a virtual collapse of the accounting and
reporting system, it was unable to exercise its controlling function over
revenue collections and expenditures, a competent Chief Executive Officer,
Accounts, was appointed in May 1983 to rehabilitate and expand WDD's
accounting systems and introduce a budget system at its headquarters and
branches. He is being assisted by a deputy (Senior Executive Officer,
Accounts), by three Higher Executive Officers, Accounts (HEO), for
Revenues; Salaries and Wages; and Internal Audit, respectively, and by an
Accountant, Bookkeeping. Also, to improve staff quality at the branch
offices, four Higher Executive Officers were appointed in November 1983 to
head the accounts sections at Masaka, Nbale, Mbarara and Tororo. To
facilitate the process of rehabilitating and strengthening WDD, WDD's
accounts were separated from those of other MLMWR departments with effect
from January 1, 1984.



-27-
Billing and Collection
4.14      NWSC:  Since July 1983, NWSC has billed its consumers for water
supply and sewerage services on a monthly basis in all three towns. Prior
to that, Kampala customers were billed quarterly. While billing is
normally carried out promptly during the early part of each month,
collections remain substantially in arrears. NWSC's accounts receivable
for Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja were USh 155.2 million as of June 30, 1983,
and USh 103.4, million as of March 31, 1984 (equivalent to about 16
months' and 11 months' billing respectively). This marks an improvement
over earlier levels, which were as high as 20 months' billing, and reflects
concentrated efforts to improve collections, including a rigorous
discounection program. In order to further improve collections, NWSC is
also planning a campaign to identify the large number of illegal consumers.
Government agencies are estimated to account for about 50% of water
consumption billed, but they represent the bulk of accounts receivable (71%
as of March 31, 1984). As a condition of credit effectiveness, the
Government would withhold from the monthly budget allocations to its
ministries monies owed to NWSC as of June 30, 1984. Accounts receivable
from government ministries as of March 31, 1984 have been confirmed and
verification of more recent invoices is in progress. Also, Government
would ensure that the future indebtedness of its ministries does not exceed
60 days' billing.
4.15      WDD: Due to inadequacies in the accounting system (para. 4.11),
and to the absence of reasonable collection targets (para. 5.02),
collections from both private and government consumers are poor. Overall,
collections are estimated at about 20% of theoretical revenues.
Collections actually received by NLMWR are low (USh 2.5 million and USh 1.8
million in 1981/82 and 1982/83 respectively), with the unaccounted for
funds frequently used by the area engineers to purchase items needed to
operate and maintain their systems. Disconnection programs are not being
effectively applied because they are deemed unjustified where consumers
have refused payment on account of interrupted service and because the
equipment needed for disconnection is often lacking. The steps being taken
to rehabilitate and strengthen WDD (para. 4.13) are expected to result in
major improvements in the areas of billing and collection.
Audit and Insurance
4.16      NWSC:  At present, the chartered accounting firm, Coopers and
Lybrand, whose staff in Uganda is adequately qualified and headed by two



-28-
partners who are Ugandan nationals, serves as NWSC's auditors. Assurances
were obtained that annual accounts audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association would be submitted to the Association within
nine months of the end of the financial year.
4.17      WDD:  WDD is subject to annual audits which are carried out
regularly by the Auditor General's Department. Annual audits would be
performed of project expenditures and audited statements would be submitted
to the Association within nine months of the close of the fiscal year. SOE
would be separately audited and an annual audit report submitted within
nine months after the end of the fiscal year in which the expenditures were
incurred.
4.18      As NWSC maintains no insurance program of any kind, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Corporation would obtain
adequate cover for its assets. WDD, being a government department, is
self-insured. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that project
equipment and materials for WDD would be covered by marine and transit
insurance to site, in appropriate foreign exchange needed to replace
equipment and materials lost or damaged.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance and Present Financial Position
5.01      NWSC:  The Corporation's accounts have not been finalized since
1978 (para. 4.09), but the available information indicates that NWSC has
consistently experienced difficulties in generating and collecting revenues
to cover normal operating expenses and has had to rely repeatedly on
government subsidies to meet its payroll (para. 4.03). The newly
introduced tariff increases (para. 5.07), combined with an intensified
collection effort and with the Government's commitment to reduce its share
of NWSC's accounts receivable (para. 4.14), are expected to improve NWSC's
financial position significantly. Lower staff turnover resulting from
improved compensation levels together with the appointment of a Finance
Manager (para. 4.09) are expected to bring further benefits.
5.02      WDD: Aggregate recurrent expenditures and revenues for WDD's
entire operations for fiscal years 1980/81 to 1983/84 are summarized below;
details are provided in Annex 13.

c/ Expenditures below authorized levels reflect use of WDD funds for other NUMWR
departments as well as reductions in funds made available by the Ministry of
Finance.
The above summary reveals that WDD had not had sufficient funds to operate
and maintain water supply systems to satisfactory standards. Collection
targets were not set prior to the 1983/84 fiscal year. The department has
never generated any substantial revenues and cannot realistically expect to
meet its 1983/84 target. It therefore relies on budget allocations from
the Ministry of Finance, but due to Uganda's difficult economic situation,
the funds made available regularly fall short of requirements.
5.03      A summ-ary of WDD's expenditures on development from 1980/81
through 1983/84 is given in A"nex 14.  Information on WDD's budget requests
is not available, but implementation has not exceeded 69% of the annual
budget provided for water supply and sewerage.
5.04       To ensure that the Government's funding for the project would be
available when needed, Government would establish, as a condition of Credit
effectiveness, a Project Advance Account into which it would deposit its
share of project cost at the beginning of each quarter, with an initial
deposit set at USh 90 million.



-30-
Tariffs
5.05      The Government was required under the Development Credit
Agreement for the Water Supply Engineering Project (CR 1110-UG) to put into
effect, by January 1, 1983, a program to revise the structure of the water
supply and sewerage tariffs of WDD and NWSC. The program was to reflect
the conclusions of a tariff study on which work was to commence by
November 1, 1981. Largely due to the post of Project Coordinator remaining
vacant for several months following the death of the original incumbent and
to the current understaffing of the PCU, terms of reference reviewed and
approved by the Association were only recently sent to several consultants
qualified to undertake the work, with a deadline for submitting proposals
set at January 31, 1984 and a target date of June 30, 1984 established for
award of contract. The draft of the tariff study is expected to be ready
by the end of 1984.
5.06      NWSC is required under the National Water and Sewerage Decree of
1972, to ensure that its revenues cover all its costs and provide a
reasonable return on investment, but its hitherto low tariffs, even after
the increase of December 1, 1981, combined with poor collections, have
always made achievement of this objective impossible (para. 5.01). In
areas not served by NWSC, government policy generally has been to provide
water free of charge to villagers and at a modest fee to the rest of the
population. As a result, tariffs for water supplied from systems under
WDD's control have remained virtually unchanged since 1964 and collections
have not been seriously enforced (para. 5.02). Recognizing the urgent need
for adjustments, NWSC and WDD in June 1983 submitted to the Minister,
MLMWR, an application for a common national tariff structure and for an
interim increase of about 300Z based on NWSC's own computations. Following
a ministerial review, a revised request for even larger (in excess of 700Z)
increases for most consumer categories was presented to the Cabinet in
November 1983 but not accepted in its entirety.
5.07      Following an exchange of views with NLMWR, the Association in
April 1984 accepted as adequate the Government's proposal to increase
tariffs, with effect from May 1, 1984, from USh 86.40 per 1,000 gallons to
USh 700 per 1,00U gallons for institutional, commercial and industrial
users, and from USh 72/month per household to USh 100/month per household
for users with private standpipes and house connections. IDA's acceptance
was based on the understanding that these adjustments were to be an interim
measure and that further increases would be implemented in FY85 to reflect
the recommendations of the tariff study (para. 5.05). The new tariffs
apply to the seven project (Category A) towns, while those for all other
(Category B) towns are significantly lower. Details, including a
comparison of new and old tariffs, are given in Annex 19.



-31-
5.08      The mDnthly tariff of USh 100/month per household is affordable,
representing about 1% of the average monthly income, including fringe
benefits, of private standpipe user households, and less than 1% of the
average monthly income of households with house connections.
5.09      To ensure that NWSC will make satisfactory progress in achieving
its financial objectives as set forth in the National Water and Sewerage
Decree (para. 5.06) and accumulate cash balances needed for a modest
capital investment program from FY88 onward, agreement was reached during
negotiations that, until the results of the tariff study are available and
agreed upon, tariff adjustments prior to the transfer to NWSC of the four
project towns currently under WDD's control would be made on the basis of
financial performance criteria for NWSC. National tariffs common to NWSC
and WDD would be maintained and set at levels sufficient to cover NWSC's
cash operating costs for FY 86 through FY90, plus 15X of depreciation on a
revalued basis in FY86, 25% in FY87, 45% in FY88, 55% in FY89, and 65% in
FY90. This is projected to require the following increases in the average
tariff in July of each year: 30% in 1985, 22% in 1986, 21% in 1987, 17% in
1988 and 13% in 1989. NWSC would review the adequacy of tariffs at
semiannual intervals and make the necessary adjustments to achieve these
targets. Agreement was also reached during negotiations that, for the
purpose of computing annual depreciation charges, fixed assets would be
revalued annually on the basis of the Manufactures Unit Value index, a
price index published by IBRD for exports of manufactured goods, including
machinery, from industrialized to developing countries.
Financing Plan
5.10      Forecast income statements, funds flow statements, and balance
sheets for NWSC, comprising the present member towns of Kampala, Jinja, and
Entebbe. -re given for FY84 through FY90 in Annex 15. Projections for an
expand- ..WSC, comprising seven towns as of July 1988, are presented in
Annex 17. Forecasts showing the financial performance of Masaka, Mbale,
Mbarara and Tororo if they were operated on the basis of a commercial
accounting system are contained in Annex 16. The assumptions used are
outlined in Annex 18.
5.11      The Government would transfer the water supply and sewerage
systems at Masaka, Mbale, Mbarara and Tororo from WDD's control to NWSC by
July 1988. The transfer would include the staff, the cash balances, the
accounts receivable and payable, the inventories, the work in progress and
the revalued fixed assets of the four water supply systems, and would not
result in any additional obligations for NWSC, being treated as an increase
in government equity in NWSC. A detailed action plan, which includes
provisions relating to the selection and training of accounting and



-32-
technical staff and a schedule for the phased transfer, commencing July
1986, of accounting systems and operational and administrative
responsibilities, would be prepared by NWSC and WDD by the end of 1985, if
necessary by drawing on technical expertise to be financed from the
Credit. As part of this plan, WDD would annually revalue the net fixed
assets of the four project towns In the same fashion as NWSC.
5.12      As the project is expected to be physically completed within five
fiscal years, the financing plan for NWSC covers FY85 through FY89 and is

5.13      The financing plan assumes that tariffs are increased as outlined
in para. 5.09, that 70% of IDA Credit funds allocated to NWSC are onlent
while 30% are made available as equity (para. 4.01), that interest during
construction in the amount of USh 1,062.4 million (US$3.6 million) would be
capitalized, and that NWSC would not be required to bear the foreign
exchange risk in order to protect its cash position (para. 5.14).
NWSC would provide 12.8% of Its capital requirements from net internal cash
generation, 30.0% from loans, 8.7% from grants and 48.5% from equity.
Future Operations and Financial Position
5.14      Based on the established targets (para. 5.09) and the above
assumptions, NWSC's financial position would be considerably improved.
Although operating income would be negative through FY90, net internal cash
generation would be adequate to enable NWSC to finance some expansion of
its water supply and sewerage systems not related to the proposed project.
WDD would be similarly affected and, consequently, the transfer of Masaka,
Mbarara, Tororo and Mbale Is not expected to impair NWSC's ability to make
satisfactory progress in achieving Its long term financial objectives as
stated in the National Water and Sewerage Decree of 1972 (para. 5.06). As
Annex 17 shows, the debt/debt and equity ratio would decline significantly
as a result of the transfer, from 22% in FY88 to 17% in FY89, and NWSC,
rather than fully financing relatively minor extenslons to Its water supply
and sewerage systems, would be in a much stronger position from FY88 onward
to borrow the funds required to undertake a much larger capital expansion
program. To help ensure a sound financial structure, agreement was reached
during negotiatlons that NWSC would not Incur debt without the approval of
the Association unless future debt service, Including that of proposed
borrowings, is covered at least 1.5 timus by Internal cash generation and
that, until project completion, NWSC would not incur annual capital
expenditures, other than for the proposed project, in excess of US$250,000
equivalent without a financing plan agreed with the Association.

VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
6.01      The proposed rehabilitation of the water supply and sewerage
systems in the seven major towns of Uganda would bring immediate relief to
approximately 62Z of the total population (total about 1 million) living in
these towns. It would also bring relief to commercial and industrial
enterprises whose development has been hampered considerably due to the
lack or shortage of water. Although the project will bring an end to the
emergency situation, major extensions of the water supply systems are
urgently required in the near future in order to serve a larger portion of
the rapidly growing population (para. 2.10). The project will also restore
the services for septic tank emptying and refuse collection. Besides
improving health conditions, the project would also contribute to the
economic recovery of the country.
6.02      More generally, all water supply consumers would benefit from
NWSC's and WDD's improved management and staff capabilities to be brought
about by the project 's training and technical assistance component and
improved operation by reducing water losses, installation of water meters
(provided under the Water Supply Engineering Credit), supply of spare parts
and maintenance equipment. Through its financial covenants the project is
expected to lead towards institutional effectiveness which should benefit
not only the consumers but all taxpayers in the country.
6.03      Parallel to the physical improvement of the services, the project
aims at improving health education in the seven project towns. This is
particularly important because a large portion of the population is still
depending on unprotected water sources. The health education component is
linked to a low cost sanitation demonstration project which should lead to
improved pit latrine construction. Benefits which can be attributed to
this project component are increased labor productivity and decreased costs
for medical services.
Least Cost Solution
6.04      In a rehabilitation project the least cost solution is either to
repair and/or replace parts of the facilities or completely abandon
facilities and construct new plants. In most cases the rehabilitation of
the existing facilities was the obvious least cost solution. Where the
present value of replacement and future operation and maintenance costs was
lower than comparable costs for rehabilitation, existing plants or parts of
it have been abandoned. Besides mere analytical aspects, such as
sensitivity against discount rates and cost variation, great importance was
attached and preference to facilities was given which can be easily
operated and maintained and are less dependent on spare parts and skilled
labor. The Bank Group and the Project Coordination Unit have directed and
checked the consultants' designs and proposals according to these criteria.



-35-
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
6.05      The economic rate of return of the project is the discount rate
at which the present value of the capital and operating and maintenance
costs is equal to the present value of benefits attributable to the
investment over the economic life of the project. In the cost calculation,
taxes and duties have been excluded. Shadow pricing of foreign exchange
and labor was not considered applicable. The present "WLndow 2" exchange
rate reflects the market value of the USh. For project implementation only
unskilled local labor will be available.   The contractor will have to
import most of the skilled labor. Since the wages for unskilled labor are
lower than the shadow price and only present a minor portion in the total
project costs, these additional benefits have not been considered in the
economic rate of return calculation. Capital costs include the annual
investments for the rehabilitation of the water supply systems and are
based on January 1984 prices plus appropriate physical contingencies;
incremental operating and maintenance costs are based on estimates since
reliable actual present costs are not available. The overall economic rate
of return for the project is 20Z on 98.5% of total project costs using
current tariffs as a proxy for benefits. The rate of return is sensitive
to a 10% increase in costs or a 10% reduction in benefits by about 2%. A
combined increase in costs and 10% reduction in benefits would result in an
ERR of 16%. Details of the calculation are given in Annex 20.
6.06      The average incremental cost of water supply for the project area
is estimated at US$0.28/m3 at an opportunity cost of capital of 10%. The
average incremental cost is lower than the expected average selling price
of US$0.47/m3 (in real terms) in 1987 when the benefits become available.
(Details of the calculations are given in Annex 20.)
Impact on Poverty Group
6.07      The poverty group in the seven towns served by the project is
estimated at 46% (270,000) of the total served population (590,000),
(para. 2.06), based on the assumption that all of the population served
through public standpipes are below the poverty threshold. Since
standpipe water users do not pay for water, this group would profit most
and have considerable health benefits from a restored safe water supply.
The tariff study will examine these issues in detail.
Project Risks
6.08      The project is designed to cope with the risks which lie in weak
organizations, limited capacity of local contractors and shortage of local
funds by providing technical assistance and procurement packages which
would attract strong contractors for the mechanical/electrical, and civil
works; and by retaining consultants for the supervision of construction



-36-
work. In addition, intensive supervision of project implementation,
including continuous checks on budget allocations, would be required. The
remaining risk is the still unsettled political and security situation in
the country. Under prevailing conditions the project as designed is
feasiDle. A deterioration in this situation, however, could have adverse
effects on project implementation, both in terms of cost and time, and may
in a severe case require revisions in the project scope.
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached:
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) WDD's accounts are being maintained separately from those of
other HLMWR departments (para. 4.13); and
(b) Tariff increases acceptable to the Association have been
implemented (para. 5.07).
(c)  the Government would provide funds to (i) finance the
balance of the project costs in accordance with the agreed
program of project expenditure (para. 3.07) and (ii) meet
the annual operating expenses of the Project Implementation
Unit.
(d) MLMWR would employ consultants whose qualifications,
experience and conditions of employment are satisfactory to
IDA (para. 3.10);
(e) the amended regulations of the Uganda Tender Board shall be
satisfactory to the Association (pars. 3.14);
(f) until the results of the tariff study are available and
agreed upon, tariff adjustments prior to the transfer of the
four project towns currently under WDD's control would be
made on the basis of financial performance criteria for
NWSC. National tariffs common to NWSC and WDD would be
maintained and set at levels sufficient to cover NWSC's cash
operating costs for FY86 through FY90, plus 15% of
depreciation on a revalued basis in FY86, 25% in FY87, 45Z
in FY88, 55% in FY89, and 65% in FY90. NWSC would review
the adequacy of tariffs at semiannual intervals and make the
necessary adjustments to achieve these targets (para. 5.09);



-37-
(g) for the purpose of computing annual depreciation charges,
NWSC would annually revalue its fixed assets on the basis of
the Manufactures Unit Value index, a price index published
by IBRD for exports of manufactured goods, including
machinery, from industrialized to developing countries
(para. 5.09). WDD would similarly revalue the fixed assets
of the four project towns to facilitate their transfer to
NWSC by July 1988 (para. 5.11).
(h) Government would onlend part of the proceeds of the IDA
Credit to NWSC for 20 years, including a grace period of 4
years, at a variable interest rate, to be adjusted annually,
equal to the minimum interest rate established by the
Government for commercial bank loans plus 3X (paras. 4.01
and 5.13);
(i) NWSC's accounts would continue to be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA and audited annual accounts and
audit reports would be sent to IDA within nine uDnths of the
end of each fiscal year (para. 4.16). WDD's project
expenditures would be audited annually and audited
statements would be submitted to the Association within nine
mDnths of the close of the fiscal year. Statements of
expenditure would be separately audited and annual audit
reports submitted within nine months of the end of the
fiscal year (para. 4.17);
(j) adequate provision would be made for the insurance of NWSC's
fixed assets and for the insurance of imported goods to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Credit (para. 4.18);
(k) NWSC would not incur debt without the approval of the
Association unless future debt service, including that of
proposed. borrowings, is covered at least 1.5 times by
internal cash generation and that, until project completion,
NWSC would not incur annual capital expenditure, other than
for the proposed project, in excess of US$250,000 equivalent
without a financing plan agreed with the Association (para.
5.14);
(1) proposed legal changes of existing water legislation will be
made available to IDA for review and comment prior to their
introduction (para. 1.25);



-38-
(m) the PCU would prepare quarterly "Project Progress Reports"
and, after completion of the project, a 'Project Completion
Report" on the basis of Bank guidelines (para. 3.09);
(n) MLMWR has acquired the land necessary for the construction
of waste stabilization ponds in Mbale and Jinja and for the
construction of four houses in Kampala (para. 3.26);
(o) the Government would pay the arrears in water fees of
various government ministries to NWSC in accordance with
para. 4.14 and would ensure that future indebtedness does
not exceed 60 days' billing;
(p) MLMWR would transfer responsibility for the water supply and
sewerage systems at Masaka, Mbarara, Tororo and Mbale from
WDD to NWSC by not later than July 1, 1988 and a detailed
action plan for the transfer would be prepared by NWSC and
WDD by the end of 1985 (para. 5.11); and
(q) the Government would apply the "Window 2" rate (USh 300 =
US$1 at present) for all transactions of Bank funds (US$)
into USh for payments made in local currency (para. 3.07).
7.03      As conditions of credit effectiveness:
(a) the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
NWSC-should be executed (para. 4.01);
(b) the monies owed NWSC by government ministries as of June 30,
1984 should be paid (para. 4.14);
Cc) Government should establish a Project Advance Account with
an initial deposit of USh 90.0 million (para. 5.04); and
(d) Government should open a Special Account.
Recommendations
7.04      With the above agreements, the proposed project would be suitable
for an IDA Credit of US$28.0 million.

WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Existing Facilities for Water Supply Sewerage and Solid Waste Disposal
Water Supply Facilities
1.        Kampala (686,000 inhabitants) abstracts its water from Lake
Victoria and treats all its water in the Gaba Water Works. The water is
treated by rapid gravity, pressure filters and micro-straining and is
chlorinated. At present approximately 40,000 m3/d is produced, while the
maximum design capacity is about 78,000 m3/d. The demand of the served
population (57%) would amount to 65,000 m3/d (1984). Rehabilitation of the
plant has been underway for two years with EEC financing. Completion is
scheduled for 1984/85. The bottlenecks in production are at present the
limited clear water pumping capacity and filtration. Another source of
continuous problems are the rising mains from Gaba Water Works to the high
level reservoirs at Muyenga and the booster station at Bunga. Pipe breaks
due to water hammer and operating problems in the Bunga booster station
have been frequent in the past. It is therefore estimated that only in
1988, after the problems in the main supply system have been eliminated,
that the average output will reach 70,000 m3/d. Kampala has a high and low
level distribution system with a total of 340 km of pipelines of 75 to 600
mm in diameter.  Many stretches are badly corroded and need to be
replaced. The total high and low level reservoir capacity amounts to
approximately 45,000 m3.  Most of the reservoirs need to be repaired; the
reservoir at Nagura needs to be replaced completely.
2.        Jinja (119,000 inhabitants) also abstracts its water from Lake
Victoria and treats all its water in the Walukuba Water Works which was
constructed in 1951 and extended in 1956 and 1968. At present the water is
treated in rapid gravity filters and chlorinated. Sedimentation tanks are
also used, but this treatment is ineffective because chemicals for
flocculation are not available. The existing micro-strainers are out of
order. Most of the mechanical/electrical equipment is already 15 to 30
years old and needs to be replaced. At present only 56% of the population
can be served and water supply is shut down in the whole town during the
night in order to fill the high level reservoir. The low level (steel
tank) reservoir needs to be replaced. Present reservoir capacity amounts
to 25,000 m3. The distribution system consists of 100 km of pipelines
ranging from 75 to 350 mm in diameter.
3.        Eatebbe (22,000 inhabitants) also abstracts its w-ter from Lake
Victoria. The treatment plant was constructed in 1954 and extended in
1970. Due to breakdown of facilities in the old treatment line, the raw
water is only chlorinated. In the new line, the water is treated in
pressure filters and chlorinated. Some of the pressure filters are out of
order. At present, approximately 3,000 m3/d (peak output) is produced,
while the maximum design capacity is about 6,000 m3/d. Demand of the
served population (86%) would amount to 4,400 m3/d (1984). Total reservoir
capacity is 6,600 m3 and the distribution system consists of 56 km of
pipelines from 75 to 300 mm in diameter.

4.        Masaka (35,000 inhabitants) abstracts its water from the swamps
along the Nabajuzi River. The treatment plant was constructed in 1948 and
extended in 1960. In 1982, the treated water pumps were replaced (financed
by EEC). Both the structures as well as the mechanical/electrical
equipment are in very poor condition. At present only about 3,000 m3/d
average is produced, while the design capacity of the plant is 4,500 m3/d.
The demand in 1984 will amount to 4,700 m3/d. The water is treated by
splash" aeration, addition of aluminum sulphate, sedimentation, rapid
gravity filtration and chlorination. The treated water is pumped to the
Boma and Bwala Hill reservoirs. Total reservoir capacity is about 3,300 m3
and the distribution system consists of 26 km of pipelines of 80 to 300 mm
in diameter.
5.        Mbarara (32,000 inhabitants) abstracts its water from the Ruizi
River. The treatment plant was constructed in 1950 and extended in 1966.
In 1982 EEC financed the replacement of seven pumps in the new and old pump
house. The water is treated by 'splash" aeration (old works), addition of
aluminum sulphate, sedimentation, rapid gravity filtration and
chlorination. Present average plant output amounts to 3,000 m3/d, whereas
the design capacity would be 4,900 m3/d. The water demand at source in
1984 would be 4,900 m3/d. Total reservoir capacity is 3,300 m3 and the
distribution system consists of 41 km of pipelines 80 to 300 mm in
diameter.
6.        Tororo (27,000 inhabitants) abstracts its water from the Malaba
River which is the border river between Uganda and Kenya.  The treatment
plant needs very urgently the replacement of part of its
mechanical/electrical equipment and must be extended. At present only
1,600 in/d (at average) can be produced, after rehabilitation the output
could be increased to 2,000 m3/d. The water demand in 1984 at the source
would, however, be 3,800 m3/d. Due to the urgency of the rehabilitation,
the Government intends to finance these works from the present IDA
Reconstruction Credit II. The water is treated by dosing with aluminum
sulphate, sedimentation, rapid gravity filtration and chlorination and is
then pumped 8 km to a high level reservoir. Total reservoir capacity is
5,600 m3 and the distribution network consists of 28 km of pipelines 80 to
300 mm in diameter.
7.        Mbale (33,000 inhabitants) has two water treatment plants.  The
old Bunkoko Works (4 km east of the town) receives its raw water from two
small mountain rivers (Namatsyo and Nabuyonga River) by gravity while the
new Manafwa Works (1962) is situated 16 km south of the town and abstracts
its water from the Manafwa River. The estimated present average output of
the two works is 2,300 + 2,300 = 4,600 m3/d whereas the demand would be
5,700 m3/d (1984). The Government intends to finance the rehabilitation of
the new Manafwa Works from the present IDA Reconstruction Credit II. After
rehabilitation this water works alone would be able to produce 8,000 m3/d
at average. Total reservoir capacity is 3,300 m3 and the distribution
system comprises 41 km of pipelines from 80 to 300 mm in diameter.

Sewerage Facilities
8.        Kampala (686,000 inhabitants) has a sewerage system which covers
must of the central areas of the town. There are a total of 136 km of
sewers with diameters of up to 660 mm. All sewage is treated in the
Bugolobi Sewage Treatment Plant and discharged to swamps which are
connected to Lake Victoria.   The treatment plant consists of an old part,
constructed in 1940, and a new part which was completed in 1970, and has a
capacity of 12,000 + 15,000 - 27,000 m3/d. The new treatment plant was
only two years in operation. Treatment consists of screening, grit removal,
primary and secondary sedimentation, trickling filters, sludge digestion
tanks and sludge drying beds. The old part of the treatment plant is at
present not operating at all. The new part was cleaned up and put back
into operation in 1983 by a local contractor, but needs further
rehabilitation of its mechanical/electrical equipment. The sewer
reticulation system suffers from a number of collapses and blockages and
three intermediate pumping stations are out of order, mainly caused by lack
of maintenance. As a result of the deficiencies in the sewerage system and
the low level of water supply, only approximately 5,000 m3/d of sewage is
reaching the treatment plant at present. The rehabilitation of the old
part of the treatment plant has therefore at present lower priority. There
are approximately 7,700 septic tanks within the project area; most of them
have not been emptied for years. Twenty-four public toilet blocks have
been damaged or are broken down.
9.        Jinja (119,000 inhabitants).  The oldest sewerage facilities date
from 1954 when the central business district was sewered. A total
population of almost 35,000 is served by the existing foul sewer network of
approximately 35 km (175 mm to 525 mm in diameter). Most of the sewage is
treated in the Kirinya waste stabilization ponds which were constructed in
1962. The first pond is full of sludge and needs urgently to be cleaned
out. Some housing areas (Kimaka) and an industrial area on the west side
of the Nile (brewery and textile factory) discharge untreated sewage into
the Nile River. One sewage pumping station is out of operation; all public
toilet blocks have been damaged. There are about 300 septic tanks.
10.       Entebbe (22,000 inhabitants).  Only a small part of the town has
a foul sewer network serving a population of about 1,000. The 1.8 km long
trunk sewer leading to the small waste stabilization ponds is blocked.
They therefore do not receive any flow. There are about 500 septic tanks
within the project area.
11.       Masaka (35,000 inhabitpits).  The town centre and market area
were sewered in about 1961, extended in 1970, and have a sewer system of
approximately 5 km length, a diameter of 175 to 225 mm. The existing
conventional sewage treatment plant consist'ng of sedimentation tanks,
aeration tanks and open sludge digesters is presently completely out of
operation and therefore by-passed. It has been looted and completely
neglected. All main structures are in good condition but most of the



-43-
ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 5
mechanical/electrical equipment has to be replaced. Motors and equipment
of two pumping stations in the sewerage system have been dismantled and
looted. At present the sewage of only approximately 1,200 inhabitants is
reaching the site of the treatment plant. There are approximately 400
septic tanks In the town. Thirteen of the public toilet blocks have been
damaged and are out of use.
12.       Mbarara (32,000 inhabitants).  The small town center was fully
severed in 1961 and has a sewer system of 3 km length.  The existing small
conventional sewage works have been completely neglected during recent
years -and are out of order. There are three waste stabilization pond
systems under construction, financed by ADB. One system will replace the
existing treatment plant, another system will serve the Kakobe Housing
Estate which has at present central septic tanks and the third system will
serve the hospital, police and prison, which also have septic tanks at
present. ADB will also finance the severs leading to these ponds.
13.       Tororo (27,000 inhabitants).  The town center is sewered since
about 1960. The effluents of the trading center and of some 2,000
inhabitants are treated at a waste stabilization pond system north of
town. Due to the small diameter, the trunk sewer is frequently blocked;
overflowing sewage pollutes an open land area near the town center. Most
institutions and the high cost housing areas are served by septic tanks
(approximately 200).
14.       Mbale (33,000 inhabitants).  Only the commercial town center and
the industrial area are sewered. There are approximately 20 km of sewers
with diameters of up to 450 mm. Waste stabilization ponds treat the
effluents from the northern parts of the town and work satisfactorily. The
conventional trickling filter plant, constructed in 1962, for the southern
parts of the town is out of order. Almost all mechanical and electrical
equipment would need to be replaced. The steel parts are all heavily
corroded; concrete structures are, however, in good condition. Raw
sewage is by-passing the plant and polluting the adjacent papyrus swamp.
There are approximately 450 septic tanks within the town area. Most of the
town's public latrines have been looted and are not in use.
Solid Waste Disposal
15.       Kampala (686,000 inhabitants).  In 1972 Kampala had an organized
refuse collection and disposal system. At that time, 12 compacting trucks
(dust bin collection) and three caterpillars at the landfill sites Lugogo
By-pass, Port Bell and Wakaliga were available. At present, although the
population has increased considerably since 1972, collection services are
limited to the town center. The services are carried out with compacting
trucks, six skip loaders of which only three are usually in use (46 skips
of 5.5 m3 each) and three roll-off container trucks. No equipment is
available on the landfill sites. Dust bin (house) collection has been
abandoned.

16.       Jinja (119,000 inhabitants) also had an organized collection
system. Today only two old compacting trucks and one old tipper is
available. Refuse is only collected in central and market areas. No
equipment is available at the Masese landfill site.
17.       Entebbe (22,000 inhabitants).  The Town Council owns one
compacting truck which is out of order and a truck which has to be shared
with other sections of the Council. Refuse is only collected from time-to-
time, and no equipment is available at the landfill site.
18.       Masaka (35,000 inhabitants) which was heavily damaged in the
liberation war, has only one truck for refuse collection which has to be
shared with other sections of the Council. People get rid of their refuse
by using vacant plots.
19.       Mbarara (32,000 inhabituats) which also damaged in the war, and
has two trucks for refuse disposal; they have to be shared with other
sections of the Council. Most of the collected refuse is used on farmland.
20.       Tororo (27,000 inhabitants).  There is one old tipper available
for all municipal services.  Refuse is only collected in the central
areas. There is no equipment on the landfill sites.
21.       Mbale (33,000 inhabitants) once had a well-organized refuse
collection system with two compacting trucks (dust bin collection) and one
tipper. At present the Council has only one tipper and there is no
equipment on the landfill site.

D. Refuse Collection and Disposal
4.        The project aims at restoring refuse collection and disposal to a
minimum required level at minimum cost. Services can only be provided for
the central town areas, market places and high density housing areas. In
low density areas people will continue to use their refuse for farming,
animal feeding or bury and burn it on their plot. This is possible and
does not pose serious problems because their waste consists mainly of
organic matter. In order to keep the cost low, house-to-house collection
is not envisaged. The refuse will have to be carried to a container placed
in the vicinity. House-to-house dust bin collection will be tested in a
limited area.  Only in Xampala where two compacting refuse trucks are still
available. Although the refuse would be ideal for composting, this is not
envisaged within this rehabilitation project. The waste expert provided
under this project will, however, be requested to find out how and where
decentralized composting can be organized and to what extent farmers are
interested to participate. The proposed equipment for the various towns is
listed below:

WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Health Education Component
Introduction
1.        Due to economic, socXal and political difficulties experienced in
Uganda during the last decade, the water, sewerage and sanitation systems
in the major cities are in dire need of rehabilitation. The present
condition poses an immediate threat to public health as evidenced by the
increase in reported cases of diarrheal diseases in Kampala during 1982.
2.        In the rehabilitation process, low-cost and technologically
appropriate options must be introduced to speed recovery. One such option
is local adaptation of the ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine.
3.        It is, however, not enough to provide improved services.  People
must accept and utilize them in a proper and hygen .: manner. Herein lies
the need for health education to encourage correct use and, thereby,
promote health.
Target Population
4.        The target population for education will be all citizens, but
particular emphasis will be on those persons/families who have limited or
no access to water and sewerage services. This means much effort will be
focused on low-income, peripheral neighborhoods.
Objectives for Health Education
5.        The project intends to achieve a reduction in morbidity and
mortality from diseases associated with unsafe water supply, improper
feces disposal and poor personal, household and environmental hygiene. Due
to inadequacy of health statistics, partly as a result of disruption of
health service delivery, it is difficult to set exact goals. In detail the
project will aim at the following:
(a)   Families in target areas inadequately served or unserved by water
and/or sewerage should construct ventilated and improved latrines
and will use the latrines in prefere.rce to defecation in the bush
or other open places. Families will keep their latrines clean.
(b)   Families collecting water from unreliable sources (e.g.,
unprotected springs) will boil or otherwise purify the water
before consumption. Neighborhoods will work together to protect
and improve springs, wells and other water sources. Water from
sanitary sources will be collected in hygenic containers and will
be maintained in a hygenic manner until consumption.



-65-
ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 2
(c)   Families will keep household refuse in covered dustbins until
eventual disposal at designated collection depots.
(d)   School authorities, staff and pupils will work together to
provide potable water, to dispose of refuse properly and to
dispose of human wastes hygenically on school premises. School
personnel and pupils will maintain water and sanitation
facilities which are located at the school so that these are
clean and functional.
Health Education Strategies
(a)   The program will first be built around staff development.  This
will consist of both fellowships to increase the number of
professionally trained health educators and in-service training
for existing health and related staff.
(b)   Community outreach and organization will be linked with
construction of demonstration VIP latrines in public places.
Organization and self-help will also focus on improved water
supply especially in peri-urban areas. Work with local social
groups will form part of this outreach.
(c)   School health education will focus on children, teachers and
parents as demonstration units will be located at some primary
schools. Curriculum development and provision of teaching aids
will be included. Interagency cooperation with the Ministry of
Education will be necesssary.
(d)   The primary health care approach can be implemented where
government, religious and voluntary agencies are phasing in this
service. The desirability of PEC rests on the fact that it
utilizes trained community members to educate, organize and serve
their own neighborhoods, thereby being better able to communicate
with the public.
(e)   Traditionally oriented and culturally relevant media (drama,
stories, songs, dance, etc.) will be developed to support
community outreach activities.
(f)   Mass media support, in communities where available, will be
utilized to reinforce outreach, school health and other
strategies.
Action Plan and Mcnitoring Mechanisms
6.        Specification/time frame plans and evaluation and monitoring
mechanisms to achieve the set objectives for health education are contained
in the consultants' report which is available in the project file.

WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Training Needs and Program
Manpower Situation
1.        Manpower data and projections provided by the manpower and
training study undertaken by Coopers and Lybrand Associates, financed under
IDA Credit 1110-UG, indicates that some 3,700 staff work in the sector
against a requirement for about 5,500 in 1982, and against a need for a
further 1,500 by 1991. In relation to the training needs of new staff, the
training needs implicit in these projections are reduced from 3,300 to
2,000 persons by allowing for unskilled and secretarial staff. The
resultant average recruitment rate of some 250 staff per year up to 1991 is
unlikely to be achieved by the two sector agencies.
2.        Current manpower stock and projections for the water supply and
sewerage installations to be rehabilitated in each of the seven towns,
including headquarters staff of NWSC and WDD (main and area HQ), indicate
current total manpower strength of some 850 staff (excluding unskilled) and
a requirement for an additional 800 staff by end-1987. While not
insignificant the sum of the training needs (refresher and basic training)
of such staff numbers would not justify the establishment of a central
training facility whether permanent or temporary. Also bearing in mind the
crash" nature of the rehabilitation project and its shorter than usual
duration, it would not be feasible to establish a central training facility
in time to supply trained staff to coincide with the start of the
construction and equipment installation phase of the project. The focus of
the project training component would therefore, be on the provision of
on-the-job training at each sub-project location by mobile teams of
expert/counterpart training staff. In addition to this primary training
objective the project training component would develop the first phase of a
sector training service which, in the longer term, possibly through
follow-up projects, would be strengthened and expanded to provide a range
of programs to meet the training needs of both urban and rural sub-sectors.
Training Strategy
3.        The necessity to build up a training system progressively over
the longer term makes it highly desirable for the sector to establish a
"Twinning Arrangement for Training;" preferably with an established water
sector operational training organization capable of providing a complete
spectrum of training services through a continuous training relationship
with the Uganda water sector.



-70-
ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 6
4.        Examples of services to be provided under a Twinning Arrangement
would include:
(a)   "on-call' availability of a multi-purpose expatriate team of
short-term training experts covering the range of training needs
related to the seven towns and to the needs of HQ (including WDD
area HQ) staff;
(b)   training of local counterpart training staff;
(c)   the design, administration and supervision of short, 3-4 month
overseas programs of practical skills reinforcement;
(d)   participation in the development and instruction of special
water-related training programs provided by Uganda Technical
College (Water Technicians Courses) and the Institute of Public
Administration (revenue collection, billing, bookkeeping);
(e)   immediate availability of training equipment lists, manuals,
training aids, instructional guidelines, etc., and
(f)   systematic monitoring and evaluation of training progress in both
the short and long terms.
5.        Dependent upon the future rate of expansion of water supply and
sanitation services, and the future ability of sector agencies to recruit
and retain staff, a later phase of the sector training strategy may need to
consider the possible development of a sector training facility. The
emphasis and priority for the medium term is expected to continue to be
given to direct, on-the-job training at the site of the numerous
installations in need of rehabilitation.
Proposed Project Training Component
6.        The project training component would consist of the following
elements:
(a)   the development and training of a counterpart team of full-time
training staff with a view both to participating in implementing
the training component and forming the nucleus of a sector
training unit on project completion;
(b)   the provision of a multi-purpose expatriate team of short term
training experts with operational and training experience
covering the complete range of training needs related to
sub-project installations to be rehabilitated, and to
Headquarters Staff (including Area HQ) of the implementing
institutions;

possible follow-up Bank-financed project or implementation with
other donor-financing. The expert/counterpart training team
would operate as a sub-unit of the Project Coordination Unit.
7.        The size of the project-related training cadres is indicated by
the number of staff currently in post, supplemented by the project
recruitment rates for the period 1984-1987. The breakdown of these totals
by broad occupational categories is as follows:

Technical Assistance and Training Costs
8.        MLMWR and the sector agencies accept that technical assistance
would be required to iuplement the tralning component which would represent
the first phase of a long-term human resource development program for the
sector as a wholQ. A training consultant would be required and would be
appointed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the IDA. Criteria for
consultant selection would include the ability to provide the range of
training services required by the project training component and to satisfy
the broader needs of establishing a twinning arrangement for training with
the water supply and sanitation sector.

WATEK SUPPLY AND SANITATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Notes to Financial Statements
A. General
1.        The financial statements are based on information supplied by
NWSC, WDD and their consultants. Foreign price escalation rates were
assumed to be 3.5% in 1984, 8% in 1985 and 9% thereafter, while local price
escalation rates were taken to be 20X in 1984, 10% in 1985, 8Z in 1986, and
6% thereafter. The four towns currently under WDD's jurisdiction (Hasaka,
Mbarara, Tororo, and Mbale) are assumed to become part of NWSC's operations
at the beginning of FY89. Their staff, cash, accounts receivable and
payable, inventories, and fixed assets on a revalued basis would be
transferred to NWSC and treated as an increase in NWSC's capital.
B. Income Statements
Tariffs and Revenues
2.        Water consumption forecasts are derived from Annex 3.  It is
assumed that consumption would be billed and collected as follows: 60% by
NWSC and 30% by WDD in 1984, 60Z by both in 1985, 65% in 1986, 70% in 1987,
80% in 1988, 85% in 1989, and 90% in 1990. A commnn national tariff
structure and major tariff increases were introduced for NWSC and WDD in
M1ay 1984. It has been assumed that the common tariff structure would be
retained and that, until the results of the tariff study are available and
agreed upon, future adjustments would based solely an financial performance
criteria for NWSC prior to the transfer of the four towns in July 1988.
Thus, the average tariff has been set at levels that would allow NWSC to
produce revenues sufficient to cover its cash operating costs for FY86
through FY90, plus 15% of depreciation on a revalued basis in FY86, 25% in
FY87, 45% in FY88, 55% in FY89, and 65Z in FY90. This would require
increases in the average tariff in July of each year as follows: 30% in
1985, 22% in 1986, 21% in 1987, 17% in 1988 and 13% in 189.
Personnel Cost (Salaries, Wages, and Benefits)
3.        At the end of FY83, NWSC had a total of 1,213 staff (387
permanent and 826 non-permanent, but full time). It is estimated that the



-87-
ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 4
facilities at Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe from project completion, in FY87,
through completion of a follow-up project, in FY89. Thereafter, small
increases of about 2% annually would be required. NWSC's current (FY84)
annual expenditures for salaries, wages, and benefits amount to USh 44.0
million compared with an estimated level of USh 164.0 million required to
attract and retain the calibre of staff needed. Assuming the inflation
rates referred to in paragraph 1 of this Annex, the competitive level of
salaries, wages, and benefits in USh million, would be: FY84, 164.0; FY85,
188.6; FY86, 205.6; FY'87, 220.0; FY88, 233.2; FY89, 247.2; FY90, 262.0.  To
restore parity with WDD, NWSC's personnel costs were assumed to increase by
50% with effect from March 1984; they were taken to reach 90Z of the
competitive level in FY 1985 and 100% thereafter. In accordance with past
experience, salaries and wages were divided between water and sewerage in a
ratio of 65:35. WDD's personnel costs reflect consultants' estimates of
required staffing levels.
Transport
4.        These costs include fuel and maintenance and are based on
consultants' estimates.
Chemicals
5.        These costs are based on consultants' estimates.
Power
6.        These costs were based on consultants' estimates and reflect a
25% price increase to about USh 0.55 per kWh scheduled for January 1984 as
well as an assumed 400% increase with effect from July 1984, following the
appraisal of a proposed Bank power project; thereafter, price increases
were taken to be as indicated in paragraph 1 of this Annex.
Maintenance
7.        These cost estimates were prepared by the consultants and by the
appraisal mission.
Depreciation
8.        Based on the past and expected couposition of assets, an average
annual rate of 2.6% has been assumed for water supply assets through
FY86,and 3.7% thereafter. For sewerage assets, an average annual rate of
2.3% has been assumed through FY86 and 3.1% thereafter.
Balance Sheets
9.        Fixed Assets.  Asset registers have not been kept current and the
replacement values of fixed assets as of December 1983 have been estimated
by the consultants. Fixed assets and depreciation bave been revalued



-88-
ANNEX 18
Page 3 of 4
annually to reflect price escalations estimated at 5.75% in FY85, 8.5% in
FY86, and 9% thereafter.
10.       Work in Progress.  Capital expenditures for NWSC and WDD are as
shown in Annexes 15-17. Transfers to fixed assets were made as follows:
OOZ of other construction at the end of FY85, 100% of other construction
and 70% of work in progress on the proposed project in FY86, 80% and 90X of
work in progress on the proposed project in FY87 and FY88 respectively, and
60% of all work in progress annually thereafter.
11.       Accounts Receivable.  The Treasury has undertaken to withhold
from the mDnthly budget allocations to government ministries monies owed to
NWSC as of June 30, 1984. Accounts receivable from government ministries
as of March 31, 1984 amounted to USh 73.6 million. This would reduce
NWSC's total accounts receivable to about four months' billing by the end
of FY84. Thereafter, accounts receivable are assumed to represent two
months' billing, or 16.7Z of annual revenues. WDD's current and future
accounts receivable position is assumed to be similar to NWSC's.
12.       Inventories.  These are assumed to be increased gradually to 1%
of gross revalued plant in operation.
13.       Accounts Payable.  Accounts payable at the end of each year have
been assumed to be 15% of cash operating expenses for that year.
borrowings and Long Term Debt
14.       For NWSC, it is assumed that USh 4,262.5 million (about US$14.2
million) of the estimated USh 4,752.0 million (US$15.8 million) project
expenditure excluding interest during construction would be financed from
the IDA Credit. Of this, 70X, or USh 2,983.8 million (US$9.9 million), is
assumed to be on-lent to NWSC by the Government for 20 years, including
three years of grace. The annual interest rate would be variable and has
been assumed at 17% p.a. for the first three years and 10 p.a.
thereafter. Interest during construction, estimated at USh 547.4 million
(about US$1.8 million), is assumed to be financed by the Government by
being added to the loan balance. NWSC has for several years failed to
service long term liabilities to various creditors, mainly municipal
authorities. The total debt, estimated at about USh 44.6 million (US$0.15
million) including accrued interest, is assumed to be repaid over five
years, commencing in FY85, based on an average annual interest rate of
6.25%. In addition, FOS, a private Ugandan company, has at the instruction
of MLMWR undertaken rehabilitation work for NWSC estimated at about USh
43.0 million (US$0.14 million), while the Islamic Development Bank (IDB)
has financed pipes in the amount of USh 701.46 million as of August 30,
1983. The terms of payment by NWSC for these goods and services have not



-89-
ANNEX 18
Page 4 of 4
been formulated beyond a general intent that payment should eventually be
made. It has been assumed that these terms would be concessional: the
annual interest rate for both loans would be 10%, but the FOS-related loan
would be interest-free through June 1984 and would be repaid over five
years, while the loan for the IDB-financed pipes would be repaid over 15
years.
