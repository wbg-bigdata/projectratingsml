TUNISIA
SOLAR WATER HEATING PROJECT
Background.
1.    Tunisia is likely to become a net energy importer by the year 2000.  Its
36 million toe of oil reserves will be close to depletion before the turn of the
century, and in ten more years also its 80 million toe of gas reserves will
probably be exhausted. Currently 73% of total gas supply in Tunisia is imported
from the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline. Energy demand is rapidly growing:
projected average rates of growth across different sources of energy range
between 4 and 6% per annum.
2.    Tunisian dependence on hydrocarbons contributes to global environmental
degradation in the form of CO2 emissions. Commercial energy demand is met
primarily by petroleum products (78%), followed by electricity (11%) and gas
(9%). Electricity is generated from petroleum, natural gas and diesel. Tunisian
authorities are concerned with both long-term energy management and with the
environmental impact of energy use.   The Eight Plan (1992-1996) calls for a
reduction on reliance on imports and for increased emphasis on conservation and
renewable energy as well as demand side management based on least cost planning.
In the residential and tertiary sectors, energy management strategies include
promotion of energy efficiency and fuel substitution using least-cost sources.
More detailed information about the energy sector and subsectors as well as solar
energy use in Tunisia is provided in the Annex I.
3.    In contrast to the declining fossil fuel resource base, Tunisia has a
substantial solar resource base, with sunlight available between 2863 and 3326
hours per year. The average daily insolation ranges from 4.5 kWh/m2 to 5.2 kWh/m2
across the country. The ratio between observed insolation and the potential
(theoretical) maximum insolation (insolation index) varies between 64 and 75%.
For example, the same index in France ranges between 37 and 66%. Solar energy
for water heating is already used in Tunisia in the residential and hotel
sectors: it presently covers 1% of hot water demand whereas countries in the same
region such as Cyprus cover 60%.  The total potential market for solar water
heating in the residential sector is estimated to be 40% and 60% for the hotel
sector. This covers retrofit as well as new installations.
4.    Tunisia has several years of experience with the SWH technology (see Annex
II for a description of the experience) . The one local parastatal company, Serept
Energies Nouvelles (SEN), has supplied SWH systems for a total of about 30,000
m2 of collector area, mainly to the residential sector.The Energy Conservation
and Demonstration Project (LN 2735 TU) recently commissioned a 160 m2 SWH system
through ICB for a hospital in Gafsa. This installation, once operational, will
constitute a demonstration case for the hospital subsector, yielding thus better
cost and benefit estimates than are available now. The 420 m2 SWH system in the
Sultan hotel in Hammamet that was installed by SEN in 1988, will be brought back
to working condition and monitoring equipment should be installed so that it can
function as another demonstration case, for the hotel subsector.
GEF activity obiectives.
5.    The main objectives of the project are to encourage the substitution of
renewable solar energy for fossil fuels in all sectors except agriculture and
industry and thus mitigate global warming by maximizing CO2 displacement and
demonstrate the potential replicability of the selected approach - SWH - for
reducing global warming.
Prolect scope and GEF activity description
6.    Several factors constrain the market penetration of SWH in Tunisia. They
fall under the following categories: a) technology - local producers have so far
almost only catered to individual households and are not in condition to serve
a larger-scale, more sophisticated demand; b) price - the low price of
alternative sources of energy makes choosing renewable energy a difficult
economic choice; c) market conditioning/awareness - marketing and awareness
campaigns encouraging renewable energy use have not been sufficiently effective;



2
d) general obstacles to a competitive market - some fiscal distortions have
affected in the past the development of a competitive market.
7.    The project will contribute to the reduction of these constraints and favor
the development of a market for SWH technology. Economic appraisal (see Annexes)
has shown that currently in Tunisia investment in SWH constitutes an economically
viable choice (either for retrofit or for replacement of other means to heat
water) when it does not directly compete with natural gas. In the cases where
fuel oil or electricity are used to heat water, and assuming that SWH equipment
enjoys the favorable tax and duty treatment foreseen by the new Investment Code
(only 10% duty on imported equipment), a subsidy of 35% of the cost of investment
before tax is sufficient to generate a high internal rate of return and makes the
SWH choice attractive.
8.    The project  consists  of  two components:  a)  a  technical  assistance
component, which finances promotion and marketing activities, international
procurement of equipment to guarantee the selection of technologically efficient
and price-competitive equipment, and monitoring of the project implementation and
its impact in terms of market penetration and the environment; b) an investment
component, in the form of a 35% subsidy to the cost of investment in SWH, which
will make the decision of investing in SWH economically attractive to potential
users and provide the seed for the development of a self-sustained market.
9.     The project intends to promote the commercialization in Tunisia of the
environmentally benign SWH technology. It will target establishments that (a)
have a high demand for hot water, mainly hotels, municipalities, hospitals,
public sports centers, schools, mosques, and multifamily (residential) buildings;
and (b) do not have access to natural gas. The project will address new as well
as retrofit clients. Investments in SWH systems are already marginally economic,
with rates of return ranging from 10 years to over 20 years.
10.   The project consists of two components:
a) Technical assistance component (US $ 700.000), which will finance:
*     organizing and carrying out product promotion and publicity, to increase
market awareness;
*    preparing the ICB procurement in packages; this includes training for
private Tunisian consulting firms and AME, in order to more professionally
predetermine the size, costs, and prospective benefits from installing a
SWH system at a particular site. In addition, technical assistance will be
provided to AME to fully comply with standard Bank procurement procedures;
*     monitoring the performance of SWH systems, from the technical, economic,
and environmental points of view; this includes keeping records of
achievements to date, including the total amounts of C02 avoided, and the
average costs for doing so; carrying out a forward-looking evaluation of
the SWH systems installed in all selected commercial private and public
establishments in Tunisia and in a sample of the residential systems, to
identify the constraints to improved monitoring and maintenance. End-users
will collect data on a daily basis, which will be compiled and analyzed by
AME on a quarterly basis.
b) Investment in SWH eauipment by taraeted users of US$ 6.6 million) : the GEF
fund, together with Belgian cofinancing, by contributing with 35% of the cost of
investment before tax in SWH (including installation), will leverage a total of
US $ 20.9 million, of which 13.6 (representing the remaining 65% of the cost of
investing in SWH) will be provided by the beneficiaries either through borrowing
or self-financing. This amount will allow the project to finance about 150
tailored packages for SWH installations over a period of 10 years, and will
constitute the trigger for the development of a self-sustaining market for SWH
in Tunisia.

Prolect beneficiaries
11.   The direct beneficiaries of the GEF grant are the final users of SWH:
hotels, schools, sports centers, and large multifamily buildings through real
estate developers. Subsidies are provided to motivate users to invest in SWH
rather than in conventional water heating technologies. A successful
implementation of the project implies about 150 subprojects of an average size
of US$ 200,000. The Tunisian economy is a beneficiary as well, as less fossil
fuels are used to heat water.   Although at the moment Tunisia is exporting
petroleum products, in the near future it will become a net importer of
conventional energy products and the use of SWH technology will encourage the
diversification  of  energy  sources.  The  global  environment  is  the  final
beneficiary, as less greenhouse gasses will be emitted into the atmosphere.
Project implementation mechanism
12.   The recipient of the grant is the Republic of Tunisia. The recipient has
selected AME as the project executing agency. A special account will be opened
at the Central Bank of Tunisia.   AME will be the beneficiary of the first
component of the grant, which will cover its expenses as promoter, procurement
agent and supervisor of the project, and will be responsible for the
administration and audit of the account for the investment component. AME role
will be limited to acting as an intermediary in the financing of the SWH
equipment packages. Upon receipt by AME of suitable evidence of the expenditures
to be financed by the grant, AME will automatically process the withdrawal
applications.  To those ends, a suitable team shall be maintained within AME
throughout the period of Project implementation under terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank and consisting of technical specialists with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank.
13.   Potential SWH users become automatically eligible for obtaining the GEF
subsidy by demonstrating that they have secured private financing for the
purchase and installation of the SWH system (minus the potential subsidy). In
order to obtain the subsidy, the final user will first submit to AME a standard
form which includes basic site parameters, civil works' plans and timetables for
the installation of SWH equipment. The form will only contain basic information
on the site of the prospective installation and on the demand to be satisfied,
as well as the basic parameters of expected performance from the equipment based
on the hot water demand profile. A rough estimate of the cost of the SWH system
and its benefits is made at this time, and   GEF's future contribution is
estimated.
14.    Once these basic parameters are determined, and the user has shown to have
access to financing, the user will be automatically eligible for the GEF grant.
The subsidy portion (35% of before tax of the estimated cost of the equipment)
will be directly paid to the supplier according to the payment schedule specified
in the contract, which has been established to be divided in three tranches of
10,  80 and  10%.  AME,  as procurement  agency,    will  invite  international
competitive bids for the provision of the required equipment, preferably for
several installations at the same time to obtain economies of scale.   The
selected supplier will provide the specific design of the installation and
discuss this with the user directly. He should not deviate from the basic
performance parameters, but is welcome to suggest several alternative designs as
long as he specifies the expected performance. The supplier will be paid through
commercial financing and by the GEF and Belgium grants directly.
15.   It is important to notice that, once the beneficiary  (hotel, school, etc.)
has filled the preliminary standard form and produced evidence of its ability to
provide the remaining 65% for the purchase of the equipment, its request is
automatically eligible, and no review or judgement will be needed in order to
allow the release of the funds. The Bank will review groups of bids every six
months. The technical specification of the equipment to be installed will be
provided by the supplier.

16.   Users will be offered an additional incentive through the performance
guarantee (up to a prespecified period, to be given by the supplier) for the use
of SWH systems installed with GEF assistance. The earlier SWH experience strongly
suggests that this guarantee be required. All equipment to be financed under this
project will be subject to International Competitive Bidding. The bidding
documents will include a description of the maintenance services requested under
this guarantee. In principle, during a prespecified period, the supplier of the
equipment will need to demonstrate that the SWH installation indeed performs
according to the specifications.
Project cost and financing.
17.    The project is financed by a US$ 4 million grant from the GEF and by
Belgian cofinancing for BEF 105 million (equivalent to US$ 3.3 million), while
the private sector is expected to generate an additional US$ 13.6 million during
the life of the project, and much larger sums afterwards through private sector
financing. The grant cum cofinancing will provide a fund of about $6.6 million
to provide financial assistance to the final users for individual purchases and
installations of solar water heating systems, and will finance a technical
assistance component of US$ 700,000 mainly for support activities. As the grant
only finances 35% of the costs before tax of SWH equipment, final users will make
available the remaining US$ 13.6 million through commercial lending institutions.
Total project cost thus amounts to US$ 20.9 million. Estimated costs and
financing plan are described in detail in Schedule A.
Procurement
18.   A table in Schedule C summarizes procurement arrangements for the grant.
AME will carry out all procurement of the project in accordance with the
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, of the Bank, dated
May 1992. Standard bidding documents have been prepared by AME and reviewed by
the Bank.
19.   Goods.       To the extent possible, contracts for goods (SWH equipment for
a total amount equivalent to US $ 20.9 million) will be packaged appropriately.
Procurement of contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $ 250,000 or more
would require the Bank's prior review. All procurement of goods will be ICB. The
selection criteria agreed upon with AME are: price, price of spare parts (for two
years), technical specifications, guarantee of performance of the equipment,
after sale service.
20.   Services.   Part of the technical assistance funds made available to AME
can be used for hiring consultants for training on Bank procurement of either AME
staff or any procurement agent to whom AME decide to sub-contract part of the
procurement task. These consultants' services are included under the technical
assistance component. The cost of each of these services and the amounts involved
will be small (below US $ 100,000). Thus consultants will be directly retained
by AME and their TORs will be reviewed by the Bank. Contracts for consulting
firms estimated to cost over $100,000 and for the employment of individual
consultants estimated to cost over $50,000 and all terms of reference would
require prior Bank review. Employment of consultants shall be carried out in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency, dated August 1981.  AME will
be required to submit, not later than October 31 each year, a yearly work program
to the Bank for the use of the technical assistance funds for the following year.
A team will be appointed within AME, specifically responsible for the recruitment
and supervision of the technical assistance component.
Disbursement
21.    A special account will be opened at the Central Bank of Tunisia. The
special account will carry funds equivalent to four months of projected
expenditures in an aggregate amount of US$ 700,000. It will be replenished each
time funds are near depletion. The funds deposited in the special account will
cover both the technical assistance components such as AME expenditures for
promotion, procurement and monitoring, and the subsidy to the cost of investment



5
in SWH. Details on disbursement are described in Schedule B. The recipient shall
cause AME to appoint auditors acceptable to the Bank for the auditing of the
special account.
Rationale for GEF fundina and contribution to GEF Dortfolio.
22.   The present cost of water heating in the targeted sector in Tunisia, using
conventional sources of energy (particularly natural gas, but also fuel oil),
makes environmentally benign SWH economically unattractive from the point of view
of the individual investors. The supply of natural gas is limited to certain
geographical areas, and some of the main tourist areas are not in that zone. The
GEF grant will help make SWH attractive to the fuel oil user by reducing upfront
costs of the investments through a direct subsidy thereby improving the rate of
return on the investment and reducing the payback time. This is likely to result
in a relatively large volume of SWH equipment to be sold and used in Tunisia (See
Annex 3, Table 6 for market projections), whereby scale economies can be gained
while the infrastructure for repair and maintenance will improve, thus
facilitating long-term sustainability to the market penetration of SWH in
Tunisia.
Global environmental benefits.
23.   CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels form a considerable
contribution to the greenhouse effect in Tunisia. Global environmental benefits
resulting from the use of SWH can be substantial: first, because SWH equipment
once installed, can provide benefits over the service life of the equipment, at
least for 15 to 20 years; second, since the GEF involvement is expected to
trigger the commercial take-off of the market for SWH, giving rise to a
multiplier effect. The technical feasibility and market studies carried out by
international consultants and financed by a project preparation advance,
suggested a conservative market penetration scenario, starting with 5,000 m2 of
additional collector area per year in 1995 gradually increasing to 26,000 by the
year 2015. Resulting avoided C02 emissions would amount to 2,450 t in the year
1995, increasing to 125,000 t in year 2015. About 60% of the avoided emissions
would come from the hotel subsector.
24.   Total avoided emissions as a result of ten years of GEF intervention
(accounting only for equipment that was subsidized by GEF) would amount to
636,500t. Total emissions through 2015, accounting also for equipment that has
not directly been subsidized by GEF, would amount to 972,000 t, while total
avoided emissions over the lifetime of all equipment that would be installed
through 2015 amounts to over 2.5 million t of C02. The proposed project would
thus significantly reduce C02 emissions for a total cost of US $7.3 million. This
translates into an avoided cost of about $7.5 per ton of C02 on a discounted cost
basis, or $23 per ton of Carbon. Although these cost figures are not the lowest
for GEF projects in the Pilot Phase, they are within acceptable limits. Taking
into account the aforementioned multiplier effect and thus accounting for accrued
benefits, cost of avoided emissions can be as low as DT 1.8 per ton.
25.   In general terms, one m2 of collector area (for the hotel subsector, with
a solar coverage of 74%, see Annex 3, Table 4) will avoid the following C02
emissions in one year: 459 kg C02 in case electricity is replaced, 362 kg C02 if
fuel oil is replaced, 231 kg C02 if LPG is replaced, and 186 kg C02 if natural
gas  is replaced.    The energy pricing  situation  in Tunisia  is such that
substitution of SWH for natural gas or LPG is not feasible.   In addition,
environmental benefits are the highest for more expensive fuels such as
electricity and fuel oil. This double effect causes the project to concentrate
on those clients that have no access -- nor will have access in the near future -
- to piped gas, but are using electricity or fuel oil.



6
Form of innovation.
26.   The project is innovative since it will provide an unprecedented financial
incentive to the introduction the SWH technology in Tunisia for the benefit of
private and public large commercial users. This approach is new to Tunisia -
where SWH has had some success in the individual household sector but has not
been widely adopted by collective establishments - and on a worldwide basis - at
least in terms of the size of the financial support offered to the sector. In
addition, the method of financing entails the participation of private
institutions and a loan portion to guarantee cost recovery and long-term
sustainability to the initiative.
Demonstration value and reolicabilitv.
27.   The lessons learned from the Tunisia SWH project can serve as a model to
leverage penetration of solar energy in the targeted sector in other countries
where market barriers presently exist. The institutional and financial mechanism
put in place, with an important role given to financial institutions and private
participants, is also an innovative feature that can be replicated in other
countries. The use of competitive bidding procedures, and the willingness of the
local producers and authorities to ensure a substantial reduction of the barriers
to market competition are key elements in guaranteeing the demonstration value
and replicability of this project.
28.   The project will test the market for SWH for different scales of investment
in different circumstances (electricity replacement versus fuel replacement), to
adjust the minimum subsidy required for investors to choose the SWH option (now
set at 35%). It will thus also allow the Tunisian authorities, once identified
this minimum level in the pres?nt conditions of the market, to evaluate
alternative policy options to enhance market competitiveness and SWH technology
penetration. These could include either taxing other sources of energy to
encourage fuel economies, lower tariff duties on imported solar equipment, or
matching the GEF-provided subsidy on renewable energy with government funded
incentives in the future (for example, make the subsidy to investment in
renewable energy a permanent effort).
Sustainability.
29.   The market penetration studies prepared by consultants as a basis for the
project forecast that, after reaching a certain threshold in terms of m2 of
collector area sold each year, the commercialization process will become self-
sustaining. A key role in the success of this process will be played by the
opening of the SWH market to increased local and international competition. Local
financial institutions will mobilize a substantially larger amount of funds than
the initial GEF grant, thus extending the horizon of impact of the project.
Market competitiveness will be enhanced through the application of the exemptions
foreseen by the new Investment Code for renewable energy related equipment and
goods. The Recipient shall ensure, under any event (including if the Investment
Code is obrogated), that the cost finally incurred by the Beneficiary for the SWH
equipment financed under the Project equals the c.i.f. price of the imported
goods plus a maximum 10% tariff with no VAT taxes. In addition, assurances have
been obtained that the Recipient shall take at all times, during and after
Project execution, all action necessary to maintain a financially competitive
environment for the solar water heating industry adequate to encourage a
sustainable penetration of said technology and guarantee a permanent reduction
of the greenhouse gas emission. To this end, the Recipient and the Bank shall,
from time to time, at the request of the Bank, exchange views with regard to the
Recipient's incentives policies in the solar water heating sector and its plans
in respect of the overall development of the sector.
30.   Success of this pilot project will also be instrumental in guaranteeing the
continuation of this effort from the Tunisian authorities. Therefore, the long-
term sustainability of the effort will be increased through the initiatives that



7
the Tunisian government is putting in place for the support of renewable
energies, with the endorsement of the President of the Republic, and which will
become operational by the end of the century.
Monitorina and evaluation.
31.   Until now, the existing SWH systems in the residential sector have not been
monitored, and possible environmental benefits have been estimated rather than
measured.   Simple monitoring equipment  (such as calorimeters,  flow meters,
thermometers, kWh or Nm3 meters for back-up systems) will be installed in all SWH
systems financed under the project, and AME will ensure monitoring of performance
and determine actual environmental benefits. Financial monitoring of the GEF
fund will be ensured by AME and by the financial institutions involved.
Agreement has been reached with the Government of Tunisia on the specific
monitoring indicators to be employed for monitoring equipment performance and
environmental impact during the execution of the Project and its operational
phase. A report on this monitoring and evaluation activities shall be submitted
by the AME not later than February 15 each year. Agreement has also been reached
with the Tunisian authorities on carrying out not later than December 31, 1998
a mid-term review of the project with the Bank, which will inter alia evaluate
AME processing and monitoring record and the success of the project in terms of
market penetration of the SWH technology and environmental impact; this review
will identify problems and obstacles and agree on actions needed to improve
project implementation, including potential changes in project design.
Issues and risks.
32.   Market penetration: the main issue and risk for the project consists in its
demand-driven nature. After a careful economic appraisal, the mission has
concluded that with a limited grant support (35% of the cost of investment
including installation), targeting users who do not have direct access to natural
gas, investors can expect high rates of return from investing in SWH equipment,
and substantial market penetration will be reached during the next five years,
with an important positive impact on the environment. However, exogenous factors
could affect this calculation (general macroeconomic conditions, slump in
tourism, etc.), and thus there could be a lack of new SWH clients willing to
borrow from commercial banks or invest in SWH equipment. This could also happen
due to occurrence of technical problems from lack of maintenance, or from the
lack of technological improvements due to the absence of international
competition.
33.   This last concern is addressed by the project by demanding that maintenance
operations be performed on a regular basis (promoting the idea of maintenance
contracts), and by applying ICB on the one hand, and by providing technical
assistance to the producer of SWH in Tunisia to improve the quality of his
product line on the other hand -- if applicable.  In addition, the publicity
campaign to be launched and organized by AME is supposed to stimulate demand for
SWH equipment. During the mid-term review foreseen, the extent of market
penetration will be evaluated and other alternatives will be taken into
consideration in the case of insuccess.
Aareed Actions
34.   Agreements were  reached with regards  to the following matters:  (i)
maintenance of a project implementation team in AME for the implementation of the
project; (ii) carrying out of a mid-term review of the project with the Bank, not

greenhouse gas emission. To this end, the Government of Tunisia and the Bank
shall, from time to time, exchange views on the incentives policies in the solar
water heating sector and the government's plans in respect of the overall
development of the sector. Furthermore, the Government of Tunisia shall ensure
under any event, that the cost finally incurred by the Bank for the goods to be
financed out of the proceeds of the GET Grant and the Belgium Grant equals the
c.i.f. price of the imported goods plus a maximum ten percent (10%) tariff with
no VAT taxes; and (vi) procurement of goods and employment of consultants shall
be carried out in accordance with Bank's guidelines.
Conditions of Effectiveness
35.   Conditions  for  grant  effectiveness  include  the  appointment  of  the
implementation team for the project within AME and submission of the first yearly
work program for the use of technical assistance funds for project support
activities. Thereafter, this report should be submitted to the Bank not later
than February 15 in each Fiscal Year (FY) beginning with the FY after the FY
ending on December 31, 1995.
Conditions of Disbursement
36.   The disbursement of the proceeds of the GET and Belgium grant shall be
conditioned to the granting of the incentives and exemptions provided in the
Investment Code to SWH equipment or the configuration that the cost incurred for
such goods equals the c.i.f. price of the imported goods plus a maximum 10%
tariff with no VAT taxes.
Prolect Implementation Schedule
37.   It is expected that within three months from the date of signature of the
grant agreement, the recipient will appoint the project team in AME and prepare
the first yearly work program for the use of the technical assistance funds for
project support activities. By December 31, 1998, AME will prepare a mid-term
project implementation report, and a mid-term review will be performed with the
Bank. All applications for withdrawal of funds from the grant will have to be
presented on or before June 30, 2003. The project is expected to be completed by
December 31, 2003. The closing date for the project shall be June 30, 2004.
Environmental classification
38.   The primary objective of the project is to reCuce greenhouse gas emissions
and global warming by encouraging investment in environmentally benign SWH
technology. Therefore the project will not have any adverse environmental impact.
The environmental screening classification is "C" in accordance with O.D. 4.01,
Annex A.

The projected disbursement flow is presented below over a ten year period after
the beginning of the project.   As the project facilitates a take-off of a
commercial process that is supposed to grow over time, the disbursement profile
is that of an emerging market rather than a standard Bank project. The project
is expected to fully disburse in nine years.

Annex I
A.    TUNISIA: ENERGY AND TERTIARY SECTORS
1.    Energy Sector.
The energy sector is of considerable importance to the economic growth of Tunisia,
although less so than in the early '80s. The value added of petroleum products and electricity
accounted for 9.7% of GDP and 28.2% of gross industrial output in '88 and an average of
11.5 % and 32%  between '82 and '86. Tunisia is expected to remain a net petroleum exporter
until the year 2000, unless new oil fields are discovered. Biomass (mainly firewood and
charcoal) is still used, primarily in the residential sector and in rural areas. In '87, biomass
accounted for 16% of the energy demand. The industrial sector is the largest energy consumer
(37 %) followed by the residential sector (27 %) and the transport sector (25 %). The tertiary and
agricultural sectors each accounted for 6%.
a.    Energy Supply
Primary energy supply in Tunisia is dominated by crude oil that for 88 % comes from the
two principal oil production fields. Oil is used for electricity generation and as feedstock for
refineries. The production of crude oil is stagnating due to a limited resource base. Exports
of surplus primary energy dropped from 3 million TOE in '80 to 1.6 million TOE in '87, and
a deficit of 4 million TOE is projected for the year 2001. Reliable data on the resource base
of biomass do not exist. It is estimated that a substantial part of the wood supply comes from
maintenance operations in the agricultural sector (olive plantations).
The total supply of energy in 1992 was estimated by AME at about 6060 kTOE of which
23 % consisted of biomass. Some 20% consisted of natural gas imported from Algeria. The
availability of natural gas increased tremendously after '83 when the transcontinental gas pipeline
between Algeria and Italy was commissioned.

Annex I
Page 2 of 6
b.     Energy Demand
The demand for energy increased at about an average of 4.4% per year during the period
between '80 and '92. The growth in energy demand was higher than the growth of the economy
except during the recent period of slow economic growth ('91-'92). The increase in electricity
and natural gas consumption has been much higher and amounted to 7.7% and 12% per year
during the same period.
By type of energy, consumption of petroleum products is the largest (69.3 %), followed
by biomass (16.2%), electricity (8.4%), and natural gas (6.0%).  By sector, the industrial
sector is the largest energy consumer (35.1%), followed by the residential sector (27.3%),
transport sector (25.4%), tertiary (6.2%) and agriculture sector (5.9%).

Source: ESMAP
2.    Tertiary Sector
Although the tertiary sector consumed about 6% of the final energy demand, the sector
is growing rapidly because Tunisia devotes significant resources into developing it. As a result,
the value added of this sector has risen at an average annual rate of about 11 %.
The tertiary sector is made up of, inter alia, hotels, restaurants & cafes, Turkish baths,
hospitals, schools, sport complexes & swimming pools, the administration, and public lighting.
Of these, the hotel subsector consumes one-third of all modem energy consumed in the tertiary
sector. The second largest energy consumer is the Turkish Bath subsector, which consumes
17% of the total. By type of commercial energy, the tertiary sector's demand was satisfied by
in 1987 with 68% petroleum fuels, 32% electricity, 10% natural gas. In addition, wood was
also used, but data are sketchy. It was estimated that as much natural gas was used as wood.
However, in recent years, natural gas consumption has increased rapidly due to the
Government's energy pricing policy which favors the use of natural gas.

a.     Hotel Subsector
The hotel subsector is rapidly growing, particularly the one catering to luxury tourists.
In 1987 there were 37 four-star hotels and 83 three-star hotels. In 1994, some 50 hotels in these
classes with at least 500 beds each are under construction. Three and four-star hotels make up
28 % of the total number of hotels, but consumed 68 % of the energy demand in this subsector.
Intervention in the luxury hotel subsector is likely to be much more cost-effective and
expeditious than in the non-luxury hotels.
Electricity is mainly used for lighting and air conditioning, while fuel oil/diesel and
natural gas are mainly used for cooking and water heating. The use of natural gas is increasing
rapidly, but the gas pipeline is not available in all of Tunisia. The main tourist areas in the
South are not connected, and this is not likely to take place soon either. The following table
shows an overview of energy use by type of hotel.

b.    Other Subsectors
Other tertiary subsectors of interest are the Turkish Baths (Hammams) and sports
facilities, specifically those with swimming pools. The Turkish Bath subsector is consuming a
considerable amount of energy, but the demand is stagnant and there are not many new baths
under construction. Many of the Turkish Baths are located in the middle of towns and villages,
completely surrounded by other buildings. In addition to hot water, steam and spaceheating is
required as well. Precise energy consumption data are scarce, and the following table presents
estimates made by AME in collaboration with ESMAP in 1987, mainly based on the '84 INS
census.

3.    Residential Sector
In the residential sector, most energy is consumed for cooking (74%), while space (9%)
and water (7%) heating are the next largest energy consuming services requested. The following

Water heating accounts for 7% in the sample of all households, and for 15% in the
electrified households sample. Although this is a considerably large energy consumption, it is
not the first priority of households which have the means to use energy for other purposes than
cooking, space heating, and lighting. About 30%  of all households use some sort of water
heating equipment - other than a stove with which they cook and also heat water.
B.    Demand for Hot Water
The residential sector is by far the largest consumer of hot water, with 62 % of the total
consumption. Turkish baths are the second largest consumer (21 %) followed by hotels (11 %).
The following table presents the demand for hot water, the energy required, and the associated
emissions. Projections show that demand for hot water will more than quadruple for the
household sector and the sport facilities, while for the hotels, schools, and health facilities it will
more than double or almost triple. Thus, the importance of the residential sector for hot water
demand will even increase, and by the year 2010 it will be 80% of the total consumption. The
increase in hot water demand for Turkish baths is limited and an increase of only 30% is
expected by the year 2010.

C.   Solar Energy in Tunisia
The solar regime is good in Tunisia with more than 3000 hours of sunshine per year, and
an average daily insolation of 4.5 kWh/m2 (in the North) and 5.2 (South) kWh/m2. About
30,000 m2 of solar water heaters collector area is installed: 24,000 m2 for residential water
heating, mainly in households replacing electric water heaters (some 7000 systems); 5,000 m2
in some 30 hotels; and 800 m2 is exported to Morocco. One manufacturer of SWH systems
exist in Tunisia (SEN). Its capacity is about 5000 m2 per year, but it currently produces only
1000 m2. It has a product line with four different models: with a storage capacity of 200, 250,
300, and 500 liters. Cost of the systems (collector plus balance of system, BOS) range from $
312 to $430 per m2 of collector area. This price does neither include transport over 25 km, nor
installation. Another company which is no longer in business, SIAME, has produced SWHs.
Le Rayon Solaire is considering starting the production in Tunisia of SWH and other products.
The Government promoted the use of SWHs by providing tax incentives to end-users and
manufacturers:  exemption of VAT for imported or locally produced renewable energy
equipment; and financial assistance was provided for the purchase by households (initially a
7 year loan with 6% interest, which increased later to 10%), with payments through STEG's
electricity billing system.
Although some technical problems with SEN's products have been resolved (corrosion,
quality of collector), there still are a few remaining: the electrical backup heater will always
keep the temperature of the water at 60 C (thereby decreasing environmental benefits), there is
currently no maintenance and after service provided to the SWIH systems already in use.
As a result of these problems, sales of SWHs have decreased, and they seem to be
bottomed out at about 1000 m2 of collector area per year. Import of SWH is not prohibited,
but an import duty exemption does not exist, hampering the imports of SWH and forcing local
production to be more in-line with international standards, both in terms of quality and prices.

1.    Assessment of existing technology and experience
1.1   Collective systems
There is at present only one tertiary sector SWVH (Solar Hot Water) system in the whole
of Tunisia: a 420 m2 installation at the "Sultan" hotel in Hammamet. Apart from this, there are
some thirty hotels which have individual SWH units installed on bungalows, three hotels that
have solar swimming pool heating systems and one hotel using a combination of solar energy
(pool heating technology) for pre-heating water which is subsequently upgraded in temperature
by an electrically driven heat pump.
The present project does not aim at pool heating (small potential for C02 saving) nor
heat pump systems (replacing low grade solar energy by high grade electricity) and so only the
experience of the Sultan hotel is relevant. This means that the experience with collective SWH
in Tunisia is limited to a single installation.
Neither has this unique experience been a success. An analysis of the energy consumption
figures before and after installation of the solar system showed that a substantial drop in energy
consumption occurred in the months immediately after the solar system became operational
(august 1988) but the energy saving became gradually less until at the end of 1988 the energy
consumption per person/night was on the same level as before installation of the solar system.
This situation then continued unchanged until the present day.
From observations on the site it would appear that due to severe scaling in the heat
exchangers, only a fraction of the available solar heat is actually put to use. This would normally
result in energy saving: however a second heat exchanger, between the back-up boiler and hot
water storage, is probably equally badly scaled and gas fired boiler needs to operate longer and
on a higher temperature in order to heat the water to the desired temperature. Thus, what little
solar gain there still is, it is compensated by a lower than usual boiler efficiency, resulting in
about zero net energy saving.
Such a situation, although extreme in this particular case, is typical for SWH systems
with integrated back-up facility. Any reduction in solar contribution is automatically compensated
by the back-up and because the end result (sufficient hot water) is good, the management is often
not aware that the solar system is not operating well and so money is being lost by burning fossil
fuel unnecessarily.
To minimize the chances of this to happen, it is important that 1) the installation be
adequately metered (energy flux, waterflows, pressures and temperatures) so that changes can
be noted, 2) that the operating staff be trained so as to know what to look out for and how to
deal with problems and 3) that the management monitors the monthly energy bills.



Annex 11
Page 3 of 12
1.2   Retrofit
The feasibility of retrofitting a SWH system to an existing heating plant depends mainly
on the physical possibility to accommodate collector field outside and the extra storage capacity,
heat exchangers and plumbing inside the existing building. This usually entails more elaborate
plumbing and so tends to raise the installation cost to a higher level than would otherwise be the
case for first time installation. The overall difference in investment cost for initial or retrofitting
is however is usually low.
For solar systems of less than 300m2, the option of collectors with integrated storage
can be particularly attractive for retrofitting because this avoids almost all plumbing and storage
facilities in the existing boiler room.
The solar system should in all cases be considered as providing pre-heated water to the
normal fuel operated water heating system. As such it does not replace the normal equipment
but rather it constitutes an addition. This is all the more so because for hotels in Tunisia, the
same fuel fired boilers are also used in winter to provide space heating.
1.3   Solar fraction
The solar fraction or solar coverage is the part of the load on annual base, which is
covered by solar energy. As a rule of the thumb system are designed in such a way as to
maximize the solar fraction without generating surplus energy at any given time. Generally this
means that systems are sized for about 100% solar coverage for the months of maximum
insolation (July, august), accepting that in the months of less insolation the back-up boiler will
cover the energy deficit. There is however some room for adjusting the north-south angle of the
collectors by which the solar energy supply can be reduced in summer compensated by an
increase in winter. This "flattening" of the supply curve is often useful where energy demand
remains constant throughout the year.
For tourist hotels, which is the main target group for this project, the demand for hot
water already resembles the annual solar energy supply curve because the room occupancy rate
is much higher in summer than in winter. This means that the overall annual solar fraction may
be in the order of 80-90%. For other applications such as hospitals, public bath houses and
schools the situation is less good because hospitals and public baths are likely to have a constant
demand and schools may be even worse because they often close in the summer months.
There is no experience in Tunisia to substantiate such estimations as there is only a single
hotel with solar water heating, which has not been monitored and which only worked for a few
months.



Annex II
Page 4 of 12
1.4   Local manufacture capacity
At present there is only one local producer of SWH systems, which is the parastatal SEN
(Serept Energie Nouvelle). This company in fact makes only individual systems and is at present
in serious financial difficulties. There is no engineering capacity at the moment to design tailor
made collective SWH systems, nor has any experience in this field been generated. Although
it was this company that supplied the SWH system at the Sultan hotel, it was at that time in
collaboration with ELF (oil company) who provided the know-how. This collaboration has been
terminated and a new partner has not yet been found.
SEN produces solar collectors which could be used for collective SWH systems, but
comparison of performance figures revealed that the efficiency of their collectors is about 20%
less than that of present state of the art collectors on the international market.
If SEN survives the present crisis, a collaboration with a foreign company will be
essential in getting access to the know-how required to redesign their individual systems and to
design collective systems. Redesign of the individual systems will be necessary to improve
cost/performance ratio, increase durability of the storage tank and reduce maintenance
requirements.

2.    Assessment of ICB procedure for the Gafsa hospital pilot project.
2.1.  Procedure
The procedure followed in this case was that of a design, elaborated in detail by a
consultant, on base of which suppliers could bid. In fact it is a copy of what is the usual
procedure for conventional fuel fired hot water systems. A perfonnance guarantee contract will
soon be signed between the supplier, a French consulting firn and the installer with the
agreement of the Hospital administration. In this particular example a number of shortcomings
in using the same procedure for solar systems have become apparent after scrutinizing the tender
documents:
The adopted luxurious design has led to a high cost, leaving no option for the
suppliers to propose more economical concepts.
There can be no guarantee of overall system performance as it was not the
supplier who was responsible for the engineering. Only sub components
performance can be guaranteed such as collectors, heat exchangers, pumps etc.
The basic parameters such as daily hot water requirement, annual profile of daily
requirement and daily consumption profile were estimated on base of very few
hard facts and so could well have a margin of error in the order of 50%. This
means that the total solar system designed on these paraameters may be either 50 %
over or undersized. The effect of this on the economics is considerable, especially
in the case of oversizing when surplus heat will be generated.
The calculations as to the optimal solar fraction (solar energy contribution to the
total) were ambivalent, leading to a less than optimal solar fraction chosen.
It was further noted that the minimum collector efficiency specified in the technical
specifications was 10% higher than what is presently possibly to obtain. Nevertheless SEN
offered their collectors which have 27 % lower efficiency than what was required. In view of the
foregoing a different tendering procedure should be adopted in which 1) the supplier is free to
propose the most cost effective design, 2) the supplier is responsible for the design of his system
and should guarantee its overall performance.
Furthermore, given the importance of the parameters, based on which the supplier
designs the system, it is very important to establish these parameters with as much accuracy as
is practically possible, rather than basing the on (weak) assumptions as was done in this pilot
project. The parameters such as hot water requirement should preferably be measured during
a number of months so as to be sure at least for some months what the daily requirement is as
well as the daily consumption profile.



Annex II
Page 6 of 12
Careful consideration should also be given to determine the temperature at which the hot
water should be made available. Generally 45C is taken as sufficient for bathing and showering
whereas for kitchens and laundry 55C is preferred. The intelligent use of thermostatic valves and
if feasible the use of separate circulation loops for the different temperature levels, can avoid
that all the water is heated to the highest temperature (55C) requirement. This temperature aspect
is important because setting unrealistic high temperature results in system oversize and bad
economics.
2.2   Technology assessment and suggestions
As stated earlier, the design of the system was already done and the supplier could only
offer equipment as was specified. The following observations can be made as to the choice of
technology and specifications for the Gafsa project and suggestions as to what is suitable for the
Tunisian market:
Hot water storage
The design is such that the full storage capacity is subjected to the mains water pressure.
This requires large volume pressure vessels which are relatively expensive (figl).
A better alternative would be to incorporate the storage volume in the primary solar circuit and
transfer the heat to a small back-up reservoir through a heat exchanger (fig.2).
In this design the storage is much cheaper because it is pressureless and at the same time the
problem of corrosion and scaling in the main storage is avoided as no fresh water enters the
system.
Whether or not a non-pressurized storage can be used depends largely on the daily hot
water extraction profile. In case of a non-pressurized storage, the momentary heat demand must
be extracted through a heat exchanger which consequently must have a high capacity when a
large part of the daily consumption is concentrated in a short time. In a pressurized system the
heat is already in the water to be used so it can respond easier to demand peaks. It is clear from
this discussion that hard data on the daily hot water consumption profile are of primary
importance for the system design and calculations.
Another storage option which has only recently come on the market is the so called
integrated storage in which each collector module is combined with a storage volume (fig.3).
This makes the system completely modular, avoids most of the normally required plumbing and
takes up no space in the boiler room. It has only a variable cost component (contrary to systems
with separate storage which have both a fixed and a variable cost component) which makes the
cost/m2 insensitive to scale between about 30 and 300 m2. Above 300m2, separate storage often
becomes more economical.



Annex 11
Page 7 of 12
Frost protection
For the Gafsa project an anti freeze additive has been provided in the primary (collector)
circuit. This option is not the cheapest, there are likely to be difficulties on the long term with
the supply of the glycol and there is a danger to health in case through leakage of a heat
exchanger, the glycol gets into the consumption water system. Particularly for collective systems
it would be a better option to chose a drain-down design. In this option the collector circuit
drains down, either by gravity or by a pump, the moment the temperature drops below zero.
It should be noted though that frost protection will rarely be needed in Tunisia, particularly not
in the area where most of the tourist hotels are located.
Colectors
The type of collectors as to be used for the Gafsa project i.e. flat plate, single glazing
and selective coated absorber, is the most suitable.
Heat exchangers
Plate heat exchangers are suitable and most often used because they are easily accessible
for cleaning (removing scale deposits) and by virtue of their large heat transfer surface, they
provide a high rate of heat transfer at low temperature difference. Another option is tubular
spiral heat exchangers, placed inside the storage tanks. They are not so sensitive to scaling as
plate exchangers but their accessibility for cleaning is generally less good, particularly when a
large units are used. This option only becomes attractive if a modular approach is chosen for
the storage. For instance a series of Im3 tanks, connected in parallel, each tank having its own
internal heat exchanger which, because being small, can relatively easily be removed for
cleaning. Internal heat exchangers in the tanks (fig.4) reduces the need for circulation pumps
from four to two, lowering investment cost and electricity consumption while also simplifying
the system.
Initially shell and tube heat exchangers were specified for Gafsa, which would not have
been suitable because they are bulky and difficult to clean. This has later been changed to plate
exchangers.
Thermal insulation
Only the insulation exposed to the sunlight should be metal covered, to prevent
degradation due to ultra violet radiation. The insulation of the pipes, storage tanks and heat
exchangers, usually installed inside a building does not require metal covering. For the Gafsa
hospital it was specified that all insulation, including the storage tanks, should be metal covered,
this unnecessarily increases the cost.



Annex II
Page 8 of 12
Monitoring equipment
The following meters should be provided as a minimum:
-     kWh meter between the cold water inlet and the hot water outlet from the solar
storage tank in order to monitor the solar system's effective energy output.
-     Water meter in the water intake to the hot water system to measure the hot water
consumption.
-     Water meter in the collector loop (primary circuit) to check on the circulation.
-     Thermometers should be fitted at all entrances and exits of tanks and heat
exchangers.
-     Pressure gauges should be fitted at all entrances and exits of the heat exchangers
in order to check on pressure drops associated with scale build-up.
For the Gafsa project it was not clearly specified which gauges are to be fitted where.
Circulation pumps
The circulation pumps for the primary and secondary circuits need not be necessarily of
the twin parallel type as was specified for the Gafsa project. This doubles the cost of the pumps
and adds no value to the system. It is advisable though that a spare pump of each type is always
kept in stock, particularly for the pump in the loop between the boiler and the back-up storage
tank.
Safety
Protection shall standard be provided against overheating, which should at least include
a mechanical pressure relief valve as a back-up, even in case some other safety measure such
as automatic draining of the collectors has been envisaged.
2.3   Prices
The prices for the SWH system for the Gafsa pilot project included additional steel
structures for accommodating the collectors, remote monitoring equipment and anti freeze
protection. These costs have been isolated and deducted. The component cost was then adjusted
by leaving out the obvious "luxury" items such as double circulation pumps, total insulation
metal cladding, excessive system marking etc.
This deduction process resulted in a system cost with some reference value. The total
system cost was then broken down into costs which can be considered as "fixed costs" largely
independent of system size (within limits) and "variable costs" which are dependent on the
collector surface to be installed. For the Gafsa project this analysis resulted in a overall system
cost for 240m2 of $ 480/m2, composed of $ 160/m2 of fixed costs and $ 320/m2 of variable
costs.

Compared with prices obtained from different sources as to specific system costs in
Europe, the cost for the offered system in Tunisia stands out as high, as can be seen from the
table below:

A:    Storage integrated into collector
B:    Separate storage system
Although the cost of a solar system, made in a European country, delivered and installed
in Tunisia is likely to be higher because of the distance, this increase is likely to be offset by
a corresponding decrease in labor cost for installation and a judicious use of locally available
equipment such as storage tanks, piping etc.
3 Maintenance and durability
3.1   Durability
A SWH system includes very few moving parts and if well designed will not be much
affected by corrosion. The predominant factor determining corrosion and scaling is the water
quality. In the case of Tunisia the water generlly has a large mineral content causing both
scaling and corrosion (chloride). For this reason it is common practice in Tunisia for the
conventional collective hot water systems to install a "water softener device" upstream of the
system. This works well to reduce scaling and to some extend also corrosion. Provided that the
water softener is most of the time operational, it can be assumed that the water entering the solar
heating system is of an average quality in terms of scaling and corrosion characteristics. Based
on the general experience and observations at the Sultan hotel (solar installation 6 years old and
storage tanks 12 years) the following service life estimations for the different sub components
of the solar system seem realistic in the Tunisian context:



Annex 11
Page 10 of 12
Collector
Usually corrosion proof because the shell is made of aluminum, the cover of
glass, the absorber of copper and the insulation of a non degradable material.
Provided that the same water is constantly recirculated through the absorber, the
absorber will not be affected by scale build-up or corrosion. It is generally
assumed that good collectors will last at least 20 years and most likely still work
well up to 30 years.
Storage tank
For this item the durability depends very much on the system design (constantly
fresh or recirculated water), on the material (stainless steel or carbon steel), wall
thickness, coating, water quality etc.
The lifetime for storage tanks may thus be in a range from a minimum of 5 years
for an in-line pressurized carbon steel tank to a maximum of about 30 years for
a closed loop non pressurized or stainless steel tank.
Heat exchangers
-     Plate heat exchangers, due to their ease of cleaning and the fact that the plates are
made of stainless steel have a virtually unlimited service life.
If spirl tubes inside the tanks are used, they can last up to 25 years if made from
(the right type) of stainless steel or not much more than 5-10 years if made from
carbon steel.
Circulation pumps
-     The pumps can be affected by scaling (depending on which circuit they are in)
which affects their lifetime and the motor life is shorter than normal for pumps
because of relatively high temperatures in which they need to work. Generally
pumps don't last more than 5-8 years.
Valves and plumbing
-     Only the part of the plumbing where the water is constantly renewed may be
subject to scaling and corrosion, depending on factors such as local temperature,
flow velocity, presence of copper containing metals etc. The valves in the system
are few and rarely used. It may occur that a valve needs to be dismantled for
cleaning (from scaling) but these occasions will be rare.
Electric controls
-     The electric controls for the solar system are simple and consist generally of two
differential switches, each with two temperature sensors. One for activating the
circulation pump in the primary loop and the other for the secondary loop.
Manual overriding switches should be provided plus motor protection relays for
over current. The service life of these components tends to vary widely but as an
average about 10 years may be assumed.

3.2   Maintenance
The maintenance work on a collective SWH system is little and most of it can be carried
out by the existing maintenance staff of the facility (hotel or other), provided proper instruction
has been given. The danger with these installations is that because of the presence of a back-up
boiler, one may not be aware of a reduced solar system performance. It is only by regularly
monitoring the solar energy flux (through the kWh meter) that performance reduction can be
noted. This is really where the maintenance begins.
Once a performance reduction has been observed, the cause of it must be diagnosed
before it can be corrected. Proper instruction of the maintenance staff by the equipment supplier
is essential here, including maintenance manuals and fault finding charts.
The normal maintenance work to be expected will be:
Cleaning of the collector.
The collector glass covers will generally need washing twice a month or after dust
storms. For this purpose water taps must be located conveniently in the collector field,
to attach a garden hose.
Cleaning of the heat exchangers
When the pressure gauges fitted on the inlets and outlets of the heat exchangers show an
increase in pressure drop (because of scaling) dismantling and cleaning is indicated. The
scaling will normally only occur on "fresh" water side, not the side where the same
water is being recirculated. The frequency of this operation depends very much on the
mineral content of the water (after softening). In extreme cases it may be necessary every
three months and in the best of cases at least once a year. When cleaning a plate heat
exchanger it is often advisable to replace the gaskets which assure the sealing between
the plates and it is essential to keep a stock of gaskets on site.
When spiral tube heat exchangers are used, performance reduction can only be observed
by monitoring the in and outlet temperatures because the scaling takes place on the
outside of the tube and so does not affect the flow resistance. Removal and cleaning is
easy provided the units are small enough to be handled by two persons. The manhole
gaskets will generally need to be replaced after a cleaning operation.
Cleaning the circulation pumps
The parts of the pumps which are in contact with the water such as the impeller and
inside of the pump casing are also likely to be effected by scale deposits. This results in
a decreased flowrate which can be observed from the installed watermeters. The
frequency of de-scaling the pumps is usually not high, not more than once every 2 years.
In order to reduce the chance of scaling in the pumps it is important that they be fitted
in the coolest part of the circuit. It is advisable to keep one pump of each type in stock
on site in case complete replacement or cleaning is necessary.



Annex II
Page 12 of 12
Cleaning pipework and valves
At some points in the system scale deposits may lead to reduced circulation flow rates
and must then be cleaned. This is not likely to happen more than once in 5 years if the
system has been well designed i.e. the pipe diameters should be sufficiently oversized to
be able to accommodate some scaling without affecting the system performance.
Flow distribution in collector field
The average flow through each collector should be in the order of 50 /min.m2, with
variations of 10% under or above still acceptable. If however the flowrate in certain parts
of the collector field becomes too low, the efficiency will be affected. A collector field
is generally composed of a series of parallel banks with common inlet and outlet pipes.
Each inlet to a bank should be provided with a throttle valve and pressure gauge
(downstream of the valve) and the adjustment of the throttle valves should be such that
the pressure gauges all show the same reading. This is part of the starting-up procedure
but changes may take place over time and periodic adjustment may be necessary.

Annex III: Economic Analysis of Solar Water Heating Project
Methodology
The analysis is carried out in two steps: first, the appropriate level of subsidy is detennined for
typical potential users in each subsector, taking into account the specific details for that subsector
and user; second, the results of this are applied to a market penetration model which relates
disbursement profiles to avoided emissions for each subsector to estimate overall environmental
costs to the project.
To identify the maximum level of subsidy for a particular end-user in certain subsector, one
determines the total avoided emissions over the lifetime of the equipment, multiplied by the
maximum acceptable cost per ton of avoided C02 emissions, and divided by the cost of the
equipment. As a result of the subsidy, the payback time on the investment shortens, and the
internal rate of return increases. Cost elements taken into account in this analysis are the
investment costs, operational, repair and maintenance costs, and fuel costs. Benefits are avoided
fuel costs. Environmental costs are not considered in this analysis. Potential clients of the SWH
project, mainly owners of tertiary sector establishments, are basically interested in technical and
financial performance of waterheaters, and take their decision based on these criteria.
Whether the benefits resulting from the subsidy are sufficient to convince potential users to
invest in SWH rather than in conventional boiler technology, can only be determined in practice.
In theory, payback times are roughly 3 - 5 years (with an IRR of about 20%), and this normally
should be sufficient for private sector participation. Discussions were held with owners of
tertiary sector establishments indicated that indeed they might be interested in investing in SWH
technology. This is confirmed in practice as several owners requested from AME more
information on the future SWH program.
The level of subsidies are used as input in the market penetration model, and the cost of the
subsidy represent the costs of the project. Benefits of the project are the avoided emissions.
The outcome of the model is the overall cost of avoided emissions for all subsectors combined
which should not exceed the maximum indicated by GEF guidelines.
Assumptions
As mentioned in the main text of the report, SWH cannot compete with natural gas boilers. this
is for two reasons: first, the price of natural gas is very low (and thus financial benefits of
avoided fuel consumption are low too), and second, environmental benefits are also low because
natural gas is a relatively clean fuel.
Electricity would be the best fuel to replace but there are only few tertiary sector establishments
using electricity for water heating. This is often done, however, in the residential sector, but
intervention in this sector in the framework of the project is limited to real estate developers
only.



Annex III
Page 2 of 7
The second best fuel to replace is fueloil, which is the main form of energy in the tertiary
sector. This is changing though, and particularly natural gas consumption is increasing rapidly.
However, many parts of the country will not be connected to the natural gas network for the
foreseeable future. The project will target its potential clients in these regions.
Three scenarios for the costs of a SWH system in Tunisia are considered, one which is based
on the recent ICB for the Gafsa hospital procured under the CR 2735-TUN Energy Conservation
Project (160 m2 of collector area; in many ways this has been a luxury project, and does not
really reflect the state of the art; see also Annex II for a description), the second is based on
average international market prices at this time, and the third is based on the lowest cost system
found at this time, assuming that in the future this system can be installed in Tunisia for the
same costs. Fixed and variable costs components for SWH systems of size 100 m2 to 500 m2
were considered. Fixed costs amount to DT 23,500 (imported) and DT 15,000 (local) for each
system, while variable costs amount to DT 160 per m2 (imported) and DT 160 per m2 (local).
These costs include taxes (for imports), parts, and labor (See Table 1).
Based on the reports from consultants engaged by AME for this project (TECSOL, MRS
Entreprises), certain assumptions were made on the distribution of total energy use for water
heating in each tertiary subsector, as well as economic growth and the maximum potential clients
for retrofitting existing water heating installations as well as new clients (See Table 4) for each
subsector.
The solar coverage is the total annual contribution of the SWH system towards the energy needs
for water heating in a year. This is a simplification, as there are certain peak times: diurnally
corresponding to (for hotels) taking a shower after waking up and at the end of the afternoon,
and monthly, corresponding to the tourist season. A sensitivity analysis will need to be carried
out by the potential user in collaboration with the supplier of the equipment to determine the
optimum configuration. In general, one looks at the energy demand during the peak month for
insolation, and determines the size of the SWH system accordingly.
Results of Analysis
Tables 1, 2, and 3 show the baseline case for a medium-sized hotel for the installation of a 350
m2 SWH system. The "without case" (when the hotel owner invests in a fueloil boiler) is
compared to the "with case" (SWH installation) for the three scenarios. A GEF subsidy of 25 %
will result in a financial internal rate of return (IRR) of about 20 % to 28 %, with a corresponding
payback time of 3 to 5 years. The costs of avoided emissions range from DT 7.6 to DT 9.5 per
ton, mainly depending on the cost of the SWH installation. It is assumed that SWH costs will
lie between the "International Market" and the "Future Market" scenario.
In current terms the costs of avoided emissions are expected to decrease from their present
levels: cost of equipment is likely to become available for lower costs due to improvements of
sector efficiencies as a result of international competitive bidding and increase volume of sales.
This also implies that future avoided emissions will be available at lower cost as a result of the
GEF project, or, that it is not very important when initially the costs of avoided emissions are
somewhat higher than the GEF criteria.



Annex III
Page 3 of 7
Tables 4, 5 , and 6 show the market penetration scenario broken down by subsectors: hotels,
Turkish Baths, schools, health institutions, sport facilities, residential buildings. Table 4 shows
the assumptions for each subsector. Solar coverage and Cost of SWH system are derived
parameters: solar coverage depends on the end-users' energy demand, the collector area, and
the insolation at the site; the cost of the SWH system mainly depends on the size of the system
(due to scale economies), solar coverage, and site specifications.  As an example, it will in
general be more expensive to install an equally sized SWH system in a Turkish Bath than in a
hotel. Turkish Baths are usually built in the center of town, fully enclosed by other buildings,
and often with a dome or otherwise round roof making installation of panels difficult. In
addition, for steam generation and spaceheating, high temperature water and air are necessary
that cannot easily be generated by SWHs.
Avoided emissions amount to 293 ktons of C02 over the lifetime of the equipment that is
installed through the GEF grant. The avoided cost of emissions amount to DT 8.1 per ton.
However, one can argue that, because the project's objectives are to trigger sustainable
development of the SWH market, it is appropriate to take into account the results of that
development. Over a period of 20 years, avoided emissions amount to 972 ktons, resulting in
an avoided cost of DT 2.5 per ton of C02. Taking into account all avoided emissions resulting
from the investments done during a 20 year period (starting from the onset of the GEF project),
avoided emissions would amount to 2.5 million tons, resulting in avoided costs of about DT I
per ton of C02.
Discussion
The project is a worthwhile one indeed, with a large potential for global benefits. Unit costs
of avoided emissions as the immediate result of the project may be a bit high compared to other
Global Warming projects. However, if one takes into account the results of the market
penetration at a larger scale as the result of the GEF project, unit costs drop quickly to very
attractive levels. Given the level of participation of the private sector and of tapping into
existing schemes and procedures, the likelihood of succeeding is relatively high. In addition,
the introduction of performance guarantees will help establish positive client reactions and help
avoid the earlier mistakes with SHW in Tunisia.

Annex 4

Annex IV - Monitoring Program
All SWH systems subsidized by the GEF program will be monitored. Data to be collected
include infonnation on the quantity of C02 emission avoided and the operation (technically
and economically) of the SWH systems for the different target groups in Tunisian. These
data are also important for the design of future SWH systems to be installed. For this
purpose the following monitoring program is proposed:
Data recording
Basic data will be recorded by the user on a daily basis. AME will collect and summarize
these data and prepare monthly performance reports (by SWH system installed with GEF
assistance). For the first year of operation, it is recommended that AME collects data sheets
from users on a monthly basis, but over time -- and if the system performs according to the
specifications -- this may be reduced to four to six times a year.  Annual progress reports
for the project as a whole will be prepared as well, outlining technical and economic
performance by subsector as well as obtained environmental benefits.
Data to be measured               How to collect
Energy supplied by the
solar system.              -      Calorimeter between the solar storage tank and the back-up
storage tank. The cold water inlet will be taken as temperature
reference.
-      Cumulative registration.
Energy supplied by the
back-up boiler.                   -      Calorimeter between the outlet of the back-up storage
and the entrance of the distribution system. The
preheated water from the solar storage tank will be
taken as temperature reference.
-      Cumulative registration.
Hot water consumption.      -      A watermeter to be placed in the cold water feeding line to the
solar storage tank.
-     Cumulative registration.
Fuel consumption.          -       Fuel (oil or gas) meter, measuring total fuel consumption
including space heating, cooking and hot water back-up.
-     This meter is normally present and need not be part of the
solar installation.
Hot water temperature.            -      To be taken at the entrance to the distribution system.
-     This cannot be cumulative and so must either incorporate a
writing device or an electronic data storage facility.



Annex 4

Maintenance.               -     Maintenance contracts must be signed between the beneficiary
and the installer; AME can perform a direct supervision of
one or two pilot projects; for all others, supervision will be
performed on the basis of reports regularly transmitted to
AME.

8) It should be noted that out of the above listed instruments only the temperature recorder and the
second calorimeter are supplementary to the gauges and meters which should normally be provided in
a collective SWH system. The extra cost for GEF monitoring would consequently amount to $ 1250
+ $2000 is $ 3.250 per SWH installation.
