                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is India's flagship program for improving equitable access to quality elementary (grades 1-8)education and has been implemented for a decade now
                         with a total investment of INR 1624 billion or US$ 30 billion (US$ -INR exchange rate ofUS$ 1= INR 55.247). The World Bank has been supporting the program since 2004 through
                         two phases of sector wide approach (SWAp)(first phase during 2004-2007 and second phase of support since 2008). The total assistance in the second phase amounting toUS$1.35
                         billion, including additional financing approved in 2010 (US$ 750 million), is fully disbursed and the project is closing on 30th September 2012. In addition to the World Bank, DFID
                         and EU together provided US$ 595 million to the second phase of SSA).Since the enactment of the Right to Education (RTE) Act in2009, SSA has also been designated as the

                         The16th Joint Review Mission held during July 18-28,2012 reviewed (based on a desk review of all relevant documents, discussions with Centre and State governments and
                         implementation societies) the progress of the program towards achieving its goals as well as the implementation of various interventions. The program has so far been successful in

                         bringing in at least 5.5 million out-of-school children (of the estimated 13.4 million out of school children in 2005) into school system.There are around 192 million students in the
                         elementary education system in the country in 2011-12 (compared to 159 million 2002-03and 175 million in 2006-07), out of which 147 million children (100 million at primary and 47
                         million at upper primary level) were enrolled in government or aided schools that implement SSA programs (source: DISE 2011-12) and hence were direct beneficiaries of the
                         interventions in 2011-12. Around 73.7 million of these students in SSA (government and aided) schools were girls. The shares of children from disadvantaged groups (Scheduled
                         Castes and Scheduled Tribes) among students now match with that in general population. Primary to upper primary transition rates have improved from 81% in 2007-08 to 87% in
                         2011-12. A sophisticated system for carrying out National Assessment Surveys (NAS) is in place now which has produced the first ever national assessment for gradeV using item
                         response theory and methods and is currently undertaking the NAS for grade VIII. The Grade V NAS results have provided key insights into the nature of learning happening in the
                         country. The analysis comparing the data with that of second round ofGrade V survey using classical testing tools shows that in Language and Environmental Sciences, mean
                         scores have improved in 24states (out of 35) while in Maths, improvements were significant in 14states.

                         Apart from these key outcomes, the project has been successful in increasing the nature and quality of outputs in the system. 650422 new classrooms were added till 2007 and
                         another427285 classrooms were built since then (till March 2012). 79500 new teachers were recruited during 2004-07 while 405000 teachers were recruited during 2007-12. By
                         recruiting new teachers and by training and regularizing the non-regular teachers, 936047 regular teachers were added to the system during 2007-12. 58% of the additional regular
                         teachers brought into the system between 2007 and2012 were female teachers and this has increased the share of female teachers in the system from 37% in 2007 to 42% in 2012.
                         PupilTeacher Ratio has improved from 38 in 2005-06 to 32 in 2010-11 at primary level and from 31 to 29 at upper primary level. In2012-13, 730,000 more teachers are sanctioned to
                         be recruited, based on the Teacher Eligibility Test results conducted at National or states level.

                         On the quality front, all states have initiated reforms. States have either revised their curriculum and textbooks; or adapted the new curriculum and NCERT text books. States have
                         developed and are implementing context specific LearningEnhancement (LEP) programs. Different states are experimenting with Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CEE)
                         techniques in the classrooms to refine their methods for tracking the development continuum of the students in both scholastic and co-scholastic areas. State specific efforts to
                         monitor quality interventions and outcomes are showing encouraging trends.
