1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background: India, a country of over a billion people with a per capita
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about $1,046 (2007) at the start of the project, has made strong
progress in reducing poverty and enhancing access to education. Poverty rates have fallen from
45 percent in the 1980s to below 25 percent in the last two decades, with per capita GDP now at
$1,410 (2011). Significant progress was also made on human development indicators –life
expectancy more than doubled from 31 years in 1947 to 65 years in 2012 and adult literacy more
than quadrupled, from 18 percent in 1951 to 74 percent in 2011. However, in spite of all these
achievements, the most populous states remained lagging behind others in many economic,
social and human development indicators, making the growth and development story of India a
more complex one.
In 2007, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Government of India’s flagship program for
universalizing elementary education of satisfactory quality, had completed five years of
implementation. The Bank and other development partners had supported SSA with the first
phase of their support (2004-2007).1 There were considerable achievements – especially on the
access agenda. The number of out of school children were reduced from 25 million to 13.5
million, gender parity was close to being achieved and substantial progress had been made in
terms of enhancing access to other social groups (schedule castes and scheduled tribes) and the
transition rate from primary to upper primary education had increased from 75 percent to 83
percent. While these were significant, GoI realized that challenges still remained, in terms of
access to the most marginalized and at the upper primary levels and on improving education
quality and requested the Bank and other development partners to continue supporting the
program. By the time of SSA II Additional Financing , the Government of India had passed the
Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE), which became effective in April
2010. The SSA program was designated as the official vehicle to implement RTE and SSA
norms and framework were revised to fully align with the RTE provisions.
Rationale for Bank assistance: SSA II was the second phase of external support to the
Government’s continuing SSA program. The rationale for Bank support was compelling. First,
the Bank and other Development Partners (DPs) had successfully supported the elementary
education sub-sector in India over the past decade through the GoI’s District Primary Education
Program (DPEP), and SSA I. The Bank’s 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) highlighted
the importance of supporting SSA - both in terms of meeting GoI’s development and poverty
reduction goals, as well as moving towards the achievement of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) on a global scale, particularly Universal Primary Education, Gender Equality and
Women’s Empowerment. Second, continuing support for SSA could facilitate the broadening
and deepening of the quality and equity agenda, the success of which was critical to achieving
the goals of the program. Third, supporting the achievement of high quality elementary
1
 Prior to supporting SSA, the Bank and other development partners had supported the Government’s District Primary Education
Program (DPEP), through eight projects, some of which ran concurrent to SSA.




                                                             1
education was a critical foundation for higher levels of education and skills which were likely to
have a significant impact on economic development. Finally, while the DPs’ financial
contribution would only be small relative to the Government’s own resources, past experience
had demonstrated the value of the sector wide approach to improve implementation of the entire
government program by bringing in comparative global experience, designing the rules of the
whole program, and support implementation, monitoring and evaluation through technical
assistance.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project’s PDO was to significantly increase the number of 6-14 year old children, especially
from special focus groups, enrolled, regularly attending and completing elementary education
and demonstrating basic learning levels.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were:
    Reduction in the number of out of school children from 13.4 million (2005) to 4.9
      million.
    Enrolment shares of girls, Scheduled Castes (SCs), and , Scheduled Tribes (STs), in
      primary and upper primary maintained or increased, relative to their share in the
      population at the national and state levels
    Attendance rates of students at primary and upper primary level increases from 70% and
      75% respectively to 85% and 90%
    Retention rate at primary level increases from 71% to 75%
    Transition rate from primary to upper primary increases from 81.3% to 89%
    Learning levels adequately and regularly monitored;
    Improvement in learning levels at Grade 3
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The objective was not revised. The Results Framework was revised with additional financing in
March 2010 for greater realism and to include targets for the additional years through 2012. In
particular, new baselines for the Indian FY 2007-08 (in a few cases the baseline is 2009) were set
to provide greater realism to the target indicators rather than relying on 2005 baseline data from
the PAD, and targets of the three key KPIs (number of out of school children, the transition rate
from primary to upper primary, and the retention rate at the primary level) were modified2.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The expected beneficiaries of the project included:

   Children (particularly girls, SC and ST children, and children with disability) in the 6-14 year
    age group who were out of school and who would enroll as a result of the program efforts
    and investments to reach out to all children.
2
 Changes in the targets for some results indicators were however not labeled as restructuring in the ISR. Nevertheless, the
changes in the project were approved by the Board together with the Additional Financing.




                                                                2
   All children in the school system from Grade 1-8 would benefit from the SSA interventions
    to improve quality of education, through the provision of additional teachers, school
    facilities, free textbooks, supplementary teaching and learning materials etc.
   Other beneficiaries would include various institutions and individuals expected to benefit
    from the implementation experience as well as the capacity building efforts, including:
    National Council for Educational Research and Training, (NCERT); National University for
    Educational Planning and Administration, (NUEPA); State Councils for Educational
    Research and Training (SCERTs); State Institutes of Educational Management and Training
    (SIEMATs); the Block Resource Centers (BRCs) and Cluster Resource Centers (CRCs); and
    the Village Education Committees (VECs); and Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs).
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The core activities financed under SSA II included:
(A) Improving Quality with Equity: The quality enhancement framework with a clear focus on
education service delivery and capacity building, with the following main pillars: ensuring basic
provisioning (teacher training, textbooks, educational materials, etc.) to create enabling learning
conditions for all children; capacity building and academic support to State and sub-State
structures; monitoring of educational outcomes; and, research and evaluation studies.
(B) Universalizing Access and Promoting Equity: A combination of demand and supply side
interventions were financed to enable the hardest-to-reach children to attend school. These would
include the establishment, construction and extension of primary and upper primary schools and
classrooms in districts where access was still an issue, and provision of teachers. Demand-side
interventions included provision of free textbooks and other materials to reduce household costs
related to elementary schooling.
1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
Additional Financing: An additional credit of SDR 482.6 million equivalent to US$ 750 million
was approved in March 2010.

Background: While SSA II was on track to achieve its PDO, the agenda to ensure that all
children completed elementary education and achieved satisfactory learning levels remained
unfinished. The GoI requested DPs for further assistance to complement GoI resources to
address this ambitious agenda under SSA. Additional financing covered a financing gap in
FY2009-10, generated by strong implementation capacity of the 35 Indian States and Union
Territories and higher than expected SSA II expenditures in FY2008-09, which had led to full
disbursement of the original IDA credit ahead of schedule. Without the additional financing to
cover the financing gap for FY2009-10, and to help finance the costs associated with additional
and expanded activities to enhance the impact of the project for the Indian fiscal years of 2010-
11 and 2011-12, achievement of the project’s development objectives would have been delayed
and the Bank’s technical and fiduciary support would not have had its intended impact.


                                                 3
Expanded and Additional Activities: The additional financing supported:
   Additional expansion of primary schools (Grades 1-5) into elementary schools (Grades 1-8),
    construction of additional upper primary classrooms, procurement of teaching and learning
    equipment (e.g. for science) and classroom furniture, hiring of additional subject-specific
    upper primary teachers, distribution of textbooks to all upper primary students.
   Eight States to convert their present elementary education system of 7 grades to 8 grades.
    This implied curriculum reform, recruitment and training of subject-specific 8th grade
    teachers and provision of textbooks.
   Assistance to States for curriculum renewal, based on the National Curriculum Framework of
    2005. This required revision of State textbooks and new forms of student learning assessment
    which emphasized continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE), and related teacher
    professional development.
   Recruitment of additional teachers and implementation of teacher professional development
    programs.
   Improved teacher performance and student learning outcomes through rollout of Learning
    Enhancement Programs (LEPs), focused on reading and basic numeracy in the early grades, in
    more than half of the country’s 1.2 million elementary schools.
   Further strengthening of academic support to schools to increase school-based academic support
    through Block Resource Centers (BRCs) and Cluster Resource Centers (CRCs), and to ensure
    that resource persons (RP) hired to provide this academic support are qualified for the upper
    primary level.
   Further strengthening of School Management Committees/Village Education Committees
    (SMCs/VECs), by training their members in the preparation and implementation of School
    Development Plans, as well as in their academic oversight and fiduciary responsibilities.
Changes to SSA resulting from the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009. As per RTE, a policy
initiative having legal sanction, ensuring compulsory education means “compulsory admission,
attendance and completion of elementary education? by all children in the 6-14 years age group.
MHRD designated SSA, its flagship program for universalizing elementary education in the
country, to be the vehicle through which RTE provisions are implemented. The Act, which came
into effect after project effectiveness, brought several significant changes into the SSA program.
The IDA Credit continued to fund the whole program. The significant changes were:
   Requires each State had to come up with the RTE state rules notification, and take up
    systemic measures like setting up State Council for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) in
    each state.
   Ensured that eight states moved from 7 year to 8 year cycle for elementary education,
   Gives new norms for school access for each habitation; requires complementary transport and
    residential facilities; and prescribes higher minimum standards prescribed in terms of school
    facilities and infrastructure for all schools.
   Requires age appropriate enrolments, which necessitates special training programs to improve the
    skills and knowledge of out-of-school children to allow them to enter school with their age
    group.


                                                 4
   Lays down norms and standards, both in terms of teacher qualifications and terms and
    conditions of service of teachers as well in terms of the Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR 30:1 for
    primary and 35:1 at upper primary, to be maintained at school level).
   Qualifying in a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is now mandatory for all existing and aspiring
    primary and middle school teachers in the country.
   RTE endorses National Curriculum Framework 2005 (NCF 2005) as the framework for
    initiating quality interventions and goals.
   Provides incentives like free textbooks to all children at the elementary level (as against that
    to children from SC/ST and girl categories under SSA) and provides free uniforms to all
    children at the elementary level
   There is a 25 percent reservation in the first grade in private unaided schools for children
    belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker sections. The RTE also mandates that schools
    cannot screen or filter entry to school.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The overall quality at entry was satisfactory. (There was no IEG report.) At the time of project
preparation, the government had demonstrated a high level of commitment to the objectives of
the project. The program covered over one million government and aided schools in all districts
in the country, and had national leadership with the Prime Minister as the Chairman of the
National Elementary Education Mission. Political support was further augmented through
passage of the 86th Constitutional Amendment (2002) which gives every child between the ages
of 6 and 14 the right to elementary education. The high level of political will was reflected in
consistent budgetary increases, especially with revenue generated through a 2 percent education
cess imposed on income, service tax and capital gains tax. In addition, as mentioned above, the
RTE came into effect prior to the SSA additional financing (2010).
Building on lessons learned during the implementation of SSA I, the program had evolved in
several ways including:

   The approach to financing became more performance and reform based. Cost-sharing
    between the Central Government and the States provided a built-in incentive for States to
    make maximum use of centrally provided grants; norms were made more flexible and the
    Annual Work Plan and Budget3 (AWP&B) approval process ensured that the Districts with
    the greatest needs would receive the largest amount of resources. The funding mechanism
    itself provided incentives, ensured equity and rewarded implementation progress.
   Enhanced flexibility was built in to support differentiated needs to address the challenges of
    diverse local contexts. Greater flexibility was provided to states and districts to respond to


3
  The District Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWP&B) process was at the heart of SSA implementation. Practically all SSA
expenditures and activities were driven by the AWP&Bs prepared by about 600 districts of the country. It was within the process
of AWP&B development, endorsement, appraisal, approval and monitoring that the SSA Framework for Implementation became
operationalized throughout the country.


                                                              5
    their special needs, and to combine this flexibility with accountability for agreed targets and
    this was reflected in the AWPBs.
   To enhance focus on quality, greater attention was paid to classroom processes as well as
    outcomes. Priority was given to monitoring of classroom processes and learning, providing
    states flexibility to innovate on interventions that emphasized improved pedagogy, and
    providing local academic support to teachers to address the diverse needs of classrooms.
   Greater use of data in planning and monitoring. Emphasis was placed on improving data
    quality and its increased use in decision making. Special focus was provided to address the
    capacity constraints to implement a program of student assessments and to evaluate the
    impact of programs on outcomes and quality. A Technical Cooperation (TC) Fund, financed
    by DFID, to enhance capacity at both the central and state levels for this purpose was put into
    place.


The Bank’s support to SSA through a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) facilitated a programmatic
approach to address the issues in a holistic manner through collective dialogues and focus on
sector-wide results. Since a SWAp encourages harmonization of borrower and donor fiduciary
system by using country systems for financial management and procurement activities, the effort
was to enhance government’s own fiduciary system, build internal capacity and sustainability,
and strengthen government ownership. The Bank’s partnership with other DPs (DIFD and EU)
and with the Ministry of Human Resource Development helped it to leverage the relatively small
resource contribution4 with greater supervisory, monitoring and evaluation and technical
improvements. The support also added value in terms of bringing its comparative global
experience, and enhancing implementation, analytical/technical support, monitoring and
evaluation and leveraging results on the ground.
Risk Mitigation Measures. The PAD identified weak fiduciary capacity especially at
decentralized levels, inadequate capacity to implement the program in lagging states, and
challenges associated with improving quality of education in the short-term. The risks were
appropriately identified and handled effectively in project design. Mitigation measures proposed
were realistic and were informed by lessons learned during the implementation of the SSA
project.
2.2 Implementation
Implementation progress remained satisfactory or moderately satisfactory during the project
period.
Strong and continued government commitment was central to successful implementation of the
program and for addressing governance constraints to effective service delivery. Many reform

 Bank and DPs contributed less than 10% of total SSA budget allocation. The United Kingdom’s Department for International
Development (DFID) co-financed the project with about US$ 300 million including a Technical Cooperation (TC) Fund for
approximately US$ 10 million, and again provided additional financing for approximately US$ 220 million including an
additional US$ 8 million for the TC Fund. The European Union (EU) provided approximately US$ 100 million via the SWAp,




                                                            6
actions required fundamental institutional changes (e.g. merit-based teacher recruitment, greater
involvement of communities in decision making, strengthening roles and responsibilities of
institutions all the way down to the school level). MHRD also engaged pro-actively with
counterparts in MoF and the Planning Commission to ensure adequate funding for the project.
Having a robust SSA framework, which served as the project’s operation manual, facilitated the
states to prepare high quality annual work plans. Further, the whole process of planning,
appraisal, implementation and monitoring were well organized. This mitigated the weaknesses in
staffing levels in implementing agencies, especially at the local level.
The SWAp strengthened donor collaboration and coordination and minimized the transaction
costs and reporting requirements for the government. The SIL instrument used for SSA provided
the multi-year support for implementation of sector-wide reforms. Additionally, it contributed
toward an alignment of priorities in the education sector between the Bank, DFID and EU, and a
strong partnership between the donors and the government remained over the project period.
Regular and sustained dialogue between the DPs and the national and state governments and
stakeholders at the district and school level facilitated steady implementation progress in most
aspects of the program. Technical inputs from the Bank, including analytical reports and just-in-
time policy and technical assistance notes, supported design and implementation of key
activities.
The Joint Review Missions (JRMs) under SSA II were the hallmark of the partnerships with the
government as well as the DPs. In these missions, each agency contributed experts in particular
areas, thus maximizing the supervision impact and worked alongside government experts.
Further, the JRM mechanism provided the forum to shift the program’s focus onto quality issues,
with greater dialogues on curriculum, pedagogy; text book preparation, teacher development and
training, etc.
There were two main factors that slowed down implementation and hindered project progress.
First, several states faced implementation challenges due to limited capacity at state, and district
levels. Availability of engineers and regular monitoring personnel at the district and sub district
level was a problem in many states. States like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for
example, had to struggle with accelerating their pace of construction in providing classrooms for
all their learners. District level staffing was well below norms in most of the large spending
states. Of particular importance was the State Project Directors, who in several States were
fulfilling several positions (for States implementing very large SSA programs this was of
particular concern). Lack of continuity of key personnel, including the State Project Directors,
was an additional problem in most States. This had an impact on quality of expenditure
considering that outlays continued to increase every year.
Second, these capacity constraints meant that the project faced continuous challenges in
translating budgetary allocations into expenditures. While impetus given by the RTE Act meant
that budget allocations for the SSA program increased substantially during the SSA II period
(2007-08 till 2011-12) from Rs. 20,000 crore to Rs. 60,000 crore (about US$12 billion), states
had a difficult time absorbing these additional resources with expenditures growing from about
Rs. 15,000 crores to over Rs. 38,000 crores during this period.




                                                 7
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
M&E design. The project had developed clear Project Outcome Indicators and Results
Indicators to assess progress in meeting the project implementation targets and objectives using
government systems.
M&E implementation. The District Information System for Education (DISE) was used for
monitoring school level indicators. School Report Cards were available on the Internet where in
all school related information was provided. Project Monitoring Information System (PMIS) was
used to track progress in project components. 41 independent Monitoring Institutions
periodically reviewed the outcomes and implementation of SSA-II. The two JRMs per annum by
the GoI and DPs reviewed the program in a comprehensive way including at state and local
levels. Data from independent agencies like the National Sample Survey was used to triangulate
results on access and equity. Special studies carried out under SSA-II tracked learning
achievements and other quality related processes. These data were closely monitored and the
actual figures were compared with the target values. However, monitoring was much more
effectively done than evaluation; with only a few good quality evaluations carried out using SSA
funds making it more difficult for states to learn from each other and expand successful
programs. In the last year of the project, NCERT published program evaluations5 of the Learning
Enhancement Programs in four states.
Technical Cooperation Fund: SSA II included a Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF), which was
financed by DFID. The TCF strengthened capacity of NCERT at the national level, and through
it, at the state levels in learning assessments and the evaluation of quality initiatives. The TCF
enabled the use of relevant national and international expertise and best practices in support of
building capacities for enhancing measurement of learning levels at a standard that was
equivalent to international levels.
M&E utilization. Appropriate data collected from various sources was evaluated and used to
inform decision-making on certain activities. For example, information from the annual
household census/registers was used for community monitoring of out of school children and to
devise local strategies to include these children. The quality of the DISE data has also improved
significantly and triangulates well with other independent surveys. DISE data was used to
identify Special Focus Districts, and was used to develop the Education Development Index
(EDI) to facilitate the targeting of resources according to needs. Further, interventions were
planned across all the districts in the country in different components like Access, Equity and
Quality based on the analysis of the data. The use of data for planning and appraisal is evident
from the extensive references to it in the Annual Work Plans of districts / states and the minutes
of Project Appraisal Boards.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard Compliance: Safeguards compliance is assessed as satisfactory.

Social Aspects. The Social Assessment appraised the SSA Results Framework and SSA
implementation processes at State and District levels, examining the mechanisms and criteria
used to ensure social and gender equity. The framework focused attention on Special Focus
Groups (SFGs), notably girls, SCs and STs, disabled children and deprived urban children and
special focus districts (SFD) and other socially/educationally disadvantaged groups. During the
project period these groups were mainstreamed in State and District planning, appraisal and
implementation, training and monitoring.
MHRD prepared checklists for planning and appraising the States and Districts AWP&Bs to
ensure that specific actions were taken for these special focus groups. The checklists were
incorporated in the Planning & Appraisal Manual for use during implementation. Similarly,
gender issues were addressed in all aspects of the program and in other related schemes with
which the SSA converged. SSA continued to strengthen its convergence with other related
Government programs such as the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), midday meal,
women’s and girls’ empowerment (Mahila Samakhya), Drinking Water Mission, etc. This had
contributed greatly towards equity and improved learning experiences for all children.
The SSA framework called for special attention to be paid to tribal children, among “special
focus groups?. Some of the specific interventions for tribal children in SSA included provision of
school facilities in tribal areas, deploying and providing specific support for teachers in these
areas, and preparing special instructional materials for tribal children.
For girls, under the National Program for Girls’ Education at the Elementary Level (NPEGEL)
program, special focus was given to education of girls from ST communities. The scheme was
targeted to educationally backward blocks where the level of rural female literacy was less than
the national average and the gender gap was above the national average, as also in blocks that
had at least 5 percent ST population and where the ST female literacy rate was below 10 percent.
Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) schools were provided for girls in educationally
backward blocks, where a maximum of 75 percent girls enrolled were from ST, SC, OBC
Minority Communities.
Environmental aspects. Environmental issues were related mainly to civil works, including
construction of toilets and water facilities in schools. The Environmental Assessment (EA) for
the SSA II was undertaken and completed in September 2007, including findings from National
Third Party Evaluation (TPE) conducted in several major states. National level monitoring
consisted of TPE, periodic reviews by project implementing authorities and special monitoring
visits by TSG and other members. National level monitoring was supplemented through the joint
review missions (JRMs). These missions were effective in identifying shortcomings and
highlighting good practices. DISE coverage had expanded across all schools and it provided
critical information needed for planning. The JRM reports indicated that overall construction
quality has been satisfactory.
A further innovation under SSA I1 was the inclusion of environmental audits which were
conducted by special teams using engineers within the State implementing agencies. All States
and UTs were covered in a cycle of three years. The audits provided the State technical teams an
opportunity to learn through self-evaluation.

Fiduciary
Fiduciary compliance is rated as moderately satisfactory
Financial Management (FM). Financial Management on SSA was guided by a comprehensive
Manual on Financial Management (FM) and Procurement (FMP) that has been prepared,
translated and disseminated across the states implementing the program. The following were the
major strengths of SSA financial management: (i) funds flow was robust and used electronic
channels for transfers to states, and in a significant number of states for transfers to districts; (ii)
audit was as per a standard Terms of Reference (ToR) which requires an opinion of the truth and
fairness of the financial statements, and reports provide insights in operation of the program in
states; (iii) MHRD conducted quarterly review meetings of Finance Controllers of states; (iv)
independent Concurrent Financial Review (CFR) provided useful insights to GOI/ DPs in
operation of the program; and (v) roll out of financial accounting software (specifically in all
large spending states) though manual account keeping is yet to be discontinued.

On the other hand, some significant areas of concern included: (i) internal control was weak,
including delays in bank reconciliations, weaknesses in internal audit and no settlement of
advances; (ii) delays in receipt of audit reports; (iii) audit reports had continuously highlighted
issues year after year but the same had not been effectively addressed; (iv) shortage of financial
management staff at the district level (average vacancy is close to 50%) was a persistent problem
across most of the large spending states, but had not been effectively addressed; and (v) block
level staff were hired but significant vacancies remained. These issues, seen with the significant
increase in SSA outlays, had led to a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory since early 2011 till
project closure. The inputs (capacity building measures) as mentioned above; though significant,
have not been effective in addressing the shortcomings identified on SSA.

Disbursement. Disbursements were made once a year around July/August for eligible
expenditures incurred in the prior fiscal year (which ends in March). Disbursements were based
on Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) covering the previous fiscal year, and program
expenditures reported in the FMRs were subject to confirmation/certification by the annual audit
reports of all implementing agencies and States. GoI submitted to the Development Partners a
Consolidated Report of Audits summarizing the findings and certifying total program
expenditures as reported in the individual audit reports of all implementing agencies by
December 31st of each year.
Procurement. Procurement for SSA II was carried out in accordance with SSA Manual for
Financial Management and Procurement (FMP) Manual, which was developed for SSA-I during
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The procurement under SSA II was
handled at National, States, Districts, Bloc/Cluster and Village/School levels. The main items
procured were civil works, teaching materials, textbooks, computers, consultant and non-
consultant services.
MHRD published financial and procurement audit reports of State implementing agencies on the
SSA website. In addition, the States were required to disclose their procurement plans, contract
opportunities, bid documents and contract award information on their website, as per Central
Vigilance Commission (CVC) requirements. Post-reviews conducted during implementation
showed no major procurement issues, and any issues raised were addressed effectively.
                                                   10
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(a) Transition arrangements. The arrangements for continuing progress appear to be adequate:
Technical, financial, commercial and institutional provisions: Based on the recommendations of
2010 Bordia Committee, SSA Norms have been modified to align them with the stipulations of
the RTE Act. Accordingly, the framework of implementation of SSA has been rewritten. Further,
government has approved about US$46 billion for SSA towards implementing RTE for the
period 2010-15.
Implementation of financial, economic and other policies required for effective operation and
maintenance: The SSA Framework for implementation has been revised with effect from April
2011. Similarly, the Manual on Financial Management and Procurement was revised to reflect
the new SSA framework for implementation. All rules of the program for financial management,
procurement, reporting etc. which were developed with the Bank’s assistance would continue for
future programs.
Timely provision of all necessary inputs: The GoI has issued directives and guidelines to states
and states to districts regarding development of work plan and budgets prioritized according to
the stipulations and timelines of the RTE Act. These plans were approved to provide necessary
resources to ensure the provisions and meet the timelines as mandated by the Act.
Adequate staffing and management: The one area of concern is that, considering the increased
quantum of outlay approved year after year, States will need more staff for the effective
implementation of the programme, in addition, to filling up the existing vacant posts.
(b) Monitoring and evaluation. A robust monitoring system for SSA is in place. At the
grassroot levels, communities in general and SMCs in particular monitor the implementation.
(c) Follow-up project. The GOI 12th Five Year Plan observes that improving school inputs are
just the starting point in improving educational quality, and that the major challenge for the next
Plan period is to focus on improving learning outcomes. This includes the need for high-quality
independent measures of student learning levels and trajectories over time, improved teacher and
school accountability, and resources for large-scale instructional changes that will lead to
improvement in classroom transactions. The next phase of SSA will focus on these issues. SSA
III is expected to be effective in FY14.
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objective The objective is still highly relevant, timely and appropriate to the
current needs of the country’s social and economic development. It is also timely and
appropriate to the needs of India’s education sector. The objective is consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (dated) which emphasizes improved delivery of public services as the first of
three key pillars. In addition, this financing would contribute to a second pillar of the CPS -
achieving rapid, inclusive growth – by reducing the human capital constraints to growth in both
rural and urban areas.


                                                11
Further, a major focus of the Twelfth Five Year Plan6 will be on implementing the objectives of
the RTE Act and aligning the government policies and practices with the overall goal of
providing quality schooling for all children until the age of 14 years. There would be four
strategic areas under SSA during the Twelfth Plan. These are: (i) strong focus on learning
outcomes; (ii) addressing residual access and equity gaps; (iii) focus on teacher and education
leadership; and (iv) linkages with other sectors and programs.
Design and implementation: The core design of the project and implementation arrangements
remain highly relevant. The project activities have contributed to: increasing the percentage and
number of children completing elementary education and continuing on to secondary education.
The SSA program has also seen a significantly enhanced focus on quality. The mechanisms for
measuring learning outcomes effectively are established, but too recent to measure progress
during the project period. The implementation arrangements of SSA II had also turned out to be
effective and efficient for achieving the project objective.
Rating: Considering these factors, the relevance of objectives, design, and implementation is
rated High.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The SSA II project supported the GoI’s SSA program in partnership with GoI, DFID and the EU.
The project provided the DPs with a strong platform to coordinate and link their support to a
Government program under a common results framework. The Project’s PDO was to enhance
access and make it more equitable, measure learning levels and make progress towards
improvements in quality. This has been broken down into four major PDO areas. At project
completion, significant progress has been made towards achievement of the access and equity
objectives and measurement of student learning levels. However, while many inputs for
improved quality have been provided, there is no evidence yet of improvements in learning
outcomes.
The details of the project’s major outcomes and achievements are as follows:
PDO I. Universal access and reduction in out of school children (OOSC):

Indicators: (i) Reduction in the number of out-of-school children aged 6-14 years; and
(ii) Enrollment in elementary school increases in absolute terms.
Measuring the number of out of school children is challenging, so three different sources of
measurement have been used and triangulated. All sources indicate that the target is met. First,
MHRD estimates OOSC on a yearly basis through conducting a detailed household child census.
As per this data, at present (in 2012-13 academic year) the OOSC among 6-14 years old are only
around 3 million, well below the target of 5.1 million. Second, MHRD commissions third
party/independent household surveys every few years to measure the number of OOSC. The
first such survey (2005) estimated that the number of OOSC was around 13.4 million. In 2009,
the second independent survey indicated that the number of OOSC had reduced further to 8.1
million. The third independent household survey (2012-13) is still underway. It is worth noting

6
    Twelfth Five Year Plan- (2012–2017) Social Sectors, Volume III (Planning Commission, Govt. of India)


                                                              12
that the data from the first two independent surveys has closely matched the data from MHRD
census estimates, which leads us to believe that the third survey will confirm that the number of
OOSC will be well below the target of 5.1 million.
A third approach is an analysis of the independent National Sample Survey (NSS) data, carried
out by the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO). While data from the latest NSS round
(2011/12) are not available, the number of OOSC fell by 2.37 million annually between 2007/8
and 2009/10, and given past trends would indicate that the OOSC would fall to around four
million by 2011/12 – again exceeding project targets.7 Another approach is triangulating the
trends using other independent surveys available. As per ASER (Pratham) surveys, around 4.3%
of rural 6-14 years in India were out of school in 2008 while in 2012, this proportion has come
down to 3.5%.
All three approaches also show that a large number of the remaining OOSC are concentrated in a
few (mainly lagging) states and districts. Despite impressive progress in Bihar, UP and West
Bengal towards reducing the number of OOSC, these three states still account for more than 40%
of OOSC in India. Together with Orissa and AP, they account for 57% of OOSC.
The number of children in school has also increased significantly – again exceeding project
targets. The DISE statistics indicates that the number of students in primary and upper primary
schools benefiting from SSA interventions in government and aided schools has increased from
185 million in 2007-08 to around 199 million by 2012. Overall, enrolment in primary schools
(including private unaided schools) has increased by three million while that in upper primary
schools has increased by 11.2 million to 137.1 million and 62.1 million respectively over the
project period – which implies strong growth in both public and private school enrolment. This
has resulted in impressive gains in school attendance rates – especially during the SSA program
period (see figure below).

  A word of caution - international experience shows that it gets more difficult to reach the most disadvantaged OOSC. Hence the
latest MHRD third party surveys and the NSS data may show a higher number of OOSC than predicted. However, it does seem
highly likely that the target will have been met.

The improvements in school enrolment/ participation are made possible because of the opening
of large number of schools at primary level and upper primary levels as well as improvements in
school facilities that enabled better participation and regular attendance. SSA II opened 161,600
new primary schools (including those Education Guarantee Schools which were upgraded to
meet RTE norms) and 97,300 upper primary schools (including upgrading of primary schools).
A total of 650,442 class rooms were added.

Overall, performance on this PDO is deemed satisfactory.
PDO II: To narrow existing gender and social gaps.
Indicators:
(i)    Girls as a share of students enrolled in primary and upper primary education reflect their
       shares in population;
(ii)   Children of Scheduled Castes (SC) as a share of students enrolled in primary and upper
       primary education reflect their shares in population;
(iii) Children of Scheduled Tribes (ST) as a share of students enrolled in primary and upper
       primary education reflect their share in the population; and
(iv)   Children with Special Needs (CWSN) identified and enrolled increases.
Girls, and ST and SC children are now enrolled at or beyond their shares in the population. The
official data from District Information System for Education (DISE) shows gender and social
parity has been achieved. The share of girls in primary education has risen to 48.35 percent and
those in upper primary to 48.63 percent which is slightly higher than their share in primary and
upper primary age population (i.e., 47.9% and 47.4% respectively). Similarly the corresponding
numbers for SCs are 20.09 percent and 19.14 percent against the shares of 17.6% and 17.10%
respectively, while for STs the numbers are 11.4 and 9.86 percent against the shares of 9.34 and
8.56 percent, respectively. These improvements have translated into significantly declining
enrolment rate gaps between boys and girls as well as between SCs and STs and others (see
graphs below). See graphs below.

SSA’s focus on equity has played a major role in these declining gaps. As shown in Annex 2,
traditionally disadvantaged groups are much more likely to attend government and aided schools
– supported under the SSA program - as opposed to private schools.
The SSA program has different strategies to address the different equity issues. The
identification of Special Focus Districts (SFD) based on the concentration of SC (61 districts),
ST (109 districts) and Muslim minority populations (88 districts) as well as districts with high
gender gaps and infrastructure gaps have helped to target resources meant for these groups in a
concentrated manner. As a result, the number of districts with high gender gaps has been reduced
from 85 in 2006 to 35 in 2011. Special interventions for improving girls’ education such as
Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (Girls’ residential education schools) as well as National
Program for the Education of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) are also targeted towards
educationally backward blocks (EBB) identified on the basis of gender gaps in literacy and
education levels.
Special attention was provided to ensure enrolments of children in urban areas through specific
urban plans. In addition, awareness campaigns regarding the benefits of enrolling children in
schools are likely to have increased the demand for schooling for girls, SCs and STs, as would
have demand-side interventions supported by SSA such as free textbooks for students and other
demand-side interventions supported by states. Other complementary programs, such as the
mid-day meal scheme are also likely to have contributed to this increase in enrollment.
However, challenges still remain – for example, there is uneven access to proper sanitation
facilities for girls and a shortage of female teachers – no doubt contributing factors in districts
that still have high gender gaps. Similarly, urban-deprived children, often migrants, are
especially hard to reach for many reasons including non-availability of land for opening schools;
less community involvement; and problems of convergence between different departments which
provide services and education providers. These children almost always belong to the poor and
marginalized groups.
Finally, under SSA II, there was a gradual increase in the identification and enrolment of
children with special needs. CWSN identified rose from 2.63 million in 2007-08 to 3.27 million
in 2012 (a 24 percent increase). The current enrolment of CWSN is estimated at 2.9 million
whereas it was 2.4 million in 2007-08 (a 21 percent increase) – hence coming close to meeting
the target. This increase has been made possible due to several factors such as a constant focus at
the national level, specific strategies developed at the state level, convergence with organizations
and schemes under Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, and active involvement of
NGOs.
Given the progress made, performance on this PDO is deemed satisfactory.
PDO III: Improvement in retention and transition rates
Indicators:
   (i)        Transition rates from primary to upper primary education; and
   (ii)       Retention rates at primary and elementary levels.


                                                15
Transition rates from primary to upper primary increased from 81 percent to 86.6 percent during
the project period – against a target of 85 percent. The retention rates at elementary level also
improved. In those states where the elementary cycle constitute 8 years, elementary level
retention improved from 32 percent at baseline to 55 percent (against the target of 45 percent)
while it improved from 45.5 percent to 81 percent (against the target of 70 percent) during the
same period in those states where the elementary cycle comprise of 7 years. However, it should
be noted that the retention rates at primary level has increased only marginally (from 71 percent
at baseline to 74 percent in 2011/12) and is well short of the target of 80 percent. However, the
retention problems are much more concentrated in certain pockets /districts. For example, the
number of districts where primary retention rates are more than 75 percent has increased from
262 in 2007/08 to 380 (out of around 630 odd districts) in 2011/12. Similarly, the number of
districts where primary to upper primary transition rates are above 85 percent has improved from
251 in 2006 to 442 in 2011/12. Similarly, the average annual drop-out rate (year to year) has
reduced from above 10 percent in 2005/06 to 6.5 percent in 2011/12.
Performance on this PDO is deemed moderately satisfactory.

PDO IV: To enhance the quality of education for all children
Indicators:
    (i) Learning levels adequately and regularly monitored; and
   (ii) Improvement in learning levels at Grade 3

The SSA program envisages quality in terms of specific components that would ultimately
enable better learning, as measured through various ways, but most importantly, evident through
national assessments. At the time of the preparation of SSA II, a system to assess the overall
student progress towards agreed system learning goals (as envisaged in curriculum) were in
place. At the national level, the National Assessment Survey (NAS) tested Language and Maths
in grade 3, Language, Maths and EVS in grade 5 and Language, Maths, social science and
Science in grade 7/8. The Baseline assessment survey (BAS) conducted through 2003 – 2006 for
grades 3, 5 and 7/8 were analyzed and results were presented, and the Mid-term assessment
survey (MAS) for these grades had been held. These assessments were given to a representative
sample or census of the target grades or age levels. In order for a learning assessment to provide
useful information for enhancing student learning in the system, it should possess the following
characteristics: (a) Data are analyzed and results are reported to education policymakers and/or
the public; (b) Results are reported for at least one of the following student subgroups: gender,
urban/rural, geographic region; and (c) The assessment exercise is repeated at least once every 5
years for the same subject area(s) and grade(s)8.
The BAS and MAS were designed in the Classical Testing Theory (CTT) mold and lacked many
of the analytical characteristics required for informing curriculum and pedagogy. In order to
improve the NAS, the DPs supported capacity building of NCERT (through the Technical



8
    OPCS, Core Sector Indicators and Definitions for Education sector.



                                                16
Cooperation (TC) Fund) to carry out NAS using the internationally recognized Item Response
Theory (IRT). Thus the utility of the learning assessment system is enhanced.
The analysis of BAS (Round 1) and MAS (Round II) of the NAS using CTT indicated marginal
improvements in results in all subjects in grades 3, 5 and 7/8. Even these marginal improvements
in results were important given the significantly increased enrolments, especially the first
generation school goers, the increased retention rates, and the movement of children from better
off backgrounds to private schools (which the NAS has not covered).
Due to the extended period required in building national and states’ capacity for designing and
implementing the IRT methods, only grade 5 NAS was carried out before SSA II phase came to
a close (though the grade 8 NAS is underway at closing). While grade 5 NAS data and analysis
are available, these results are not exactly comparable to the previous rounds of NAS in the same
grades due to the significant improvement in techniques used. However, using 20 common items
in the new NAS in grade 5 and in the previous rounds, it was possible to make some comparison.
As per this, in 24 states, Language and EVS scores improved compared to previous rounds,
while in 14 states, Math scores improved. Average scores (using CTT method) for the common
items shows improvements in Language from 58 (MAS) to 62 (Third Round) and in
Environmental Sciences from 42.8 (MAS) to 47 (Third Round), while in Maths, there is no
improvements (NCERT).
The NAS also provides information about the areas of weakness in student performance. These
item analyses help the areas for improvement – whether it is concepts, mental processes or tasks
- and help to inform curriculum, learning enhancement programs (LEP), development of
teaching learning materials, teacher training etc. In general, as questions require higher mental
processes, the performance of students declines significantly. For example, while overall 76
percent of children can compute remainder after division, only 45 percent can find the difference
of two four-digit numbers with simple carry, and only 34 percent can compute the difference
between two decimal numbers. There are also significant differences in performance across
states. The overall picture emerging is many children have still not acquired basic abilities in
reading and arithmetic. The analysis shows that what is happening at present is mostly “rote
learning? and not conceptual learning or “learning with understanding?.
These findings are confirmed from other independent tests such as Pratham’s yearly conducted
ASER surveys in rural areas (every year since 2009) and Education Initiatives’ (EI) country-
wide student assessment of Classes 4, 6 and 8 (2009). For example, the latest ASER survey
indicates that 53% percent of children in class V cannot read a class II text (ASER 2012); and
Education Initiatives (EI) reports that students are able to respond correctly only to
straightforward questions that are close to what one would practice from a typical textbook and
are not able to apply the knowledge when presented with different situations (Gannicott and Oza,
2013).
While NAS development is one step in the direction of identifying areas for system
improvement, at the national level, quality improvement exercise started with developing a
quality visioning exercise at national and states level. The quality related reforms addressed: (a)
Building understanding on core and enabling components. Core components included
curriculum, pedagogy, material, classroom organization and practices, and learning assessment.
Enabling components include teacher recruitment, deployment, and development, performance

                                                 17
assessment, administration, program evaluation, research, and institutional development; and (b)
vision-building on the nature of learning activity and shifts desired in classroom processes; unity
of thought and shared assumptions and beliefs on children, learning, teachers; the implications
for classroom processes, planning, classroom organization and assessment and a vision of child-
centered school based on ground realities. Fifteen states revised the curriculum and subsequently
school syllabus as per the NCF framework. Twelve states (mainly small states/UTs) either follow
NCERT text books or the text books from the neighboring states while in the remaining states
the reforms are still underway. The SSA program supports a comprehensive reform of classroom
assessment practice by introducing a system of Comprehensive and Continuous Evaluation
(CCE), in place of high-stakes examinations at the end of each academic year. While this reform
is in line with international good practice, teachers and schools are having considerable difficult
in implementing it in practice and significant additional capacity building and support is needed.
The availability of teachers improved tremendously during SSA II. Of the 1.27 million teachers
appointed during the entire SSA period, 38 percent were appointed during SSA II. Mean Pupil
Teacher Ratio (PTR) in government schools now is 30:1 (2011-12, DISE), down from 34:1 in
2007-08 in the context of a large increase in the number of students. However, the mean PTR
camouflages wide variations across the country. Around 30% of the schools and more than 150
districts had a PRT above 40:1 in 2007-08. In 2009-10, due to RTE specifications of PTR of 30:1
at primary and 35:1 at upper primary, this indicator was revised to look at the number of districts
and schools with PTR above 30:1. As per this in 2011-12, 35 percent of districts (224) and 40
percent of schools had a PTR above 30:1.
While progress is being made in measuring quality and putting significantly greater emphasis on
quality, the targets have not been fully met. Hence, performance on this PDO is rated as
moderately satisfactory.
3.3 Efficiency
The cost benefit analysis of SSA II reveals an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of about
19 percent using a discount rate of 12 percent. At appraisal, the economic analysis of the SSA II
for 2007-2010 estimated the EIRR of 16 percent using a discount rate of 12 percent.
The costs of the projects were taken to be project costs plus the private costs of households for
sending children to primary and upper-primary school. The benefits of the project are estimated
to be composed of two streams. The first is the increased number of students who complete
primary and upper primary school thus getting higher wages than if they had not completed these
levels of schooling. The second stream of benefits is an estimated small increase in wages for all
upper primary school graduates due to improved quality of schooling. We also compute the rate
of return assuming there is no improvement in quality of learning. Under this assumption,
internal rate of return of the project is about 16%. Since the quantitative analysis here is limited
to the financial benefits due to higher wages only, this provides a lower limit to the economic
benefits of the project. As is widely known, acquiring good quality elementary education also
has many positive externalities such as lower fertility rates, improved health seeking behavior
etcetera. These cannot be quantified easily. Thus the actual rate of return for the project would be
higher than estimated 19 percent.



                                                18
The benefits stream, as explained above, is estimated from the increased wages due to higher
number of primary and upper primary school graduates and also from slightly higher wages for
the latter due to better quality schooling. The increase in the number of primary and upper
primary school graduates was achieved due to the efforts of the program to reach out to all
children (including girls and other disadvantaged groups) via community mobilization
campaigns, enrolment drives, greater involvement of village education committees, and
provision of schools within one kilometer of every habitation. In addition, the SSA program
allocated considerable attention and finances on improving the quality and efficiency of
elementary education. SSA II also funded various programs aimed at improving quality of
education such as the provision of free textbooks and supplementary teaching learning material,
provision of regular in–service training to teachers, and special provisions for disabled children.
It is assumed that the increase in quality of schooling will marginally improve wages that upper
primary graduates can expect in the labor market.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. This takes into account the strong progress
in meeting (and in some cases exceeding) access and equity targets, as well as those for
retention. While the clear emphasis on quality is beginning to have an impact, the targets for
both measuring and improving learning outcomes have only been partially met. While this is
understandable, given the international evidence which shows that quality improvements take
time, it is clear that the program needs to maintain and even increase the focus on quality moving
forward.
The Table below provides a summary of the scores of different aspects of project outcomes,
using a six point scale to serve as a check on the overall assessment of the outcomes rating. This
results in an outcome rating of moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty Impacts. SSA interventions disproportionately benefited the poor and marginalized as
seen in Section 3.2. The figure below from the 2009/10 NSS data shows that children from
underprivileged groups like SC and ST predominantly attend government and aided schools.
Similarly girl children attend government schools slightly more than boys; and the poorest
children overwhelmingly attend government and aided schools.

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening. The SSA program has had a substantial impact on
institutional development:
   RTE Act: The most significant outcome in terms of institutional development has been the
    implementation of the RTE Act and formulation of consequential rules at national and state
    levels. Though this was not formally part of the project, the project provided the enabling
    conditions to realize this development.
   Planning and Budgeting. The planning and budgeting process embodied in the Annual Worl
    Plan and Budget (AWPB) has been strengthed and is a fundamental to the dialogue between
    the center and state governments. It has also evolved to focus more on outcomes and
    processes.
   School Management Committees (SMCs): The project played a huge role in strengthening the
    capacity, knowledge, effectiveness of SMCs in managing funds and holding schools
    accountable for children’s education. Further, as project funds were transferred directly to
    schools in rural areas and managed by school management committees, there was a positive
    social development impact through empowering the SMC members.
   State capacity: As states had to put together teams of people to prepare annual work plans
    and budgets, as well as supervise and manage educational districts, and organize teacher



                                                     20
    training programs, the capacity of staff at the state level in planning and implementation has
    improved.
   Convergence. A major strength of the Inclusive Education (IE) program under SSA has
    been the convergence it has established with various stakeholders. At the national level,
    convergence has been established with existing scheme like Assistance to Disabled
    Persons for purchase/fittings of Aids/Appliances (ADIP), Rehabilitation Council of India,
    National Institutions and NGOs. The convergence has mainly been established for
    seeking assistance in assessment, providing aids and appliances and in capacity building.
   National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT): The Quality Monitoring
    Tools (QMT), introduced by NCERT, have started providing qualitative information on
    various classroom processes and on classroom assessments of students. Various review
    meetings of functional area coordinators at the national level provide further feedback on
    program implementation. In terms of national assessments, NCERT has now developed the
    capacity to conduct national assessments to international standards.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
   Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) for the secondary education (Classes 9 and
    10), a national centrally sponsored scheme, started in 2009 in response to the increasing
    demand for secondary education. The Bank and DFID are supporting RMSA.
   The program contributed in developing better fiduciary practices, including financial
    management (FM) processes, manuals on FM and procurement, and training programs. Many
    of these are being adopted by the RMSA program.
   The SSA program has created a huge awareness and interest on the part of civil society and
    NGOs to look at various aspects of learning and quality of education. The program has also
    generated substantial international interest in India’s education sector and a large amount of
    high quality research has been and is being conducted, which informs reforms in the sector.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
The Government of India and state Governments are fully committed to continuing the SSA
program. In particular, the government’s proposed allocation to SSA program in the 12th Five
Year Plan remains high, and the legislative and regulatory framework provided by the RTE Act,
and the institutional development mechanisms in place ensure the program’s sustainability
beyond the Bank support. However, at the same time, continuation of reforms in particular
concerning improvements in the education system governance and strengthen accountability at
all levels in order to improve school performance and service delivery are likely to remain
challenging in some states with a weak governance environment. Further, there are significant
variations in capacities across states - despite progress under SSA, planning and execution
capacity remains weak in some lagging states and various administrative levels from the state to
the school. Addressing these risks are now the focus of the program moving forward.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.
The ICR team deems the quality at entry to be moderately satisfactory. During preparation and
appraisal, the Bank in general took into account the adequacy of project design and all major
relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and institutional, including procurement
and financial management. In addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier
projects in the education sector were considered and incorporated into the project design. The
design also benefited from an extensive Quality Enhancement Review (QER) process as well as
a Bank-wide Regional Operations Committee (ROC) review of the project. However, some of
the problems experienced during implementation, such as the capacity of lagging states, could
perhaps have been anticipated and specific measures proposed.
Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the
technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a good project design. The Bank
provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure quality
preparation and appraisal work. The project was consistent with the CAS and government
priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a consistently good working relationship with
the Borrower during preparation and appraisal which enabled an open dialogue on difficult
issues.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory.
The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. Sufficient
budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately and intensively
supervised, and closely monitored. The Bank team also technically supported the TC Fund
provided by DFID for capacity building for assessment and evaluation. Aide-Memoires were
prepared regularly during the joint review missions and alerted the government and the MHRD
to problems with project execution. The Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs)
realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of development
objectives and project implementation. A major recurring problem was the area of financial
management (see section on implementation agency performance below); these issues got
highlighted due to the due diligence by the Bank’s FM staff, flagging these issues repeatedly
during the supervision missions. Bank staff continuity was important here. The team responded
quickly in preparing the Additional Financing documents on time.
The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in January 2010, and assessed progress to date on
all project components, the implementation issues and the actions to be taken to ensure the
successful completion of the project. Bank’s procurement and financial management staff
worked with the MHRD staff to explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project
implementation, with regard to procurement of goods and works, and selection of consultants,
accounts and audits, based on the Credit Agreement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above,
overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.
As mentioned in Section 2.1, the government had shown its commitment to the objectives of the
project at the time of project preparation. The government consistently maintained its
commitment throughout the implementation. For example, in both FY2008-09 and FY2009-10,
both Central and State Government allocations and expenditures for SSA II exceeded
expectations set out in the PAD. This acceleration in total SSA II program expenditures led to
full disbursement of all IDA resources by September 30, 2009, six months prior to the original
closing. Passage of the RTE Act by the Indian Parliament in August 2009 has improved the
policy and legal framework for implementation of SSA, as it makes certain elementary education
objectives mandatory for the States to achieve.
The government officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, and
cooperated fully with the task team. Appropriate levels of review and approval were usually in
place; financial accountability and follow-up was observed, and expenditures were duly
authorized before they were incurred; and documentation was maintained properly for periodic
review. The project did not suffer from any counterpart funding problems, as the GoI took
timely corrective measures and made appropriate budget provisions.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
The implementing entities (MHRD and 35 States and Union Territories) were fully committed to
this project. For example, MHRD, through the Elementary Education Bureau (EEB), played a
key role in directing the planning process and, in strengthening the consultation in the process,
and instilling accountability into it. Along with the Project Appraisal Board (PAB), MHRD
focused on the lagging states as well as critical technical or implementation bottlenecks in all
states. Quarterly reviews were used for resolving issues at the state level; and at the semi-annual
meetings with state ministries MHRD reviewed project’s progress and implementation issues
were discussed and resolved. MHRD worked with apex national institutions such as NUEPA and
NCERT for the development of appropriate monitoring mechanisms for the project. While the
focus of the program increasingly shifted to quality during the SSA II project period, there is
clearly need for greater focus – and commensurate capacity development - on improvements in
learning outcomes and classroom processes moving forward.
Financial Management. See Section 2.4 above.



                                                23
Procurement. Total procurement entities within the project numbered at 8350 and at community
level 1.3 million schools handled beneficiary led construction of new schools, classrooms, walls
etc. valued up to $10,000. Establishment of community level horizontal assurances mechanisms
like Social Audit, Display Boards, etc. had added transparency and efficiency in school
construction. Across the country, the model of community construction had led to better schools
at lower costs. Third party procurement review of all procurement was conducted by the GoI, on
a rotational basis to ensure that all states were covered in a three year cycle, through Independent
Auditors. SSA had also integrated procurement review as part of Internal Audit and the
quarterly Financial managers meeting organized by the national Government took up issues in
procurement for action plans and remedies.
Education is a joint responsibility of the national and state governments and States have
independence and authority over implementation of project activities. As expected in a large,
national program covering 35 states and UTs, there was considerable variation in performance
across states. Taking this factor into account, the overall performance of the implementing
agencies is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
In light of the Government and implementing agencies’ performance as discussed above, the
overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory.
6. Lessons Learned
Demonstration of Results: Strong political commitment and ownership are critical for
successfully steering a centrally sponsored scheme. Significant and positive results – especially
on the access and equity agenda - demonstrated by the program has proved to be the lynchpin for
sustained political ownership and commitment.
Development Partner Coordination: SSA provided DPs with a viable platform to provide
consistent and concordant support to the program under a common results framework, jointly
designed with the Government. This significantly reduced the transaction costs for the
Government. Continuous and intensive DP engagement across the program and technical and
advisory support provided resulted in timely identification of issues and (often) resolution of
challenges during implementation.
Capacity: A realistic assessment of the capacity is important to inform the design and
sequencing of the reform programs for optimal impact. Inadequate staffing, especially at the
state and local levels, led to challenges in areas such as financial management and adversely
affected project implementation.
Assessments: Regular diagnostic assessments for tracking student achievement are good initial
steps towards improving student learning outcomes. However, to leverage the assessments to
achieve intended improvements requires capacity for test design, test administration and
analysis, and wide dissemination of the findings to key stakeholders and the public.



                                                24
Monitoring and Evaluation. Availability of timely and reliable data is essential for choosing
the results indicators to measure the achievement of the development objectives. In SSA,
significant strengthening of the DISE database was critical for assessing program performance
and feeding data to policymakers to make requisite modifications to program design.
Communications. Communication is key to successful interventions. Communicating
"changes", especially those related to the "softer" aspects of education (like quality interventions,
intentions and outcomes) is quite challenging, but unless the message is not conveyed properly to
various stakeholders, the intended outcomes will be difficult to achieve. For example: Parental
understanding of quality and learning is often around the traditional rote learning and "marks"
based, and if National curriculum framework envisages child centered pedagogy, or multi-grade
multi-level teaching like Activity Based Learning in Tamil Nadu, it is important that parents are
informed about through effective communication strategy.

Annex 1. Project Costs and Financing

The project’s Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) design differs from a traditional investment
lending operation as there was no pre-defined component and associated ex-ante allocation of
finance. Outlays of the project were approved based on district level decentralized annual
planning. The cost of the program is driven by the interventions needed to achieve universal
elementary education of satisfactory quality as determined by decentralized annual planning. The
project plans and outlays were mainly based on contextualized interventions that were aimed at
improving the four goals of SSA – namely, improve access and enrolments, improve retention
and transitions to the next stage of education, improve quality and learning levels and all these to
be achieved by bridging gender and social gaps. Interventions could be designed with many of
these objectives and not necessarily map neatly into project objectives.
At the time of appraisal, it was estimated that the project would require around USD 10,700
million, of which nearly a third was expected to be devoted to civil works. See table below.

The analysis of expenditure categories and interventions indicate that in reality, many different
interventions were broadly included in the project. For example, interventions regarding
Learning Enhancement Programs (LEP), provision of 2 pairs of school uniforms to all children

                                                         26
attending government schools, etc. Some interventions also got modified, such as the free text
books. At the time of appraisal of SSA II project, free text books were entitlements for only girls,
and children from SC and ST communities. In the course of time and post RTE, free text books
were introduced as a universal entitlement for all children.
 
The list of interventions are broad ones, and there are several sub-dimensions to each of these
interventions and components – for example, the innovative activity at district level is meant to
include several activities using a block grant at district level. These interventions could be
broadly categorized as those facilitating better access and retention, those aimed mainly at
improving quality, annual grants of various forms, those dealing with school infrastructure,
gender and equity and management. Outlays increased every year, and did so in most categories.

Annex 2: Output by Components

It must be noted at the outset that this project being a SWAp, there were no formal components
mapped to each development goals, but interventions which led to one or the other outputs and
outcomes.
This annex provides additional information to complement the discussion on the achievement of
outcomes in Section 3 of the main text. It includes data on: (i) trends in outcomes as reported by
administrative monitoring data, as well as additional data from independent sources to
triangulate and validate trends; and (ii) trends in outputs to facilitate the establishment of the
linkages between the program outputs and achievement of objectives.

B. Outputs by Objectives
SSA II was unlike a traditional investment credit with predefined components. The scope of
interventions varied across states, districts and sub districts and also from year to year, enabling
the interventions and resource requirements to respond to different circumstances to best meet
the development objectives. This section presents trends in some of the key outputs/categories of
activity. It should, however, be noted that many of the outputs under PDO I and II also
contribute to quality (PDOs III and IV) – for example, provision of minimum physical or human
resources.
PDO I. Universal access and reduction in out of school children (OOSC) and
PDO II: To narrow existing gender and social gaps
As shown in Section 3.2, SSA II achieved its objectives of reducing the number of OOSC. Some
more details are provided here about the estimates from the NSS data, the latest round available
being from 2009/10. There has been a significant focus on enhancing access for children
attending upper primary grades.
          Figure 5: Proportion of Children in age group of 6-10 and 11-13yrs not attending school




These data, presented in the graph above provides estimations for the proportion of children in
the age group of 6-10 years and 11-13 years who were not attending educational institutions at
the time of various NSS surveys (1993-94, 1999-2000, 2004-05, 2007-08 and 2009-10). In the
graph, the dashed lines show the trends in the decline in the OOSC proportion between mid-
1990s till early 2000s and what would have been the projected reduction in OOSC if those trends
had continued. However, the actual decline in the OOSC population for these age groups during
SSA period was much steeper, indicating the impact of the SSA program. As the proportion of

                                                    34
younger children enrolled increased, to close to 100 percent, it provider hard to reach the
remaining few OOSC, hence the decline in OOSC among the younger age group was slower
during SSA II. However, for the older age group, the number not enrolled declined faster than
the trends during SSA I period, indicating greater impact in SSA II period. These numbers
resulted in a strong increase in enrollments.
Several factors were responsible for this increase during the SSA II project period:
Provisioning of schools. First, there was a significant increase in the provisioning of schools.
The project provided 76,850 primary and over 70,050 upper primary schools. When SSA
program started, in many remote and small habitations, education was provided initially through
Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) centres, and these EGS centres were gradually upgraded to
primary schools. With RTE, it became mandatory that EGS were upgraded to regular schools
with all prescribed facilities and teachers. Thus, during SSA II 42,979 EGS centers were
upgraded into regular schools (41,105 Primary and 1,874 Upper Primary).
Reduction in primary/upper primary ratio. At the beginning of the SSA II period, 15 states had
more than 2.5 primary schools for every upper primary school. The target was to reduce this
number to 10. Given the strong focus on setting up of upper primary schools during the project
period, this target was achieved and now only six states have this ratio above 2.5.
Additional Classrooms. A total of 1,346,656 additional classrooms (ACR) were made available
in government schools during the SSA decade (of which 696,214 ACRs or around 52% of SSA
ACRs were constructed during SSA II period of 2008-2012). While this was below the target of
about 1.8 million classrooms – it should be noted that there were no pre-decided targets since
these numbers were based on teacher requirements which changed on a year to year basis from
state to state, based on the AWPB requirements. As a result of the provision of additional
classrooms the Student Classroom Ratio (SCR) reduced from X% to 30:1.
Provision of Residential Schools and Hostels in remote Tribal/ forest/ hilly / desert Areas: As per
RTE (since 2010), the project started providing residential schools and hostel facilities for
children living in hilly terrain, small and sparsely populated areas as well as for children without
adult protection who are in need of shelter and care in order to ensure their access to schools.
Transport and escort facilities: Post RTE, the project started to provide transport and escort
facilities to children living in remote habitations where opening of school was difficult. These
facilities were also provided to children of extremely deprived groups.
In terms of equity, girls, and ST and SC children, are now enrolled at or beyond their shares in
the population. The official data from District Information System for Education (DISE)
presented in Section 3.2 is also corroborated by the NSS data as shown in the figures below.

The factors mentioned above (increased availability of schools, additional classrooms, residential
and transport facilities) have helped in draw the disadvantaged and marginalized into schools. In
addition, provision of water and sanitation facilities (especially for girls) has increased the
likelihood of them coming to school. Against a target of 90 percent, 95 percent of schools have
access to safe drinking water. 76 percent of schools have common toilet facilities as opposed to
the target of 65 percent. Finally, the percentage of schools with separate toilets for girls have far
exceeded targets – with 62 percent of schools at the primary level and 69 percent of schools
overall having these facilities (as opposed to targets of 45 percent and 62 percent respectively).

Part of the reason for the increase in these rates has been the result of greater availability of
infrastructure facilities which have facilitated student transitions from primary to upper primary
schools. Some other factors have also come into play:



                                                       37
Improved availability of teachers. SSA provided additional teachers to the States so as to
maintain the PTR as per RTE Act. By 2012-13 the States had appointed about 1,275,000 (for the
entire SSA period) teachers against the sanctioned strength of 1.9 million teachers under SSA
(65%). Of this, around 422000 teachers were appointed during SSA II period. It should be
noted that the overall target is a shifting one, since it is based on year-to-year requirements of
states based on needs identified in the AWPBs. However, the goal of a PTR ratio of 40:1 still
eludes States like Bihar (53), UP (50), Jharkhand (45) and West Bengal (45).Having said this
states are making significant efforts to meet teacher shortfalls by recruiting more teachers in
order to meet the RTE norms.
Teacher Training: No. of Teachers covered under 20 Days In-service teachers training since-
2007-08 are as follows (an unknown number of teachers were trained more than once):

Improvements in curriculum, syllabus, textbook and content rich environments. NCERT was for
laying down the curriculum and evaluation procedure for elementary education in respect of the
central government and UTs without legislature and to develop a framework of national
curriculum. The NCF-2005 was notified to develop a new framework. States too have notified
Academic Authority which in most cases is SCERT. Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra,
Sikkim, Tamilnadu, Tripura, Punjab and West Bengal have revised their curriculum and
textbooks. The States like Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman & Nikobar Island, Chandigarh, Delhi,
Goa, and Haryana (Up. Pr.), Himachal Pradesh (Up. Pry.) Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand.
Lakshadweep, Rajasthan have adopted the textbooks and curriculum of NCERT.
School Libraries. Over 350,000 schools have been supported to establish libraries to promote
reading. As per DISE 2011-12, 54 per cent of schools have libraries.
Free Textbooks. There has been a significant increase in the number of children who were
provided with free textbooks at the beginning of the school year every year during SSA II. It
must be noted here that while pre-RTE, free text books were made available through SSA to only
girls, and boys from SC and ST communities, whereas post RTE (since 2010), all children
attending government schools were provided with text books free of costs.

Technical Support for Quality. At the national level, NCERT has been assisting the States in
setting up core groups for reviewing their syllabi in the light of NCF-2005. Technical Support
Group (TSG) has been helping in developing a vision and perspective regarding pedagogy,
teacher training, CCE, making lively classroom transactions and use of LEP. The SCERTCs and

                                                        38
the SIEs have been providing academic support to the States wherein the textbooks, TLM and
training modules are modified to bring in quality. The NCERT led qualitative evaluation of LEP
programs in four states showed interesting results. While the ABL program in Tamil Nadu and
Multi Lingual Education program in Odisha demonstrated a positive impact on student learning,
the quality interventions of Aadhar in Himachal Pradesh and Children’s Learning Acceleration
Programme for Sustainability in Andhra Pradesh did not show any significant impact on student
learning. In AP, school grading, home-school links and monitoring were not found to contribute
significantly to learning achievement or competency attainment of children at the state level and
were also not key predictors for most of the districts. Tamil Nadu is using the research findings
of its ABL program very constructively and has enriched its Activity Based Learning (ABL)
program.
However, in terms of learning levels – while there has been a significant amount of investment to
improve the provisioning of inputs aimed at enhancing quality (as seen above), as well as on
measuring learning levels comparable to international assessments – this is yet to translate into
improvements in learning levels, which, based on international evidence, does take time. Some
initiatives undertaken under the project are:
Technical Cooperation Fund: SSA II included Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF), which was
supported by DFID in parallel to SSA. TCF supported and facilitated strengthening capacity of
NCERT at the national level, and through it, at the state levels in the specific areas of (i) learning
assessments; and (ii) the evaluation of quality initiatives. TCF enabled the use of relevant
national and international expertise and best practices in support of building capacities for
measuring the quality of education. This had included study tours for NCERT’s assessment and
evaluation staff in Europe and the United States, focused training and capacity building for
NCERT staff in test item development, sampling frames, use of statistical packages and other
assessment tools. In addition, TCF also supported rigorous impact evaluations of four major
quality improvement interventions: the Activity-Based Learning program in Tamil Nadu; Multi-
Lingual Education Programme for Tribal Children in Orissa; Early Reading Skills Enhancement
Program in Himachal Pradesh; and the Children’s Language Improvement Program/Children’s
Learning Acceleration Program (CLIP/CLAP) in Andhra Pradesh.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Rationale for Intervention
Investment in elementary education is one of the key solutions to breaking the vicious cycle of
poverty in India. It is widely acknowledged in international literature that completing at least
primary, if not upper primary levels of education, has a major impact on economic and social
development. SSA II was envisaged as the second phase of external support to the
Government’s continuing SSA program meeting GoI’s economic development and poverty
reduction goals, as well as moving towards the achievement of the MDGs, particularly Universal
Primary Education, Gender Equality and Women’s empowerment. The program also strived to
facilitate the broadening and deepening of the quality and equity agenda in elementary education
in India.
Rate of return:
Completing primary and elementary education has high private and social rates of return. There
is widespread international evidence to support that the private returns are, in fact, higher in
developing countries like India than in developed countries. Private returns are high because
completing this basic level of education enhances the wage earning capacity of the individual.
Improving the quality of education at this level can further enhance wage earning capacity. The
SSA program seeks to improve both completion rates and the quality of education. Social rates
of return are also high for elementary education as there are significant social benefits to an

Externalities and public good:
Investing in elementary education is beneficial because it also has significant externalities. These
range from improved health outcomes such as lower infant mortality rates, to lower fertility rates
and better health seeking behavior.

Poverty alleviation and equity:
Since elementary education has high private as well as social rates of return, it also has a long
term impact on alleviating poverty. This impact is both direct and indirect. Directly, a better
educated workforce earns higher wages. Indirectly, lower fertility rates and better health
outcomes improve human development indicators and reduce poverty (when it is defined more
broadly than just ‘income poverty’. More educated women also tend to marry later, have fewer
but healthier babies, and invest more in education for their children. The SSA II program
continued to facilitate ways to enhance equity by targeting investments in deprived groups such
as scheduled caste and tribe, girls, and children with disabilities.
Cost benefit analysis of SSA
The economic analysis at appraisal projected and assessed the costs and benefits stream
associated with the project. It also estimated a prospective internal rate of return from and
prospective net present value of project benefits.
The costs of the projects were taken to be project costs plus the private costs of households for
sending children to primary and upper-primary school.
The benefits of the project were taken to be: (a) increase in the number of students who complete
primary and upper primary school who get higher wages as a result compared to the
counterfactual; and (b) increase in wages of upper primary school completers due to and the
better quality education they receive due to various program components aimed at improving
learning in schools.
The SSA program has been focusing on providing universal access to primary and upper primary
schools to all eligible children. The program uses innovative methods to reach out to the hardest-
to-reach children such as girls, tribal children and minorities. Additionally, the SSA program
focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of providing elementary schooling through
initiatives such as provision of teaching-learning material, free textbooks, teacher training and
attention to children with special needs among others. There has been a continuous improvement
in enrolment rates and reduction in repetition and drop-out rates during the project period. It is
not, therefore, unreasonable to assume improvement in the quality of education received in
elementary schools as a result of SSA. Benefits stream of this analysis captures these
improvements in quality of learning at Upper Primary level.
The discounted benefit stream over the working life-time of primary and upper primary school
completers under the project was then compared with total project costs. Using the cost-benefit
framework, an internal rate of return of 19.36 percent was estimated along with the net present
value of economic benefits of USD 53.8 billion (using a discount rate of 12 percent).

Cost-Benefit Analysis and Economic Rate of Return at Project Completion
The cost-benefit analysis is done for the project period 2007-08 to 2011-2012.
The assumptions and data used in the present analysis are the following:
a) Population data for the age-group 6-13 years is computed using the 5-yearly age-wise
   population projections from the Census of India 2001 for the years 2007-08 to 2011-12.
   Population numbers for in-between years are imputed using simple interpolation.
b) Primary and Upper Primary gross enrollment rates for years 2007-08 to 2011-12 are taken
   from the DISE database.
c) Projections are also done for the number of students completing primary and upper primary
   grades. The proportions of children completing primary (83.8% and 86.7%) and upper
   primary (67.7% and 75.5%) levels are computed using NSS 2007/08 and NSS 2009/10.
   Under business as usual (BAU) scenario, completion rates are assumed to increase by 1
   percentage point. Completion rates are assumed to have increased by 2 percentage points
   after 2009-10 as a result of SSA. Additional Primary and Upper Primary completers are
   computed taking difference in the numbers of completers under SSA scenario and completers
   under BAU scenario.
d) Economic costs for the project which include: (a) project cost from 2007-08 to 2011-12 and
   (b) private costs for the students. The private costs are estimated with data from the 64th
   round of the NSS 2007-08. These costs are Rupees 696 per year for primary school students
   and Rupees 1346 per year for elementary school students in 2007-08 rupees.
e) It is assumed that the benefits accrue to completed levels of schooling and not completed
   years of schooling.
f) Data from the 64th and 66th Rounds of the National Sample Survey 2007-08 and 2009-10
   have been used to estimate age earnings profile.
g) Similar to appraisal, it is assumed that there is an increase of 1% in wages due to
   improvement in quality for upper-primary school completers. We also present the no-quality
   improvement scenario for sensitivity analysis of estimates.


                                                    42
h) A discount rate of 12 percent has been assumed in the present analysis for estimating the net
   present value of project benefits. This is the same as the appraisal assumption.
i) Employment rates of 80%, 85%, 90% and 95% have been assumed. The appraisal analysis
   was based on the assumption of Employment rate of 95% and 88%. To assess the robustness
   of returns, this analysis presents results for 4 different scenarios of employment rates.

Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value of Economic Benefits of the Project and
Sensitivity Analysis
Assuming an employment rate of 85%, a return to quality of 1% and no opportunity costs by way
of child labor, the estimate of the internal rate of return is 19.4% and a net present value of net
economic benefits to the extent of USD 53.8 billion.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine how sensitive the rate of return of the project to
the employment rate of the primary and upper primary graduates (external efficiency). Analysis
was done for 4 different scenarios of employment rates: 80 %, 85%, 90%, and 95%.
The results of the sensitivity analysis are reported in Table 2 below. The rate of return of the
project does not vary widely between four different scenarios for the employment rates of
primary and upper primary graduates. EIRR ranges from 18.8 to 20.5 percent for low (80
percent) to high (95 percent) employment rates under the quality premium assumption. If we
assume that there is no improvement in quality of learning, EIRR ranges from 15.3 to 16.7
percent for employment rates of 80 and 95 percent, respectively.

The estimate of the IRR of the project at completion is close to that under appraisal under a
number of scenarios, and the present value of net benefits from the project are slightly higher.
There are a number of differences between assumptions underlying the analyses at completion
and appraisal which affect both the costs and the benefits sides.
The estimated IRR of 19.4% assuming improvement in quality of learning and 85% employment
is likely to be an underestimation of the actual returns of the program for at least two reasons.
Firstly, the IRR is an under-estimate because it has not taken into account the increase in wages
due to longevity in the school system beyond the elementary stage. It is a robust empirical
finding that improvement in quality of education increases average years of schooling for a
cohort that experiences good quality schooling; and more years of schooling are rewarded with
higher wages in the labor market. Secondly, it has been computed without taking into account
social returns due to positive externalities in health, fertility and economic growth. The value of
improved education is not limited to labor market outcomes alone. A better educated cohort of
children are likely to be healthier themselves and have fewer and healthier children in the future;
a more educated labor force is likely to be more skilled and readier to invent, adapt and use new
technology establishing the basis for higher and more sustainable economic growth; more wide-
spread literacy is also likely to lead to greater social participation and sense of community
among the people. Overall, better educated and healthier children become educated, healthy and
more productive work-force for the country.

1. Background & Introduction

India is a big country (area 3.3 million Sq. Km, seventh largest in the world) comprising 35
States and Union Territories with diverse socio-cultural histories, spread over widely varying
geographical conditions. According to the provisional results of Census of India 2011, India’s
population increased from 1.028 billion in 2001 to 1.21 billion in 2011. Commitment to
providing basic education for all is a goal enshrined in the Indian Constitution, which guarantees
universal compulsory education as a fundamental right for every child in the age group 6-14.
Successive development policies and plans have pursued this goal for the last six decades. As a
result, impressive progress has been registered in education in general and elementary education
in particular.

Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is one of the largest programmes in the world which was launched
in the year 2001-02 as a flagship program of the Government of India (GoI) to provide a
comprehensive policy and budgetary framework to achieve this goal of universalization of
elementary education. The goals of SSA, which are consistent with the MDGs, the NPE and the
fundamental right to free and compulsory education were the following: (a) All children in
schools; (b) Bridge all gender and social category gaps at primary and upper primary; (c)
Universal retention; and (d) Focus on elementary education of satisfactory quality with emphasis
on education for life. SSA builds on the experiences of a series of past interventions at the
national and state levels such as Operation Blackboard, District Primary Education Program
(DPEP), Mahila Samakhya, Lok Jumbish, Bihar Education Project and Uttar Pradesh Basic
Education Project. The broad strategies central to SSA design are: (a) Decentralized planning
and implementation; (b) Emphasis on special focus groups; (c) Community ownership; (d)
Thrust on quality; (e) Institutional reforms; and (f) Sustainable financing.

A number of other centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) viz., the National Program of Education
of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL), the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV), the
Mid-Day Meal Scheme, the Teacher Education Project and the Mahila Samakhya are either
incorporated with or linked to complement SSA. With the Right to Education (RTE) Act coming
into effect from April, 2010, SSA has been designated the primary vehicle for implementing the
Act.

Background of the external support projects in SSA

SSA I: The Development Partners (DP) i.e. the World Bank, the Department of International
Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom and the European Commission (now the European
Union, EU) joined the programme in 2004 with partial funding. The DPs pooled approximately
US$ 1 billion (The share of the World Bank during SSA-I was for USD 500 million) and
committed their support to the SSA for a four year period (2004-2007), through an Elementary
Education Project (called, SSA I). This was a Sector Investment Credit (SIC) for which the DP
pooled funds with the GoI through a Sector-wide Approach (SWAP). The partial funding of SSA
by DPs was aligned to the SSA’s long term goals of universal elementary education and
programmatic goals. Due to accelerated disbursement and implementation, the credit closed nine

                                                49
months in advance and the first phase of external support ended in 2007.

SSA II: DPs were requested for a second phase of external support to the program. This phase
(called, SSA, II, approved in May, 2008) was initially for three years (FY 2007/08-2009/10),
including retroactive financing. This term was later extended to 2012 through the Additional
Financing Agreement in 2010. The Second credit for SSA II by the Bank was of USD 600
million. The focus of this phase was strengthening government capacity for continuous review,
monitoring and evaluation, enhancing emphasis on areas such as student assessment, monitoring
and evaluation, and fiduciary safeguards; and fostering cross-State and cross-District learning.
The key performance indicators (KPI) identified for SSA II are as follows:

      Reduction in the number of out of school children from 13.4 million to 4.9 million.
      Enrolment shares of girls, SCs, and STs, in primary and upper primary maintained or
       increased relative to their share in the population at the national and state level.
      Attendance rates of students at primary and upper primary level increases from 70% and
       75% respectively to 85% and 90%.
      Increase in retention rate at primary level from 70% to 75%.
      Transition rate from primary to upper primary increases from 83% to 89%.
      Learning level adequately and regularly monitored.
      Improvement in learning level at Grade 3.

These indicators have been included as outcome indicators in Results Monitoring in the Project
Approval Document (PAD). Every JRM Aide-Memoire includes Result Monitoring as a part of
review exercise. Government of India shares the progress against these indicators with the Joint
Review Missions based on the annual plans prepared by the states and assessed during the
appraisal.

The term of SSA II ended on 30/09/2012 which resulted in the process of the Implementation
Completion Review Report (ICRR). The present report is the ICRR by Government of India
which is the borrower in this Project. The report takes stock of the investment in the project,
accounts the interventions to implement the project and assesses progress on KPIs.

Major developments during SSA II

Implementation of SSA II witnessed several landmark developments. SSA II effectively began
with the inception of the Eleventh Five Year Plan in fact, taking into account the extended
duration of the project, SSA II becomes almost co-terminus with the Eleventh Plan. The National
Curriculum Framework, NCF (prepared, 2005) which was rolled out in 2007 provided an
impetus to improvement of quality with equity in general and curricular reforms in particular.
The focus of the Eleventh Plan and the approach of NCF greatly influenced SSA in bringing to
centre stage the goal of quality education. The biggest and by far the most historic development
during SSA II were the enactment and implementation of the RTE Act making free and
compulsory education a fundamental and justiciable right.




                                                50
The RTE Act (2009): The Act came into force on April 1 2010. Subsequently the national and
state governments formulated consequential rules (e.g. the Model Rules, The Central Rules and
the State Rules). SSA was designated as the primary though not the exclusive vehicle for
implementing the Act and the Government approved Rs. 2.31 lakh crore for SSA to implement
RTE for five years. The rights perspective as well as the stipulations of the Act necessitated
major changes in SSA Norms and approach which were effected to align the programme with the
approach and standards of the Act. Subsequently the Framework of Implementation of SSA was
rewritten. The revised approach brought to greater focus on child entitlements, equitable quality
of education and continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) etc. It also specified timelines
to many of these provisions e.g. neighbourhood school, teachers according to the PTR standards
and school infrastructure within 3 years and professionally qualified teachers within five years of
the commencement of the Act.


2. Component wise interventions and outcome

I      Universal access & reduction in out of school children (OOSC)

The first goal set for SSA- II was to improve enrolment in schools and reduce the number of out
of school children. Universal provision of schooling facility is prerequisite for universal
enrolment. In SSA-I there was a significant provisioning of primary schooling facilities across
the country resulting in improved enrolment and reduced number of out of school children. In the
next phase i.e SSA- II continued this provisioning primary schools and related facilities in
residual unserved habitations especially in remote and socially disadvantaged areas. The second
significant action was expansion of upper primary schools in all unserved habitations.

Expansion of Schooling facilities during SSA-II

The foremost challenge during SSA-II was, provisioning of residual requirement for primary
schools in all habitations, within a walk able distance and saturation of schooling facilities at
upper primary level. The trend of sanctioning of schools shows that there has been a remarkable
expansion of schooling facilities across the country during this period. SSA has provided over
77 thousand primary and over 70 thousand upper primary schools during this period (upto
31.03. 2012). Following is the status of schools sanctioned to the states during SSA II.

                                                51
This includes upgradation of 42,979 EGS centers into regular schools (41,105 Primary and 1874
Upper Primary). These schools have been largely sanctioned to states with infrastructure gap
such as Uttar Pradesh (28,619), West Bengal (24,178), Bihar (17,914), Rajasthan (13,472),
Jammu & Kashmir (11,137) and Odisha (8,075).

Provision of Residential Schools and Hostels in remote Tribal/forest/hilly/desert Areas:-

Realizing that there are many areas which are sparsely populated with low density of population
(mostly tribal areas) and many children in urban areas who are in need of care and protection,
SSA has successfully attempted to address context specific issues of states with regard to access.
The detail of Residential facilities sanctioned under SSA during this period is given below:

           Year          Resi. School           Capacity      Hostel         Capacity
           2007-08       17                     1700          0              0

           2010-11       105                    33450         6              600
           2011-12       3                      1100          10             1000
           2012-13       18                     1750          70             6150
           Total         176                    41300         147            11800

Transport and escort facilities: In addition to regular schools, access to school was also
supported through transport and escort facilities. This facility was provided to children living in
accessless habitation where opening of school was not possible, but these habitation are
connected to schools through all weather roads, children of urban areas where highways or
railway lines were hindrances for access to school.

                     Year            Children         Fund allotted in lakhs
                     2010-11         521010           1672.94
                     2011-12         184058           4510.705
                     2012-13         122779           3435.06

SSA has, thus, brought elementary education to the doorstep of millions of children and enrolled
them in schools including first generation school goers through successive and context specific
initiatives in hitherto unserved and underserved habitations.

Implementation of Right to Education Act 2009 and Consequent Shift in Approach

Provisions made during this period have been discussed above. Following are other rights based
provisions initiated with enactment of RTE Act for Universal Access and Participation.

Removal of Financial Barriers: The RTE Act provides that no child in a neighborhood school,
as notified by the State Government, shall be liable to pay any kind of fee, charge or expense that
may prevent her/him from enrolling, participating and completing elementary education.
Expenses such as textbooks, uniforms and transportation are provided under SSA, unless these
are already being provided under any other scheme of the State Govt. Free noon meals is also
                                                 52
provided under the MDM Scheme. Other schemes of the State Governments and local
authorities, such as scholarships, school bags, stationary, bus passes, etc., also contribute to
meeting the ‘hidden’ costs of education.

Removal of Procedural Barriers: The RTE Act provides for removal of procedural barriers to
school access. It ensures that no child shall be denied admission in a school for want of a Birth or
Transfer Certificate. The Central RTE Rules provide that wherever a Birth Certificate under the
Births, Deaths and Marriages Certification Act, 1886 is not available, an anganwadi record or an
ANM record or a declaration of the age of the child by the parent or guardian would be deemed
to be proof of age. Similarly, State RTE Rules may notify the documents that may suffice in the
absence of a Birth Certificate. Delay in issue of Transfer Certificate shall not be a ground for
denial of admission to a child in the new school.

Any-time admission in school: Admission of a child in school is a fundamental right and it
cannot be denied at any point of time. Ideally, all children should be enrolled in school at the
beginning of the academic session. However, in the case of children in difficult circumstances,
including children affected by migration, displacement or ill health, etc. schools need to be
flexible to allow admission at any time during the session.

Special Training for out-of-school children: The RTE Act makes specific provision for Special
Training for age-appropriate admission for out-of-school children. SSA has provided support for
Special Training for out-of school children who have been admitted to regular schools to ensure
that they are integrated into the school system. Such support is both in the form of residential and
non-residential courses, as needed and other context specific strategies as proposed by states.

Reduction in out of school children

There has been a remarkable reduction in the number of out of school children across the
country. The base line taken during second phase of SSA for estimating reduction of out of
schools children was an all India Independent Survey conducted by IMRB in 2005. A similar
survey conducted in 2009 shows that SSA interventions have brought down the number of out of
school children in the country from 13.46 million to 8.15 million in 2009.

The recent All India survey of Out of School Children in the 6-13 age group conducted in 2010
has revealed that there were 8.15 million out of school children in this age group. Thus, there has
been a reduction of 5.31 million out of school children over the period of 5 years. The
percentage of Out-of-School Children in this age group was 4.28% in 2010 which was 6.94% in
the same age group in 2005 which is a reduction of 2.66 percentage points.

The number of out of school children reduced further in subsequent years. According to the
household survey conducted by states and reported in the annual work plan and budgets, the
number of OOSC is estimated at 29.45 lakh (AWP&B, 2012-13). Number of districts with more
than 50 thousand OOSC was 36 in 2007-08 is now reduced to 4 districts in 2012.

Universal Enrolment

The expansion in schooling facilities has greatly contributed to achieve the goal of universal
enrolment. This is evident from the fact that enrolment at primary level has increased from 134
million to 137 million. The enrolment is near universal at primary level, NER was 95.92 in
2007-08 has increased to 99.89 in 2010-11. Enrolment at upper primary level has increased by
eleven millions during the project period; it has gone up from 50.91 million in 2007-08 to 62
million in 2011-12. The GER at upper primary level have increased by 17 points, it has risen
from 69.88 in 2007-08 to 87 in 2011-12; NER at upper primary level has shown a steep rise
during this period. The NER at upper primary level which was 52 in 2007-08 has increased to 67
in 2011-12.

II     Bridging gender and social category gaps

Increased enrolment share of girls: Participation of girls and of children from disadvantaged
groups has improved. Share of girls in enrolment at primary increased from 48.22 in 2007-08 to
48.35 in 2011-12 whereas in upper primary during the same period it increased from 46.99 to
48.63 (DISE 2011-12).

This impacted the Gender Parity Index (GPI). At the primary level it improved from 0.93 to 0.94
and for upper primary it increased from 0.89 to 0.95. The annual average growth rate of


                                               54
enrolment for girls is considerably higher as compared to boys. The number of districts with high
gender gap in enrolment at primary and upper primary reduced from 65 in 2007 to 35 in 2012.

Increased enrolment share of SC & ST children Share of SC children in enrolment at primary
level improved from 20.08% in 2007-08 to 20.09% in 2011-12 while at upper primary it
marginally reduced from 19.17% to 19.14%. During the same period, enrolment share of ST
showed a decline at primary level from 11.60% to 11.14% while it registered significant increase
at upper primary from 9.23% to 9.86%.

A number of strategies have been adopted to ensure increased enrolment and participation of
girls and other disadvantaged social groups, including SC and ST. These include but are not
limited to opening of neighborhood schools, relaxation of norms in opening schools,
transportation, escort and residential facilities as per need, increasing the number of seats in
tribal schools, innovative activities funded from the Innovation Head of SSA, and the schemes
like Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV), Early Child Care & Education (ECCE) and
National Programme of Education for Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) etc.

Inclusive Education of children with special needs: The practices and interventions under SSA
for Inclusive Education of children with special needs (IE for CWSN) have led to a gradual
increase in identification and enrolment of children with special needs (CWSN). From 26.37
lakh CWSN identified in 2007-08, 32.71lakh CWSN have been identified till now. The current
enrolment of CWSN stands at 28 lakh as compared to 22 lakh in 2007-08. The number of
children with special needs that have been brought into the fold of education (through enrolment
in formal schools, school readiness programmes and through home-based education) has
increased from 2.41 million in 2007-08 to 3.06 million in 2012-13, an increase by 26.97%.
Increase in coverage of CWSN has been approximately 16% more than target. This has been
possible due to a constant focus on children with special needs from the National level, specific
strategies being formulated at the state level, convergence with organizations and schemes under
Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment and with active involvement of a large number of
NGOs in this effort. The percentage of children with special needs identified (1.62% of total
child population) is however still lower than their share in the population (2.1% as per 2001
Census) and a large proportion (about 34.12% in 2009) of the identified children are still out of
school.

The RTE Act has been amended to include children with special needs in the meaning of the
disadvantaged group. Further, the Act also provides to parents of children with severe and
profound disabilities the right to opt for home based education. SSA has adopted a zero
exclusion policy, which means that every child with special needs, irrespective of the kind,
category and degree of disability, is provided meaningful and quality education. 930 NGOs
across 32 States/ UTs are currently working in close partnership with SSA in this area; mainly
for awareness generation, capacity building, surgical assistance, medical assessment and
resource support.

               III     Universal retention

               Retention is a product of many factors, including, but not limited to physical facilities or school
               infrastructure, availability of teachers, professional qualification and in-service/ refresher
               training of teachers, decentralized management of schools, community awareness and
               participation, curricular reforms, improved pedagogy, child centered learning and rigorous
               monitoring of time on task (commonly understood in terms of school attendance) etc. SSA II
               has hugely invested in all these areas. Most of these areas have been discussed in the section on
               Quality, an account of school infrastructure development which is a well organised achievement
               of SSA, besides enhancement in teacher availability and decentralization and curricular reforms
               have been mentioned below.

               Infrastructure development: The schedule to the RTE Act lays down the norms and standards
               for a school building. A school building has to be an all weather building comprising at least one
               classroom for every teacher and an office-cum-store-cum-head teachers room, barrier free
               access, toilets, safe and adequate drinking water facility for all children, arrangements for
               securing the school building boundary wall or green fencing, a kitchen for cooking MDM, a
               playground, equipment for sports and games, a library and TLM. At the national level, the vision
               is to develop each school’s built-environment as an ecosystem for learning. The school is
               envisioned as inclusive and pedagogically rich, , safe and secure from hazards, incorporating
               elements of green architecture, optimum resource utilization through culturally and
               environmentally sustainable practices. SSA supports the creation of school infrastructure as per
               the norms and standards specified in the RTE Act, both through direct programme funding and
               also in convergence with other relevant schemes of the central and state government. Planning
               and implementation by the community through SMC in all school infrastructure development
               activities is mandatory in order to ensure a sense of ownership and a departure from contractor
               driven approaches. The following table depicts the quantum of school infrastructure sanctioned
               under SSA since its inception till 2012 with progress therein.

               As evident, 92% of primary & 96% of upper primary school buildings, 91% of additional
               classrooms, 95% of drinking water and 84% of toilet facilities are either completed or in progress
               (DISE 2011-12).

               Enhancement in teacher availability: SSA has sanctioned 22.17 lakh teachers and part time
               instructors since its inception till 2012; despite delayed recruitment of teachers in many states,
               the number of teachers increased from 56.35 lakh in 2007-08 to 64.03 lakh in 2010-11 (DISE).
               Another intervention, to improve teacher availability at school, is rationalized teacher
               deployment. During SSA II, MHRD has made sustained efforts to impress upon the need to
               address the issue of uneven distribution of teachers. Karnataka is one of the leading states which
               have undertaken teacher cadre management reforms. The state has brought in an Act to provide
               legislative support to the endeavor. TSG has developed software to facilitate rationalized teacher
               deployment in a transparent manner.

                                                                       56
Curricular reforms and decentralization: States have undertaken curricular reforms which
also included development of new textbooks. Efforts for decentralization and participatory
planning and school management have been through forming and strengthening SMC’s (9.86
lakh SMCs have been formed since April 2010, and 21 states/UTs have made progress in
formulating SDP).

Improved retention and transition rates: According to DISE, the retention rate at primary
level increased from 70.26 in 2007-08 to 73.8 in 2011-2. The number of special focus districts
with low retention rate (retention rate > 60) reduced from 114 in 2008-09 to 98 in 2012. The
annual average dropout rate in primary stage which was reported at 8.02 in 2007-08 reduced to
6.5 in 2011-12. The analysis of dropout data over the years indicates that the dropout rate of girls
has been generally lower than that of boys. The Transition Rate from primary to upper primary
also improved from 81.13 in 2007-08 to 86.6 in 2011-12.

IV     Improvement in Quality and learning levels

Quality education and improvement in learning levels is one of the key objectives of SSA. the
programme. The SSA Framework for implementation (revised, 2008 & 2010) describes the
approach to quality, including, content and process to achieve quality, the impediments in
achieving quality and the indicators to monitor improvement therein. The developments under
SSA II can be broadly categorized under two phases; I) The period, during 2007-2010 was
marked by the approach of the 11th Five Year Plan. Quality improvement was a central focus in
the Plan. This focus included, various kind of curricular & teaching learning materials, ensuring
teachers availabilities, good quality of teachers trainings, strengthening of academic support
structures, learning enhancement programme (LEP) to encourage innovation in strategies for
improving learning. II) The period post April 2010, with the RTE act coming into effect, the
approach to quality and learning achievement witnessed a major shift in accordance with
mandate of the Act. This approach has been broadly characterised in the following three
categories;

      Enhancement in enabling component – through provision of additional teachers and
       strengthening existing teachers through various kind of training. It also includes
       providing institutional expertise & strengthening of support structures for school
      Enrichment in core component – includes curriculum, syllabus , textbook, learning in age
       appropriate classes , content rich environment through library and others support
       materials and selection of appropriate pedagogy
      Ensuring Essential components – include various kinds of child entitlements e.g. library,
       books etc.

Major interventions in each of the above categories have been discussed below.

Improved availability of teachers

In order to have requisite PTR in the schools, a three-pronged strategy has been adopted, it
includes, (a) rationalization of the deployment of existing teachers in a transparent manner, (b)

                                                57
filling up of the sanctioned vacant posts under SSA as well as under the State sector and (c)
recruitment of additional teachers.

Status of sanctioned post, teachers working and teacher vacancies

                            Sanctioned till 2012-13    Vacancies till 2012-13

MHRD rigorously followed up with the states on the need for expeditious filling up of posts
sanctioned under SSA and under State quota.

Provisioning of additional teachers as per PTR and new teachers for new schools. SSA provided
additional teachers to the States so as to maintain the PTR as per RTE Act and new teachers
against opening of new schools. Upto 2007-08, the sanctioned strength of teachers under SSA
was 11.12 lakh. Against this sanction, the state had appointed 9.71 lakh teachers (87.33%). By
the year, 2012-13 the States had appointed 12.74991 lakh teachers against the sanctioned
strength of 22.17343 lakh teachers under SSA (57.5%). The vacancies of teachers remained
mainly with respect to State Posts

Teacher Recruitment under SSA from 2007-08 to 2012-13

                                                                 Total No. of Teachers in

       *including part time instructors

Effective utilization of Teachers and students time in School

According to DISE, the average number of days (nationally) on which the school functioned was
211 days for primary and upper primary combined. This increased to 224 days for primary and
225 for upper primary in 2011-12. TSG conducted a research study on teachers and students
attendance (data collected, 2006-07 & published, 2009) wherein it was found that average
attendance rate of students was 68.5% and 75.7% at primary and upper primary levels
respectively. The average attendance rate of teachers was 81.7% and 80.5% respectively in PS
and UPS.

Another study undertaken by TSG regarding utilization of teaches time in school ( 2008) shows
that more than 90% of teacher time goes into curricular activities ( 87.9% time) and training
(2.3% days) while 5.9% time/days was spent on other duties, including, administrative and non-
academic (1.5% days).

The Act prohibits teacher deployment for administrative work except for select functions like
decadal census, election and relief work in case of calamities. To facilitate this manadate, SSA

                                                58
provides additional support at each block to reduce teacher’s non-teaching assignments-
including one MIS person at each block and one accounts person for each 50 schools.

The RTE Act specifies minimum number of working hours per week for the teacher as 45 hours.
This would include inter alia time spent in planning and preparing for the lessons, identifying
specific activities for specific competencies, developing appropriate teaching learning material,
making an assessment of the work done by children keeping in mind the principles of CCE and
keeping a record of each child’s progress based on such assessment.

Effort to improve - Curriculum, syllabus, textbook and content rich environments - For this
purpose the NCERT was notified as the academic authority. The NCF-2005 has been notified as
the national curriculum framework till such time as the central government decides to develop a
new framework. States too have notified Academic Authority which in most cases is SCERT.
Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Punjab and West Bengal
have revised their curriculum and textbooks. The States like Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman &
Nicobar Island, Chandigarh, Delhi, Goa, and Haryana (Up. Pr.), Himachal Pradesh (Up. Pry.)
Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand. Lakshadweep, Rajasthan have adopted the textbooks and
curriculum of NCERT.

Content Rich Environments & Child Centered pedagogy through LEP - SSA advocates a
shift from a teacher-centered classroom to an active classroom that promotes maximum
opportunity time for active student participation and learning. Upto 2% of the total SSA outlay
for a district can be used for district/state specific LEP from 2008-09 onwards. These include
programmes for strengthening reading and mathematics in the early primary grades, or for
strengthening Science and Maths at the upper primary level, etc.

School Library-Over 3.5 lakh schools have been supported to establish libraries to promote
reading.

Free Textbook – Coverage of free textbook distribution was enhanced to general boys. Efforts
were made for ensuring that the textbooks reached students in time. Fund allocation for textbook
distribution increased from 76878.92 lakh in 2007-08 to 165135.80 lakh in 2012-13.

Teachers Trainings – Improved pedagogical approach through continuous capacity
building of teachers

In order to build capacities of teachers SSA provides support for three kinds of training: i.e.
annual in-service training for up to 20 days ii) induction training of 30 days for new recruits, and,
iii) training for professionally untrained teachers. Apart from these, SSA also provides support
for 10 days training of head teachers as well as training of masters trainers.

Teachers are provided various training packages developed by different academic bodies.

Strengthening academic support structures i.e. BRC/CRC - The Block Resource Centers
(BRCs) and Cluster Resource Centers (CRCs) have been established across the country to
enhance teachers’ performance by extending professional support. Progress in Operationalization
of BRC & CRC is indicated below.

Technical Support for Quality

At the national level, NCERT has been assisting the States in setting up core groups for
reviewing their syllabi in the light of NCF-2005. The SCERTCs and the SIEs have been there to
provide academic support to the States wherein the textbooks, TLM and training modules are
modified to bring in quality. Twenty Eight states have declared SCERT/ SIE as academic
authority of their respective States.

I.       Achievements Survey – two rounds of achievements survey shows that there has
         been significant progress in term of Scholastic achievements of children. On comparing
         round I and II of achievement surveys (conducted by NCERT, during 2003-2009) it was
         found that Average achievement increased in all groups in Maths and languages in case
         of class III (Table below). Further in case of class V the average achievement increased
         in all subjects & across all groups, except in language for urban and ST children.


         Achievement Survey - Round III-: Highlights of the progress on the third round of the
         survey and the trends are indicated below.

              Third round testing based on Item Response Theory: superior methodology for
               measuring achievement levels.

                                                 60
          Third round testing initiated :

           i) Class V achievement test completed :
           ii) Class VIII – administering of tests in progress.
           iii) Class III testing in 2012-13.

       Findings for class V indicated improvement in learning levels, but there are areas of
       concern, in Language there has been an improvement in learning achievement in 24
       States/UTs, in Mathematics, 14 States have improved learning levels, in Environmental
       Studies, 24 States/UTs have shown an improvement in learning level.

II.    Implementation of CCE: the RTE Act mandates for CCE wherein autonomy has been
       given to the teacher to evaluate the child on continuously and comprehensively. Teachers
       and other education functionaries are being trained in CCE.

III.   Innovative practices to improve learning: Several States have introduced innovative
       mechanisms to ensure teaching learning. For example:

          Andhra Pradesh has developed Academic Standards by intertwining teaching and
           learning for attaining certain levels of learning. For different classroom levels
           different standards have been developed. These standards are being used for
           monitoring teachers and their teaching.
          Similarly Odisha has introduced assessment of schools against given parameters by
           the programme named as ‘Samiksha’.
          Gujarat has introduced ‘Gunotsva’ as a monitoring tool for learning-based
           innovations in the classroom processes.
          Rajasthan introduced at small sample level (12000 schools) as quality assurance
           programme ‘Sambalan’ at school level.
          The innovations like “Nali Kali’ of Karnataka and ‘Pado Punjab’ of the Punjab have
           reaped dividends. Such activity based programmes have been very much liked by the
           children and these have been successful in reducing dropout rate.

3. Reforming decentralized planning and management

Decentralized planning and community participation: Decentralization in planning &
management is essential to achieving enhanced participation of community. Decentralized school
management has been in practice at a large scale since the inception of DPEP through the Village
Education Committee (VEC). The SSA envisages a participatory and bottom up approach to
planning right from the habitation level. The school management was decentralized by up scaling
the VEC experience.

The RTE Act, 2009 has mandated formation of School Management Committee (SMC). The Act
mandates the participation of community, teachers, parents and PRIs through the SMC in the
visioning, planning and running of the school. Local authorities envisaged under the Act, have
been mandated to take decisions from opening of school to school timings to academic calendars,
ushering in a collegial and collaborative process of school management.


                                                61
School Development Plan (SDP): Since school is the delivery point for RTE and the Act assigns
to school a critical role in the community based and community owned planning process,
therefore, inclusive school development reforms have become necessary. States now are at
various stages with regard to formulation and implementation of SDP. Many states have
developed guidelines and formats to operationalize the process of SDP and feed it into the district
AWP&B under RTE – SSA. States like Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Himachal
Pradesh, Gujarat & Rajasthan etc. have been preparing for a couple of years their AWP&Bs on
the basis of SDP.

4. Project financing and financial management

Fund allocation and utilization during SSA II

Budgetary allocations for elementary education specially the SSA have been going up year on
year particularly after introduction of Right of Children to Free & Compulsory Education Act
2009. The allocation in 2007-08 was 2064838.82 lakh which increased to Rs.6993651.87 lakh in
2012-13 (i.e. an increase of over 338%). The central share released by Government of India to
State Implementation Societies was raised to Rs. 20820 crores in 2011-12 from Rs. 11119 crores
in 2006-07 registering an increase of 87%.Correspondingly. This happened for 2 reasons; i) The
annual allocations substantially increased in lieu of the RTE Act, and ii) the sliding scale of
centre state fund sharing (which has all along been in favour of states) was reversed in 2010 55-
45 to 65-35 (90 – 10) for the States in the North-eastern Region to reduce the burden on the
states. The State Governments also raised the level of their contribution in lieu of the increased
outlays to the programme to Rs. 10450 crores in 2011-12 from Rs. 3517 crores in 2006-07. The
States increased their share by 97%. The deficit of Rs. 984 crores in release of State share at the
end of 2011-12 is offset by an excess release of State share amounting to Rs. 2108 crores during
the period.

Funding by DPs during SSA II

The funding provided by the Development Partners for SSA-II including additional funds is as
follows:
  (i) IDA – US $ 1350 million (SDR 847 million)
  (ii) DFID - £ 280.46 million
  (iii) EC – Euro 158.20 million

Against this, the disbursement made by Development Partners is as follows:

Except in the case of EC, the funds provided by IDA and DFID have been fully utilized before
the closing date of the Project.

E-Transfer of funds and utilization

Government of India is transferring the funds to States through RTGS ensuring prompt
availability of funds with the States. State Implementation Societies in turn release funds
electronically to the districts and in many cases upto the level of schools. Increased availability
of funds with the implementing agencies resulted in enhanced expenditures. The expenditure
went upto Rs. 37863 crores in 2011-12 as compared to Rs. 14540 crores in 2006-07. The
unspent balance which was 14.57% of the available funds in 2006-07 was reduced to 11% in
2011-12. This indicates significant improvement in implementation of the programme activities.
Government of India has started Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System (CPSMS) to track the
availability of funds with the implementing agencies.

Financial management and procurement

SSA has put in place a sound financial management system by rolling out a Manual on Financial
Management & Procurement. This Manual provides guidance on financial planning, budgeting,
accounting, fund flow arrangements, financial reporting, internal control & internal audit,
statutory audit and procedure for procurement. To further improve the effectiveness of
monitoring, it has now been decided to review the performance of SSA on monthly basis.

Development Partners have not prescribed their own procurement procedures but allowed to
follow the procurement procedure prescribed in the Manual. However, financial ceiling for
various method of procurement was prescribed by the Development Partners and the States have
followed these fiancial ceilings. States are also preparing the Annual Procurement Plan and
uploading the same on State SSA’s Website. MHRD is monitoring the progress of preparation
of Annual Procurment Plan by the States. In order to monitor the progress of procurement
MHRD has developed a software for open tender contracts above Rs. 10 lakh and the same has
been hosted on a dedicated Website. A user’s Manual has also been developed by MHRD and
the same is also hosted on the Website along with the software.

5. Monitoring mechanism

A robust monitoring system for SSA is in place. At the grassroot levels community in general
and SMC in particular monitor the implementation. The Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator
(CRCC) monitors implementation in all the schools in the clusters through regiular visits to each
school individually. The State,district and block level offices monitor implementation at their
respective levels through establisehed mechanisms like periodic reviews, field visits, DISE,
PMIs etc.Monitoring mechanism at the national is indicated below:

(i)     Statutory Audit by Chartered Accountants Firms on the empanelled list of Comptroller
        and Auditor General of India.
(ii)    Internal Audit by in-house arrangement or by Chartered Accountants.
(iii)   Concurrent Financial review by IPAI

                                                63
(iv)     Audit by State Auditor General
(v)      Performance Audit by Comptroller and Auditor General of India.
(vi)     Social Audit of Schools by community members
(vii)    Social Audit by NCPCR/SCPCR
(viii)   Quarterly Review Meeting of State level Coordinators.
(ix)     Periodic review meetings by Secretary/Addle Secretary of the Minstry of HRD
(x)      Half yearly Joint Review Mission.
(xi)     Field based monitoring by independent Monitoring Institutions (MI)
(xii)    Surveys and research studies commissioned by the Ministry
(xiii)   Concurrent review by officials of the Ministry/ TSG Consultants
(xiv)    Annual District Information on School Education (DISE)
(xv)     Annual Appraisal

7. Lessons learnt

Implementation of the project through an autonomous State Implementation Society (SIS) on
behalf of the State government has proved a remarkable strategy which has resulted in
expeditious implementation, monitoring, follow-up and financial progress. Formulation of
annual work plan and budgets and funding based on the district AWP&B has also proved to be a
very significant strategy for comprehensive district based planning.
Decentralization and delegation in planning, management and monitoring of interventions has
emerged as a key learning. That participation of civil society is a crucial factor for stakeholders
participation is another important lesson learnt. That quality of education cannot be achieved
only by infrastructure and teacher provisioning and curricular reforms are essential towards this
objective by far has been the most crucial lesson learnt.
The most crucial lesson learnt is that interventions for equity and quality have to run hand in
hand and not on after the other.

            New Delhi.

            Sub: Comments on IC R-SSA II

                   This is with reference to your email dated 14.03.2013 wherein draft copy ofiCR-
            SSA 2013 was shared with the Department. I am instructed to bring the following points
            to your notice with reference to the draft report.

            1.     In para F-Results Framework Analysis-(a) PDO indicators - At indicator 7, it
            is mentioned that improvement in learning levels in grades 3, 5 and 7/8, the target has not
            been achieved. It is also mentioned in the comments that NAS round 3 for Class V was
            conducted with IRT analysis, hence the results are not comparable with the base line.

                    Round I and 2 showed improvement in learning levels and in round 3 there were
            only 10 indicators which were common to the earlier rounds. Though the number of these
            common indicators is very small, however, it shows moderate improvement in most of
            the States. Hence, " not achieved" is not be an appropriate response.

            2.      In para F- Results Framework Analysis-(b) Intermediate Outcome
            indicators- In Indicator 3, it is mentioned that number of districts with Pupil Teacher
            Ratio > 40 was 104 on 30'h June, 20 12. The indicator on the original SSA-11 PAD was
            number of districts with PTR more than 60 and it is indicated that post RTE Act, this has
            been revised to number of districts with PTR more than 30: I. It may kindly be noted that
            the RTE Act mandates that PTR should be maintained at school level. Hence associating
            number of districts with adverse PTR to RTE Act is a fallacious correlation. The target
            indicator may be kept as originall y decided for number of districts with PTR > 40, since
            this was the target assigned under SSA-JI.

            3.     In para F- Results F ramework Analysis - (b) Intermediate Outcome
            indicators-In Indicator 5, cumulative achievements in ACRs till December, 2012 may be




                                                     66
corrected to 1.38 million till 31 51 December, 2012. The achievement figures are collected
quarterly only and date 18.01.2012 given in the draft 1CR appears to be incorrect.

4.     In para F- Results Framework Analysis - (b) Intermediate Outcome
indicators-In Indicator 8, percentage of schools with common toilets as per DISE 2011-
12 may be corrected to read 76%.

5.     In para F- Results Framework Analysis - (b) Intermediate Outcome
indicators-In Indicator 9, percentage of schools having separate girls toilets as per DISE
20 11-12 may be corrected to read 65%.

6.      Para 4-Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome mentions that
continuation of reforp1s in education system governance, accountability and service
delivery are likely to remain challenging in some States with week governance
environment. The remark appears inappropriate as there are elected governance at the
State and the Central level, with a well established framework of governance.

7.      Annexure-2 - Output by Components- In the Intermediate Results Indicator
quotes from ASER 20 12 Report for students attendance at primary and upper primary
level as well as teacher attendance at primary and upper primary level. It may be noted
that ASER is a habitation based sample surv~ and hence an inappropriate reference
for teacher pupil attendance in government schools where SSA is implemented.

8.      In Annexure-2-0utput bv Compo nents- B. Outputs by Objectives- It may be
noted that 54% of schools have libraries as per DISE 20 11- 12.

       The World Bank support has been important in the implementation ofSSA during
the SSA-11 period. Successive JRMs have contributed to the enhancing the delivery of the
programme on the basis of inputs given by the members.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

European Union

The European Commission engagement, along with the World Bank and the DFID, in
elementary education goes back to the start of the District Primary Education Programme
(DPEP), the precursor to the ongoing Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme. It is heartening
to note that international cooperation in the sector has continued on a robust path, currently using
a full-fledged Sector Wide Approach to funding. The SSA programme has been consolidating
gains and absorbing lessons learnt over time, and is arguably one of the biggest elementary
education sector programs in the world. While managing for scale, the programme has also
catered to the diversity that India represents – by identifying special target districts with high
Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Minorities population, educational blocks with
low female literacy or high gender gaps, and children with special needs, for greater attention
and focused action. It is noteworthy that SSA has been supported by different successive
governments with enthusiasm and there has been a clear upward trend in additional domestic
resource mobilization for the sector. India's deep commitment to improve universal access to
quality education is reflected in the recent Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, which
came into force 1st April, 2010, making elementary education a fundamental right, and the 11th
Plan allocations, have all contributed to putting elementary education in the spotlight – these are
opportune times to ensure that India is able to reach the MDGs in education.

The SSA programme has the characteristics of a highly aid effective SWAp from the point of
view of international support – it is based on a coherent and long term sector policy by the
Government of India, it is supported largely by domestic resources and coalesces allocations
from the Centre and States to reach the stated goals and objectives, has clear-cut monitorable
indicators and is supported by harmonized donor contributions that reinforce the country's own
systems and procedures for planning, implementation and monitoring. It can be said that the SSA
programme resonates very well the key principles and objectives of the European Union's
Development Policy which are articulated in the European Consensus for Development:
    There is exemplary ownership by the GoI in designing and implementing development
     strategies and programmes for improving elementary education: the strength of leadership
     provided by the GoI and the State governments is a key factor in bringing about such
     robust international cooperation.
    There are well structured platforms for dialogue both within the country between different
     stakeholders as well as between the Indian counterparts and representatives of the
     international Development Partners in support of program implementation and monitoring.
    The programme includes participation of civil society in designing specific interventions,
     particularly addressing the needs of the most vulnerable groups of population. Civil society
     groups have played an active role in collaborating with the government, have helped to
     build capacities in the sector and have conveyed the voices and aspirations of the hardest to
     reach children

The programme has actively promoted gender equality in education through all its interventions.
Efforts to promote the participation of girls in schooling and the attendant results are particularly

                                                 68
noteworthy and the EC would like to commend the efforts of the GOI and the State governments
in implementing a range of interventions for girls. The programme has facilitated mainstreaming
gender equality in education policies and supported financing measures that directly influence
girls' participation in education, such as incentives for girls to attend schools, free textbooks and
uniforms and improving the school environment through the construction of toilets for girls and
so on. These are very much in line with the EU policy on Gender Equality and Women's
Empowerment in Development Cooperation. The focus on Inclusive education is also
noteworthy and in line with EU Policy.

Turning to international participation in SSA, it can be observed that India was implementing the
spirit of the precepts of the Paris Declaration and Aid Effectiveness. The EU Code of Conduct on
Division of Labor in Development Policy 38 that incorporates the principles of country
ownership, alignment, harmonization and management by results entailed in the Paris
Declaration and which includes additional objectives and values of the EU on Development are
reflected in actual practice.

To summarize, it has been a fruitful and exciting journey of international collaboration to support
the home-grown program of reform in elementary education. Indeed, there is much to celebrate
in terms of success and progress. In the coming period, it would be necessary to provide access
to the most difficult target groups; states would need to consider comprehensive strategies for
teacher recruitment, teacher development and their career management; a sharper focus at upper
primary levels is warranted, as also efforts to bring measurable improvements to quality and
strengthen result oriented monitoring. The current times are conducive to support these in terms
of policy and resources and to break further ground to improve results and impact. The 12th Plan
strategy for Elementary Education is focused on improving learning outcomes at all levels. The
12th Plan targets for Elementary Education are to improve learning outcomes that are measured,
monitored and reported independently at all levels of school education with a specific focus on
ensuring that all children master basic reading and numeracy skills by class 2 and skills of
critical thinking, expression and problem solving by class 5. As we move into the next phase of
cooperation in SSA, we hope that there are opportunities to exchange best practices and
innovative approaches in education at different levels in the European context with Indian
institutions and to share EU-wide experiences in improving school education.
