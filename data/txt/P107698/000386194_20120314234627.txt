        IRAQ — REGIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROJECT
                                  P107698
                                 TF092237
                    Revisions to Procurement Methods



1.     This is a Level II restructuring to include an additional method of procurement to
the Grant Agreement for the Regional Health Emergency Response Project (RHERP) as
per the request of the Ministry of Health of the Regional Government of Kurdistan
(KRG MOH) dated January 4, 2012.

2.      The original grant for the above project was approved on June 19, 2008 for
US$8.7 million, with additional financing for US$4.5 million approved on June 30, 2010.
The project is at 80% physical completion, with the disbursement level at 82%. The
project is rated as moderately satisfactory, with the near completion and functionality of
the Emergency Coordination Centers (ECCs), the installation of the CAD/AVL
(emergency tracking system), and the installation of radio towers. All blood banks have
been completed, equipped, and are operational, except for the Erbil Blood Bank which
has settlement cracks in the facility which need to be remedied prior to being operational.
Data for collection and use of blood for emergency purposes is currently being collected.
Other project data such as response time using the new system and registration of
incoming calls, will be collected in February 2012 once the ECCs are operational.

3.     The request to add a procurement method is based on the assessment and needs of
the project to include the addition of Direct Contracting to Paragraph 2 of Part B of
Section III of Schedule 2 of the Grant Agreement which would read as follows:

        “Other Methods of Procurement of Goods and Works. The following
       methods, other than International Competitive Bidding, may be used for
       procurement of goods and works for those contracts specified in the Procurement
       Plan: (a) Limited International Bidding; (b) National Competitive Bidding,
       subject to additional provisions set forth in the Annex to this Schedule 2; (c)
       Shopping; and (d) Direct Contracting.?

4.      The KRG MOH has requested procurement of an additional 15 ambulances under
the project to strengthen its existing fleet of over 100 vehicles in anticipation of the
launch of the emergency response system supported by the project. The Grant
Agreement does not currently include Direct Contracting as a procurement method.
Adding vehicles with the same specifications would ensure alignment of the vehicles to
be procured with the existing ambulance fleet and maintenance program. The estimated
unit cost for the vehicles would be US$67,000. The addition of this method to the Grant
Agreement would also permit the KRG MOH to procure these additional 15 ambulances
expeditiously, given that the project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2012. In addition,
the need for Direct Contracting was highlighted in November 2011 when a waiver had to

                                            5
be sought to purchase an IP-PBX system (telephone communication system) costing
US$120,000.

5.      The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) continues to act as the
implementing agency for the KRG MOH. The project continues to receive the
commitment of the KRG MOH. Completion of project activities is scheduled for end
March 2012 with systems expected to be operational during the April to June 2012
period.

6.      During      the   November       2011    mission,     an  Action    Plan    and
Procurement/Disbursement Plan were agreed for the remaining key activities of the
project, namely, the purchase of the IP-PBX telephone system which routes emergency
calls to the ECCs through the radio towers, and dispatches ambulances (delivered in late
December 2011), completion of all minor works on the ECCs, radio tower development
and installation, interconnections, test and acceptance for the CAD/AVL and the Radio
Communications System, public awareness campaign, and operating manual for the
Emergency Medical System (EMS)/Emergency Coordination Centers (ECCs) system
that has been put in place under the project (communication systems, training manuals,
radio systems, etc.).

7.      There are no overdue audit reports and Interim Un–audited Financial Reports
have been submitted on a regular basis to the World Bank. Based on the revised Closing
Date, the next audit report will cover the period from July 1, 2010 up to December 31,
2011, and will be due by June 30, 2012 and the last audit report will cover the period
from January 1, 2012 up to the Closing Date plus the four-month grace period ending
October 31, 2012, and will be due for submission by December 31, 2012.
