                        Extension of Closing Date
        IRAQ — REGIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROJECT
                              P107698
                             TF092237


1.      This is a Level II restructuring for a six-month extension of the Iraq Regional
Health Emergency Response Project, which has a current closing date of December 31,
2011 and therefore it is proposed to extend the closing date to June 30, 2012. This will
be the second extension of the project, the first extension having been approved on June
30, 2010 for a period of 18 months, bringing the total extension period to 24 months,
requiring RVP approval per BP 13.30, paragraph 7. The proposed extension has been
assessed to be needed to complete all remaining project activities, by which the project
objectives will be met within the requested six-month period.

2.      The project is at 75% completion, with disbursement levels at 77% (disbursed and
committed). The project is rated as satisfactory, with the near completion and
functionality of the Emergency Coordination Centers (ECCs), the installation of the
CAD/AVL (emergency tracking system), and the installation of radio towers. All Blood
Banks have been completed, equipped, and operational, except for the Erbil Blood Bank
which has settlement cracks which need to be remedied prior to being operational. Data
for collection and use of blood for emergency purposes is currently being collected.
Other project indicators will be collected in February 2012 once the ECCs are
operational.

3.      The delays incurred over the last year have been due to lack of full understanding
of the key elements required in an Emergency Medical System. Intensive capacity
building has been carried out during 2011 for both the United Nations Office for Project
Services (UNOPS) and the Ministry of Health of the Regional Government of Kurdistan
in Iraq (KRG MOH), and the pace of implementation has picked up since July 2011.
There is a clearer understanding of the requirements of the system, which resulted in the
MOH putting in place an Emergency Medical System (EMS) framework, requesting a
specific line item for EMS for the 2012 budget exercise, hiring of key staff, training of
EMS managers using counterpart funds, which also reflects on the commitment of the
MOH to complete all project activities and have a fully functional emergency system.

4.      The extension period is to operationalize the ECCs for Erbil, Dohuk and
Suleimaniyah, and the Blood Bank of Erbil, carry out additional training of Emergency
Medical Technicians on the live CAD/AVL system, finalize interconnection and resolve
interference issues between the radio towers and the ECCs, finalize the framework for
“122? (similar to the “911? system of the US), and launch the products which will be
used in the awareness campaign.

5.     During the November 2011 mission, an Action Plan was completed and agreed
upon to complete the key activities of the project. These include, but are not limited to,
                                            5
purchase of the IP-PBX telephone system which routes emergency calls to the ECCs
through the radio towers, and dispatches ambulances. The IP-PBX system has been
delivered and will be installed in early January 2012. Completion of all minor works on
the ECCs, radio tower development and installation, interconnections, test and
acceptance for both the CAD/AVL and the Radio Communications System, awareness
campaign, and operating manual for the full system will take place by March 31, 2012.

6.     This will be the second extension of the project, the first extension having been
approved on June 30, 2010 for a period of 18 months.

7.     There are no overdue audit reports and Interim Un–audited Financial Reports
(IFRs) have been regularly submitted to the World Bank. Building on the proposed
extension, the next audit report will cover the period from July 1, 2010 up to December
31, 2011, and will be due by June 30, 2012 and the last audit report will cover the period
from January 1, 2012 up to the closing date plus the four-month grace period ending
October 31, 2012, due for submission by December 31, 2012.
