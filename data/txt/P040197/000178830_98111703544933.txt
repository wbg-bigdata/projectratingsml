A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The proposed project would continue IDA's support to the Government of Nicaragua through FISE in its poverty
alleviation efforts in the following areas: (i) providing essential small-scale infrastructure, mainly in education, health,
and water supply and sanitation (in close coordination with the responsible line agencies), (ii) focusing on the poorest
communities, and (iii) strengthening, on a pilot basis, municipal management which, in turn, should lead to more
sustainable subprojects at the local level.
The project's development objectives would be achieved through targeted investments and pilot approaches that (if
successful) could be expanded, particularly dealing with rural water supply and the participation of women and
indigenous peoples. Key performance indicators would monitor the efficiency and equity in the allocation and use of
resources as illustrated by: the quantity and quality of FISE's investment projects in the poorest areas; FISE's contribution
to overall sectoral expenditures in the priority sectors (education, health, and water supply and sanitation); number of
participating municipalities and degree of beneficiary participation in the allocation of resources and in the operation and
maintenance of subprojects (decentralization); and subproject technical and financial sustainability, particularly for rural
water supply projects (development impact)..
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: Report No. P- 1 7496-NI, dated March 18, 1998.
Date of latest CAS discussion: April 9, 1998.
The reduction of poverty and income inequality is at the center of IDA's assistance program. More specifically, IDA's
main objectives are to: (i) consolidate growth through private sector development, (ii) develop the rural sector and
strengthen environmental protection, and (iii) develop human capital and protect the poor. To this end, IDA would also
assist the country to reduce its extemal debt burden to sustainable levels and help the modemization of the state. The
proposed FISE project would directly support the third objective, in close coordination with other projects dealing with
poverty and the social sectors, whether funded by IDA or other bi- and multilateral agencies.
FISE was created in 1990 to mitigate the effects of the economic stabilization program following many years of civil war.
Its mandate has now grown from providing a safety net and generating employment to playing a key role in improving
living conditions and development opportunities among the poorest segments of the country's population. It seeks to
accomplish this goal by improving access to, as well as quality and sustainability of, priority social infrastructure in the
poorest areas. Because of Nicaragua's large investment needs and FISE's substantial effectiveness in resource
mobilization, targeting, and use, FISE has been maintained as a main government instrument to provide social sector
investments and alleviating poverty. The proposed project would continue to support FISE's efforts aimed at the above,
with a new focus on rural water supply and municipal/community involvement. To this end, it would emphasize and rely
significantly on the participation of beneficiaries, locally-based NGOs, local govemments, and the private sector to ensure
that investments represent local priorities and that prospects for sustainability are maximized.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Poor Social Indicators: The greatest challenge facing Nicaragua is reducing the extent and depth of its poverty and
improving its social indicators, which were affected badly by the civil war and inadequate economic policies. It is
estimated that half of the population falls below the poverty line and one-fifth below the extreme poverty line. Poverty is
much higher in rural areas; three of four rural inhabitants are poor. While slowly improving, social indicators continue to
be inadequate: life expectancy is low (66), and infant mortality (53 per 1,000 live births) and fertility rates (5 children per
woman of child bearing age) are the highest in the region. At the current growth rate (3 percent per year), the population
doubles every 23 years. The illiteracy rate remains high at 23 percent (41 percent in rural areas); average schooling is
only 4.5 years and the quality of education is low. Water coverage is 64 percent (30 percent in rural areas) and lack of



3
clean water is a major factor contributing to diarrhea as a main cause of infant mortality. Sanitation coverage is also low
at 18 percent in rural areas.
Government Strategy: Although a large share of government resources is allocated to the social sectors, absolute per
capita expenditures in education and health are still well below regional averages. Within these constraints, the
Government's social sector policy aims to: (i) expand access to social services (basic education, health, and water); (ii)
improve efficiency and accountability (at the national and local levels) in the delivery of social services; and (iii) focus on
the most vulnerable groups that suffer from malnutrition and extreme poverty. Although the Government's programs
have a number of positive features, actual implementation of the above policies remains limited because of: (a) lack of a
coherent framework for short-term interventions (social safety net), (b) slow speed of modernization / reform of line
ministries; (c) inefficient institutional arrangements, (d) inadequate information systems in implementing agencies and
programs, and (e) gaps in the safety net, with insufficient attention to malnutrition and water and sanitation. 1 In addition,
the Government has yet to define a decentralization strategy, which is central to both line ministries and social safety net
programs. The Government, with the support of a great number of multi-and bi-lateral donors, is now trying to address
these issues, starting with a policy and operational framework agreement. Since its establishment in 1990, FISE has been
a key instrument in this effort, and has become a crucial government instrument for financing small-scale investment
projects in the social sectors. FISE's contribution to poverty alleviation, through its targeted interventions, has been
significant in terms of providing social and economic infrastructure and improving social services and coverage in poor
areas (see Annex 10). FISE's contribution to investments in the social sector has been increasingly significant. Between
1991 and 1996, its investments rose from US$10.5 million per year to US$31.9 million, averaging about 17 percent of
public investments. FISE accounted for 99 percent of public investment in education and 25 percent in health during that
period.
Past achievements need to be sustained. In spite of achievements to date, further substantial investment is required to
improve the coverage and quality of basic social and economic infrastructure. Continued disparities in terms of access,
utilization, and quality of social services and social and economic infrastructure between poor and less-poor communities,
and between rural and urban areas, make it essential that scarce resources for such investments are targeted equitably, that
they respond to the highest priorities, and that projects, once completed, are operating as long as possible.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Since 1991, IDA, IDB, KfW and a significant number of other multi- and bilateral donors have supported the
Government's reconstruction and development efforts, particularly in the social sectors and among the most vulnerable
groups, through various credits and grants to FISE. IDA's successful support to FISE is documented in the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR, Sec. M97-122 of April 11, 1997) for FISE I (Cr. 2434-NI) and supervision
reports for Cr. 2767-NI (including a Mid-Term Review issued in May 1997).2 The Government continues to rely on FISE
for the delivery of education, health, and water supply and sanitation infrastructure to the poorest regions of the country.
This project would continue to assist the Government's strategy, and would place increased emphasis on improving the
efficiency and equity of resource allocation, subproject sustainability, as well as local development.
The proposed project would support FISE's expansion into the rural water sector in close cooperation with the National
Water Institute (INAA), its ongoing contribution to the health and education sectors in close cooperation with the
Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Education (MOE), and pilot work in municipal and community
strengthening and decentralization of resources to the local level in close cooperation with the Nicaraguan Institute for
Municipal Development (INIFOM) and the associations of municipalities. Additionally, the project would support
FISE's efforts in quality assurance, beneficiary participation (including women), subproject sustainability, the
development of pilot projects for indigenous peoples, and an expanded role for local NGOs in FISE's operations at the
municipal/community level.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The Government's capacity to implement its social sector policies is limited by ongoing budgetary constraints and the
persistent weakness of public institutions, including the FISE counterpart agencies. The situation is worse in water
supply, where there is still no agreed policy. The impact and viability of public sector expenditures in the long-run,
particularly of FISE' s investments, depends on FISE's ability to transfer its know-how and lessons learned to line
institutions. However, the current sectoral context does not yet provide a receptive climate to fully realize this transfer;
therefore, an alternative and more realistic route is to go to the lower level, and work directly with local governments and
beneficiary organizations. This is being pursued through pilot efforts aimed at micro-planning and municipal
strengthening.
Key focus areas for this project would be:
* Reformulation of FISE's role and coordination with central and local government agencies;
* Targeting and coverage of FISE's investments, including a substantial rural water supply effort;
* Complementarity with and avoidance of duplication with other public and private sector programs;
* Long-tern sustainability of FISE's investments; and
* Local development, decentralization and effective transfer of FISE's know-how to the local level and other
government agencies (pilot effort).
3. Benefits and target population:
The proposed project would affect over half of the population currently living below the poverty line, through the
provision of small-scale economic and social infrastructure and improved social services in the poorest areas (using a
poverty map) and for the poorest population groups. The project would aim at increasing the involvement of
beneficiaries and their local governments in identifying, planning and implementing development projects. It would thus
contribute to efficiency, transparency, and equity in social expenditures and public investment, and ensure that
investments are priorities of local communities (to help guarantee that there is local ownership of investments); this,
combined with efforts to train local agents and end-users in operations and maintenance would enhance the prospects of
sustainability of subprojects. Special emphasis would be placed on targeting women and indigenous groups with
investment strategies. Efforts would be made to increase coordination with, and to transfer FISE's expertise to, line

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period. Four years: mid-1998 until mid-2002.
Project Implementation and Coordination. The project would be managed by FISE, which is the largest and most efficient
institution for small-scale investments in social and economic infrastructure, in close coordination with MOH, MOE,
INAA, and INIFOM. With annual disbursements of US$30-35 million, FISE accounts for about 20 percent of all public
investment and more than 60 percent of social investment. Its well-trained staff (currently 181) uses targeting and
evaluation criteria that ensure high efficiency levels and guarantee that funds reach target groups. It is also practically the
only government institution that retained its key technical staff after the recent change in government.
The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for FISE I found that the project objective of sustaining poverty alleviation
efforts and maintaining social cohesion during the period of economic adjustment was substantially achieved. FISE met
the geographic and sectoral targets for poverty interventions that were established at appraisal; improved the coverage and
conditions of social services delivery through significant investment in social infrastructure; increased subproject
financing and coverage by means of mobilizing additional external resources; strengthened private sector development in
the construction, private banking, and insurance sectors; helped build municipalities' technical capacities in subproject
processing; and improved overall operational efficiency. MOH and MOE benefited from institutional strengthening;
however, the intended transfer of FISE experience and its methods of operations and procedures was limited by personnel
turnover in both ministries and a weak consultation process.
The Mid-Term Review of FISE II, conducted in April 1997, showed that FISE had taken measures to improve the
technical aspects of subproject quality, for example, through the contracting out of subproject supervision and financing
of community organization and training subprojects to ensure better operation and maintenance of completed subprojects.
New community organization and training activities under the proposed project should contribute to subproject
sustainability, which should also be helped by the recent establishment of a Preventive Maintenance Fund (Annex 2,
Section 2) for investments in social infrastructure (with equal contributions from the central and local governments, and
FISE) and a Communications and Social Training Unit.
Additionally, FISE updated its poverty map for geographic resource targeting, based on the results of the LSMS of 1993
and population census data of 1995. The number of municipalities in each poverty category was adjusted. In the new
map, extreme poverty municipalities number 44, compared to 39 in the old map; high poverty municipalities number 69,
compared to 95; and medium poverty municipalities number 34, compared to 9 in the old map. The percentage allocation
of resources in each poverty category also changed. In the new map, the allocation of resources to extreme poverty
municipalities is about 57 percent of total resources, compared to the previous target of 20 percent; high poverty
municipalities receive about 36 percent, compared to 57 percent; and medium poverty category municipalities receive
about 7 percent, compared to 23 percent. The map will be further improved to reflect the results of the 1998 LSMS.
Subprojects would initially still be identified by communities, NGOs, and municipal authorities, but, under an accelerating
pilot program for micro-planning and municipal strengthening, increasingly selected by communities (cabildos abiertos),
managed by the municipalities, and carried out by private sector contractors and NGOs. The micro-planning and
municipal strengthening efforts, accompanied by substantial municipal and community training, have already been started
with the help of experienced NGOs in 44 municipalities, and will be expanded gradually to 60 of the country's
municipalities (see Annex 2, Section 2). The new policies and guidelines have been described in great detail in the
revised Operational Manual and supporting documentation.
Project Oversight. A Presidential Decree permits FISE to operate relatively free from political interference, and exempts
the institution from standard government budget, procurement, and recruitment regulations. Oversight is provided by a
Board of Directors, with four members appointed by the President of the Republic. FISE's Executive Director is a non-
voting member of the Board. Substantial oversight would also continue to be provided by the donors.



7
Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Requirements. Financial audit reports, prepared by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA, would be submitted to IDA annually in accordance with IDA standards. In addition, concurrent audit
reports of a sample of subprojects, both in execution and completed, covering both their processing and implementation,
would be prepared by the same auditor and submitted to IDA quarterly. FISE would also prepare semi-annual progress
reports. The experience under earlier projects has been excellent, and FISE is taking steps to adapt its financial
management systems in line with IDA's new Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI).
Monitoring and Evaluation. FISE does have, updates, and reviews regularly a comprehensive set of key performance
indicators (see Annex 1, Attachment). However, these indicators are being reconsidered in the context of a
comprehensive Impact Evaluation study, which is being carried out with the help of IDA staff, and funded partly under a
Japanese Grant (see Annex 2, Section 2). Preliminary results are expected by the end of this year. This major effort
should lead to establishing a baseline and regular update, as well as agreed economic evaluation and key performance
indicators, by no later than June 30, 1999. Additional funding for this effort would be provided under the credit. The
project would also be subject to regular supervision by IDA and other donor staff, including their participation in annual
project implementation reviews, as well as frequent beneficiary assessments and ongoing subproject quality monitoring.
Cofinancing. Apart from IDA, FISE has received, and will continue to receive, substantial funding from IDB, KfW,
OPEC, and various other bi-lateral donors. Cooperation between the donors has been excellent, and the proposed project
has been designed in close consultation with the other donors, in particular with IDB and KfW.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Since its establishment, FISE has remained unparalleled in Nicaragua as an efficient delivery mechanism for small-scale
public sector investments. Alternatively, the substantial amount of social sector investment financed and delivered
through FISE could have been channeled through the line ministries (MOH and MOE) and the water supply agency
(INAA). However, some years ago, the Government decided that the line ministries should channel their investment
programs through FISE. In addition, INAA has never developed the capacity to process a substantial number of small-
scale projects in rural areas. Also, although this would be further piloted and promoted under the project, the
municipalities/communities have still not developed the necessary capacity to manage these types of projects on their own
without substantial training and financial support from FISE.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The project reflects the lessons of earlier projects, as detailed in the ICR of FISE I and the Mid-Term Review of FISE II,
as well as lessons of social investment fund projects in general.1 The main ones are listed below.

Quality. Project efficiency (subproject approval, execution, and disbursement rates) has so far not been sufficiently
linked to project effectiveness (increased community participation, subproject quality, sustainability of benefits, and
social impact). Too much emphasis has been placed on efficiency; as a result, the long-term benefits of the subprojects
have occasionally suffered.
Sustainability. The participation of all of FISE's partners (ministries, government agencies, municipalities, communities,
NGOs, and donors) is essential to achieve sustainability. Most important is informed community participation throughout
the subproject cycle, particularly in the selection of subprojects. Therefore, community organization and training in
infrastructure use and maintenance must accompany infrastructure subprojects.
Institutional Strengthening. FISE's experience with MOH and MOE demonstrates the importance of strengthening
FISE's partner institutions. Collaboration with MOE has been good because the ministry received institutional
strengthening under the first and second Social Investment Fund projects, whereas MOH declined such support under the
second project, which had an adverse impact on FISE's work. Also, institutional strengthening was not provided for
municipalities or UNIFOM, even though FISE's work has been increasingly geared toward local governments. Apart
from sector-specific support under ongoing projects with MOH and MOE, the proposed FISE project would aim at close
cooperation with the above agencies. The proposed assistance for INIFOM, in the context of the micro-planning and
municipal strengthening component, would be provided in close cooperation with the support available under the Rural
Municipalities Project (Cr. 2918-NI).
Implementation Performance. Successful project implementation owes as much to FISE's stability as an institution and
the high quality and continuity of management and staff, as to well applied standard social investment fund operating
procedures and methods. The key performance indicators used to monitor implementation performance (see Annex 1,
Attachment) have worked well; their utility as a management tool for decision-making appears to be limited, however,
and FISE will therefore review and revise those as required.
Subproject Cycle. FISE has made progress in expanding the subproject menu and the design, quality, and operational
sustainability of some subproject types. However, experience has shown that these and other advances have important
consequences for the entire subproject cycle, which must be taken into account; the impact of any change in the
subproject cycle should be addressed when the changes are first considered, as is currently the case with the design of
FISE's municipal strengthening program. The importance of a systematic evaluation of the subproject cycle as a whole
cannot be overstated. FISE's planned review of the subproject cycle as part of its systematic renovation signals a critical
advance over discrete, corrective measures, and will be supported under the proposed project.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Borrower commitment has been amply demonstrated by the importance attached by the Government to FISE and its
regular counterpart contributions. FISE's management has been actively pursuing positive change, in accordance with
identified needs, in particular through its new focus on communities/municipalities.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The social sectors in Nicaragua require substantial and long-term donor support. It is the second-poorest country in Latin
America and the Caribbean, with a GDP per capita of only about US$400 per year, and still very much affected by the
impact of the civil war. IDA support is of critical importance. Apart from its funding, IDA has contributed and is
contributing with regard to:
*   Development of adequate targeting mechanism based on LSMS and census data
*  Promotion of NGO participation and gender awareness
*  Identification of indigenous needs
*   Support for the implementation of rural water supply projects
*   ooperation with IDB and KfW
*   Cooperation with ongoing Health Sector Modernization Project (on primary health care facilities)
*   Cooperation with ongoing Rural Municipalities Project (on decentralization)

* Design and implementation of Impact Evaluation
* Cooperation with ongoing Basic Education Project (on basic education facilities)
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis:               [X] Cost Effectiveness Analysis:
Since the FISE mechanism is fully driven by community demand and similar to a line of credit, no rate of return
calculation or cost-benefit analysis has been or could be carried out for the full program. However, given the public
nature of the types of investment financed by FISE and the scarcity of funds available for such investments, experience
argues in favor of the project approach (Annex 4). Also, in accordance with FISE's Operational Manual, cost
effectiveness analyses are carried out by FISE's evaluation staff for all subprojects, which have to meet agreed minimum
criteria. Also, FISE has a detailed economic evaluation methodology for new water supply subprojects. FISE has agreed
that, following the completion of an ongoing Bank study of policies and practices regarding economic evaluation of social
investment fund subprojects, a new methodology will be agreed with the Bank, and implemented by no later than June 30,
1999.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
Funding of maintenance of completed education and health infrastructure subprojects would have to be provided by the
relevant line ministries and final beneficiaries, but little can be expected from the ministries beyond routine maintenance
and from the final beneficiaries beyond labor and materials. More promising in this respect is FISE's recently-established
Preventive Maintenance Fund (with equal contributions from the central government ministries, beneficiaries, and
donors), which is providing for the cost of maintenance of primary schools and health posts in a gradually increasing
number of municipalities. The municipalities would also be expected to contribute, which is being pursued under the new
municipal micro-planning, strengthening, and maintenance program.
In the case of water supply and sanitation works, final beneficiaries would be responsible for operation and maintenance
of completed systems, and user committees would charge user fees.
The fiscal implications of the project for the Government would include: (i) administrative costs of FISE of about
US$19.2 million over the next four years and (ii) under the Preventive Maintenance Fund, partial funding of maintenance
costs of completed schools and health center infrastructure of about US$1 million annually.
3. Technical:
The project is a follow-up project that builds on substantial lessons learned. FISE is the most efficient government
agency in Nicaragua for the construction of basic social infrastructure. It works with the permanent public institutions to
upgrade planning methodologies, selection criteria, and maintenance arrangements. Its internal procedures, set out in its
Operational Manual, have proved to be effective in targeting the desired groups, ensuring the technical viability and
quality of investments and guaranteeing transparency. The IDA-assisted Impact Evaluation study should be completed
within six months, and FISE will then take any further corrective action as required by no later than June 30, 1999.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: The project would be managed by FISE, and increasingly executed by municipalities meeting
agreed criteria. All municipal/coimmunity training would be handled by intermediary organizations, which have
demonstrated the capability to do so. All infrastructure would be contracted out to the private sector, which has proven to
be quite capable and competitive.
b. Project management: FISE is exempt from normal government salary, personnel recruitment, budget,
procurement, and disbursement restrictions. Its well-defined and transparent targeting and allocation of resources reduce



11
political risks, and help assure that high social return subprojects are directed to the poor. Its standardized menu of
subprojects promotes efficiency; and oversight by external donors has fostered continuity and the preservation of an
institutional memory through FISE's staff. Its monitoring and evaluation system will improve following the completion
of the Impact Evaluation study.
5. Social:
IDA staff spent considerable time and effort, jointly with FISE staff, meeting with and listening to NGOs and
representatives of disadvantaged groups, including the indigenous population and women. Based on those meetings, an
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP; see Annex 9), and an action plan to promote the participation of women in
the project cycle were drafted by FISE, and included in the PIP.
FISE's has had a limited ability to develop projects and processes tailored to the needs of special groups. Recent
activities formulated by and with the indigenous population may provide some valuable lessons for the expansion of its
existing menu, subproject sustainability, local capacity building activities and FISE's strategies for decentralization, and
the transfer of its know-how.
6. Environmental assessment:  Environmental Category    [] A   [X] B   []C
The proposed project would have no significant environmental risks, and no resettlement would occur as a result of
project investments. Under the ongoing project, FISE has already taken a number of important initiatives on
environmental issues as an integral part of its decision making process. It has created and staffed an environmental unit,
and developed procedures to incorporate environmental selection criteria. Under the proposed project, it would conduct
further training and sensitization programs, and develop new environmental menu items that would be eligible for FISE
financing. In addition, the community organization and training programs would include environmental sensitization
components. Consequently, if some of the new water and sanitation subprojects were to have a negative environmental
impact, these would be easy to predict and mitigate.
7. Participatory approach [key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced; ifparticipatory approach not
used, describe why not applicable]:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Social funds are demand-driven, and, thus, by definition participatory. However, participation can be improved, and this
is being reviewed under the comprehensive Impact Evaluation, which started in April 1998. It has also been explored
with both local and international NGOs, and a recent FISE-NGO seminar was well attended. The following table
provides more detail:

b. Other key stakeholders:
The project has been designed in close cooperation with other donors, in particular IDB and KfW.
Indigenous Population: Under the earlier projects, FISE has done little to target the indigenous population. An
operational strategy and IPDP for FISE, combining the field work and findings of projects operating in the indigenous
areas and consultations with the indigenous communities, specifically on FISE's operational arrangements, has now being
designed, and is reflected in the PIP.
Gender: A gender specialist has reviewed the status of women's participation in FISE-financed subprojects and benefits
for women, and necessary corrective actions prior to and during the implementation of the project have been reflected in
the PIP.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
FISE's subprojects should be increasingly sustainable because of:
*   cooperation with line agencies and agreement on their responsibility for some of the maintenance of completed
subprojects, as well as the operation of the Preventive Maintenance Fund for education and health infrastructure; and
*   comprehensive program of beneficiary community training in social management and operation and maintenance of
all infrastructure subprojects, including establishment of user groups/committees for operation and maintenance of
all infrastructure subprojects, as well as provision of tool kits for water supply and sanitation subprojects.
Regarding the sustainability of FISE as an institution, the Government has emphasized repeatedly the importance of FISE
in dealing with the country's substantial lack of basic, small-scale infrastructure, and could sustain an ongoing operation.
The need for sustainability would be reviewed prior to project completion, based on the capacity of the relevant line
ministries and agencies.

Annex 2
Nicaragua
Third Social Investment Fund Project
Project Description
This annex is divided into two sections. The first section provides an overview of the project's four components; the
second section provides additional details regarding the strategies and implementation arrangements of the following
components and subcomponents: Micro-Planning and Municipal Strengthening, LSMS, Monitoring and Evaluation, and
Rural Water Supply.
SECTION 1: OVERVIEW
Project Component 1 -- Subproject (total cost of component US$136.2 million)
Subproject financing represents the core of the proposed project. This component would include social and economic
infrastructure subprojects identified and sponsored by communities, NGOs, and/or local government representatives.
Based on past experience, the majority of demand is expected to be for:
(i) Education: Infrastructure and furniture for pre-schools, primary schools, secondary institutes and vocational centers;
classroom libraries, other teaching materials, training, and school orchards;
(ii) Health: Infrastructure, furniture, equipment, and basic materials for health posts and centers, as well as latrines,
management and disposal of solid waste, and basic health prevention training;
(iii) Water Supply and Sewerage: Infrastructure in rural areas with concentrated populations would be improved and
expanded; and a special effort would be made to increase the number of subprojects in rural areas with dispersed
populations (see Section 2); and
(iv) Social Projects: Construction of and equipment for, a.o., child-care centers, shelters and homes for the elderly,
family gardens, and maternity homes.
Project Component 2 - Capacity Building of Municipalities/Communities (total cost of component US$5.6 million;
see Section 2)
Training activities for local governments and beneficiaries, as well as gradually increasing number of pilot projects in
micro-regional/municipal planning (see Section 2), special projects for indigenous people (see Annex 9), and programs
specifically targeted at women. It would also include training seminars and workshops with NGOs and local contractors;
and seminars for the transfer of FISE's know-how to staff from other government agencies..
Project Component 3 - LSMS, Monitoring and Evaluation (total cost of component US$2.0 million; see Section 2)
(i) Analysis of 1998 LSMS; updating of FISE's poverty map; and analysis of the 1998 FISE Impact Evaluation;
(ii) Review of FISE's project appraisal, monitoring and evaluation systems;
(iii) LSMS and FISE impact evaluation data collection in 2001; and focused studies under MECOVI, a regional initiative
to generate accurate information regarding living conditions and poverty in Latin America (sponsored by the Bank, IDB
and ECLAC); and
(iv) Analysis of 2001 LSMS; updating of FISE poverty map; analysis of 2001 impact evaluation; and analysis of
MECOVI surveys.
Project Component 4 - Project Management (total cost of component US$21.7 million)
Operating cost of FISE, as well as of office expansion and rehabilitation, staff training activities, improvement of the MIS
systems and office technology equipment, vehicles, and external auditing (both financial and concurrent).

SECTION 2: SPECIAL PROGRAM DETAILS
Micro Planning and Municipal Strengthening
Objectives: the pilot program seeks to: (i) increase transparency in FISE's targeting of resources to the poor, (ii) foster an
increased role of the municipal governments in the allocation of resources, (iii) strengthen citizen participation in and
social accountability of investments, (iv) encourage coordination among the various government agencies in the social
sector at the local level, and (v) increase the participation of all local actors in the identification of investments, financing,
and operation and maintenance.
The program has four sub-components: (i) local participatory micro-planning, (ii) decentralization of FISE's subproject
cycle to the local level, (iii) the Preventive Maintenance Fund, and (iv) training in community participation.
Implementation Strategy: the program would be supported by specific actions in the following areas: (i) formulation of
operational policies for social investments at the local level in a decentralized manner, (ii) capacity building of the local
actors in the identification of investments projects, sources of funding, and operation and maintenance, (iii) specific
agreements at the local and national level establishing responsibilities and contributions of the various participants, and
(iv) technical assistance to the technical units of the municipal governments and communities, through NGOs, in the
implementation of the program components.
The program would develop mechanisms at the local level to articuLate coordination among the various national actors
(FISE, INIFOM, the Association of Mayors, line ministries, the General Comptroller's Office, NGOs, international
development programs) and the local actors (the Municipal Council, the Mayor, the Technical Unit, communities and
their leaders and organizations, and local representatives of the various sector agencies.
During project preparation, five pilots were conducted, which resulted in completed participatory investment plans for the
municipalities of Diriamba, Camoapa, Jalapa, Santo Tomas and Nindiri; 44 have initiated micro-planning training
workshops and a total of 86 (out of 147) municipalities are committed to the Preventive Maintenance Fund.
Key differences from normal FISE procedures would include: (i) direct access to FISE's technical and financial resources
for municipal governments and other local actors, (ii) a single local investment plan for three years incorporating all
sources of funding, (iii) targeting of resources at the municipal level, (iv) community participation in the identification
and prioritization of needs, (v) local accountability for resources and contracting, (vi) local capacity building activities,
(vii) transfer of FISE's know-how to the local technical units, and (viii) local technical assistance through NGOs and
various development programs.
LSMS, Monitoring and Evaluation
I. Analysis of 1998 LSMS; Updating FISE poverty map; Analysis of 1998 FISE impact evaluation component
[US$380,000]
1. Carrying out three studies to analyze the results of the 1998 Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS),
particularly relative to 1993 when the last LSMS was collected, with respect to social policy issues and the impact of the
FISE investments. The results of these studies should be useful to the line ministries and FISE for policy making and, to
the extent possible, should be carried out by or in conjunction with local researchers.
Cost/Timing: FISE will contract three studies at US$50,000 each; to be carried out by consultants, NGO's,
university research departments or research staff in Nicaraguan government agencies during 1999-2001
2. Updating FISE's poverty map by combining the results of the 1998 LSMS with the 1995 census data. This
procedure yields predicted per capita consumption figures for all households covered by the census, thereby facilitating
disaggregation of the poverty map and allowing for more accurate targeting at the departmental or municipal levels.



24
3. Carrying out the first FISE impact evaluation. The evaluation will use data from the 1998 LSMS which
includes a sample of FISE and non-FISE projects and related households to consider the following aspects of FISE
primary school, health post, latrine, and water and sanitation projects: 1) supply and utilization, 2) sustainability, 3)
success in reaching the poor, and the 4) role of local groups in FISE investments. The evaluation will concentrate on
comparing FISE projects and beneficiaries to non-FISE projects and beneficiaries, and will use the information that has
been constructed to serve as baseline data during the course of the data collection effort.
Cost/Timing: FISE will contract for $US200,000 a top-level analyst to work in FISE's Planning Department for
two years (1999-2000); $30,000 for hiring a research assistant for two years (1999-2000)
II. Review of FISE project appraisal, monitoring and evaluation systems [US$150,000]
The objective is to create a streamlined, systematic project appraisal, monitoring and evaluation system.
1. The first step is to review the present project appraisal methodologies (cost-benefit and cost-efficiency
analysis) that are carried out for individual projects by the FISE Evaluation Department as part of the project selection
process. The objective is to validate the ex-ante project appraisal methodology by technically reviewing the parameters
and cut-off points used for evaluating and selecting projects, eliminating or modifying specific indicators and/or data
collection activities, and ensuring coherence between the ex-ante project appraisal system and the monitoring and ex-post
evaluation activities.
2. The second step is to review the management information system and the key performance indicators with an
eye toward eliminating, modifying or adding indicators according to project objectives. The result should be a set of
indicators that provide continuous feedback to FISE for refining their promotion, appraisal and supervision processes and
for troubleshooting on problem projects.
3. The third step is a review of the existing ex-post evaluation methodologies--the annual qualitative beneficiary
assessment, the ongoing evaluation of the quality of project infrastructure at the time of completion, and the impact
evaluation to be carried out once every three years in conjunction with the LSMS--to ensure that the methodologies are
complementary and that the results are being used effectively to inform FISE, the line ministries and the Government's of
Nicaragua's social policy.
The final product of this review will be to develop recommendations regarding how the FISE appraisal,
monitoring and evaluation activities (including the environmental ones) can be streamlined and improved.
Cost/Timing: FISE will contract for $150,000 a 9-12 month consultancy to be carried out in 1999-2000
III. 2001 LSMS and FISE impact evaluation data collection; Focused studies under MECOVI [US$700,000]
The activities in this component will be carried out in the context of Nicaragua's participation in the MECOVI program.
MECOVI is a regional initiative to generate accurate information regarding living conditions and poverty in Latin
America, sponsored by the IDB, ECLAC and the World Bank and is currently being implemented in Argentina, El
Salvador, Paraguay and Peru. Within this framework, Nicaragua will build a national statistical system with adequate
capacity to collect and analyze information and use to for policy design and evaluation during 1998-2001.
1. In order to monitor changes in living standards in Nicaragua, this component will provide technical assistance
to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) to implement a LSMS survey in early 2001 and analyze its
results. The LSMS core sample would consist of approximately 4,500 households interviewed in order to establish (i)
their poverty profile; (ii) the determinants of poverty; (iii) gender dimensions of poverty; (iv) employment and the price
of labor; (v) child labor; (vi) access and demand for health and education; (vii) prevalence of malnutrition; (viii)
household consumption patterns; and (ix) social capital and other such issues that are deemed relevant at the time.



25
2. The LSMS will also be used to collect the data for the second FISE impact evaluation following the
methodology established in the 1998 survey which included a representative sample of FISE and non-FISE projects and
related households as part of the LSMS. If appropriate, the survey will also follow up on baseline projects and households
surveyed in 1998 by FISE as part of its evaluation activities. The FISE, through other sources of financing, will continue
to finance the annual qualitative beneficiary assessment and the evaluation of the quality of infrastructure at delivery,
which serve as key complements to the ex-post impact evaluation work.
3. Financing of other data collection activities in the context of the MECOVI program from 1999-2001.
Cost/Timing: FISE will contract for US$700,000 the LSMS 2001 including the FISE evaluation component, and
the additional data collection activities to be carried out in 1999-2001.
IV. Analysis of 2001 LSMS; Updating the FISE poverty map; Analysis of 2001 FISE impact evaluation; Analysis of
MECOVI surveys [US$800, 000]
1. Analysis of 2001 LSMS; comparison with 1998 LSMS
2. Updating FISE poverty map using the results of the 2001 LSMS
3. Second FISE ex-post impact evaluation study
4. Analysis of additional MECOVI surveys
Cost/Timing: FISE will contract these activities for US$500,000 from the year 2000 to the end of the
project.
Rural Water Supply
Although FISE' menu has always included water supply as a major component, it has so far only completed 22 large
urban installations, at an average cost of more than US$800,000. Extensive efforts to increase the component, and focus
upon small rural subprojects, assisted with the help of consultants funded under the earlier FISE project, failed because of
disagreements between FISE and INAA on the proper policies and practices of dealing with rural needs. It now seems
that this has been resolved. FISE and INAA have recently agreed upon their cooperation in this field, and FISE has
started to strengthen its watersupply engineering and training staff. FISE's role in rural water supply will be further
strengthened by the recently enacted Water Law, which limited INAA to regulatory activities, and established ENACAL
as a new semi-privatized executive body for mainly urban water supply, leaving FISE as the major source of supply in
rural areas. FISE has now also signed a cooperation agreement with ENACAL.

1/ Since the project is essentially a financial intermediary type operation, and physical targets are not the main objectives of the
proposed project, no contingencies have been provided for the subprojects. Any increase in the average subproject cost would be
reflected in a reduced number of subprojects. Since most technical assistance and all vehicles would be provided in the first project year,
no price contingencies have been provided for these categories either. Although computer equipment (both hard and software) be
purchased over a three-year period, no price contingencies have been provided because of an increasingly competitive market. In
addition, based on local experience, no price contingencies (in US$) have been provided for project administration and the external
auditor.
Totals may not add up due to rounding, and not reflect beneficiary contributions in land and labor. Although beneficiaries are
increasingly contributing to maintenance, their c.-ntribution to the investment costs are relatively small, and difficult to quantify.
Costs include taxes and duties estimated at about US$13.6 million for subproject works and goods. FISE itself is tax-exempt.
2/ Costs do not include consultancies funded by other donors.

Third Social Investment Fund Project
Economic Analysis Summary
Background
Economic analysis of social fund projects has proved to be an extremely complex issue. Accordingly, the Bank has
recently initiated a study to review the experience to date with economic analysis in social funds, identify the issues
involved and develop guidelines as a technical support to Bank task managers and social fund line staff in how to improve
the economic analysis applied to these investments. 1 The results of this study are expected to be discussed and agreed
with the relevant social funds within the next six months. Consequently, FISE would be expected to adopt and apply new
economic analysis policies and practices in accordance with the recommendations of that study, as of the beginning of
1999.
Furthermore, FISE and IDA have also initiated, as part of project preparation, an impact evaluation of the FISE program
to date, the results of which are expected by late- 1998. That study is also likely to provide inputs that will be useful for
improving FISE's economic analysis policies and practices, and will therefore serve as a basis for determining additional
measures to be taken by FISE in this area.
Notwithstanding expected improvements in the methodologies applied by FISE to ensure optimization of resources, this
annex summarizes an economic analysis of the project at two different levels: (a) the level of the FISE itself, i.e., whether
the mechanism and design of the fund represent reasonable investments for the Government; and (b) the level of the
subprojects, i.e., how does the project ensure that the resources of the FISE are used optimally.
Economic Analysis of the FISE as a Delivery Mechanism.
Given (i) the public nature of the types of investments financed by FISE (i.e., social and economic infrastructure targeted
at poor communities), and (ii) the scarcity of funds (private or public) available for such investments, the most likely
counterfactual scenario would be re-absorption by line ministries of the responsibilities FISE now has for infrastructure
investments. While quantitative analysis of this alternative presents certain comparability problems, a number of factors
argue in favor of the project's approach:
a) Re-absorption of FISE's investment functions by line agencies would result in a significantly reduced national
capacity to address the needs for investments in social and economic infrastructure and social services. Despite
assistance from numerous financing agencies, including IDA, modernization / reform of the line ministries has proved
to be a slow process. In the meantime, and as a consequence of this, FISE has become the principal government
instrument for financing small-scale projects in the social sectors. It is unlikely that line ministries could quickly or
easily reabsorb the functions currently carried out by FISE.
b) Overall costs would likely be higher under the stand-alone projects that would be required by individual ministries to
carry out sectoral investment programs. FISE's ability to operate efficiently (operating costs were about 10% in
1997) and on a massive scale has had much to do with specialization and economies of scale. Furthermore, FISE has
been able to streamline the processes involved in mobilizing the substantial external financing required for social
sector investments, and has done so using an existing institution that requires no special project coordinating unit
(PCU); administrative costs are borne by Government.
The outline for that study is presented in a draft issues paper, "Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Social Funds", prepared by Julie
Van Domelen as an internal memorandum, March 24, 1998. This annex draws liberally from that paper.



28
c) FISE's design also produces allocative efficiencies that would be difficult to replicate in stand-alone sectoral
investment projects: through the promotion of participatory local decision-making, FISE empowers communities to
allocate scarce resources across sectors, thereby ensuring that such resources are applied optimally, in response to
local priorities. This participation also contributes to local ownership, which, combined with other complements that
FISE provides (such as training of end-users), enhances sustainability of subprojects and extends the life of
investment benefit streams.
d) Finally, FISE has proved itself able to mobilize resources that might otherwise remain untapped. By promoting
participatory decision making, and by requiring commitments and contributions from communities and
municipalities, FISE mobilizes additional resources for investments, and importantly, for maintenance. The
promotion of participation also helps build another kind of asset: social capital.
Economic Analysis of Subprojjects.
Since the project is fully driven by community demand and basically a line of credit, no cost-benefit analysis has been
carried out for the full program. However, in line with its Operational Manual, and subject to minimum requirements
agreed with the relevant sector agencies, FISE uses detailed technical criteria, standard designs, and simple economic
criteria (e.g., cost-per-beneficiary calculations) to determine subproject economic viability. This includes application of a
comprehensive list of unit costs by type of subproject and by region, which is being updated at least twice a year.
For education and health subprojects, which have comprised most of FISE's investments, FISE has detailed agreements
with MOH and MOE, respectively, on technical design and costs; "lineas de corte" (cut-off lines) are used as well as
parameters such as cost per man-month employed, unit cost per type of infrastructure project and unit cost per
beneficiary. It should be noted also that, for reasons of effectiveness and cost efficiency, under the existing IDA-
supported project for Basic Education, MOE has asked FISE to manage the infrastructure financed under the project.
For its relatively small program. of new water supply and sanitation subprojects, most of which are urban and have
relatively high investment costs, FISE has computer programs to calculate cost-benefit ratios. First, a beneficiary survey
is carried out to collect the following information: (i) consumption per capita; (ii) cost of obtaining water (financial and
time); (iii) water source; (iv) water tariffs; (v) time spent transporting water; and (vi) socio-economic data. Second, a
program is used to estimate demand elasticities and the tariff level that can be charged to the project beneficiaries. Third,
IRR and NPV are calculated. If IRR is higher than 12 percent and NPV is positive, the project is feasible. The programs
also calculate: (i) cost per beneficiary; (ii) operating cost per gallon; (iii) investment cost per gallon; and (iv) total cost per
gallon of water (for tariff calculation). The forms include a tariff study in the case of new projects. Benefit for water
projects is time saving. An IRR of a least 12 percent is required.

Assumes average operation and maintenance costs of 2% per year. According to experience under past phases of the FISE program,
and studies carried out under the FISE II project and during preparation of the proposed FISE III project, in the absence of budgetary
provisions by MOH and MOE, these costs are frequently borne by beneficiary communities and local governments. Since the
proportion of projects requiring new staff is expected to be low, no incremental staff salaries are assumed for the purposes of this
analysis. In any case, as has been the case under previous phases of the FISE program, for subprojects that do entail an increase in
Government expenditures on recurrent costs (i.e. incremental staff), prior endorsement of the subproject by relevant line ministries
would be required. Also, the Preventive Maintenance Fund (with equal contributions from the Central Government, the
municipalities/communities, and FISE) would provide for the cost of maintenance of completed health and education subprojects.
Water supply and sanitation operations and maintenance would be handled by user committees.
2 The cost estimates provided for subproject investments include only measurable financial costs incurred, and therefore exclude
certain cost items that are typically contributed by beneficiaries, and sometimes by local governments and/or NGOs, prior to initiation
of the works, such as land; unskilled labor for site clearing; certain materials; and certain prefeasibility studies.

Third Social Investment Fund Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (see Table A). Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with
IDA's guidelines on procurement of goods, works, and services, and using standard contract documents acceptable to
IDA (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, revised January/August 1996 and
September 1997; and Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997,
revised September 1997). It would also be in accordance with any restrictions agreed for IDA XI financing, including the
definition of Non-Participating Countries. FISE would manage or supervisel all procurement actions under the project,
based on agreed procurement procedures reflected in its Operations Manual and the Project Implementation Plan.
Small Works. FISE would finance integrated subprojects (small social and economic infrastructure projects, including
corresponding equipment, furniture and materials, such as the construction or rehabilitation of schools, health posts, water
and sanitation projects). These subprojects are typically small, scattered, and located in remote areas, and no International
competitive Bidding (ICB) would be expected. The average subproject cost amounts to about US$55,000.
Subproject contracts estimated to cost US$150,000 equivalent or more would be procured using National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) procedures. To the extent possible, contracts for subprojects would be combined in packages of
US$150,000 or more, and awardLed on the basis of NCB. Three Quotations and Direct Contracting procedures would be
permitted as follows, up to aggregate amounts of US$8.0 million and US$3.7 million, equivalent. Contracts estimated to
cost between US$50,000 and US$150,000 equivalent could be procured on the basis of quotations obtained from at least
three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation; for contracts of subprojects with an estimated cost less than
US$50,000 equivalent, in cases where competitive proposals cannot be obtained, Direct Contracting of local contractors
would be permitted. In the case of Direct Contracting, to ensure fair pricing, FISE would use, as a basis for negotiations
with contractors, a well-tried system of regional, standard unit prices, which is updated periodically. The same procedures
would apply to about US$200,000 in office expansion and rehabilitation.
Goods. Goods to be procured under the project would consist of goods not included in the Small Works, such as:
vehicles, computer equipment, other office and administrative equipment, and training materials, as well as an estimated
US$2.0 million of medical equipment in health centers. ICB would be required for contracts estimated to cost
US$250,000 or more. Contracts for other goods estimated to cost more than US$25,000 would be procured using NCB
procedures. To the extent possible, contracts for goods would be combined in packages of US$25,000 or more and
procured using NCB. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$25,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 100,000, could
be procured using National Shopping procedures.
Consultant Services. As mentioned above, consulting services would be procured following IDA's Consultant
Guidelines and using standard contracts. The methods of selection to be followed would be as follows: (a) contracts for
consultant services under the External Auditing, the Municipal and Community Training and most of the LSMS,
Monitoring and Evaluation subcomponents would be awarded on the basis of Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS);
(b) contracts for all other consultant services would be awarded to Individual Consultants, or to firms on the basis of
Under the Pilot Program for Micro-Planning and Municipal Strengthening, the project intends fostering greater participation by local
governments in procurement actions through decentralization of certain functions and responsibilities, and granting of resources to
carry out such functions and responsibilities, to these agents. This would be implemented on a small but accelerated scale, with
intensive monitoring. Procurement of subprojects, up to a maximum of US$100,000, would be mainly on the basis of Three
Quotations, and funding through the municipalities on the basis of individual agreements and accounts between FISE and the
municipalities for each subproject.



31
Selection Based on Consultant Qualifications, or in exceptional cases, Single-Source Selection. Of course, Selection
Based on Consultant Qualifications would only be used for small contracts and Individual Consultants where teams of
personnel are not necessary.
Prior review thresholds (see Table B). Prior review by IDA would include: (a) procurement arrangements in
accordance with Appendix 1, paragraph 1 of the IDA Procurement Guidelines; (b) for Goods, all contracts for vehicles,
medical equipment, computer equipment, and office / administrative equipment above US$25,000; (c) for small works,
the first two Three Quotations contracts, and the first two NCB contracts, irrespective of value, and all contracts equal to
or above US$300,000 equivalent; (d) any amendment to a Subprojects contract that was originally awarded using Direct
Contracting, if such amendment shall cause the total value of the contract to rise above US$50,000 equivalent; (e) for
Consultant Services: (i) all terms of reference; (ii) all Single-Source Selection contracts; (iii) all contracts for individuals
when the contract value exceeds US$25,000 equivalent; and (iv) all contracts for firms when the contract value exceeds
US$50,000 equivalent. The balance would be subject to ex-post review.
Prior review of an estimated 19% of the Credit is expected under these arrangements. This level of IDA prior review of
procurement is relatively low, but is considered acceptable in light of (i) IDA's previous satisfactory experience with
FISE; and (ii) audit arrangements for the project, which include quarterly and annual auditing by a qualified external firm,
including physical audits of subprojects. Periodic project physical performance evaluations, and IDA supervision
missions, would also look at procurement issues in the course of random reviews of subprojects, including field visits.
Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (see Table C). The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed over a period of about four
years, to be completed by December 31, 2002. The project closing date would be December 31, 2002 (i.e., about six
months after final commitments). Disbursements would be in accordance with guidelines set out in IDA's disbursement
handbook.
Disbursements would be made against the following categories of expenditure: (a) Small works and office
expansion/rehabilitation (100%); (b) Goods, including vehicles, equipment, and materials (100% of foreign expenditures
for imported goods, 100% of total expenditures for locally-produced goods (ex-factory cost), and 75% of other local
expenditures; (c) Technical Assistance: 100% of the cost of eligible training, workshops, learning materials, study tours,
and consultant services, including external auditing. Retroactive financing of up to US$4.5 million equivalent would be
permitted for eligible expenditures under all categories incurred as of March 1, 1998. Such funding would be justified
because of the substantial pipeline of subprojects built up following the closing of FISE I in mid-1998.
Use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs). Disbursements would be made on the basis of full documentation for all
expenditures made under contracts requiring prior review by IDA, as indicated in Table B; and contracts whose value
would be raised above the prior review limits as a result of amendments. For all other expenditures, disbursements would
be granted against SOEs for which supporting documents would be maintained by FISE, and be available to IDA and
external auditors for review.
Special Account. In order to facilitate project implementation, the Government would establish a special account in US
Dollars at a commercial bank satisfactory to IDA, with an authorized allocation and initial advance of US$3.5 million,
corresponding to the average of four months of expenditures that are expected to be made from the account. FISE will
submit replenishment applications on a monthly basis, or when 25% of the authorized allocation has been used,
whichever occurs first. The replenishment application will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank
statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation of the Special Account against Bank records. The Special Account
would be audited in conjunction with the annual financial audit of the project.
Audits. FISE would have the records and accounts of the project for each fiscal year, including the Special Account,
audited by independent and qualified external auditors, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and
procedures, and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. Certified copies of the audit reports would be furnished to IDA
no later than four months after the end of FISE's fiscal year. In addition, "operational audit" reports of a sample of



32
subprojects both in execution and completed, covering both their processing and implementation, would be prepared by
the same auditor and submitted to IDA quarterly. Auditors would review individual contracts, ascertain compliance with
the terms of contracts, inspect progress of works, and reconcile the physical progress with financial expenses incurred,
and verify that procurement guidelines are being respected.
FISE Financial Management Systems, and Conversion to LACI System of Disbursements. During project
preparation, the project team reviewed FISE's financial management system, and found it satisfactory. On the basis of
this finding, FISE agreed to take steps to adapt its financial system in accordance with IDA's Loan Administration
Change Initiative (LACI), with the goal of eventually converting disbursement arrangements under the project to a LACI
system. Accordingly, under the project, FISE has agreed to prepare, for submission to IDA: (i) quarterly project progress
reports; and (ii) annual financial statements for the preceding fiscal year, to be submitted to IDA within four months after
such fiscal year. These annual statements will have roughly the same format as the quarterly reports, with the exception
that they will also contain the results of the audit--including related audit opinions--carried out by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA, in accordance with Terms of Reference acceptable to IDA. These reports will be consistent with the
formats established as part of LACI. Once a quarterly report can be generated which is fully consistent with the LACI
principles, the project would bie considered by IDA for full conversion to LACI-style disbursements, which would be
based on quarterly financial relports rather than on Statements of Expenditure.

Third Social Investment Fund Project
Social Assessment and Indigenousl Peoples Development Plan (IPDP)
I.     SOCIAL ASSESSMENT
1.    A social assessment was carried out from September 1997 to June 1998 by a World Bank consultant, with
participation by FISE staff, municipal governments, and communities. It took place in the departments of RAAN (North
Atlantic Autonomous Region) and RAAS (South Atlantic Autonomous Region), following up on FISE's interest to serve
the regions better.2 Despite all efforts of the Government to develop these regions, many difficulties have affected
development, such as (1) geographic isolation of some areas, making access difficult and costly; (2) lack of knowledge of
the different ethnic groups, their social organization and structure, their values and idiosyncrasies, (3) weak presence of
government institutions in health, education, water and sanitation, and (4) weak municipal governments.
2.     The main objectives of the social assessment were to (1) identify the stakeholders and beneficiaries of FISE
projects in areas with indigenous populations; (2) analyze cultural diversity and ethnicity and their role in development;
and (3) determine the role of modem and traditional authorities in the decision-making process at the local and municipal
levels.
3.     Among the social participation tools used were (1) analysis of data from the 1995 Census, FISE poverty maps,
previous research done for earlier Bank-assisted projects, and data verification in the field; (2) a series of rapid rural
appraisals with different groups of the population to detect access of isolated! remote groups to FISE projects, and
participation of women in the decision-making process of social infrastructure projects; and (3) focus groups and
interviews with municipal governments and local NGOs to discuss their administrative organization and managerial skills
and capacities. It was of particular interest to discuss the mechanisms necessary to ensure that the ethnic groups,
geographically-isolated peasant populations, and women participate in and benefit from the process of Municipal
Participatory Micro-Planning carried out by FISE nationwide (see Annex 2, Section 2). Among those consulted were
mayors, members of the Municipal Technical Units (UTMs), local NGOs (indigenous and non-indigenous), the
Mayangna Federation Sukawala, and women's and midwives groups. The consultant also interviewed educators,
AMURACAN (Association of Municipalities of the Atlantic Coast), SILAIS (decentralized health systems), the Morava
and the Catholic Church.
Main findings of the social assessment
Socio-demographic data
4.     According to the 1995 Census, the population of Nicaragua amounts to 4,357,100 and its area to 120,000 sq. km.
The majority (89%) live in the Pacific Coast and central regions with an average density of 132 inhabitants per square km.
The territory of the Atlantic Coast is approximately 50,000 sq. km. or 42% of the national territory. It is the home of 11 %
of the total population or 464,968 inhabitants. Approximately 58% of those are indigenous/creole and the other 42%
mostly mestizo farmers.
5.     According to national censuses, the population in RAAN and RAAS increased by 175% between 1971 and 1995.
Massive immigration from the Pacific region took place since 1920, encouraged by the establishment of rubber extraction
' In Nicaragua, the legal definition of "indigenous community" refers to a community which responds to a complex economic, social
and cultural structure, and which is subject to its own patterns of development and formal and traditional forms of authority.
2 While this social assessment was undertaken in the broader national context, with the purpose of including all of the indigenous
groups located in Nicaragua, it focuses primarily on the conditions identified in the autonomous regions of the Atlantic Coast (RAAN
and RAAS). Detailed informnation on indigenous groups in other regions may be found in background documents for this Project.

operations, forestry projects, and large scale mining operations. In the 1 960s, agrarian reform programs promoted large
settlements of small farmers. During each of these waves of settlement, mestizo settlers pushed indigenous communities
further towards the Atlantic. During the 1970s and 1980s, mestizo immigration to the Atlantic Region decreased
significantly because of the war in the region. During the 1990s, immigration patterns in the Atlantic Region have been
encouraged by the economic activity in the region. Annually, about 80,000 hectares of forests are cleared for agriculture
and cattle ranching by new settlers.1
6.     Of the total population in RAAN and RAAS, approximately 67% live in rural areas; they are mostly subsistence
agriculture farmers and peasants. Approximately 70% of the mestizos live in urban areas. Only 44,000 of the urban
residents are indigenous/creole.

7.     Ethnicity is difficult to d[efine in some areas. However, the following distribution according to dominant ethnic
group seems reasonable. Of the 250 indigenous communities identified2, 166 are Miskito, 34 are Mayangna, and the
other 50 are mixed. The ethnolinguistic map included in this document gives the approximate location of language
groups.

General profile of ethnic groups
8.    The Mestizo originate in the Eastern and Central regions of the country. Migration to the Atlantic Coast started
as early as the mid 19th century. They are the largest ethnic group (195,000 inh. or 42% of the total population of the
Atlantic Coastal Region). They speak Spanish.
9.    The Miskito is the largest non-mestizo group (125,000 inh.); they live mostly in the Northern Coastal Region,
along the Wanki (Coco) River, which splits the Moskitia in two (Nicaragua and Honduras). There are miskito
communities also spread in RAAS. Their language is Miskito, spoken by a large monolingual population (especially
women and children).
10.   The Mayangna (or Sumu) are about 9,760. They include three distinctive sub-groups: Panamahka, Itwhka, and
Ulwa. Their communities are widely dispersed. They live mostly in RAAN. Their language is Mayangna. There are
only few communities which are totally monolingual, which is the case with the Sikilta community.
11.   The Garifona (or Black Caribbean), a mix of indigenous and African slaves living in British colonies of the
Caribbean. They live mostly in RAAS and account for only 3% (3,740) of the total Atlantic Coast population. Although
their native language is Garifona, most of them are bilingual.
12.   The Rama were almost wiped out by Spanish and British colonization. There are close to 1,700 survivors, who
live in Rama Cay, close to the Bluefields Bay. Their culture and language (Rama) are slowly disappearing.
13.   The Creoles are the oldest non-indigenous group. Slave descendants from survivors of ship wrecks during the
early Spanish colonization. The creole population is approximately 44,430 or one-third in RAAS, concentrated in the
Bluefields area. Their native language is Creole English.
Socio-economic characteristics
14.   The Nicaragua Poverty Assessment and the UNDP Human Development Report 1997 concluded that about half
of the population of Nicaragua falls below the poverty linel. Poverty and extreme poverty are mostly rural. Of the rural
poor nation-wide, 99% use wood fuel for cooking.
15.   In RAAN, only 7% has access to piped water and in RAAS only 16% (Map INAA, 1997); 98% do not have
sewerage connections. Even in urban areas most solid waste goes into rivers and the ocean. Most people use spring
water for cooking and drinking.
16.   The 1995 Census and UNDP Report both coincide in that over 50% of the school-age population nation-wide do
not attend beyond the 4th grade of elementary school. On the Atlantic Coast, where monolinguism in non-Spanish
languages is high, education indicators are even lower than in the rest of the country. Lack of access roads and
transportation, poverty, and an increase in violence are mentioned by parents who do not send children to school.
Although the quality of education and curriculum standards are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education,
religious organizations, such as Morava (mostly in RAAN), and the Catholic and Evangelical churches, have joined the
Government in providing education to the population.
17.   In RAAN and RAAS, of the total population over 6 years old, 48% have never attended school. It is not clear if
the alarming drop in enrollment from the 3rd to the 4th grade, and particularly from the 6th to the 7th, is a problem of
supply or of demand. However, the Technical Schools and the two Universities in Puerto Cabezas and Bluefields have
graduated close to 5,000 students. Unfortunately, many graduates migrate to the Pacific and Central regions in search of
job opportunities.
' The poverty line is established as the per capita monthly expenditures necessary for the minimum daily caloric requirement (2,226
calories per adult) plus basic needs (clothing and transportation). The extreme poverty line is the per capita monthly food
expenditures required to obtain the daily minimum caloric requirement.

18.    Communities are widely dispersed (population density of 8/sq km); therefore, people prefer to resort to local
health suppliers such as midwives, witchdoctors, or health promoters. Despite efforts by the Ministry of Health to
provide primary health care in these areas, only 75% of the communities in RAAN and 65% in RAAS have a health post.
The municipalities of Prinzapolka and Cruz del Rio Grande lack any. Several international NGOs are established in the
region to supplement central government efforts. These are Medicos del Mundo, Acci6n Medico, KEPA, among others.
19.    With regard to morbidity and mortality, according to health centers, the most common cases of morbidity are
respiratory infectious diseases, parasitism, diarrhea, gonorrhea and malaria. The mortality rate for women at child
delivery is 320 per 100,000 women in the region compared to 160 per 100,000 in Nicaragua.
20.    Roads are one of the main problems mentioned by the population. Transportation is usually by foot, and by canoe
along canals and rivers. Public transportation is scarce, and boat transportation is extremely costly.
Municipal government structure
21.    The management and adiministration of municipalities is handled by municipal government, including the Mayor,
the Vice-Mayor and the Municipal Council. In the case of the Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic Coast, municipalities
follow the Autonomy Regions Statutes, which grant them more autonomy from the Central Government.
Recognition of indigenous authorities and organizations
22.    There are special legal references to municipalities with indigenous populations. They recognize formal and
traditional indigenous authorities and their right to be included in the decision-making process at the municipal level.
Formal authorities are the Boards of Directors, and traditional "costumbre" authorities are those elected by their people,
such as the Council of Elders, Reform Councils and Alcaldes de Vara.
Social traditional structure'
23.    The Council of Elders is the highest traditional authority and regarded by ethnic groups as the most important. It
is formed by respected, knowledgeable elders, as well as younger men. They play an advisory role in important social or
personal matters.
24.    The Sindico is nominated by the community to represent it in disputes and legal matters dealing with land tenure
and natural resource management, particularly regarding lumber and precious woods. The Sindico is also in charge of
managing community resources.
25.    The Sukawala is a Mayangna Federation with legal status which represent the Mayangna in-and-outside the
'This information too focuses on the indigenous groups located on the Atlantic Coast. On the Pacific Coast, indigenous communities
are legally ruled by a "junta" or assembly, elected each year. As is the case in RAAS and RAAN, the Council of Elders represents the
highest traditional authority, followed in hierarchy by a "cacique mayor", a "cacique menor" and various "alcaldes" or mayors
("alcalde de vara", "alcalde mayor", "alcalde segundo", "alcalde tercero" and "alcalde cuarto"). Each mayor commands five
"regidores".

community. Among this ethnic group, the Wihta is a judge, also elected by the community to manage internal
community affairs, and take disciplinary action. They also nominate a guard to maintain public order.
26.   The Judges and policemen are publicly nominated by all ethnic groups.
27.   Outside the strictly indigenous ethnic groups, the following people play a key role in making decisions for the
community: the Pastor (Moravo, Catholic or Evangelist); teachers, health workers, midwives, and health promoters.
FISE poverty maps and targeting of resources
28.   FISE's poverty map is the most powerful tool available to the Government for targeting resources to
municipalities. So far, two maps have been used by FISE to target the poor. The first one (1993) was based on the
indices of five basic unsatisfied needs (access to elementary education, access to water, access to health services, access
to sanitation and employment). According to that map, the index of basic unsatisfied needs in Nicaragua was 75.5%.
This meant that three-fourths of the population did not have access to at least one basic need; 43.6% had no access to two
needs. As a result, only 25.5% of the population was considered "not poor"', and the entire Atlantic Region was
classified as "extreme poverty".
29.   The present poverty map for 1997-2000 uses different variables to measure poverty, based on the LSMS of 1993;
its key variable to define the poverty line is family consumption. As a result, RAAN and RAAS are no longer classified
under "extreme poverty", but "high" and "medium and low" (Puerto Cabezas, Bluefields, El Rama, El Tortuguero, La
Cruz de Rio Grande, Kukra Hill). Financial resources are then distributed accordingly. A new Poverty Study and Map
will be published using 1998 LSMS and 1995 Census results.
FISE's Municipal Micro-Planning Program
30.   FISE has recently started Municipal Micro-Planning (see Annex 2, Section 2). An initial pilot program was
carried out successfully last year in five Pacific municipalities (Diriamba, Camoapa, Jalapa, Santo Tomas y Nindiri) with
participation of municipal governments, and their respective UTMs. By the end of 1998, FISE expects to have completed
the Municipal Micro-Planning Program in 40 more municipalities, including 10 municipalities with indigenous
populations: San Dionisio, Pantasma, Wiwili, San Roman, Jinotega, Matagalpa, Mozonte, Telpaneca, San Lucas and El
Cud Bocay.
31.   Due to previous government commitments, the majority of municipalities on the Atlantic Coast have exhausted
the resources assigned to them according to the Poverty Map. However, FISE will carry out the Municipal Micro-
Planning Program in those municipalities with rural indigenous communities, where some resources are still available.
Recommendations
32.   FISE's Municipal Micro-Planning Program includes participatory rural appraisal mechanisms. Given that 58% of
the inhabitants in RAAN and RAAS are not mestizos (like the majority of the Pacific and central regions), the present
social assessment recommends the incorporation of an indigenous/creole and gender strategy in the Municipal Micro-
Planning process in the Atlantic Coast to ensure that these groups are encouraged to participate and benefit from all of the
steps in the process. Those mechanisms have been discussed with FISE, the implementing NGOs, the municipal
governments, and the communities. They are reflected in the IPDP and the Participation Plan.
II.   INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT PLAN (IPDP) FOR MUNICIPAL MICRO-PLANNING IN
THE ATLANTIC COASTAL REGION
33.   While 11% of the Nicaraguan population is ethnic, previous FISE projects did not incorporate mechanisms to
'Morales Nieto, Jairo. 1995. "Reforma Social y Pobreza." Separata Tendencias 2000, No. 2, UNDP, Managua.



44
promote the participation of indigenous communities. With the objective of correcting this situation and improving
attention to the ethnic groups throughout the country, this IPDP develops mechanisms to adapt the Municipal Micro-
Planning Program to the cultural, multi-ethnic and multilingual context of those municipalities with indigenous
populations. It thus seeks to assist FISE in ensuring that the lowest strata of the population (indigenous and creole, as well
as women) benefit from its implementation. Given that 58% of the Atlantic Coast inhabitants are indigenous/creole, it
focuses primarily on RAAN and RAAS, and seeks to secure that its indigenous populations:
a) are aware of benefits offered by FISE subprojects;
b) have access to FISE subprojects by making information accessible to them in local languages (if necessary). To this
effect, FISE menus will be translated into local languages;
c) benefit as much as possible from the Municipal Micro-Planning process;
d) have the opportunity to be present and participate in the discussion and prioritization of potential subprojects
(Participatory Diagnoses) in the Local Development Plans and the Municipal Development Plans; and
e) participate in decisions about the cultural make-up of subprojects. This will enable them to identify with the
subprojects, thus ensuring operation and maintenance and sustainability of completed subprojects.
34.    This IPDP has been prepared by FISE following the requirements of O.D. 4.20. It also follows the requirements
of Municipal Law No. 40, Title VI, Chapter II, which states that "formal and traditional authorities be recognized and
consulted prior to making decisions for municipal plans affecting their people and territory", and is in accordance with the
Municipal Strengthening Program agreed by FISE and INIFOM in 1997. It is the result of a series of consultations with
municipal mayors and Municipal Councils, the Mayangna Sukawala Federation, local NGOs (indigenous and non-
indigenous), women's and midwives groups, as well as interviews with educators, AMURACAN (Association of
Municipalities of the Atlantic Coast), and University and Hospital staff.
Selected municipalities in the Atlantic Coast
35.   Thirteen out of the 18 municipalities of the Atlantic Coast will be part of the Municipal Micro-Planning and
Municipal Strengthening process in RAAN and RAAS. The other five are already part of neighboring departments
(Waslala under Matagalpa; Bocana de Paiwas, Muelle de los Bueyes, El Rama and Nueva Guinea under Chontales). The
population make-up of these mtnicipalities is mostly mestizo.
36.   Table 4 illustrates the p:resent municipal fund allocation based on the Poverty Map 1997-2000'.
While this table reflects the original resource allocation according to the Poverty Map, it does not reflect the amount of resources
that are still available.

Objectives of the Municipal Micro-Planning/ IPDP
37.    The main objectives of Municipal Micro-Planning are:
i  Strengthening the municipal government and empowering it with the tools to coordinate development initiatives in the
municipality.
*  Facilitate coordination among all agencies which finance projects/ programs in the municipality, to incorporate all
available funds for social investments in the municipal budget.
*  Decentralize management of social investments to the local level and strengthen administrative and managerial skills
of local governments and communities to handle investments, sustain project maintenance plans, and guarantee
adequate use of social and economic infrastructure.
*  Target funds to the poorest areas.
38.    Within this framework, the IPDP describes additional measures to identify the needs of the indigenous population
and to help refine the process, which would be used for the program carried out in RAAS and RAAN:
*  Community participation. Mechanisms have been created to ensure that all communities will be invited to participate
in the Workshops. Given that the 13 municipalities have indigenous/ creole populations, mechanisms have been
established to ensure their representation in the meetings, workshops, assemblies during all Micro-Planning stages.
Committees formed as a result of Micro-Planning must have ethnic representation proportional to population.
*  Gender focus. Mechanisms have been created to facilitate (a) women's participation at assemblies and workshops
(training and forum) and (b) their nomination for any organizations which may be created or strengthened as a result
of Micro-Planning. To facilitate women's attendance to meetings and workshops, child care services may be
organized and managed by community volunteers.
*  Legitimate community representation will be promoted. Communities will be able to choose their own
representatives.
*  Simplified materials in the local language. In municipalities with populations speaking only the indigenous language,



46
Micro-Planning concepts will be explained in simple terms and in the local language.
* Avoid duplication of efforts aimed at Municipal Strengthening by other agencies. A promotional workshop for
mayors of RAAN and RAAS will help them place all of their other Municipal Strengthening programs they may have
access to, in the context of FISE's Micro-Planning Program.
Conceptual Framework
39.   Some of the concepts are implicit to the Micro-planning program carried out in the Pacific and central regions.
However, the present IPDP intends to underline them for the program to be done in RAAN and RAAS.
*  Community participation. Mechanisms have been created to ensure that all the communities affected will be invited
to participate in the Workshops. Given that the 13 municipalities have indigenous/ creole population, mechanisms
have been put in place to ensure their representation in the meetings, workshops, assemblies during all Micro-
planning stages. Committees formed as a result of Micro-planning must have adequate ethnic representation.
*  Gender focus. Mechanisms have been created to facilitate (a) women's participation in assemblies and workshops
(training and forum) and (b) their nomination for any organizations which may be created or strengthened as a result
of Micro-planning.
*  Legitimate community representation will be promoted. Municipalities/communities shall be able to choose their
own representatives.
e  Simplified materials in the local language. In municipalities with monolingual population speaking only the
indigenous language, Micro-planning concepts shall be explained in simple terms and in the local language.
*  Avoid duplication of efforts geared to Municipal Strengthening by other agencies. A promotional workshop for
mayors of RAAN and RAAS will help them place all other Municipal Strengthening programs they may have access
to, in the context of FISE Micro-planning program.
Functions of main stakeholders of the Micro-Planning Program
40.   The main stakeholders of this program will perform the following functions:
* NGOs, under the direction of FISE, will be in charge of promotion, training, and technical assistance of stakeholders
at the local and municipal levels.
* The local govemments and their UTMs will implement and supervise the program.
* FISE-INIFOM will be in charge of monitoring and following up on the process.
* Local communities will perform social control over the program.
Main tasks of the implementing NGOs
41.   The two main tasks for the NGOs implementing Municipal Micro-Planning are:
A. Provide UTMs with the skills needed to fully implement and supervise the Municipal Micro-Planning Program in
their communities.
B. Provide all needed technical assistance to municipal govemments and communities to identify and prioritize projects
and elaborate Municipal Social Investment Plans by means of using the Micro-Planning methodology.



47

Pilot Micro-Planning Process in the Atlantic Coast
43.   The program would initially be piloted in two selected municipalities with indigenous populations (Siuna and El
Cud Bocay). This would involve the following activities:
i) Contract a local consultant to assist FISE in the cultural appropriateness of actions, serve as a link between FISE and
the local governments, assist the implementing NGOs in assessing the UTM and local government capacities, and
assist FISE in finding NGOs to carry out the promotional campaign.
ii) Fine-tune the Terms of Reference for the NGOs to meet the criteria recommended by O.D. 4.20 to secure
participation of indigenous groups and women in the Municipal Micro-Planning program (through the elaboration of
a promotional campaign (in Spanish and local languages); consultation/training activities of indigenous authorities;
and the design of participatory mechanisms).
iii) Contract local NGOs capable of carrying out the Municipal Micro-Planning program in the two municipalities chosen
for the pilot in the Atlantic Coast.
iv) Organize and carry out a Promotional Campaign of Municipal Micro-Planning and the Preventive Maintenance Fund
in Siuna and El Cua Bocay. Culturally adequate (drawings, simple Spanish, local languages) printed materials such
as pamphlets and posters, will be used for promotional purposes in all communities.
v) Train mayors, local governments and UTMs of Siuna and El Cud Bocay on MMP and PMF.
vi) Implement MMP and PMF in Siuna and El Cua Bocay.
vii) Train traditional indigenous/creole authorities of RAAN and RAAS on the MMP process with the purpose of
disseminating the information to indigenous/creole communities.
viii)Final MMP reports to be submitted to FISE.

Annex 10
Nicaragua
Third Social Investment Fund Project
History and Achievements of FISE
This annex provides a brief summary of the history and achievements of FISE. It draws mainly from information
presented in the May 19, 1997 report on the Mid-Term Review for the Second Social Investment Fund Project and from
FISE: Informe de Avance y Cierre del Programa 1995-1997 of December 1997.
I.    Background
The Government of Nicaragua established FISE in November of 1990 as a temporary agency to help protect and
improve the standard of living of poor and effected groups during the period of economic adjustment through the
provision of employment and social and economic infrastructure and services. FISE was viewed as a transitional safety-
net instrument that would provide a rapid response to a critical poverty situation until the line ministries strengthened their
institutional capacities. Originally scheduled to end in December 1995, the Government first extended FISE's life by two
years to help meet persisting social and economic problems. In March 1997, the Government extended FISE's existence
until the year 2002. The mandate was altered from a focus on short-term compensation to an emphasis on medium-term
social investment. FISE was to continue helping the Government in sustaining its poverty alleviation efforts under its new
economic adjustment program, particularly during the transition in government and the development of new sectoral
policies. Also, it was to complement the Government's investment strategy in the social sector; be responsible for the
construction and rehabilitation of social investments on behalf of the line ministries; and assist in the decentralization of
the Central Government responsibilities to the local governments; as well as develop mechanisms and strategies to ensure
long-term sustainability and quality of investments.
Since its creation, FISE has received substantial support from the international community, including from IDA
under the First and Second Social Investment Fund Projects (Cr. 2434-NI for US$ 25 million in 1992 and Cr. 2767-NI for
US$ 30 million in 1995). It is estimated that, as of 1995, the bulk of FISE's resources, or about US$100 million (of which
about US$10.4 million were used for FISE's operating costs) financed a range of priority, small-scale social and
economic infrastructure subprojects, sponsored by municipalities, community organizations, and NGOs, and selected in
consultation with relevant government entities. The remaining resources were used for institutional strengthening of FISE
(US$1.0 million), a Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) (US$0.5 million), and a Preventive Maintenance
Fund (US$0.9 million).
IH.    Achievements of FISE
Resources mobilization:
FISE's ability to mobilize external resources led to a 9 percent increase in subproject commitments, from
US$89.6 million in March 1996 to US$97.8 million in March 1997. For the period January 1995 to March 1997, FISE
was successful in mobilizing US$103.1 million in multilateral and bilateral support from IDA and five other donor
agencies. Of this amount, US$93.9 million were disbursed as of December 1997. Administrative costs for the same period
totaled US$10.8 million, or about 10 percent of project disbursements. Funds for the second IDA Credit were 91 percent
disbursed as of the same date. FISE has been able to process subproject requests, from receipt of eligible subproject
requests to start of implementation, in about one year. The average subproject implementation period has been five
months.
FISE's contribution to poverty alleviation, through targeted interventions, was significant in terms of providing



52
social and economic infrastructure and improving'social services and coverage in poor areas. Between 1991 and 1996,
FISE's participation in social sector spending rose from US$ 10.5 million to US$31.9 million, averaging about 65
percent. FISE accounted for 99 percent of the Government's education and 25 percent of its health investment
expenditures.
As of end of December 1997, FISE had financed 5,508 subprojects at a cost of US$166.5 million, including the
rehabilitation or upgrading of 1,410 pre-primary and primary schools, 109 secondary schools, 24 technical and vocational
institutes, 287 health posts, 52 health centers, 36 childcare centers, 15 shelters and homes for the elderly, 47 water
subprojects, and 42 sewerage projects, among others. A total of about 24,000 years of temporary employment had been
generated by FISE-financed projects (based on ex-ante appraisal criteria).
Targeting:
As shown in Table 1, FISE has been successful in applying poverty targeting mechanisms to reach the poorest
communities. Important progress has been made in reaching poor rural communities (which have received 65 percent of
total investments allocated by FISE between 1995 and 1997, as opposed to 42% between 1991 and 1994), in enhancing
the role of women, and expanding benefits of the program to the indigenous peoples.

I Note: Between 1991 and 1997, FISE's targeting system was based on a classification of municipalities into three categories, according to key
social indicators: displaced population, child malnutrition, and water supply indicators.
Sectoral allocation:
As shown in Table 2, during the period 1991-1997, 79 percent of subproject disbursements were in education, health, and
water and sanitation sectors, with the remainder in economic infrastructure subprojects in poor areas and environmental
subprojects. Sectoral allocations were estimated in four broad categories: social infrastructure, economic infrastructure,
social assistance, and environment.

Private Sector Development:
FISE's impact on private sector development has been substantial. FISE has strengthened the local contracting
industry, as well as private banking and the insurance industry. From 1991 to March 31, 1997, FISE approved subproject
financing of US$147.14 million for 5,543 subprojects. Construction firms (I 17) and independent contractors (1,01 1)
executed 61 percent of subprojects, or 83.44 percent of total approved financing. Subproject financing stimulated private
sector manufacture of construction materials and promoted growth of transport. FISE also fostered private banking by
virtue of the fact that its own accounts are held in private banks, as well as through direct contractor payments to banks.
FISE contributed to growth of the insurance industry (and private banking) as a result of the requirement that contractors
secure construction guarantees. FISE's rate of investment was approximately US$0.8 million per week as of March 1997,
up from US$ 0.5 million per week in September 1996.
Finally, FISE also has had a positive impact on the development of the non-profit sector. Non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) sponsored, executed, and formulated social assistance subprojects. From 1991 to March 31, 1997,
90 NGOs sponsored 160 subprojects at a cost of US$10.7 million, or 7.3 percent of total project approvals; 18 NGOs
executed 554 subprojects at a cost of US$3.9 million, or 2.7 percent approved financing; and 15 NGOs prepared 1 ,152
subprojects costing US$6.5 million. In the future, NGOs are also expected to play a large role in environment, child care
centers, and family garden subprojects.
