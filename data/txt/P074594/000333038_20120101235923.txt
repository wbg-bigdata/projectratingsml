1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Second Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP II) was
presented to the Board of the World Bank in December 2006 and became effective in
February of the following year. It succeeded an earlier emergency rehabilitation project
(EMSRP I, $19.9m, FY03). The latter, in turn, was one of several other Bank projects
developed in response to the severe political, economic, social, and institutional crisis
that engulfed the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) following the onset of the Second
Palestinian Intifada in September 2000. While some progress had been made since 2000,
the Palestinian situation remained very difficult: the economy continued to contract, with
real GDP per capita remaining well below its 1999 level; unemployment remained high
at 25 percent; poverty continued to increase, to an estimated at 41 percent by the end of
2006; and the movement of people and goods continued to be severely restricted by stern
Israeli military measures, with exports from Gaza having dropped by 40 percent over
already low 2005 levels. As a result municipalities continued to experience sharp declines
in their revenues; spiraling payment arrears; and the accelerating degradation of
infrastructure and services already seriously damaged during the Intifada. This was even
further complicated by the Hamas political party (on the terrorism lists of several donor
countries) winning a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council in March 2006 and
resulting severe difficulties for donors in continuing to provide funds to WBG. In sum,
the context in WBG at appraisal was one of deep and worsening crisis.
In response to the situation at the time, the Palestinian Authority (PA) sought urgent help
from donors in dealing with the crisis, while also expressing a strong wish to continue to
maintain their longer-term institution-building agenda. This was entirely consistent with
the Bank’s strategy to focus on “maintaining medium-term development activity where
feasible, and providing emergency assistance designed to sustain Palestinian institutions
and mitigate poverty.?1 The approach was one of balance: continuing to address the crisis
but also laying a foundation for the future. The Bank’s portfolio at appraisal comprised
10 active projects totaling US$107.8m with 60 percent committed to the infrastructure
sector, mostly designed to address emergency issues. There was little room within the
existing portfolio for reallocation to meet the acute emerging crisis; hence the decision to
pursue EMSRP II instead of the planned project then under preparation (see Section 2.1).
The donor response at the time was also noteworthy. The French and Dutch governments
were particularly forthcoming as can be seen in Annex 1, and several other donors
expressed an interest in supporting the Bank’s initiative.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The objectives of EMSRP II were to (a) provide assistance for mitigating further
deterioration in the delivery of essential municipal services in the West Bank and Gaza;
(b) create temporary job opportunities at the local level; (c) promote pilot initiatives that

foster collaboration among local governments and NGOs and promote municipal cost
recovery.2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The project development objectives were never formally revised. However, consistent
with the need to respond to the emergency situation, the emphasis in the PRDP, the
Bank’s Interim Strategy, and the allocation of funds, objectives “a? and “b? were
considered as primary and “c? as secondary throughout the implementation period, and
also for this ICR.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary target groups were: (i) the 132 municipalities3 in WBG (accounting for 70
percent of the population), who received support for rehabilitating, sustaining and where
possible improving essential local government services; (ii) the Ministry of Local
Government (MOLG) who would secure a mechanism for the more equitable and
transparent allocation of funds and legally required budget reports from municipalities on
a timely annual basis. Subsidiary beneficiaries included specific municipalities and
NGO’s, who were supported through pilot initiatives to improve revenue collection and
the delivery of local services.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The components were as follows:4
Component 1: Emergency Municipal Services Assistance Grants. Total cost
US$29.7 million, of which Bank financing US$7.0 million; Government of Netherlands
US$3 million equivalent; AFD US$13 million equivalent; and a financing Gap of US$6.7
million.5 The component would finance (i) rehabilitation, reconstruction and
upgrading of damaged municipal infrastructure and facilities, as well as the supply
of equipment to sustain municipal service provision, and (ii) non-wage recurrent
expenditures as direct inputs to the provision of essential municipal services over a
period of up to two years.
Component 2: Labor-intensive Employment Generation. Total cost US$6.10 million, of
which Bank financing US$1.10 million; Government of the Netherlands US$3.0 million
equivalent; and a Financing Gap of US$2.0 million. This sub-component would finance
temporary labor-intensive employment sub-projects that are identified and
implemented by Municipalities in coordination with locally-based community groups.
Component 3: MDLF Innovation Window. Total cost US$1.20 million, financed solely
by the Bank. This component is divided into two sub-components: (i) Piloting pre-paid
electricity metering systems at municipalities (US$0.50 million), financing the purchase
of over 3,500 new meters, administrative systems and technical assistance. (ii) Piloting

  The wording of the PDO in the TA diverges slightly from the simpler PDO statement in the Grant
Agreement used for the ICR, but the substance is essentially unchanged.
3
  The appraisal document (TA) makes reference to 131 municipalities, but this appears to be an error. All
subsequent Bank and Palestinian documents specify 132.
4
  The specific component allocation is provided in Annex 1.
5
  It was expected that the financing gaps would be comfortably filled by donor contributions, and it was.

                                                     2
Local Government-NGO collaboration for emergency and other joint programming
purposes (US$0.70 million), aiming to encourage greater coordination and joint
programming by local governments and NGOs at the local level through the
requirement of a joint funding proposal.
Component 4: Project Management Costs. Total component cost: US$3.2 million, of
which Bank financing US$0.7 million; Government of Netherlands financing of US$0.3
million; and AFD financing of US$1.8 million equivalent; and a financing gap of US$0.4
million. The component would finance: (i) MDLF Management Fee: sub-component
costs to administer donor funds, based on a 5 percent administration fee. (ii) Technical
assistance and monitoring (US$1.3 million). This includes financing of four regionally-
based local technical consultants (LTCs) to support municipalities in preparing and
implementing their Emergency Assistance Programs (EAPs);6 a technical review audit;
environmental and social safeguard reviews; training in procurement and financial
management; a beneficiary impact assessment; and other small, specialized technical
assistance assignments.
1.6 Revised Components
The core components were not revised. However, the pre-paid metering pilot was
replaced early in calendar 2008 by a parking meter pilot in the Ramallah/Al Bireh
municipalities as requested in a May 26, 2008 letter from Ministry of Finance to the
Bank.
1.7 Other Significant Changes
There were four significant changes. The first was the reallocation of US$2 million from
component 1 to component 2 to rebalance the overall allocation of funding in response to
the funding preferences of other donors—reducing the Bank allocation to Component 1
from US$7 million to US$5 million.7 The second change was the provision of US$3.0
million in additional grant funding (AF) by the Bank in July 2009 for the purpose of
supporting additional infrastructure rehabilitation in Gaza. The latter was in response to
the widespread damage caused by Israeli military attacks during December 2008 and
January 2009 period. This increased the overall Bank funding from US$10 million to
US$13 million (i.e., by 30 percent), and total Bank funding for component 1 from US$5
million to US$8 million. The additional funding also included a further provision for
project management. Third, the closing date of the project was extended, from the
original June 2009 to December 2009 to facilitate completion of the parking meter pilot--
and later to June 2011 to facilitate the implementation of the additional funding.8 Fourth,
overall project funding was increased significantly by additional Bank and donor funding
from an estimated US$40.2 million at appraisal to an eventual total of US$70.28 million
(a 75 percent increase) indicating very strong donor support for the initiative (from
France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Germany (KfW)), and more than
covering the initial component financing gap. (See Annex 1 for details.)

6
  Municipalities were required to prepare EAPs as a condition for access to funding.
7
  The precise date of the adjustment is not clear. The adjustment is recorded in the March 2008 Mid Term
Review. It is also reflected in ISR # 5, see Annex 1(d)).
8
  The closing date for the Danish Trust Fund was also extended until September 30, 2011. By June 30,
2011, TF094522 (World Bank Additional Financing), and the TF092840 (Swedish) were fully disbursed
and closed. (This joint financing is in addition to the Bank’s US$13m contribution.)

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Quality at entry is rated Satisfactory (S). In spite of the emergency situation and the very
difficult conditions on the ground, the Bank was able to respond quickly because of its
deep sector knowledge and its ability to draw on the recently completed EMSRP I.
Importantly, it was also able to use ongoing preparatory work from the planned project--
the Municipal Management and Service Delivery Project (MMSDP) which was cancelled
at the request of the PA-- and sector knowledge used as a base for preparing EMSRP II. 9
Based on this, EMSRP II was able to include institutional measures to a greater extent
than what would normally be seen for an emergency operation, balancing crisis response
with the strengthening of institutional capacity. The project also built effectively on
lessons learned; primarily from EMSRP I (see Annexes 2 and 10 for details.) Notably,
the October 2007 QAE assessment (discussed in Section 5) rated the project as
satisfactory overall, and highly satisfactory in several areas.
A number of aspects of the project could have been improved, however. First, while the
sector and institutional development objectives of the project were obvious and had been
clearly specified as such in EMSRP I, they were not so specified in EMSRP II. Second,
the output indicators were not well specified--there were too many to be practically
monitored, and too many that were unquantifiable--and had to be significantly revised
during the March 2008 Mid-Term review (see Annex 2). Third, there was ambiguity
concerning the number and timing of the required beneficiary impact assessments
(BIAs)—see Section 2.3. Fourth, while the idea of including pilots was not necessarily a
bad one even in an emergency project, it is not clear that there was strong ownership for
them or that the mechanisms for preparation and implementation were adequately
thought through. These are shortcomings; but given the robustness of the design and the
rapidity of project preparation under very challenging conditions, the ICR concurs with
the QAE’s Satisfactory rating.
2.2 Implementation
Despite implementation problems early on, overall project implementation is rated
Satisfactory (S). EMSRP II was never seriously at risk at any time though periodic delays
were experienced. The project was due to close in June 2009. However, as noted it was
extended first to December 2009 to enable the completion of the parking meter pilot, and
later to June 2011 to enable the implementation of the additional US$3 million funding
for Gaza.
The project got off to a slow start in the first half of 2007. Implementation was severely
hampered by Israeli military restrictions on the movement of people and goods—
particularly in and out of Gaza, but also in the West Bank; and there were problems with
management and oversight by MDLF. In addition, there were delays due to a contractors’
strike occasioned by a depreciation of the US dollar and its negative impact on
construction costs. Further, the first pilot had to be replaced early on; this change was
formalized in October 2008 (see discussion in section 3.2).


9
 The TA is not specific on the preparation status of MMSDP at the time of EMSRP II appraisal, or on
which components of MMSDP were included in EMSRP II.

                                                   4
Many of the managerial and contractual issues were addressed by 2008 and considerable
improvements were noted in the performance of municipalities and MDLF--as confirmed
by the MTR and the Implementation Status and Results report (ISRs). However, in
December 2008 the Israelis attacked Gaza militarily, severely disrupting project
operations, physically devastating several neighborhoods, and making an already very
difficult situation far worse. The Bank and other donors responded quickly to the new
crisis by providing additional funds to help keep essential infrastructure and services in
Gaza functioning—even if at a minimal level. MDLF also strengthened their staffing and
stepped up their operations there. Despite the many obstacles, the MDLF with strong
support from the Bank and donors was able to sustain disbursements and complete the
original project by December 2009, and the additional activities as planned by June 2011.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design of the M&E framework suffered from the lack of sufficiently solid data at the
municipal level to effectively monitor project impacts on the ground. This was supposed
to be partially offset by BIAs, and a single beneficiary assessment was in fact carried out-
- in September 2009.10 This helped to capture the subjective experience of the project
from the beneficiary point of view and overcome the lack of initial data. However,
coming as it did almost at the end of implementation it was too late to be of any real help
in steering the project. Further, in terms of M&E utilization the wealth of information
contained in this BIA was left largely unexploited by the MDLF for EMSRP 2.11 This
meant that an opportunity was missed to learn other, much deeper, lessons about the
strengths and weaknesses of the project during implementation. The output indicators in
particular were not well specified, but corrective and necessary revisions were made at
the March 2008 MTR in order to overcome the shortcomings in M&E design.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
There were no significant safeguard or fiduciary compliance issues at any time during the
project. None of the social safeguards were triggered for this project as the works
concerned the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. Sub-projects which required land
acquisition were ineligible for funding. Part of the due diligence included confirmation
by municipalities that each sub-project was screened to ensure that land acquisition
would not take place.
Financial Management: Throughout the life of EMSRP II, MDLF issued regular
quarterly and annual financial reports, which were received by the Bank in a timely
manner. Annual Audit reports were received by the Bank on time and auditors' opinions
have always been unqualified. Auditors’ Management Letter, as well as Bank reviews,
did not reveal material weakness in MDLF internal control System nor reported any
material misstatement in the Project Financial Statements. MDLF has maintained an
effective internal control system to ensure that project expenditures are properly
authorized, supporting documents are maintained, accounts are reconciled periodically
and project assets, including cash, are safeguarded.


10
   Annex 4 of the appraisal document specifies the need for 2 BIAs, “…one after 12 months of project life,
and one at project closing? (as was done in EMSRP I) while the project description implies the need for
one, and only one was undertaken.
11
   However the BIA did help to inform MDP I

                                                    5
Procurement: Overall procurement performance improved gradually throughout the
project lifetime. Initially, project implementation experienced substantial delays that were
mainly attributed to the low procurement capacity of MDLF and its ineffective
management of the Local Technical Consultants (LTCs). The latter failed to provide the
envisaged guidance to municipalities in adhering to procurement guidelines. The weak
contract management capacity at the municipal level, the restrictions imposed on the
movement of people and goods, especially into Gaza, and the 2007-2008 protracted strike
by the Contractor’s Union in protest of the US dollar depreciation further contributed to
the delays.
MDLF gradually established an effective system to continuously monitor all procurement
aspects of the sub-projects in West Bank and Gaza. As a result, procurement performance
under EMSRPII improved; its rating was upgraded, as of early 2009 to satisfactory and
remained so until the closing of the project. The Bank carried out 3 ex-post procurement
reviews during the project lifetime (May 2009, May 2010 and June 2011). No major
noncompliance was noted.
Environment: Concerning the environmental aspects, an environmental mitigation plan
was prepared and implemented. The MDLF staff includes an Environment Specialist who
was responsible for training municipalities and contracts on implementing the EMP,
coordinating with the Environment Bureau and with the assistance of a specialist hired by
MDLF who worked with the municipalities to ensure compliance by the contractors.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Sustainability is usually difficult to achieve in an emergency project. However,
EMSRP II benefited from the strong coordination of donors to achieve a high level of
consensus around a common framework for the next phase. A follow up Municipal
Development Project (MDP I) is already under implementation and a second successor
project (MDP II) is under preparation. These projects will contribute to consolidating the
achievements in terms of the fiscal transfer mechanism and procedures. The follow-on
MDP I was able to build on the accomplishment of EMSRP II to:
   Further rationalize the municipal funds allocation system, improve distributional
    equity, and strengthen local and national accountability
   Strengthen managerial capacity at MDLF and develop an organization that now
    commands widespread local as well as international donor support
   Strengthen donor coordination and support to a broadly based national led
    programmatic development effort
With respect to the pilots, the parking meters show promise of sustainability however the
future of the NGO pilots is less clear. There is the broader question of whether or not
these kinds of pilots should be part of an emergency project, as discussed in section 6.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Project objectives were highly relevant to the situation in WBG at the time of appraisal
and remain relevant today in light of the most recent strategies for WBG (the 2008-2010
Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) and the Bank’s FY08-FY10 Interim

                                             6
Strategy). The PRDP clearly states that the MDLF is the PNA’s preferred mechanism for
channeling reform and development assistance to local government. The main parts of
the PRDP governance agenda are security and local government reform, and the Bank’s
strategy is aligned to these priorities. While addressing critical municipal infrastructure,
services, and employment problems, EMSRP II managed to lay the foundation for
institutional change and improved accountability in local government and in the
transparency of municipal finances. The beneficiary survey provides further evidence of
the relevance of project interventions, with 81 percent of beneficiaries reporting (in the
2009 BIA, see Annex 5) that the project was very relevant to their community’s needs.
The design was relatively well thought through, flexible and yet robust, building on
lessons learned from previous sector interventions and ongoing lending, but with the
drawbacks mentioned under Section 2.1. The project clearly helped achieve the key
objectives of the PRDP and Interim Strategy to balance crisis response with laying the
foundation for sustainable sector development. Adjustments during implementation
assured continued relevance of project interventions to the evolving context (e.g. the
metering pilot), but was only partially able to correct the deficiencies in M&E.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO was achieved with minor shortcomings and is rated Satisfactory (S). EMSRP II
helped lay the foundation for the major on-going policy and strategic shift under MDP I,
from a succession of largely uncoordinated individual donor-supported initiatives, to a
more sustainable nationally-led long term programmatic approach (see description in
Annex 10). The project had three objectives, which are weighed in this analysis
according to both the importance to respond to the emergency situation, emphasis in
PRDP and Interim Strategy and the funds allocated to the activities measured by each
sub-PDO. The first two were clearly the primary objectives-- as reflected in their status in
the ISRs.
The first sub-objective of providing assistance for mitigating further deterioration in the
delivery of essential municipal services in the West Bank and Gaza was achieved with
minor shortcomings. The majority of project funds were used to this end, with US$7.8M
disbursed under Component 1 through the transparent, fair and rules-based transfer
system established under the project. As noted in Annex 2, the project financed works in
a number of sectors under municipal responsibility and also funded non-wage recurrent
expenditure to keep services operational, critical in keeping key services going,
particularly in Gaza, and preventing further deterioration in service delivery, based on
locally determined priorities. The resources provided by the Bank, plus the additional
funds leveraged, directly or indirectly benefited the 70 percent of the WBG population
living in the 132 municipalities targeted. Importantly, the indicator on beneficiary
satisfaction was achieved, with 81 percent of the target population reporting and they are
satisfied or very satisfied and the same percentage reporting high relevance. The strong
ownership of investments was underscored by the municipalities providing additional
funds to meet the financing gap following cost increases. Further, the Bank was able to
leverage rather modest funds (US$10m initially) to mobilize an additional US$32m (plus
subsequently US$27m additional). These funds, combined with support from the group
of donors, were what made it possible to institute a multi-donor, transparent, fair and
rules-based transfer system. Achievement of the outcome indicator was a result largely

                                             7
attributable to the Bank’s intervention and coordination effort. The role of EMSRP II in
laying the foundation for the major policy shifts under the successor MDP I (see Section
2.5 above and Annex 10), as well as in promoting greatly increased donor cooperation
should be recognized as a major achievement, in a context of weak institutional capacity.
The submission of executed and planned municipal budget reports to MOLG was
achieved as a result of this being a criteria to access funds, and this in itself is a result at
the institutional level attributable to the project. However, the indicator of public
disclosure of municipal budgets was only partially (56 percent disclosed versus a target
of 90 percent) achieved, and only 46 percent of beneficiaries reported that the
municipality was transparent in its disclosures.
Sub-objective 2 was supported by Component 2, and the creation of temporary job
opportunities at the local level was achieved, with 167,000 person-days of employment
created against a target of 140,000. The BIA indicated that most beneficiaries (95
percent) had a positive or very positive view of the program. About US3.1 million was
spent on this component, or 25 percent of project expenditures. This also helped the
project to achieve the outcome indicator of assuring an equalization effect. The transfer
allocation system formula has an element of equalization in that it uses population and
need (employment) as part of the formula.
The third sub-objective of promoting pilot initiatives that foster collaboration among
local governments and NGOs and promote municipal cost recovery was only partially
achieved. The pilot which sought to explore the possibilities for improving municipal
service cost recovery through the introduction of pre-paid electric metering systems as
previously noted was replaced by a parking meter scheme. The second sought to test the
possibilities for leveraging partnerships with local NGOs to deliver services more
effectively. Results from the parking meter pilot have so far been inconclusive. The
meters have been installed however there are issues with enforcement, but the pilot
should still be seen as a worthwhile effort to promote cost recovery and should yield
dividends in the future. The second pilot was also only partially successful. Ten pilots
were implemented including a successful community center operation developed in one
municipality in Gaza; a women’s training center constructed in Ajanta municipality in the
southern West Bank that is operating satisfactorily; and a park and community center
developed in Bait Shout municipality, also in the southern West Bank. The total number
of beneficiaries from the NGO sub-projects was 22,180 in the West Bank and 18,387 in
Gaza. However, the partnership process between the municipality and the local NGO was
fairly mechanical, with the municipality simply constructing the building and handing it
over to the NGO for operations. On both counts the pilots were only partially successful,
but yielded useful lessons on the advisability of including such components without very
clear links to core project objectives or strong local ownership.
Overall, despite shortcomings the project responded well to the emergency situation, and
with the rather limited funds (US$13 M total) was able to achieve results both in terms of
mitigating the immediate impact of the crisis in terms of service delivery and
employment generation, while laying the institutional foundations for continued
improvement in these areas and in intergovernmental transfers, in collaboration with
other donors. Further, the funds greatly benefitted many smaller municipalities that were


                                               8
often neglected or by-passed and were often the only rehabilitation funds available. The
above, taken together, justifies the Satisfactory rating above. (See annex 2 for details.)
3.3 Efficiency
The efficiency of EMSRP II is rated Satisfactory (S). Ex-post economic analysis shows
that investments made under the project yielded high economic rates of returns. The
project supported capital expenditures and incremental recurrent expenditures in support
of operations, maintenance and repairs in 132 municipalities, and in six main subsectors,
as detailed in Annex 3. The dominant subsectors were road rehabilitation, solid waste
management, and public facilities, which together accounted for some 59 percent of
disbursements. These investments totaled approximately US$2.8 million—or about 80
percent of capital expenditure and 22 percent of total project costs.
Analysis of capital expenditures: The quantification of the expected benefits of these
subprojects is based on the standard analyses of the situation “with? and “without? the
project, applying the criteria detailed in Annex 3 (benefits in terms of time and cost
savings for road rehabilitation, incremental and additional net revenue from solid waste
management, and savings in expenditures in rental of municipal office space). The
analysis does not incorporate indirect benefits, and therefore the actual results are likely
to be higher. The results are as follows:
   Roads: Investment of US1.5 million on rehabilitation of roads yields an economic
    rate of return (ERRs) of about 25.8 percent; and a Net Present Value (NPV) of
    approximately US$0.88m
   Solid Waste Collection: Investment of approximately US$0.14 million in the
    improvements on solid waste collection yields an average ERR is 37.8 percent, and a
    NPV of about US$0.3m
   Municipal Buildings: Reconstruction and rehabilitation of public buildings worth
    about half a million dollars (US$0.52 million) yields an ERR of 14.8 percent, and a
    NPV of US$95,000.
Sensitivity Analysis: The results are quite robust. Even if lower net benefits of 25 percent
are assumed, the investments still yields acceptable ERRs: 12.4 percent for roads, and
11.1 percent and 11.7 percent respectively for solid waste collection and buildings. These
three investments also yield positive NPVs under this conservative scenario. Moreover,
this level of profitability does not take into account several other indirect benefits of the
project, such as: (i) market value of real estate; (ii) improved health; or (iii) productivity
increases.
Analysis of non-capital expenditures: Electricity, water and sewer systems comprised the
sectors with the smallest investments (totaling about 13 percent of disbursements). The
analysis of the public works in these three sectors reveals that financial resources were
allocated to maintenance of specific segments in the water, electricity and sewer
networks; which is estimated to be more cost-efficient than reinvesting in new networks.
This is also the case for the part of disbursements in road rehabilitation, solid waste
management, and public facilities, which did not go towards capital expenditures. It was
deemed more suitable to apply cost-efficiency methods for the assessment of the
economic merits of the expenditures in maintenance, spare parts, and repairs (constituting
US$6.3m of total disbursements). It was verified that MDLF's procurement system did in

                                              9
fact systematically request price quotations, as part of established selection procedures,
for ensuring low maintenance costs, and still ensuring the compliance with minimum
acceptable technical specifications. Consequently, it may be considered that the execution
of expenditures in these sectors in maintenance, spare part and repairs met cost-efficiency
standards.
Analysis of employment generation: Analysis of efficiency of labor-intensive
employment generation sub-projects financed under Component 2 focuses on the number
of man-days of work created under this component per dollar spent, in line with the
methodology laid out in the TA and as detailed in Annex 3. The results show that
efficiency of the 167,533 person-days of employment generated, for an expenditure of
US$3.1m, was higher than expected at appraisal. The labor content was higher, at 69.58
percent, against 50 percent in the TA and direct temporary employment was created with
US$12.59 spent per person-day, which is more efficient than the US$15 per person-day
expected in the TA. The analysis shows that employment generation as actually
experienced under the project was more efficient than what was foreseen at appraisal.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the EMSRP II is rated as satisfactory based on the
positive results of the economic analysis for capital investments (US$2.8m) and cost-
efficiency analysis for expenditures in maintenance, spare parts, and repairs (US$6.3m),
combined with the satisfactory efficiency of employment generation (constituting
US$3.1m of the sector expenditures).
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Overall achievement of objectives is rated Satisfactory (S), based on the demonstrated
high relevance of the project against current PA and World Bank priorities. Outcome
targets were achieved with only minor shortcomings (two out of three outcome indicators
fully achieved—those most relevant to the emergency--and both intermediate results
indicators achieved), and the satisfactory efficiency of project investments. Further and
importantly, EMSRP II also played a pivotal role in promoting sector reform and donor
coordination, and in the development of the successor project which is now tackling some
of the broader and more deeply entrenched sector issues.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The key themes were infrastructure rehabilitation, and employment aimed at reducing
poverty, the latter albeit on a temporary basis. Gender was not directly addressed, and
most of the jobs created went to men (see BIA). However, it is well known that families,
including of course women and children benefit directly as well as indirectly from the
income generated by emergency employment. An area directly benefiting women and
supporting social development was the NGO pilot. The Janata (West Bank) pilot
specifically supported training and economic activities for women. The Gaza pilot
supported youth development.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The changes in the rules governing the allocation of funding to the sector through MDLF
(greater equity and transparency), in the behavior of municipalities, and in the behavior
of donors in agreeing to coordinate their sector activities are documented elsewhere in the

                                            10
ICR. In addition, municipalities have been assisted in deepening local accountability by
discussing local needs priorities with the population; and MDLF itself is emerging as an
increasingly capable and effective implementing agency—an emergence strongly
supported by several other donors (see Annex 1). Further, the changes in the funding
allocation rules while not yet PA policy do begin to lay the foundation for this policy.
The behavioral changes are of course fragile, and only time will tell whether or not these
changes are institutionalized. However, recent developments points strongly in this
direction—particularly the PA’s commitment to further pursuing sector reform under
MDP I.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
There were no clearly identifiable unintended outcomes.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
The BIA was useful to assess the achievement of project objectives, particularly the
output target that 80 percent of beneficiaries should rate municipal services as improved.
A single survey was undertaken in September 2009. The survey targeted direct
beneficiaries, focusing on Component 1 (infrastructure rehabilitation and non-wage
recurrent expenditure support) and Component 2 (employment creation). A total of 737
individuals were interviewed for the survey (beneficiaries, municipal staff, NGO
personnel, and citizens from pilot municipalities). The highlights are presented below,
with details in Annex 5.
   Beneficiary Awareness o f EMSRPII and Associated Projects: Sixty percent of
    beneficiaries (60%) had not heard about EMSRP II.
   Satisfaction with Infrastructure Development Component: Of those beneficiaries who
    received assistance in infrastructure development, 81% indicated that they are
    satisfied and/or are very satisfied (target 80%).
   Satisfaction with Job Creation Component: Approximately 95% of beneficiaries
    assessed the job creation program as being good and/or very good.
   Relevance of Infrastructure Component: Eighty-one percent of beneficiaries of
    infrastructure development specified that the project was very relevant to their
    community's needs.
   Perceptions o f Impact: Thirty six percent and forty four percent respectively
    indicated that the project vastly improved the quality of life or improved the quality
    of life to a certain extent. About 16% indicated that the quality of their lives remained
    unchanged.
   Perception of Municipality Transparency: Forty six percent felt that the municipality
    was transparent and it did provide project information without discrimination.
    Slightly more than thirty percent felt that the municipality was not transparent.
    Twenty four percent of all beneficiaries had no opinion.
On the whole, the findings of the BIA were very positive, confirmed that the beneficiary
satisfaction targets had been met, and testified to the general success of the project. (NB.
There was no stakeholder workshop.)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome


                                             11
This risk is rated Significant. This rating is explained by the fact that already much has
been achieved with respect to infrastructure and job creation, but that the gains in service
delivery remain at risk due to the precarious political situation of the WBG. Also,
although the EMSRP II contributed substantially to improving the institutional
environment for intergovernmental fiscal transfers, with more rational, equitable, and
transparent sector funding allocations, and to considerably improved donor
coordination—these hard won gains have yet to be consolidated. Further, although
follow-on operations contribute to mitigating this risk and deepening reforms, the
sustainability of the development outcomes is greatly dependent on improvement of the
overall political and economic climate in WBG.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The ICR rates Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry as Satisfactory (S). This is
in line with the Bank’s October 2007 QAE assessment (see discussion in section 2.1, and
QAE summary at Annex 9). The ICR concurs with the evaluation of the positive aspects
presented in the QAE review, specifically the team’s contribution to incorporating
lessons learned and ensuring that the project was able to balance the pressing need for
immediate financial support to ensuring critical urban services against the need for
modest institution building support, in spite of the unique and difficult context in WBG.
The team also helped the client take advantage of the capacity and strong ownership of
the municipalities and at the same time maintain an appropriate level of accountability
and flexibility, while focusing on ensuring continued critical municipal services. The
team worked in a highly charged WBG environment, and was effective in getting a large
number of donors to participate in the MDLF in a complex logistical and political setting,
and also keeping the Bank engaged in a critical region. On the negative side were the
ambiguities of institutional development objectives, the divergent statements of the PDO
and the weaknesses in the M&E framework. Also, the community participation and
partnerships with local communities in planning, budgeting and piloting local
government-NGO collaboration were not robustly designed. These constitute minor
shortcomings with the Bank performance, but given the extremely difficult conditions in
WBG, they are insufficient to negate the overall assessment of satisfactory Bank
performance.
(b) Quality of Supervision
The quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory (S). A review of the project documents
and discussions with MDLF and municipalities and participating donors confirm that the
locally based Bank supervision team was flexible, responsive, and highly supportive in
the face of the difficult, changing and very complex environment. Bank teams are
limited in their access to Gaza for security reasons (advanced scheduling; access permits
etc) and the MDLF team from the West Bank is not able to meet with their counterparts
from Gaza face to face. Therefore, the Bank teams had to conduct separate supervision
exercises and could only hold video conference meetings with the MDLF teams together.
Faced with the changing needs and urgent priorities due to the military intervention and
continued blockade in Gaza in 2009, the Bank supervision team was a key interlocutor

                                            12
between Gaza and the relevant entities in the West Bank. The Bank’s facilitation of
contact with the MOLG ensured that a damage needs assessment was completed thus
providing a credible foundation for additional funding from donors. In addition, the
Bank team was responsive (e.g., facilitating the movement of materials into Gaza with
Israeli authorities) and flexible (e.g., in adjusting the allocation of Bank funding to
balance the narrower allocation preferences of some donors, and supporting the adaption
of existing machinery for service delivery use—itself a significant innovation) as well as
reallocating funds between components and categories and in seeking to quickly provide
additional funds to alleviate the pressures faced by the municipalities. Furthermore, the
Bank provided leadership in strengthening MDLF (building it into an implementing
institution that all12 can utilize and depended on), and in promoting more rational and
coordinated sector development. This is a significant achievement of the on-ground
supervision team. More narrowly, the supervision of procurement, FM, disbursement,
accounting, and safeguard issues were all satisfactory managed. No significant problems
arose.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Based on the satisfactory assessments above, overall Bank Performance is rated
Satisfactory (S).
5.2 Borrower Performance
 (a) Government Performance
Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS). The data that is
available points to significant responsiveness on the part of the Government (the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) and MOLG). Both took the necessary steps to ensure that Bank and
project requirements were met on a timely basis (particularly ratifying the environmental
management plan and executing subsidiary agreements), and that MDLF was able to
operate effectively in Gaza even under the period of Hamas control. Without this
flexibility on the part of the PA, it would have been impossible to implement the project
in the Hamas controlled Gaza. A constant and as yet unresolved issue, however, has been
the role of the MDLF Board in overseeing the management of the organization, and the
reluctance of the Chairman of the Board (who is also the Minister of Local Government)
to even partially devolve responsibility for the signing of checks to the Managing
Director. The latter highlights a long unresolved internal PA issue: the role of MOLG in
relation to MDLF.13
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Despite some problems the performance of MDLF is rated Satisfactory (S). Initial slow
progress was partly attributable to weak procurement capacity and the ineffective
management of LTCs. However, the problems were eventually resolved by recruitment
of key staff for MDLF and better training of LTCs. The only area that appeared
continuously weak was in implementing the pilots. The strong areas were technical and
financial control and reporting, as well as responsiveness to municipality and donor
requirements. MDLF was also very effective in developing and implementing more

12
     Donors’ policies prevented direct interaction with Hamas led municipalities
13
     Efforts are currently underway within the PA to address this, but the prospects are not clear.

                                                        13
transparent rules for the allocation of funds to the sector; helping municipalities to
prepare projects, and persuading them to comply with their legal obligation to submit
budgets on a timely basis; building a solid municipal database; and sorting out the initial
LTC problems, as well as the difficult US$ depreciation and resulting contractors’ strike
problems. MDLF successfully persuaded municipalities informally to contribute to
resolving sub-project financing gaps, and to do it up front.. Thus MDLF contributed
significantly to achieving broader sector and institutional reform objectives as well as to
effective project problem solving. For instance, as result of the Israeli interventions of
2009, the MDLF was able to persuade municipalities in Gaza to change priorities to those
activities which could be implemented within the short-term and serve to alleviate the
immediate hardships of the population. Overall, based on this performance, MDLF was
subsequently entrusted by the Bank and several other donors with the management of the
follow-on MDP I and a number of other sector related projects, and enjoys the trust of
MOF and MOP. On the negative side, as MDLF consolidated its documentation (a
positive step), reporting became more and more skewed towards financial data, with
insufficient attention to reporting on implementation issues—though they were clearly on
top of these issues.
 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Overall Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory (S). This is based on the substantial
achievement of project objectives under MDLF, and MDLF’s strong and constantly
improving leadership. The issue of check signing by of MDLF’s board chairman, though
important, is not sufficient to undermine this rating.

6. Lessons Learned
Nine lessons may be cited out of the several learned through EMSRP II. Some go beyond
the particular emergency project, and speak to development of projects in both typical
and conflict situations. The core lessons are:
i)    BIAs are a valuable project tool: Similar emergency initiatives would clearly
benefit from performing BIAs at key points during the project (e.g. early on after
effectiveness, mid-term and closing) to help focus and steer the project and draw out
lessons learned—particularly when the baseline data are inadequate.
ii)   Unrelated Pilots are to be discouraged: Attractive as they may be it is not a good
idea to include pilots in emergency projects unless they are clearly related to the
emergency at hand or some very important allied project objective, and also have strong
local ownership. The view of this ICR is that they should be included only when the
potential learning payoffs are highly relevant to the emergency in question. Otherwise,
they are likely to be treated as a distraction—which is partly the case under the EMSRP
II.
iii)  Significant institutional reform can in fact be achieved and capacity built even
under very difficult emergency conditions: On the face of it an emergency project is not
the place to seek or expect significant reform or capacity building. However, both were in
fact achieved under the project: a) A more transparent and equitable municipal funding
allocation mechanism was developed and implemented; and b) Municipalities were
persuaded to submit their budgets to MOLG (as required by law but mostly in breach). In
addition, MDLF’s own capacity to plan, monitor, manage and report was strengthened in
                                            14
the process of implementation—to the point where it is now seen as a model for other PA
institutions and as an essential municipal sector development institution by donors. The
key to success was to carefully calibrate and link reform to critical project participation
requirements (access to funds) and to keep the reforms simple, equitable and achievable.
iv)      To be effective, it is essential to have (or to build) a capable and reliable project
delivery mechanism (MDLF), one that is also not seen as overly partisan: Partly due to
well thought out long term institutional investments backed by the Bank and other
donors, going back to EMSRP I; and partly due to the discipline and hard work of the
Palestinians themselves, MDLF evolved, began to consolidate, and became available as
an effective and relatively neutral vehicle for channeling donor funds to priority projects.
Without this, it is doubtful that: a) donor funding and support could have been secured
and maintained in the midst of considerable internal and external political and military
conflict; b) critical financial, social and technical support could have been provided to
municipalities; and c) that the financial and technical accountability necessary for
effective project implementation and institutional development could have been achieved.
v)       Flexibility in implementation is as important as simplicity in design: One of the
great strengths of EMSRP II, recognized in the 2007 QAG review, was its simplicity. It
focused on 2 key components: a) essential infrastructure rehabilitation; and b) temporary
employment generation. However, no less important was the fact that key subcomponents
could be redefined and/or reprioritized during implementation in response to
circumstances on the ground. An example of this is the Bank’s readiness to reallocate
funds from infrastructure rehabilitation to employment generation [in Gaza] in response
to particular municipal needs and the complementary inputs of co-financiers.
vi)      During implementation it is important to encourage and support innovation and
to tap latent potential and resources. However success does not come easily: An
unplanned and unheralded achievement in Gaza was the adaptation of existing machinery
and equipment (tractors, etc.) for critical infrastructure and service delivery tasks when
the import of materials and spare parts was severely restricted by Israeli blockades. Local
Bank staff recognized the local need and potential and provided support accordingly to
local engineers and mechanics.
vii)     Deep institutional reform is not a quick process and thus it is essential to be
patient and to stay engaged: While not explicitly stated in project documents, EMSRP II
was in fact part of an evolution of municipal sector institution building in WBG—a
shifting from individual project funding to a much broader, more equitable, more
transparent, and more sustainable programmatic approach as witnessed by the successor
MDP I. However, the reform process has taken 8-10 years and it has required much
nurturing by successive and committed on-ground Bank teams.
viii)    Donor coordination can be increased if: a) the local socio-economic and
institutional situation on the ground is dire enough; b) there is a relevant and effective
delivery mechanism; and c) the Bank is able to provide capable leadership: Under
EMSRP II and the follow-on project it has been possible to build a fairly broad donor
consensus on municipal development policy, investment programming, the implementing
institution, and the harmonization of individual donor lending, and project systems. The
explanation lies in a combination of the following: a) donor realization of the depth of the
negative impact of the post Intifada crisis on the Palestinian people; b) negative impact of

                                             15
the Israeli attacks on Gaza beginning in December 2008; c) the dilemma created by the
election of Hamas in 2006; d) the emergence of MDLF as a relatively competent and
politically neutral vehicle that could operate in Gaza and by-pass the Hamas funding
dilemma; e) the on-ground Bank team’s patient and determined policy leadership.
ix)     Sensitive and competent on-ground Bank leadership and supervision is critical for
success: It would have been difficult if not impossible to put the project together in such
short time and in such a comprehensive and carefully calibrated manner if the preparation
team was not acutely aware of the conditions on the ground, and with the key issues and
actors (individual and institutional). Proximity meant that monitoring and support could
be close, and that necessary remedial actions could be effected quickly if needed;
otherwise it would have been difficult to react as sensitively and flexibly. Finally, it
would have been impossible to build the kind of donor relationship necessary for
coordinated and effective longer-term sector development without close and continuous
on-ground contact with key donor representatives over an extended period of time. This
on-ground contact allowed sharing of experiences; sharing of problem analyses; sharing
of objectives and options; and sharing of policy and investment constraints and
dilemmas. Gradually this began leading to a convergence of strategies and policies.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
Drafts of the ICR were shared with the Borrower and Implementing Agency. In response,
the Borrower sent the Borrower's ICR, which agrees to the positive outcome of the
project and does not raise any issues that warrant comments. Attached in Annex 6.
(b) Cofinanciers
The draft ICR was shared with other donors for comments. KfW, SIDA and DANIDA
provided comments (main points summarized in Annex 7), overall agreeing with the
positive outcomes of the project, while requesting that the ICR provide a more nuanced
picture of the role of other donors and also clarifying that they see
MDLF is a key national institution. While the current ICR accounts for project results
from a Bank perspective, the Bank fully recognizes the EMSRP II as a collaborative
effort with the PA and other donors and agrees to the key role of the MDLF. The
language in the final ICR has been adjusted to remove any statements that could be
interpreted otherwise.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component (Key Performance Indicators)

Introduction
This Annex summarizes achievements of key objectives and outputs as identified in the TA and the ISRs.
The Annex also provides additional information on a number of issues that have been summarized in the
main text, including:
     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
     Implementation
     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Further, the Annex provides data on the following:
    Annex 2-a), Sector-Related WBG Assistance Strategy Goal, indicates that the sector goals were only
     largely achieved. Overall achievement is rated Satisfactory (S) despite some minor shortcomings
     because more could not be reasonably expected in the extremely difficult context. The key issues are:
      i) municipalities still receive funds from MOF and other donor sources outside this framework
      ii) municipality budgets are seemingly not yet being systematically reviewed or used by MOLG for
          funds allocation
     These are more appropriately addressed under the follow up MDP 1, however.

 Annex 2-b), Sector Indicators, shows that the achievement of sector objectives was Moderately
     Satisfactory (MS).
     The key targets (new rules based formula and system institutionalized, and Equalization Grant System
     institutionalized) were met, but there were some problems with the public disclosure of budgets. Only
     54 (of the target of 90 percent) percent were apparently disclosed, underperforming expectations and
     hence the MS rating on this item.
 Annex 2-c), Outputs by Component, shows the physical outputs with respect to infrastructure and other
     works; the achievements of employment objectives and beneficiary satisfaction, and the relative lack
     of achievement with respect to the pilots. Overall achievement is rated Satisfactory (S) despite
     problems with the pilots which were rated MU, here and throughout the entire implementation period
     based on the ISRs. The achievements with respect to beneficiary satisfaction, employment generation,
     and infrastructure rehabilitation were all satisfactory. Significant repair and improvements were made
     to roads, solid waste services, electricity services, water supply networks, and public facilities—as
     shown in this annex, and evidenced by in distribution of expenditure shown annexes 2d-i.
     Annexes 2-d-i) indicate the distribution of Bank funding by sector and governorate, and shows where
      the Bank funding went and for what. They also highlight the differences in the structure of
      expenditure between West Bank and Gaza, and between the original and additional funding.

Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project was prepared quickly (within 4 months) during the second half of 2006. In spite of the
emergency situation and the very difficult conditions on the ground, the Bank was able to respond
because of its deep sector knowledge, and because its ability to draw on the recently completed EMSRP I.
Importantly, it was also able to use ongoing preparatory work from the planned project--the Municipal
Management and Service Delivery Project (MMSDP) which was cancelled at the request of the PA-- and
sector knowledge used as a base for preparing EMSRP II. 14 Based on this, EMSRP II was able to include
institutional measures to a greater extent than what would normally be seen for an emergency operation,
14
  The TA is not specific on the preparation status of MMSDP at the time of EMSRP II appraisal, or on which
components of MMSDP were included in EMSRP II.

balancing crisis response with the strengthening of institutional capacity. The October 2007 evaluation by
QAG (discussed in Section 5) also rated the QAE satisfactory.
The project was relatively well prepared, and the potential impact of the Trust Fund for Gaza and the
West Bank (TFGWB) was significantly increased by the Bank leveraging other donor’s funds for the
project. The balance between crisis response and institutional reform was appropriate, well thought out,
and well structured. Key reforms related to rationalization of the overall sector funds allocation system,
and the timely submission of budgets was a condition of funding, reinforcing what municipalities were
already required to do by law. Linking of access to funds with non-onerous reforms was a good tactic in a
context where the municipalities were in desperate need for funds. The risks were appropriately identified
and assessed as high, and appropriate mitigation measures set in place by: i) focusing on rehabilitation
and activities where the stock of required materials was at hand thus limiting the risk of materials
shortages; ii) decentralizing sub-project preparation, procurement and monitoring thus limiting the risk of
approvals bottlenecks; iii) utilizing an implementing agency that was seen as relatively neutral and
increasingly competent; and v) mobilizing donor participation thus sharing the risks and increasing the
pool of available funds. The design of the electricity metering pilot was based on prior successful piloting
of the approach at Jerusalem District Electric Utility Company. This sub-component had substantial
potential to solve a major issue of arrears by Palestinian households that the PA had to cover to the Israel
Electricity Company, constituting the second largest PA expenditure after the wage bill.15
The project built effectively on lessons learned, primarily from EMSRP I. These may be summarized as
follows:
    Focus on fewer LGUs (132 instead of 400) in order to improve impact.
    Decentralize to the extent possible to ensure ownership and relevance to local needs.
    Be flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively to problems as well as opportunities arising
     during implementation—reflected inter alia in the demand-driven approach and a willingness to
     readjust Bank funding allocation to accommodate the preferences of other donors as noted in the
     March 2008 Mid Term Review (MTR)
    Continue to build the existing implementing agency (MDLF) technical and managerial capacity that
     operates effectively even in the extremely complex political and security environment and is able to
     attract wide donor support.
In addition, the experience of the earlier project pointed to the continued need to rationalize the allocation
of funds from central to local governments,16 and to improve accountability at both central and local
levels—a task partly assumed by EMSRP II. (See Annexes 2 and 10 for details.)
A number of aspects of the project could have been improved, however: First, while the sector and
institutional development objectives of the project were obvious and had been clearly specified as such in
EMSRP I, they were not so specified in EMSRP II, and there were divergent statements of the PDO in the
TA (TA) and Grant Agreement. This led to some ambiguity in defining indicators (see review of
Objectives and Indicators in Annex 2, and Annex 10 for comparison with EMSRP I).17 Second, the output
indicators were not well specified; there were too many to be practically monitored, and too many that
were unquantifiable. The latter shortcoming was largely but not completely corrected by a major revision
of the indicators during the March 2008 Mid-Term review (see Annex 2). Third, there was ambiguity
concerning the number and timing of the required beneficiary impact assessments (BIAs)—see Section
2.3. Fourth, while the idea of including pilots was not necessarily a bad one even in an emergency
15
   This partly explains the inclusion of the pre-paid metering pilot. However, the Palestinian Energy Authority took
over the initiative just prior to EMSRP II approval.
16
   Data on the nature and volume of these intergovernmental transfers were not provided in the appraisal document,
and were not available at the time of writing this ICR.
17
   There were significant differences re indicators between the text of the TA and the Indicator Annex (3) of this
document. There were also differences with the ISRs.

                                                         25
project, it is not clear that there was strong ownership for them or that the mechanisms for preparation and
implementation were adequately thought through. The second pilot (municipality/NGO cooperation) was
also inadequately specified—i.e., what precisely were the expected achievements. These problems are
minor shortcomings from the overall quality at entry; but given the robustness of the design and the
rapidity of project preparation under very challenging conditions, the ICR concurs with the QAG’s
Satisfactory rating.

Implementation
EMSRP II was never seriously at risk at any time though periodic delays were experienced. The project
was due to close in June 2009. However, as noted it was extended first to December 2009 to enable the
completion of the parking meter pilot, and later to June 2011 to enable the implementation of the
additional US$3 million funding for Gaza.
The project got off to a slow start in the first half of 2007. Implementation was severely hampered by
Israeli military restrictions on the movement of people and goods—particularly in and out of Gaza, but
also in the West Bank; and there were problems with oversight, by MDLF, of the LTC who were not
adequately fulfilling their roles in helping the municipalities to prepare proposals, and in subsequently
monitoring project implementation. In addition, there were staffing problems at MDLF, including low
procurement capacity and ability to manage the LTCs. Also, there were delays due to a contractors’ strike
occasioned by a depreciation of the US dollar and its negative impact on construction costs. Further, the
first pilot had to be replaced early on (apparently during the first year, but not formally until October
2008—see section 3.2).
Many of the managerial and contractual issues were addressed by 2008 (as confirmed by the MTR and
the Implementation Status and Results report (ISRs)), and considerable improvements were noted in the
performance of municipalities and MDLF. Improvements were due partly to the recruitment of key
procurement and managerial staff by MDLF, a change in LTC recruitment process, and learning by all
parties. With respect to MDLF’s own performance, they established a comprehensive project database
and an effective financial management, monitoring and reporting system—both well respected and relied
upon by donors and the Bank for their own reporting. MDLF also addressed the contractor issue by
persuading municipalities to fund the resulting cost escalation from their own resources. Further, the
March 2008 mid-term review was instrumental in helping to correct several shortcomings in the M&E
framework (see Section 2.1 and Annex 2). However, in December 2008 the Israelis attacked Gaza
militarily, severely disrupting project operations, physically devastating several neighborhoods, and
making an already very difficult situation far worse. As indicated above, the Bank and other donors
responded quickly to the new crisis by providing additional funds to help keep essential infrastructure and
services in Gaza functioning—even if at a minimal level. MDLF also strengthened their staffing and
stepped up their operations there. Importantly, the close supervision by the Bank team based in WBG, and
effort by the MDLF to improve its performance meant that disbursements could quickly be put back on
track, a major objective in this type of emergency operation, targeting quick disbursements to mitigate
deterioration of services (see Annex 1(i)). Despite the many obstacles, the MDLF, with strong support
from the Bank, was largely able to complete the original project by December 2009, and the additional
activities as planned by June 2011.
With regard to the municipal infrastructure and services improvements, 18 of the total original funding for
infrastructure, services and job creation (US$9.71m—see Annex 2(d-i)), on the West Bank 43 percent
went to road rehabilitation, 12, 11, and 10 percent respectively went to improvements to public facilities,
electricity, and solid waste, and 18 percent to a mixture of other infrastructure and services improvements.
The improvements were widely distributed across 11 West Bank governorates. With respect to Gaza,

18
 Due to the nature of the conflict, (e.g. destruction of infrastructure at various points before and during project), specific figures
on service delivery levels are unavailable.

                                                                  26
solid waste and roads accounted for 26 and 20 percent respectively of the infrastructure and services
expenditures, and 41 percent going a mix of other infrastructure and services expenditures. Overall, the
largest share of expenditures (35 percent) from the original grant went to road improvements, followed by
miscellaneous other municipal improvements (25 percent) and solid waste (15 percent). These
expenditures were widely distributed across the 5 main Gaza governorates. With regard to the additional
US$3m, it all went to Gaza to help address the damage due to the Israeli incursions under their operation
“Cast Lead? beginning in December 2008. Of the infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement funds
(US$2.27m), 45 percent went to solid waste, 11 percent to roads, 5 percent to sewage, 2 percent each to
roads and water supplies, and 31 percent to a mix of other municipal improvements. Again, these
expenditures were widely distributed across the 5 main Gaza governorates. Discussions with the
municipalities during the preparation of this ICR indicated that these improvements helped considerably
in improving the physical conditions in WBG (confirmed by the BIA), and that the improvements were
especially welcomed by the smaller municipalities which tended to be neglected or overlooked in the past.
Further, in several cases, these (along with allied donor funding—see Annex 1) were the only
rehabilitation funds available to municipalities.

Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO was achieved with minor shortcomings and is rated Satisfactory (S). EMSRP II helped lay the
foundation for the major on-going policy and strategic shift under MDP I, from a succession of largely
uncoordinated individual donor-supported initiatives, to a more sustainable nationally-led long term
programmatic approach (see description at Annex 10). The project had three objectives, which are
weighed in this analysis according to both the importance to respond to the emergency situation, emphasis
in PRDP and Interim Strategy and the funds allocated to the activities measured by each sub-PDO. The
first two were clearly the primary objectives-- as reflected in their status in the ISRs.
The first sub-objective of providing assistance for mitigating further deterioration in the delivery of
essential municipal services in the West Bank and Gaza was achieved with minor shortcomings. The
majority of project funds were used to this end, with US$7.8M disbursed under Component 1, or 67
percent of project funds. As noted in Annex 2, the project financed works in a number of sectors under
municipal responsibility and also funded non-wage recurrent expenditure to keep services operational.
The latter was critical in keeping key services going, particularly in Gaza, and preventing further
deterioration in service delivery, based on locally determined priorities. The resources provided by the
Bank, plus the additional funds leveraged, directly or indirectly benefited the 70 percent of the WBG
population living in the 132 municipalities targeted. Importantly, the indicator on beneficiary satisfaction
was achieved, with 81 percent of the target population reporting and they are satisfied or very satisfied
and the same percentage reporting high relevance. The strong ownership of investments was underscored
by the municipalities providing additional funds to meet the financing gap following cost increases.
Further, the Bank was able to leverage rather modest funds (US$10m initially) to mobilize an additional
US$32m (plus subsequently US$27m additional), and these funds were what made it possible to institute
a transparent, fair and rules-based transfer system. Achievement of the outcome indicator was a result
largely attributable to the Bank’s intervention and coordination effort. The role of EMSRP II in laying the
foundation for the major policy shifts under the successor MDP I (see Section 2.5 above and Annex 10),
as well as in promoting greatly increased donor cooperation should be recognized as a major
achievement, in a context of weak institutional capacity. The submission of executed and planned
municipal budget reports to MOLG was achieved as a result of this being a criteria to access funds, and
this in itself is a result at the institutional level attributable to the project. However, the indicator of
public disclosure of municipal budgets was only partially (56 percent disclosed versus a target of 90
percent) achieved, and only 46 percent of beneficiaries reported that the municipality was transparent in
its disclosures.

                                                    27
Sub-objective 2 was supported by Component 2, and the creation of temporary job opportunities at the
local level was fully achieved, with 167,000 person-days of employment created against a target of
140,000. The BIA indicated that most beneficiaries (95 percent) had a positive or very positive view of
the program. About US3.1 million was spent on this component, or 25 percent of project expenditures.
This also helped the project to achieve the outcome indicator of assuring an equalization effect. The
transfer allocation system formula has an element of equalization in that it uses population and need
(employment) as part of the formula.
The third sub-objective of promoting pilot initiatives that foster collaboration among local governments
and NGOs and promote municipal cost recovery was only partially achieved. The pilot which sought to
explore the possibilities for improving municipal service cost recovery through the introduction of pre-
paid electric metering systems as previously noted was replaced by a parking meter scheme. The second
sought to test the possibilities for leveraging partnerships with local NGOs to deliver services more
effectively. Results from the parking meter pilot have so far been inconclusive, but should still be seen as
a worthwhile effort to promote cost recovery and should yield dividends in the future. The meters have
been installed however there are issues with enforcement. The second pilot was also only partially
successful. Ten pilots were implemented including a successful community center operation developed in
one municipality in Gaza;19 a women’s training center constructed in Ajanta municipality in the southern
West Bank that is operating satisfactorily; and a park and community center developed in Bait Shout
municipality, also in the southern West Bank. The total number of beneficiaries from the NGO sub-
projects was 22,180 in the West Bank and 18,387 in Gaza. However, the partnership process between the
municipality and the local NGO was fairly mechanical, with the municipality simply constructing the
building and handing it over to the NGO for operations. On both counts the pilots were only partially
successful, but yielded useful lessons on the advisability of including such components without very clear
links to core project objectives or strong local ownership.
Overall, despite shortcomings the project responded well to the emergency situation, and with the rather
limited funds (US$13 M total) was able to achieve results both in terms of mitigating the immediate
impact of the crisis in terms of service delivery and employment generation, while laying the institutional
foundations for continued improvement in these areas and in intergovernmental transfers. The pilots were
less successful, but still provided valuable lessons learned in return for limited investments. In addition
(and importantly), the quantifiable project investments yielded highly positive economic rates of return
and the non-quantifiable infrastructure maintenance and job creation efforts were relatively efficient (see
Section 3.3 below). Further, the two primary objectives of the project (accounting for some 85 percent of
expenditures and directly addressing the emergency) were significantly achieved. Further, as noted in
Section 2.1, the funds greatly benefitted many smaller municipalities that were often neglected or by-
passed and were of then the only rehabilitation funds available. The above, taken together, justifies the
Satisfactory rating above.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Considering that EMSRP II was an emergency operation, no cost benefit analysis was conducted during
project design. As such, there are no estimates of either the expected ERRs or NPVs for any of the
investments executed by this project. Therefore, no comparison could be made between the expected and
the actual results of EMSRP II’s main investments. In practice, however, the value added of this analysis
is that it confirms the economic viability of the executed investments and offers subsequent operations a
reference point regarding actual ERRs and NPVs that could be used to judge the economic merits of
future operations supporting similar types of investments.
Summary of the Actual Use of Funds by EMSRP II
The original trust fund grant for EMSRP II was US$10 million, which subsequently was granted an
additional amount of US$3 million, as illustrated in Table 1 below. Out of the US$13 million only about
US$2.8 million, worth of public works and equipment, constituted the actual project investment, which is
the object of cost-benefit analysis in this Annex. The rest of the funds, due to the emergency nature of this
project, were primarily allocated to incremental recurrent expenditures in support of operations,
maintenance and repairs, which are not subject to cost-benefit analysis of ERR and NPV, but are
evaluated in terms of cost efficiency. Finally, the efficiency of employment generation is evaluated
following the methodology laid out in the TA, namely the number of man-days of work created per dollar
spent.

The number of subprojects covered 132 municipalities in about six different sectors, and considering this
situation the economic analysis focuses on those sectors that absorbed most of EMSRP II’s financial
resources, and cost-benefit analysis is carried out on those resources that was allocated to public “Works?
(Component 1a), including some specific types of equipment. As illustrated in Table 2 below, the main
sectors that benefit from EMSRP funds were in roads (29.68%), solid waste collection (22.07%), and
public facilities (7.68%). These three sectors as a whole benefited from more than half (about 59%) of the
total disbursements for both recurrent and capital expenditures.
It should be noted that the investments by sector are much smaller than the actual disbursement for each
of these sectors, considering that a significant proportion of these resources were by design allocated to
the financing of non-wage recurrent expenditures (budgetary support), such as operations, maintenance
(O&M) and reconstruction costs. Only about 22% (US$2.8 million) of EMSRP II’s financial resources
were allocated to investments that could, at least in principle, be suitable to cost benefit analysis. Most of
the funds (78%), were allocated across the 132 municipalities and the six sectors to a multiple number of
fairly small sub-projects (i.e., 626 sub-projects in about 400 locations).

Therefore, the cost-benefit analysis focuses only on the main investments in urban infrastructure and
municipal services; for which their benefits are quantifiable and the required data was available to apply
the respective methodologies. The dollar amounts of such investments are as follows: (i) Roads
rehabilitation and reconstruction (US$1.5 million), (ii) solid waste collection equipment (US$144
thousand) and (iii) municipal buildings (US$517 thousand).
EMSRP II’S Main Benefits
The main benefits of the project were the restoration of basic local infrastructure and essential municipal
services including: Roads, water supply, sanitation service, solid waste collection, and electricity
distribution, among others. The improvements of service quality and coverage, particularly in sanitary
conditions including waste collection, have apparently contributed in reducing health risks. However,
there was no empirical data available to support this argument. In addition, as part of the objective of
creating temporary job opportunities MDRP II channeled an important part of its resources (about US$3.1
million) to those communities with higher indices of poverty and unemployment rates in order to support
them in carrying out small public works in multiple economic sectors. During the project, the total
number of persons-days paid was about 167,533 in subprojects characterized by being labor intensive. In
these cases the measurement of benefits is primarily done in terms of the number of man-days of
temporary work created per dollar spent. Also, considering that the Project was to support demand-driven
subprojects based on community initiatives, there were no specific baseline indicators to measure physical
achievements. Nevertheless, the different subprojects that were approved and implemented were subject
to a positive list. The section below focuses on those subprojects for which the application of standard
cost-benefit analysis was possible, with the analysis of cost-efficiency further below, and analysis of
employment generation at the end of this Annex.

Roads Rehabilitation
Costs: EMSRP II invested about $1.5 million in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads in 132
municipalities across both the West Bank and Gaza. The cost-benefit analysis was carried out comparing
the situation of roads “with? and “without? the project, in order to determine the net effect, among others
aspects, on the net expenditure needed for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of rehabilitated roads.
The analysis applied the standard average for O&M cost, which is 10% of the capital value.
Benefits: The main direct benefits of roads are primarily reflected in savings in transportation time, and
savings in vehicles maintenance cost. Additionally, indirect benefits are due to the appreciation in market
values of those real estate properties adjacent to the rehabilitated roads.
Methodology: Considering that most of the investments were relatively small and spread over 132
municipalities, the calculation of total benefits is based on the aggregated benefits of all the subprojects in
terms of savings in both transportation time, and vehicles maintenance costs.
Time-Savings: In order to estimate time-savings, the quantification of three basic variables was needed,
as it is briefly described below:


                                                           40
  (i)    Relevant number of vehicles: The number of motor-vehicles that operate in the 132
         municipalities (in which PMSRP II did road rehabilitation and reconstruction) was determined
         based on the information provided by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) on
         number of vehicles in West Bank and Gaza. This total amount of vehicles was adjusted
         downwards by the proportion of vehicles that actually use the rehabilitated roads in the average
         municipality.
 (ii)    Relevant number of Passengers: In order to estimate the number of passengers associated
         with the rehabilitated roads a distinction was made of the different type of vehicles that benefit
         from these roads. The typical mix of vehicles includes: Public buses, private vehicles, taxis,
         commercial vehicles, trucks, and motorcycles. Each of these types of vehicles is associated with
         a certain number of passengers, which allowed for the calculation (in Table 3) of the relevant
         number of passengers.
 (iii)   Duration of the average road trip: The methodology, in this particular case, took into account
         the duration of the average road trip “without? and “with? the project in order to estimate the
         total savings attributable to these subprojects. The result was in turn adjusted by the proportion
         of the average duration of a trip that is actually affected by the rehabilitation.

Savings in the Cost of Maintenance: The calculation was based on an estimate of the average yearly
expenditure in maintenance, adjusted by the estimated proportion in which the typical rehabilitation is
expected to contribute to a reduction in maintenance’s yearly expenditures. The relevant number of

illustrates the calculations made to estimate both time savings and maintenance cost savings.

Assumptions: Considering that there are no technical studies available in WBG on passengers per vehicle
and the proportions of different types of motor-vehicles, the methodology assumed that such proportions
as well as the average number of passengers per vehicle are similar to those in other countries in the
MENA region. Furthermore, it was assumed that most of the rehabilitations and reconstructions were
carried out on the main municipal roads.
Roads: Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV)
The economic analysis of the investment of US$1.5 million on rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads
indicates that the ERR is about 25.8%, and the Net Present Value (NPV) is approximately US$880
thousand (Table 5). This result supports the economic viability of the public works on roads.
Furthermore, if the net benefits had been lower in 25%, as compared to the base case, under that scenario
the ERR would have been 12.4% which, still, would had been economically acceptable (Table 6). Lastly,
considering the long term durability of this type of infrastructure, as well as the O&M expenditures
“without? and “with? the project, it is estimated that there will be no immediate net fiscal impact beyond
the standard (O&M) cost.

Solid Waste Collection and Equipment
Cost: EMSRP II invested US$144,500 (as part of Component 1a) in the rehabilitation and expansion of
solid waste collection services benefiting residents in both the West Bank and Gaza. In order to determine
the total net cost of this type of investment, the analysis took into account the required expenditure for
operation and maintenance (O&M) of roads “with? and “without? the project. The estimated average cost
of O&M is 7% of the investment value, while the replacement cost of the equipment has been computed
using the standard of 10%.
Benefits: The main direct economic benefits come from two sources: One, the incremental net revenue
from higher fees, due to service improvements; and the other, the additional or new revenue, because of
the expansion of the service coverage benefiting new subscribers. It is important to note that there are also
some specific indirect benefits, such as the positive impacts on both environmental protection and
sanitation conditions; which reduce human health hazards.
Methodology: The quantification of net economic benefits focuses only on the incremental net revenue
from higher fees due to service improvements and to enhance cost recovery; together with the additional
net revenue from the expansion of service’s coverage to new subscribers. It should be noted that no
attempt was made to measure indirect benefits due to the unavailability of data to offer specific estimates
on the positive impact on environmental protection and human health.
Incremental Net Revenue: Due to service improvements “with? the project, additional revenue from
better collection efficiency and new fees was estimated at 30% with respect to the scenario “without? the
Project. This figure was calculated for the aggregate of the sub-projects in solid waste collection. The
average subproject includes improvements in fee collection primarily supported by the acquisition of
additional community containers, as well as the replacement of the old units -- those that were practically
obsolete.
Expansion of Service Coverage: in order to expand the service to new subscribers additional containers
were installed in specific communities. The net revenue impact of these investments has been examined
and it is estimated at 20% greater in relation to the situation “without? the Project. This result, similarly to
roads, refers to the average subproject (i.e. the consolidated of all the subprojects in solid waste
collection).
Solid Waste collection: Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV): The total
investment in improvements to solid waste collection amounts to approximately US$144 thousand, and it
yields a NPV of about US$300 thousand. This result is consistent with the average ERR for the sector,
which is about 37.8% (Table 7). This is a fairly robust indicator of the economic merits of investments in
solid waste collection. The sensitivity analysis, under the assumption that net benefits had been lower in
25%, indicates that the ERR would have dropped to 11.1% (Table 8), which would have also been
economically acceptable, considering an opportunity cost of capital of 10%. On the fiscal side,
considering the life expectancy of the solid waste containers, and the improvements in revenue collection
in this service, it is estimated that there will be no net fiscal impact on O&M of this revenue-generating
service in the short term. It will depend on the sustainability on the current revenue collection effort.

Municipal Buildings
Costs: EMSRP II invested $517.6 thousand in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of municipal
buildings in both the West Bank and Gaza. In order to compute the net cost in O&M the analysis
examined the actual and required expenditure for operation and maintenance of municipal buildings
“with? and “without? the project. O&M was estimated at 7% of the invested capital.
Benefits: The criteria to estimate economic net benefits are based on the actual yearly savings in
expenditures in rent per square meter of office space currently being used for municipal operations. It is
estimated that about 3,958 sqm of office space were rehabilitated. Indirect benefits may include
productivity increases in both the municipal administration and in the services the municipality provides
to the private sector.
Methodology: In order to determine the net economic costs and benefits the methodology analyzed the
situation “with? and “without? the project. The monthly savings in rent per sqm were estimated at
US$2.00 for the average subproject.
Municipal Buildings: Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV): The results for
the reconstruction and rehabilitation of public buildings, which is worth about half a million dollars
(US$517 thousand) yields an ERR of 14.8% and a NPV of US$95 thousand (Table 9). These two
indicators support the economic justification of the rehabilitation of this type of municipal fixed assets.
Additionally, under the conservative scenario that net benefits had been lower in 25%; the ERR would
have been 11.7% (Table 10), which still would have been acceptable considering that it is greater that the
opportunity cost of capital (i.e., 10%). Last, the net fiscal impact of the rehabilitation of municipal
buildings is positive, considering that it generates savings in the operating budget in rent for office space,
as well as in buildings’ recurrent expenditures in physical maintenance and repairs.

Other Sectors
In contrast to the capital expenditures analyzed above, electricity, water and sewer systems comprised the
sectors with the smallest investments (13 percent of disbursements went to these sectors). The analysis of
the public works in these three sectors reveals that financial resources were allocated to maintenance of
specific segments in the water, electricity and sewer networks; which is estimated to be more cost-
efficient than reinvesting in new networks. Also, the analysis of the situations "with" and "without" the
sub-projects indicates that the public works referred to sub-projects on the old networks, which did not
add new beneficiaries. This is also the case for the part of disbursements in road rehabilitation, solid
waste management, and public facilities, which did not go towards capital expenditures. Considering
these findings it was deemed more suitable to apply cost-efficiency methods for the assessment of the
economic merits of the expenditures in maintenance, spare parts, and repairs (constituting US$6.3m of
total disbursements). It was verified that MDLF's procurement system did in fact systematically request
price quotations, as part of established selection procedures, for ensuring low maintenance costs, and still
ensuring the compliance with minimum acceptable technical specifications. Consequently, it may be
considered that the execution of expenditures in these sectors in maintenance, spare part and repairs met
cost-efficiency standards.

Employment Generation
In the case of labor-intensive employment generation sub-projects financed under Component 2, least cost
methodologies cannot be applied since the emphasis on labor intensity would preclude using capital
intensive approaches that may in some cases be less expensive. In such cases, any assets developed under
the sub-projects would be considered a positive spillover benefit. As such, measurement of actual
economic benefits focuses on the number of man-days of work created under this component per dollar
spent, as foreseen in the TA. The results under this component, with 167,533 person-days of employment
generated for an investment of US$3.1m shows that labor content (wages as percentage of investments)
was higher than expected at appraisal, at 69.58 percent against 50 percent in the TA. Direct temporary
employment of 167,533 person-days was created with US$12.59 spent per person-day, which is more
efficient than the US$15 per person-day expected in the TA. In conclusion, employment generation as
actually experienced under the project was more efficient than what was foreseen at appraisal.

Annex 5. Summary of Beneficiary Survey Results

I.     Introduction

The Beneficiary Survey was undertaken in September 2009 by consultants contracted by MDLF. Its
objectives were to:
i)        Assess the activities delivered vis-a-vis its intended objectives
ii)       Assess the perception of beneficiaries on actual activities vis-a-vis intended objectives
iii)      Assess the relation with and performance of the Local Technical consultants hired by MDLF to
          support municipalities during the projects
iv)       Compare actual activities vis-a-vis intended objectives and original performance indicators
v)        Produce lessons learnt and recommendations for future programs
The survey targeted direct beneficiaries, focusing on Component 1 (Infrastructure Development) and
Component 2 (Job Creation). A total of 737 individuals were interviewed for the EMSRPII survey
specifically, covering: 614 beneficiaries; 62 municipal staff; 15 NGO personnel; 46 citizens from pilot
municipalities, as shown in the table below. (See Appendix 1 for details.)

II. Beneficiary Perceptions

Component 1: Infrastructure

Satisfaction with Assistance in Infrastructure Development
   Of those beneficiaries who received assistance in infrastructure development, slightly less than half
    (48%) indicated that they are satisfied; one-third (33.2%) indicated that they are very satisfied, 13.3%
    are not satisfied, and 4.9% are not satisfied at all.
   Of 85 beneficiaries in infrastructure development who indicated that they are not satisfied or not
    satisfied at all, reasons cited for dissatisfaction included:
   Destruction of adjacent agricultural lands, bad smells, polluting water, flies and mosquitoes, very
    close to residential areas and mosques and parks (17.6%)
   Project doesn't cover all areas that require assistance (11.8%)

                                                     51
   Noise and dust (10.6%)
   The time it took to complete the project was very long (10.6%)
   Tarring was not completed properly: it did not cover all areas and wrong type of pavement was used
    (9.4%)
   There is a need for other projects and services i.e. there are more important needs (4.7%)
   Bad administration and absence of supervisors (4.7%)


Relevance
   Of those beneficiaries who benefited from infrastructure development, the clear majority (80.5%)
    specified that the project was very relevant to their community's needs, 13.1% specified slightly
    relevant and 3.3% sad that it was not relevant.

    o There are more important projects, what was done was not relevant, a sanitation network would
        have been more relevant (6.7%)
    o It does not meet the needs of the area; it only targets roads and deprived areas (6.7%)
    o Roads are narrow and have not been fixed in the required ways (need wider roads) so there are
        many accidents (5.3%)

    through their municipality, who advertised the project; 3.5% through family members and 3.5%
    through newspaper adverts.
Selection
   41.1% of the beneficiaries in job creation indicated that workers were selected by the Municipality,
    and that this form of selection included a training program and exam.
   A further 14.9% indicated that to the best of their knowledge, the selection of workers was based on
    the fact that the worker had to be unemployed; hold a high-school leaving certificate and suffer from
    dire economic conditions. 9.9% indicated that the selected worker must be married, unemployed and

         program as being good, and 45.5% described it as being very good. 96.5% of beneficiaries in job
         creation specified that they would be interested in participating in a repeat of the program.
    iv) A clear majority of beneficiaries (88.8%) did not participate in project selection, but close to two-
         thirds of all beneficiaries (62.5%) indicated that they are satisfied with the method in which the
         project was implemented.
    v) Recommendations included better informing community members about the project before
         planning and taking their needs into account; providing longer periods of employment; and
         ensuring better project administration and implementation.
    vi) Another lesson learnt, is that more than half of all municipal employees (53.2%) are satisfied with
         consultancy assistance provided to municipality in planning projects.
    vii) More than half of all municipal employees (56.5%) would prefer working with consultants as
         opposed to working with MDLF directly.
    viii)         To ensure project flexibility and responsiveness to different community needs and to
         circumvent prevailing mobility restrictions, the design of EMSRP II retains the demand-driven
         arrangement and decentralized implementation approach of its predecessor, whereby local
         governments, in consultation with their communities would determine their own emergency
         assistance priorities and would implement projects at the local level, including preparation of
         emergency programs, tendering, contracting and supervising implementation, under the guidance
         of the MDLF.
    ix) On the NGO level, all 15 NGO personnel indicated that they did have a role in determining the
         nature of the project. Twelve out of 15 NGO personnel (73.3%) are very satisfied with their role.
         This is very encouraging and gives the stakeholders and the designers of future projects some
         hope to continue to build such projects.
    x) The future outlook was represented in initiatives adopted through LGU-NGO collaboration. This
         relationship is still at an infant stage: NGOs are occasionally reluctant to be immersed into
         volatile relationships with the government on the local and national levels.
    xi) However, municipalities appear to be flexible, and will take advantage of any type of cooperation
         that might help them recover some of the costs for the services they provide. Today,
         municipalities are taking very serious measures for financial sustainability and steadfastness.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

In 2007 The World Bank (WB) and the Government of Netherlands represented by the Netherlands
Representative Office (NRO) in the WBG contributed with a grant of an amount of US$10 million and
US$ 6.17 million respectively to provide emergency assistance to the Palestinian LGUs. The financed
program is called the second phase of the Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP
II) under which the beneficiaries are the municipalities in West Bank and Gaza. Both the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the German Development Bank (KFW)
decided to contribute for the year 2008 by US$5.0 million and Euros 15 million respectively. In year 2009
SIDA, the World Bank agreed to contribute additional funding of 6 million US$ (3 US$ million each).
Danida joined the agreement in 2010 with a contribution of 5.2 US$ million

The main project development objectives are to:
    1) Help mitigate further deterioration in the delivery of essential municipal services, including solid
         waste collection, provision of water, wastewater and electricity services (where such services are
         provided by municipalities), and street cleaning, among other services, through rehabilitation of
         damaged or deteriorating infrastructure and the provision of non-wage budgetary support for
         direct service cost inputs.
    2) Create temporary job opportunities at the local
         level through the launching of labor-intensive
         employment            generation       schemes,
         proportionally allocated on the basis of an
         unemployment index.
    3) Pilot innovative initiatives that foster Local
         Government-NGO collaboration in response to
         urgent     community        needs  and     assist
         municipalities in recovering costs for the
         provision of services.
Based on the findings of final review of the First
Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP I) done by the World Bank (WB) and the
MDLF, it was noted that the project scope was too broad,
aiming at addressing over 400 localities, thus spreading too
thinly limited resources while limiting the Project’s impact.
The lessons learned have been incorporated into the proposed
project’s design, as EMSRP II would be targeting only the
132 municipal areas, while other Bank interventions
(particularly the Integrated Community Development


                                                    64
Project) would aim to target refugee camps and smaller village councils and communities.

EMSRP II project components:
Component 1: Emergency Municipal Services Assistance Grants: This component would finance (a)
rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading of damaged municipal infrastructure and facilities, as well as
the supply of equipment to sustain municipal service provision, and (b) non-wage recurrent expenditures
as direct inputs to the provision of essential municipal services over a period of up to two years.
 Component 2: Labor-intensive Employment Generation: This sub-component would finance labor-
intensive temporary employment sub-projects that are identified and implemented by municipalities in
coordination with locally-based community groups.
Funds would be earmarked for municipalities on the basis of the unemployment index of the Governorate
in which they are located and then the total amount allocated for the governorate will be distributed based
on population among its municipalities. This allocation method would ensure that localities in greatest
need of assistance would be eligible to receive a greater share of resources.
Component 3: MDLF Innovation Window: This component is the third component of the EMSRP II
project supported by the WB and is divided into two sub-components:
Piloting pre-paid metering systems at municipalities:
This subcomponent was designed to install electricity
pre meters at no more than 3 pilot municipalities and
tested as a means of enabling municipalities to enhance
local revenue collection.
Piloting Local Government-NGO collaboration for
emergency and other joint programming purposes: This
pilot activity is being prepared in coordination with a
parallel World Bank-financed operation (NGO Project
III). The main aim of this pilot is to encourage greater
coordination and joint programming by local
governments and NGOs at the local level through the
requirement of a joint funding proposal. NGOs will be
financed under the NGO III Project, while municipalities will be financed under EMRSP II. This
component had financed physical rehabilitation and/or expansion of public facilities, parks and other
municipal-owned assets within which NGOs will provide programming for social activities for youth,
children, and women. Public awareness campaigns to promote water and energy conservation, public
health, and environmental management are proposals likely to receive support. The LGU component
would involve financing for small-scale civil works and goods not to exceed an aggregate value of
US$70,000 per subproject and would likely include playground and park rehabilitation, fencing, sports
facilities (soccer/basketball) and amenities to provide a platform for NGOs to organize community
activities for youth, children, women, etc.

Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
Regarding the implementation of the WB original fund, MDLF had approved 626 sub?projects under the 
components (1, 2 & 3) with an allocated amount of (US$ 9,099,570), where the implementation   was 
completed in Dec. 2009, despite facing many obstacles including the difficult security situation in Gaza, 
dollar  devaluation  and  prices  instability,  and  the  Palestinian  contractors  strike.  Given  that,  528  out  of 
626 sub?projects were funded by the World Bank and 98 out of 626 sub?projects were co?financed by 
the World Bank and Dutch. A breakdown of the sub?projects according to the funding source is provided 
in table 1:

In year 2009, in particular after the recent Israeli military attack from December 27, 2008 to January 18,
2009, the PNA has requested an additional financing from international partners for assistance to the
EMSRPII based on the Gaza early recovery and reconstruction plan as well as the Gaza municipal sector
assessment conducted by the MDLF. The World Bank agreed to contribute additional amount (US$ 3
million) to EMSRPII component 1. The agreements with the World Bank had been signed in July, 2009.
MDLF had approved 109 municipal sub-projects with  an  allocated  amount  of  (US$  2,790,000) 
distributed among Gaza municipalities where the implementation started in August 2009 and completed 
by end of June 2011. 
It should be noted that the additional financing (AF) for Gaza was designed to support incremental
operating costs to help municipalities in maintaining the basic municipal services from deteriorating as
any construction of new works would be subject to delays associated with the current constraints resulting
from Israeli’s policy restricting access. The access restrictions limit the availability of supplies and
construction materials and equipment.


Special notes about the implementation of EMSRPII in Gaza.
The progress in Gaza: was slower compared to the West Bank. The
situation in Gaza and in particular after the recent Israeli military
attack from December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009 in addition to the
chronic unavailability of construction materials caused by the Israeli
blockade, have badly affected the progress of infrastructure sub-
projects. Moreover, the shortage in fuel supply and spare parts is
delaying the budgetary support sub-projects.
During the implementation period of the project the environment in
Gaza was characterized by more restrictions on movement of people and goods from and into Gaza. The
Israeli Military continued to impose a high level of restrictions preventing the entrance of most basic
materials as well as the construction material into Gaza. These restrictions had affected the
municipalities’ activities and the implementation of EMSRPII's subproject leading to a clear delay in the
progress of the original fund sub-projects. Moreover, these restrictions and the closure of Gaza Strip

beginning of the program as one of the most urgent needed materials and was thought to be feasible to
implement.
Since the EMSRPII was designed as an emergency intervention, the MDLF in coordination with its
partners encouraged the municipalities to and assisted them in revisiting their priorities in order to come
up with more reasonable projects that could be implemented and at the same time enable the
municipalities to alleviate the continuation of burdens on the living conditions of the Gaza's population.

Assessment of Outcomes (Achievements against outcomes)
As mentioned previously, the main objectives of EMSRP II include: help mitigate further deterioration in
the delivery of essential municipal services, create temporary job opportunities at the local level, and pilot
innovative initiatives that foster Local Government-NGO collaboration in response to urgent community

needs and assist municipalities in recovering costs for the provision of services. These objectives
coincide with one of the major goals of the PRDP which is to increase national prosperity, and enhance
quality of life. In addition, the EMSRP II objectives fall within the second Strategic Theme of the MDLF
Strategic Plan “ Supporting and Enabling LGUs “.
The EMSRP II various activities have improved the ability of municipalities to provide better services to
their constituents. The outputs of the implemented projects will contribute in the improvement of basic
services and infrastructure. The following chart illustrates the achievements against the revised indicators
at different levels (output, outcomes, and sector related objectives).

                 support component to the recurrent municipal expenditures was 9.41% in average.




                                                                     70
2. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High
The risk to the Development Outcome is High given several critical factors :
        ? The project development objectives were too optimistic even though the project was designed
             under the emergency scheme. The outcome indicators had been revisited and revised during
             the MTR mission to cope with the situation and to come up with reasonable, realistic,
             measurable and achievable outcomes.
        ? The Israeli Military continued to impose a high level of restrictions preventing the entrance of
             most basic materials as well as the construction material into Gaza. Where the needs for
             budgetary support projects, spare parts,…etc. became more important than rehabilitation and
             construction projects.
        ? The municipal allocated amounts distributed among municipalities had affected the priorities
             of sub-projects selection using the funds for other than the intended purpose in some cases for
             small municipalities.
        ? The political situation and the financial crises in the municipalities after the formation of
             Hamas government wherein major donors suspended most of the financial aid earlier
             committed to WBG; guided the projects priorities of municipalities to cover their recurrent
             expenditure through the budgetary support component of EMSRPII.
        ? The dollar devaluation and the contractors strike affected the project implementation and
             leading to a clear delay in the progress.


3. Assessment of Bank Performance
    Bank
      The overall bank performance is rated satisfactory given that the following:
      ? The project was prepared and designed to respond on the emergency needs of the municipal
         sector within the environment to sharp declines in economic activity, high unemployment,
         deteriorating of municipal services and sharp decline in local government revenues. The
         project well balanced between emergency and medium term objectives, with practical
         consideration given to how to get things done".
      ? During the implementation, there was day-to-day follow up by the field based members,
         semiannual structured supervision missions were organized which featured team members
         from West Bank and Gaza and HQ. This ensured the mobilization of a multi-disciplined team
         much needed to oversee this project. Moreover, Safeguard policies were also monitored
         closely and were timely addressed. For example, procurement was constantly monitored with
         periodic post-reviews as part of the supervision missions' activities. Most importantly, there
         was a flexibility in doing such reallocation for the categories, and revision for the outcome
         indicators at the MTR mission to be more realistic, achievable and measurable.


4. Lessons Learned
      ? The fund transfer mechanism should be modified to reflect the objectives of the national
         government and the MDLF which is building the capacity of municipalities and improve their
         performance as the basic requirement for development. The recommended transfer
         mechanism should include incentives to reward better financial, planning and management
         practices in the municipalities.
      ? Based on the Paris Declaration (endorsed on March, 2005) it’s highly recommended to work
         with donors and relevant ministries to ensure the harmonization of the donors’ projects
         through coordination and continuous discussion among different parties. Working together

                                                    71
               will maximize the benefits and the impact of international support to the Palestinian
               community. The Palestinian National Plan (NDP) should serve as the guidance to all donors
               who are active in the local government sector.
       ?       Furthermore, donors shall coordinate their efforts with each other’s and with the Palestinian
               counter parts to eliminate funds earmarking so to achieve better impact and more transparent
               approach of allocations and have efficient implementation. The MDLF has been promoting
               the idea of pooling and having one basket of funds from all donors.
       ?       The MDLF should continue its approach in strengthening the municipalities’ institutions and
               improving their staff capacities through in job training and transfer of knowMDLF This will
               enable the municipalities to be efficient and sustained institution as well as better rank to the
               municipality toward the implementation of the MDLF’s transfer mechanism.


5. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

During the supervision missions of EMSRPII and during the Donors Consultation Forums, it was
commented by the financing partners and MDLF concerning the following:

           ?    Funds Allocation: The EMSRPII allocation was distributed among municipalities based on
                the population criteria causing the allocation to be small in certain cases which had limited
                measurable impacts. Moreover, it was highlighted to have performance based criteria along
                with population.
           ?    Donors Harmonization: In order to build on the experience of EMSRPII pooling, it was
                highlighted to have donors harmonization with development oriented scheme rather than
                emergency.
           ?    Needs for budgetary support / incremental: It was also highlighted by the WB to continue
                supporting the municipalities in Gaza with incremental investment to cover their needs for
                recurrent expenditure.
           ?    Procedures: It was highlighted by MDLF that the procedures and application forms which
                were used for EMSRPII were too detailed and beyond the technical capacity of smaller
                municipalities.

Annex 7. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

In addition to direct edits from the donors within the draft documents, the following more general
comments from KfW and the Danish International Development Assistance are included:

A. KFW Banken Gruppe (German Development Agency)
Thank you very much for providing us with a draft ICR for our comments. We have two comments on
the report,

We do not agree with the report's many references to donors perusing "parochial interests" that is
"attenuated" by the EMRSPII and efforts of the World Bank. The KfW and also other MDLF donors have
since long supported Palestinian national developmental goals/objectives and plans, and consider donors'
harmonization and alignment with PA systems as an essential element of reducing transaction cost for the
PA. Furthermore, the KfW funding for the MDLF is basically stemming from interest in supporting
national plans and national institutions.

We do not agree with depicting the MDLF as merely an implementing institution for donors funded
projects. The MDLF is a key national institution that implements national policies and strategies with the
aim of helping LGUs to improve quality of services and achieve sustainable development by inducing
national reforms, funded by international funding partners and PA own resources.

B. Danish International Development Assistance

I guess all financing partners strategies are aligned to this governance agenda…In general I believe the
very first paragraphs of Context etc. would benefit by strengthening the partnership and trust fund aspect
of this operation. When Denmark supports WB trust fund we do not prepare additional reporting to the
MFA as we normally consider WB reporting adequate. This means, however, that the WB reporting has
to be a little less WB and more Trust Fund and joint financing. A Trust Fund Arrangement is for
Denmark not only about financing.

Annex 9. Summary of Quality Assessment at Entry Review (QAE) by Quality Assurance Group
(This is based on the original QAE review undertaken in October 2007. )

Overall Judgment

1. Quality at Entry of this project was rated “Satisfactory? (2) overall, with Highly Satisfactory (1)
ratings for the critical categories of Strategic Relevance and Approach, Policy and Institutional Aspects,
and Bank Inputs and Processes. All other quality dimensions were rated Satisfactory (2).
2. An emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP1) was approved in 2002 against
the background of severe deterioration of social and economic conditions and public service delivery
services triggered by the Intifada. After satisfactory implementation of the project (2006) the Bank in
consultation with the client proposed a Municipal Management and Service Delivery Project (MMSDP)
for WBG. This was based on the assumption that, following a protracted period of instability and
uncertainty, there would be an opportunity to return to a medium-term development framework.
Unfortunately, further civil strife broke out in WBG, which required a change in strategy. To respond to
the crisis the Bank had to abandon the MMSDP and proposed a repeater EMSRPII (2006) project focused
on local municipal delivery service.
3. The panel found EMSRP II to be a well prepared operation, which was deemed highly appropriate for
the unique and difficult context of West Bank/Gaza. The team is to be congratulated on its ability to shift
quickly from a planned medium term urban renewal project to this emergency operation with its clear
focus on sustaining essential municipal services. Building effectively on EMSRP I and the work done on
the preparation of a conventional (as opposed to emergency) project, the project found an appropriate
balance between the pressing need for immediate financial support to ensuring critical urban services, and
the need for modest institution building support as a precursor to a future, conventional urban services
operation.

Strong Aspects

4. On the face of it, the project would seem to be over prepared and over documented for an emergency
operation (the environmental assessment work is an example), but this was the result of the advanced
preparation of a longer term, conventional project before changes in West Bank and Gaza forced a shift in
tactics, which the team was able to draw upon.
   Emergency operations are inherently short term in nature, but even so, the project did a good job of
    balancing immediate needs with longer term country strategic goals.
   The policy and political environments in WB/G are unique and difficult. The TT managed to find a
    way forward that took advantage of the capacity and strong ownership of the municipalities and at the
    same time maintained an appropriate level of accountability and flexibility. The focus on ensuring
    continued critical municipal services was the right focus in the highly charged WB/G environment.
   For an emergency operation, the project was exceptionally well grounded in country and sector
    knowledge.
   In an extremely complex logistical and political setting, the TT was extremely effective in getting a
    large number of donors to participate in the MDLF. The role of MDLF as vehicle for the transfer of
    funds and auditing results should be considered as best practice.
   Community participation and partnerships with local communities in planning, budgeting and pilot of
    local government-NGO collaboration are noteworthy. Budgets are being made public and service
    delivery surveys are being carried-out.



                                                    75
   The skill mix, continuity and experience combined with exemplary coordination between HQ and
    field staff produced excellent results with quick processing of the project. Strong presence on the
    ground played an important role.
   The relationship and mutual understanding between the different units of the Bank was very good and
    given the sensitivities of this project in a conflict area there was excellent support provided by
    Management and support units.
5. Even in the face of these strong points, the review panel did not necessarily see the project as a model
for other emergency operations. The unusual circumstances surrounding this case (a repeater project,
significant preparation work on a conventional project already completed, stronger than usual institutional
capacity) are unlikely to be present in other emergency operations.
Areas Needing Improvements
6. Given the conditions existing in Gaza, the panel was pleasantly surprised to find no significant
deficiencies that deserved highlighting in an emergency project.
Any Systemic Lessons
7. The panel has high praise for the focus and preparation of this operation, and deems it among the best
prepared emergency operations QAG has seen. However, it may be inappropriate to hold future
emergency operations to the preparation standards set by this project. Had the project team not been well
advanced in the preparation of a conventional urban services operation, we might have faulted the team
for doing too much when quick action was what was needed. Social and environmental safeguards that
apply to conventional operations need to be applied with great care and common sense to emergency
operations. However, since the team already had in hand most of the underpinnings for a conventional
project, it would have made no sense not to have used these materials in the preparation of this project.
8. As to broader lessons, the panel found the project design very well suited to the task at hand, but was
uncertain as to whether the lessons from this operation can be generalized beyond WBG. The Bank would
do well to follow this operation carefully, and to find ways to assess whether the model developed here—
the combination of a locally-managed municipal development fund and local implementation—is
applicable to other post conflict and difficult settings.
9. The panel also feels that the current QEA questionnaire format may not fully capture the unique and
often very complex situations that characterize crises such as violent conflicts, which may require
operational responses that are different than the ones the standard questionnaire is designed for. The panel
would suggest that QAG consider adjusting several of the questions and accompanying guidance in the
questionnaire, and/or adding other questions (such as the project's ability to respond to the specific
challenges of the emergency situation both in design and in institutional arrangements, its ability to be
guided by an understanding of the key aspects of the crisis situation, its ability to adapt and apply
operational lessons from similar circumstances, its ability to maintain sound institutional principles such
as accountability amidst an emergency, etc.).

E. Suggestions to the Task Team
In light of this assessment, list two or three factors that will require particular attention during the short-
medium term to improve the prospects for achieving the project’s development objectives and long-term
sustainability.

10. The team might consider strengthening emphasis on ex post physical audits of operations funded
under this project as a means on increasing local accountability. While emergency operations are
generally not places for experimentation and innovation, the special circumstances of WBG might make it
appropriate to consider ways of testing “payment for performance? as a means of holding local authorities


                                                      76
accountable for results. Increased accountability and transparency (wide distribution of the results of
audits) will help create demand for further institutional development in WBG.
