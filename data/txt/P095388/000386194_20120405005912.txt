Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective is to support efforts to deepen Tunisia's global integration and
enhance the capacity of Tunisian firms to exploit the opportunities offered by greater
integration. More specifically, the program supports: (a) reducing trade transaction costs
and deepening Tunisia's global integration; (b) further improving the business climate to
encourage private investment and facilitate business operations; and (c) strengthening the
financial sector to increase its capacity to finance investment.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.       The Tunisia Integration and Competitiveness Policy Loan (ICL) was a development
policy loan prepared during 2008 and approved in March 2009. The ICL supported the key
strategic elements of Tunisia’s 11th National Development Plan (2007-11), which sought to
strengthen growth and ensure that this growth is translated into employment. The ICL was a
cornerstone of the World Bank’s program in Tunisia 1 as outlined in the Country Assistance
Strategy (FY05-08) and the Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (2007) that set out an
indicative program for FY09-10, which included the ICL.

2.       The main thrust of the ICL was to continue growth-enhancing reforms anchored around a
deeper integration of Tunisia to the global economy. More urgently, the ICL was to assist the
Government in responding to the global financial crisis which was beginning to expose Tunisia’s
inherent macroeconomic vulnerability to growth in Europe. The development objectives of the
ICL as specified were: (i) to reduce trade transaction costs and deepen Tunisia’s global
integration; (ii) to improve further the business climate to enhance competitiveness of Tunisian
firms, including services and; (iii) to enhance the development of the financial sector to increase
its capacity to finance private investment.

3.       The ICL was organized in terms of the three broad development objectives, with specific
actions specified under each component. The ICL was a two tranche operation, with two equal
tranches: the first tranche was released upon effectiveness (August 2009) and the second tranche
upon the achievement of specified policy actions (December 2010). The program supported by
the ICL also benefited from support from the European Union (Euro 70 million) and the African
Development Bank ($250 million). The EU and AfDB support was provided in the form of
parallel financing but the EU and AfDB participated in the design of the operation and EU and
AfDB staff participated in the supervision of the ICL. The Bank together with the EU and AfDB
utilized the same program matrix, but selected somewhat different actions as the basis for release
of their financing. The programmatic content of the ICL drew heavily on previous World Bank
work analyzing constraints to Tunisia’s competitivity, notably the study Tunisia Global
Integration: A New Generation of Reforms to Support Employment (World Bank, 2008).

1.1     Context at Appraisal

4.       Since the 1970s, Tunisia had been pursuing an economic policy based on strict
macroeconomic discipline, characterized by modest fiscal and balance of payments deficits and
low rates of inflation, and partial economic liberalization through the creation of a liberalized
offshore export sector, while retaining a tightly controlled onshore sector devoted almost
exclusively to domestic consumption. This policy approach had been successful in promoting
relatively high rates of economic growth, with real growth on the order of 4-5 percent per year,
high rates of Foreign Direct Investment, equivalent to 3 percent of GDP during the period 2000-7,
and low rates of inflation.2 As a result of these policies, Tunisia’s GNI per capita had increased
to $2,659 per capita in 2007 (see table 1), implying an average annual growth rate of 3.2 percent
since 1961, and Tunisia was able to meet increasing proportions of its external financing
requirements through access to international financial markets.

which was approved in June 2005 and closed in June 2007.

  5.      However, by the middle of the first decade of the second millennium, in spite of the
  impressive improvements in living conditions, weaknesses associated with this approach were
  beginning to emerge, most notably the persistence of high rates of unemployment. In spite of
  high rates of economic growth the unemployment rate continued to hover around 14 percent of
  the labor force, with unemployment rates particularly high for the young (the unemployment rate
  for individuals aged 20-29 was about 27 percent) and those with a higher education degree (20
  percent).3 The persistence and structure of the unemployment reflected the confluence of several
  factors: demographic pressures, demand for largely unskilled, low-wage labor in the dynamic
  offshore sector, and low rates of growth and investment in the on-shore sector, which was
  constrained by a variety of anti-competitive practices.4

  6.      In effect, the Tunisian economic strategy had given rise to a dual economy with few
  linkages between the two: a vibrant offshore sector which was based on access to low-wage
  Tunisian labor and oriented primarily toward the European market, and a relatively stagnant
  onshore sector which was oriented primarily to the domestic market, sheltered from foreign
  competition and subject to a variety of economic controls. A key factor motivating the relatively
  intrusive Government role in the onshore sector, was the accumulation of rents by politically
  well-connected individuals who benefited from this system.

  7.      In addition to the structural pressures that were emerging from this development model,
  in 2008 Tunisia confronted a major economic management challenge which exacerbated the
  weaknesses in the existing developmental model. With economic growth declining in Europe,
  Tunisian exports were slowing down (real export growth of only just over 1 percent in 2008),
  leading to a deceleration in economic growth (only 4.5 percent in 2008).5 The 11th National
  Development Plan sought to address the structural weaknesses in the economy, by putting more

    Tunisian economic growth is highly correlated with a 1 percent change in European real growth

emphasis on increasing the competitiveness of the onshore sector and explicitly promoting
reduction in unemployment through increased competitiveness. At the same time, with FDI and
private capital flows declining, the Government renewed its interest in foreign official financing,
particularly in the form of fast-disbursing assistance.6 In addition, in 2009 Tunisia’s access to
international capital markets was essentially curtailed, making World Bank and other official
balance of payments financing more interesting.

8.       The confluence of these factors led then to a situation where the Government was more
willing to address sensitive policy areas with, in 2009, renewed interest in access to World Bank
fast-disbursing assistance. This provided an opportunity for the World Bank and the Government
to contemplate measures in sensitive policy areas, i.e., the constraints to competitivity in the
onshore sector, in the context of a new development policy operation. 7 However, there were
limits in terms of how sensitive issues could be addressed, which would need to be taken into
account in the design of the operation, particularly in areas such as financial sector reform and
elimination of anti-competitive practices. In such areas, reforms would have to be limited and
largely technical in nature, because of political sensitivities.

9.      The Bank agreed to proceed with the design of this operation, even taking into account
the restricted margin for maneuver in sensitive areas. There is no evidence that the Bank
considered not to do an operation, in lieu of accepting these constraints. This stance would not
have been inconsistent with the Bank’s policy during the period 2007-08, when the Bank
dialogue focused overtly on governance issues leading to a cooling in relations with the
Government, as reflected in the sharply lower lending levels cited above. Such a stance would
have had the advantage of consistency and arguably could have enhanced Bank credibility in the
post-Revolution period. However, taking such a stance would have foregone the opportunity to
promote useful economic reforms, however modest (see below), and would also have foregone
the opportunity to deepen ties with Tunisian government technicians, most of whom remained in
post after the political change and were the key interlocutors in the design of the follow-on
operation (see below), but also with representatives of civil society (in particular of business
groups) and with the other donors, which also remains an essential part of the Bank’s dialogue in
the country, even more so in the current context. On balance, the Bank engagement seemed to
generate more benefits to the country than the counterfactual with no operation, by supporting
gradual reforms in a context where consensus for big structural reforms was difficult. Based on
these considerations, the Bank’s decision to proceed with a new operation under these conditions
seems appropriate.

10.      Also, influencing the Bank’s approach was the assumption that the ICL DPL was
expected to be followed in two years by another DPL (ICL II), 8 allowing structural reforms
initiated under ICL I to be pursued in subsequent operations.

  Because of the more constrained access to international capital markets, the size of the project was
steadily scaled up during project preparation. From an original size of $50 million, the project was scaled
up to $150 million (the amount envisioned in the lending plan in the Country Assistance Strategy Progress
Report) and, at appraisal, the Government requested that the Bank increase the size of the ICL by another
$100 million to $250 million. The ICL was the first World Bank program assistance since 2005.
7
  As noted above, the previous World Bank fast-disbursing operation had been closed for two years and
during FY 06-08, Bank lending to Tunisia averaged less than $40 million per year and was exclusively in
the form of investment lending (Country Partnership Strategy, World Bank, 2009).

11.    On balance, the Bank’s decision to proceed, accepting that reforms in sensitive areas
would necessarily be limited, appears appropriate under the circumstances it was taken and within
the CAS of the time.

1.2     Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

12.      As stated in the program document, the overall objective of the project was to support
efforts to deepen Tunisia's global integration and enhance the capacity of Tunisian firms to
exploit the opportunities offered by greater integration. More specifically, the program
supported: (a) reducing trade transaction costs and deepening Tunisia's global integration; (b)
further improving the business climate to encourage private investment and facilitate business
operations; and (c) strengthening the financial sector to increase its capacity to finance investment.

in the paragraphs 78 to 103.

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

17.      The operation was largely implemented without problems, with one exception. As a
condition for second tranche release the Government was to reduce the level of Non-Performing
Loans to 15 percent of Bank assets and to increase the rate of provisioning of these non-
performing assets to 70 percent. By end-2010, the level of non-performing loans had been
reduced to 13.2 percent, below the targeted level, and a significant improvement over the 2007
level, 17.3 percent.9 However, the rate of provisioning of these loans as of 2009 was only 58.3
percent, a modest increase from the 2007 level, 53.8 percent. 10 It was not expected that the
provisioning rate as of end-2010 would be at the targeted level because of banks’ continuing
difficulties in a weak economic climate. Effectively, with weak banking profitability, it was
difficult to meet both the NPL rate, which required writing off of loans, and the provisioning
target, as the actual level of provisioning would be reduced as the loans were written off. 11
Because of this, therefore, a partial waiver was sought for this condition. While there are some
technical issues with the actual measurement of NPLs, which tended to minimize their level, the
improvement in this performance was almost certainly real.12

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

18.     Program performance was to be evaluated based on 8 quantitative performance indicators,
which were specified in the program matrix.13 The performance indicators were to be monitored
through the Government’s own monitoring and evaluation system for the 11th National
Development Plan, although as noted below several were in practice not regularly monitored.
The 8 indicators were not of a particularly high order and one of them (the number of meetings
organized annually including sessions of thematic working groups has doubled between 2008 and
2010) could be viewed essentially as a program output rather than an indicator of a development
outcome. While there was no separate results framework (the indicators being included in the
program matrix) the performance indicators selected are well-linked to the policy actions in the

   Meeting with Mr. Rekkik at Central Bank.
12
   Tunisian banks could avoid classifying a loan as non-performing by issuing a new loan to cover
repayment arrears before these arrears reached 90 days.
13
   The eight performance indicators were a subset of the total number of indicators specified in the program
matrix, eleven in all. In addition, one of the second tranche release conditions (improvement in the level of
non-performing loans and increases in their rate of provisioning) was itself a performance indicator.


                                                      7
program matrix; they are, though, less well linked to the broader development objectives
promoted by the operation (increased integration in the world economy, improved
competitiveness). However, given the nature of the operation (a two-tranche DPL with an
expected duration of two years), it would have been unrealistic to expect significant changes in
higher order development indicators within the time frame covered by the operation. Hence, the
design of the monitoring and evaluation framework can be viewed as appropriate given the nature
of the operation.

19.      However, the choice of the indicators was not always well thought through. For example
information on several of the indicators (two out of the eight) was not systematically collected,
negating their usefulness for tracking of performance. In addition, there is no evidence that these
indicators were used as part of the regular project supervision, even when information was
available (as, e.g., in the case of the length of delays in port clearance which is regularly
monitored under the World Bank’s Second Export Development project). The monitoring of the
program, as reflected in the missions’ aide memoires and the one ISR that was filed for the
project focused almost exclusively on Government progress in meeting tranche release conditions.

2.4        Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

20.      As noted, it had been expected that this operation would be succeeded by a similar
operation (ICL II) which would deepen the reforms pursued under this operation.14 Preparation
of this operation had begun and a draft program document had been prepared which linked
clearly the new operation to the preceding one. However, political events intervened in early
2011, resulting in a shift in focus in the follow on operation. With the departure of the previous
regime, the Government was more interested in addressing directly some of the factors which had
affected economic performance. This led to the shelving of the ICL II operation and the design of
a new operation to focus more directly on transparency and accountability and which fell within
the limited mandate of the interim government. The counterparts have repeatedly indicated the
strategic importance to return to the agenda planned for the ICL II as soon as
political/constitutional circumstances allowed. The redesigned operation, entitled the Governance
and Opportunity DPL, was approved by the Board in June 2011. This is discussed further below.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

21.      Assessment of the relevance of this operation must necessarily take into account the
political change that occurred in Tunisia in early 2011. After weeks of civil unrest, the President
was forced to leave the country, a new interim government was set up, and a process of elections
was set in train to lead to a new Government and a new Constitution. One of the key factors
underpinning the civil unrest was dissatisfaction with the performance of the economic system
which was viewed by many as rigged in favor of politically well-connected individuals. As such,
the development objectives of the ICL, which aimed at increasing the competitivity of the
Tunisian economy, particularly its capacity to absorb an increasingly educated work force, by
reducing, inter alia, anti-competitive practices, can be viewed as still highly relevant. However,
whereas these issues were addressed under the ICL indirectly and as technical issues, the current
environment provides the opportunity to address them more directly, in a more overtly political
manner. This difference in approach can be seen most clearly in comparing the approach taken in

     See Country Partnership Strategy, World Bank, 2010, page 119.


                                                     8
the ICL to non-commercial bank behavior to that taken under the Governance and Opportunity
(GO) DPL Under the ICL, this issue was addressed through reduction in the number of non-
performing loans and their rate of provisioning, the intent being by better enforcement of
prudential limits to encourage more commercial behavior by the banks. By way of contrast,
under the GO DPL, conditions in this area related to the governance and selection of members of
boards of commercial banks. Hence, while the development objectives of the ICL still appear to
be quite relevant, the specifics measures aimed at achieving the development objective are
different in the new context.15

22.     This said the specific measures promoted under the ICL were sensible and remain
relevant in the current context (e.g., it is always useful to reduce the level of non-performing
loans held by commercial banks and reducing tariff levels can be expected to enhance openness
of the economy regardless of the changed context). Hence, given the continued saliency of the
development objectives even in the new context, and the utility of the measures actually taken
(even though the new context provided an opportunity of different types of measures in some
areas) an evaluation of Moderately Satisfactory seems appropriate.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

23.      The development outcomes specified in the program were relatively well-linked to the
policy actions contained in the DPL. A good example of this is the second tranche condition
calling for reducing the number of tariff bands. The practical intent of this measure was to reduce
average protection rates (expected development outcome), and thereby increase competition in
the domestic economy, particularly the on-shore sector (higher order development outcome, not
specified in the program matrix). The measure was taken and was indeed effective in reducing
average tariff rates.

24.      However, as noted above, the indicators for the development outcomes are not of a
particularly high order and their impact on the broader development objectives is relatively
indirect. This reflects in large part, the nature of instrument, i.e., a two-tranche DPL with a time
horizon of only two years. Given this, it would be unrealistic to expect significant changes in
higher order development outcomes (as measured, e.g., by increase in the competivity of the on-
shore sector).

25.    In addition, several of the indicators have been specified in ways which makes
measurement difficult, if not impossible (see below). An example is the indicator of number of
meetings that have been held by groups working in the service sector. Such an indicator is
probably better viewed as an output rather than outcome indicator. In addition, with no
benchmark specified it is impossible to determine whether the indicator has been achieved or not.

26.    Of the eight development indicators specified, information could be found on the actual
performance of seven indicators, of which four were fully met and three were partially met. This
performance is set out in the table below:




15
  This can also be seen in comparing the ICL design with that envisioned under ICL II, an operation that
was subsequently superseded by the Governance and Opportunity DPL.

27.      In addition, one of the tranche conditions, that related to the percentages of NPLs and
their rate of provisioning by commercial banks was partially met and another development
indicator which was not included among the 8 but was specified in the program document, the
reduction in credit/deposit margin, was apparently met, as this differential fell from 3.9 percent in
2008 to 3.5 percent in 2010, an improvement of ten percent.16

28.      Finally, while not formally specified in the program matrix, it is clearly indicated in the
program document that maintenance of macroeconomic stability was one of the program
objectives. At the time of development of the operation in 2008-9, Tunisia confronted a
downturn in economic performance (due to lower export demand, particularly from Europe) and
reduced access to external financial markets. The Government had adopted anti-cyclic economic
policies in late 2008 to attenuate the macroeconomic impact of the looming economic slowdown


16
   The interest spread between deposit and credit rates is arguably a more important indicator of financial
sector efficiency than the percentage of NPLs and the extent of their provisioning as this differential affects
directly borrowing costs.

but was concerned with how the expected increased current account deficit would be financed,
particularly with reduced access to external financial markets. The World Bank finance, together
with that of the other co-financiers, was viewed as necessary to substitute for this reduction in
foreign financing.17 In this the operation largely succeeded; while GDP growth fell in 2009 to
3.1 percent (from 4.5 percent in 2008), growth accelerated in 2010 to just under 4 percent, and the
rate of reserve coverage of imports remained comfortable at over 5 months import coverage in
2010.

29.     On balance, taking into account all these factors, a project success rating of Moderately
Satisfactory appears appropriate.

3.3        Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

30.      With relevance and economic achievement both rated as Moderately Satisfactory an
overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory is indicated.

31.        Not applicable.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

32.      Little or none. Some of the policy actions such as enhancing the role of National
Services Council and the Competition Commission may have had an indirect impact on their
institutional strengthening, by increasing their relevance.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

33.     The set up of a great donor’s coordination and joint collaboration on development
operations could be considered as an unintended positive outcome of the preparation of this
program which had as a result the capacity for the government to leverage additional resources to
finance their development program.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
      Rating: Moderate

35.     This rating results from the uncertainty surrounding events in Tunisia since the January
revolution. In the current situation the measures taken under the program are not in themselves
particularly controversial and the measures taken have not been reversed. If anything, the new
Government will probably be inclined to push more aggressively in some of the areas covered by
the operation, building on the measures already taken. The uncertainty arises because of expected
change in Ministers which could lead to some change in priorities. As of end December 2011,

     See Table 4 in the Program Document.

elections have been completed for a Constituent Assembly and a new Government based on these
elections has just been put in place. However, some time will be needed in order to have a clear
understanding of the Government’s policy in the areas covered by the operation. In addition, in
the wake of the Revolution, there has been some economic deterioration, which has been
exacerbated by the continuing slowdown in Europe, to which Tunisia is particularly susceptible
(see above). This weak economic situation could lead to some backsliding. Mitigating this risk,
though, is the fact that the technicians who worked on this operation remain largely in place and
they are continuing to implement the previous policy and that the challenges which motivated the
operation remain relevant and a priority of the next DPL agenda and their pertinence has been, if
anything, enhanced in the new political climate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory

36.      This rating focuses exclusively on the DPL itself, leaving an evaluation of the Bank’s
overall stance towards Tunisia during the review period to a separate CAS evaluation. The rating
reflects two positive factors and one negative factor. The positive factors were: the exceptionally
close link between the World Bank’s analytic work, particularly the “Tunisia: Global Integration
Study?, and the design of the operation and the close and effective working relationship between
the World Bank and the other two co-financiers in the design of the operation. As noted above,
many of the measures in the operation have their clear roots in the Global Integration Study. In
addition, this study served to “depoliticize? to some extent potentially sensitive issues (e.g., anti-
competitive practices, service sector reform) allowing the World Bank to reengage with the
Government on a policy dialogue on potential reforms, after several years of relative
disengagement. The quality of the analytic work is evident in that it served as an analytic basis
for the subsequent World Bank operation (Governance and Opportunity DPL, 2011) which, as
noted above, addresses many of the same issues, but in a more direct manner. The operation also
drew on other analytic work in the areas of private sector development and land reform.

37.     Comments by the other co-financiers were unanimous in their appreciation for the quality
of the World Bank’s engagement (see Annex 5). The Bank team was considered to be both
highly competent and constructive in their engagement with the donors. There was appreciation
for the World Bank’s willingness to take on issues in the program that were of less importance to
the World Bank and more important to the co-financiers (e.g., microfinance). Preparing a
multidonor budget support operation is inherently more complicated than preparing a stand-alone
World Bank operation and the fact that the World Bank was able to do so, while still ensuring
that key issues as we saw them were addressed is remarkable.

38.     These two elements alone would have justified a rating of Highly Satisfactory.

39.     On the negative side, the M&E framework set out in the operation was relatively weak.
While the use of relatively lower order outcomes as indicators is understandable given the short
duration of the operation, what is less comprehensible is the quality of the indicators chosen. One
of them is really an output rather than outcome, and several others are not systematically
measured, mitigating their usefulness for assessing project performance.

40.     The combination of the high quality of the analytic basis and cooperation with donors
with the relatively weak M&E design suggest that a rating of Satisfactory is indicated.


                                                 14
(b) Quality of Supervision.
    Rating: Satisfactory

41.      As is typical with multitranche DPLs, supervision focused primarily on progress towards
meeting disbursement conditions. Taking this into account, potential problems, e.g., the lack of
progress in the rate of provisioning were identified relatively early and the evidence suggests that
the Bank’s early engagement led to an acceleration of Government reform efforts. In the
supervision, the Government was reminded of areas in which further progress was needed with
the result that, with one exception, all the second tranche measures were met within the time
frame of the project. This progress was noteworthy given that at the time of the formal
supervision mission in March 2010 a number of measures were only partially fulfilled.
Facilitating the supervision was the presence of the World Bank TTL in the field, which allowed
for real time supervision of project performance.

42.    On the other hand, there is no evidence that supervision ever utilized the M&E
framework set out in the program matrix. In any case, as noted above, this framework suffered
from some deficiencies, limiting its usefulness in supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

43.      The rating of satisfactory on design and satisfactory on supervision translate into an
overall rating of Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

44.     The Government was actively engaged in the design of the operation, setting clear limits
as to what would be acceptable. In spite of some political sensitivity, the program was
successfully implemented.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Highly Satisfactory

45.     The implementing agency was the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation,
which is the chief Government interlocutor with donors on budget support operations, including
any IMF program.18 In spite of this, most of the actions envisioned under the program were not
under the directly responsibility of this Ministry making coordination more than usually
complicated. Compounding this complication, was the large number of conditions (ten), which
were linked to second tranche disbursement. In spite of this complexity, the Government was
able to meet fully all but one of the ten measures, which warrants a rating of Highly Satisfactory.
This rating relates exclusively to the performance of the implementing agency and not to the
country context in which the agency was operating.

  Tunisia did not have a program with the IMF, although its performance was regularly reviewed under
Article IV.

46.     This is a direct result of the rating of Satisfactory for Government and Highly
Satisfactory for implementing agency performance.

6. Lessons Learned
47.        There are four broad lessons that can be drawn from this operation:

      a. The importance of grounding DPLs in solid analytic work. This operation was
         exceptional for the quality of the analytic work that had preceded it, notably the Tunisia:
         Global Integration Study. This work served to identify key problem areas, to a degree
         that is almost prescient in light of the events of January 2011, and provided a platform
         and justification for the measures contained in the operation. As a result, the operation
         has still remained broadly relevant in the political changed circumstances following the
         revolution. It is noteworthy that this analytic work was drawn upon again for the
         successor operation (Governance and Opportunity DPL, 2011). This operation, while
         covering many of the same areas as the ICL, was designed quite differently, pointing to
         the continued relevance of the analytic work.

      b. The limits of gradualism. The reform efforts under this program have focused on bringing
         gradual change where opportunities arose (as explained above), on the assumption
         (untested in the absence of feedback mechanisms, see above) that society was only
         prepared for incremental moves. As it turned out, the January 2011 revolution
         demonstrated that the said society was actually hungering for quantum change.

      c. The value of the location of the TTL in the field, particularly for a complex operation
         involving other co-financiers based in the field. The TTL for the ICL was based in Tunis,
         allowing for real time contact with both donors and the Government. The TTLs physical
         presence and interaction was a key factor explaining the success of the operation and
         cooperation with the other co-financiers.

      d. The need to factor in more explicitly political tensions in assessing risks. It is noteworthy
         that while the analytic work indicated clearly the social tensions arising from the
         continuation of Government policies, the discussion of risks in the program document
         focused exclusively on the likelihood of external shocks and lack of supply response to
         policy measures. While it is difficult to predict an event such as the Tunisian revolution,
         the factors giving rise to this event were well-documented in the analytic work, and the
         program itself was designed with these factors in mind. At the end of the day, the project
         still remains relevant in spite of this omission, thanks to its close linkage to high quality
         analytic work.

      e. The need to go beyond measures that initiate a reform process but that are not clearly
         linked to the subsequent phases of this process. As shown in the discussion on the prior
         actions, some of these measures were completed but there was no significant impact or
         substantive improvement in the areas of interest due to weak implementation or lack of
         follow up on the measures.

      f.   The need to spend more time upfront on the development of the monitoring system,
           including selection of development indicators. While these indicators must necessarily
           take into the account the impacts expected during the period of the project, they must also
           be selected with an eye to measurability as well as relevance. In particular, indicators
           need to be selected in terms of their relevance (they are relatively closely linked to



                                                   16
expected development objectives) and their measurability (they are systematically
measured enabling an assessment of program impact).

        Annex 5: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The following is based on interviews with staff involved in the operation as co-financiers,
both in the field and in Washington.

The operation was co-financed by the African Development Bank (in the amount of a Structural
Adjustment Loan of $250 million) and the European Union (in the amount of a total envelope of
Euro 70 million). The AfDB finance was released in two tranches, in line with the World Bank
finance, and the EU finance was released as a fixed tranche and three variable tranches. All
parties used the same matrix, with the each agency disbursing against its own choice of actions in
the matrix. Disbursement decisions were made individually, but there was joint assessment of
progress against the actions in the matrix.

Staff from each of the co-financing agencies participated in the design of the over-arching matrix,
which defined the program. Donors felt that that matrix reflected appropriately their priorities,
most of, but not all of which, were shared by the Bank. There was appreciation that the Bank was
prepared to include in the matrix areas in which co-financiers had a strong interest but which
were relatively marginal to the Bank program, e.g., microfinance. The resulting matrix, they felt,
summarized appropriately the collective priorities of the group.

While there was broad agreement on the measures, there was some differences in definition of
these measures, reflecting different agencies interests. For example, the World Bank saw the
objective of tariff reform as being to reduce the level of protection whereas the EU, which had a
trade agreement with Tunisia which provided preferential access for manufactured goods, was
more reluctant to see as an explicit condition the erosion of the preferential margin. This tension
was constructively addressed in the matrix by having as action the reduction in the number of
tariff bands, the expected result being a reduction in the overall level of protection. In other areas,
e.g., services, the team had to take into account as well on-going trade negotiations between the
EU and Tunisia.

The co-financiers regarded the World Bank’s involvement as positive and felt that the
engagement by the team had been constructive and collaborative. The Aide Memoires detailing
the conclusions of the missions during the preparatory stage were joint Aide Memoires, involving
all the co-financiers, testifying to the close cooperation.

Co-financiers also participated in the supervision of the project. There was one formal
supervision of the project in March 2010, but with co-financiers based in the field and the Bank’s
TTL also based in the field, supervision essentially was continuous. The co-financiers
participated in the single joint supervision mission and the resulting Aide Memoire was agreed to
jointly by all parties, ensuring a common assessment of outstanding issues and progress.

Contributing to this successful collaboration was the location of the project TTL in the field,
which allowed him to interact continuously with his counterparts from the other co-financing
agencies, all of whom were based in Tunis.
