                          The Integration and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan is a core element o f
                          the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (FY05-08) and the Country Assistance
                          Strategy Progress Report (2007) that set out an indicative program for FY09-10. It
                          constitutes a strong support o f the first pillar o fthe CAS which seeks to "strengthen
                          the business environment to support the development o f a more competitive,
                          internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness o fthe
                          Tunisianeconomy". This operation is also expectedto be a major component o fthe
                          new Country Partnership Strategy currently under preparation.

Risks andriskmitigation   The program faces two main risks.

                          (i)First,thedirectimpactoftheglobalfinancialandeconomiccrisisonTunisia's
                          growth and development remains uncertain. The duration o fthe recession in Europe
                          is a key factor, affecting Tunisia primarily through exports, tourism, foreign direct
                          investment, and remittances. By accelerating the economic reforms supported by
                          this program, the Government expects to mitigate this risk andreduce its financial
                          vulnerability. Inaddition, Tunisia's development partners have come together to
                          provide a common platformo f support to help the country respond to the more
                          difficult external environment. The continuous macro-monitoring and country
                          dialogue will help respond quickly ifneeded.

                          (ii)Second, the expected response o fthe private sector to the refoms may be muted
                          giventhe global economic downturn anduncertainties about the duration ofthe
                          recession inEurope. These would affect private investment. To mitigate this risk,
                          the Government is stepping up investment climate reforms, including finance for
                          enterprises, and is undertaking a broad communication campaign on its policy
                          measures to international investors.

                          Although Presidential Elections will be held in October 2009, the political risk is
                          low as the current president is likely to win given the absenceo fa credible
                          opposition candidate.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION


1.    This Program Document proposes an Integration and Competitiveness Development Policy
Loan (ICL) for Tunisia in the amount o f US$250 million.           This I C L supports the key strategc
elements o f Tunisia's 1I*   National Development Plan (2007-11) which seeks to strengthen growth
and ensure that this growth i s translated into employment. It is also a cornerstone of the World Bank's
program in Tunisia as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (FYO5-08) and the Country
Assistance Strategy Progress Report (2007) that set out an indicative program for FY09-10. This
operation is also expected to be a major component o f the new Country Partnership Strategy (FYIO-
13). The main thrust o f the program is to continue growth-enhancing reforms anchored around a
deeper integration o f Tunisia to the global economy. More urgently, the ICL will assist the
Government in responding to the global financial crisis which i s beginning to expose Tunisia's
inherent macroeconomic vulnerability to growth in Europe. The immediate objective o f the
Government i s therefore to accelerate reforms, send a strong signal to investors and mitigate recession
contagion risks inthe coming years. The global financial crisis and economic downtum will no doubt
dnve policy changes in Tunisia's main competitors for direct foreign investment and trade. Tunisia
has decided to respondby accelerating reforms to maintain its competitiveness.

2.    Tunisia i s a small open economy that is permanently facing challenges from developments inthe
world markets. So far, the country's global integration strategy has worked well: in 1971, to reduce the
anti-export bias inherent in the heavy protection o f the economy, an offshore sector was created. This
triggered a rapid rise in FDI and the birth of a large labor-intensive textile industry integrated
vertically with the EU's productionnetworks. Inthe middle o f the 1990s, trade protection vis-a-vis the
EU was scheduled for gradual and systematic dismantling, as part o f the Tunisia-EU Association
Agreement (AA). Trade liberalization was accompanied by a wide ranging structural reforms
supported by the World Bank. A recent Bank report shows that while a new generation o f reforms i s
needed, past integration efforts have led to new exporting sectors emerging in both manufacturing
(automobile electrical and mechanical components) and services (business process outsourcing, BPO).
That study also found that Tunisia's economic sectors which are highlyintegratedto the global market
have been able to attract investment, converge to EU's labor productivity standards, and boost job
creation. 1The country's average annual economic growth of about 5 percent in 1996-2007 clearly
owes much to the Government's solid macroeconomic and integrationpolicies.

3.    Tunisia now faces two interrelated challenges. First, it needs to grow at a much faster rate than
in the past to reduce high unemployment (14 percent). Tunisia's second challenge is the need to
accelerate the structural transformation o f the economy from a low-wage, labor-intensive economy to
a knowledge-based, shll-intensive and technology-based economy. For a small economy, meeting
both challenges requires deeper global integration, i.e., finding niches in global market for Tunisian

products, tapping into global knowledge, technologies and investment, and further reducingprotection
at home to enhance resource allocation and efficiency. In its 1l*National Development Plan (2007-
201l), Government clearly reaffirms its objective to deepen and widen the global integration o f
        the
Tunisia. Operationally, this means shifting away from just facilitating the economy's adjustment to
openness (supported by a series o f four Bank structural adjustment loans inthe past) towards a more
ambitious and deeper global integration agenda.

4.     The proposed ICL focuses on a set o f mutually reinforcing policies and actions to deepen
Tunisia's global economic integration and to promote private sector development. It proposes a
selective focus on three key policies areas o f the Government's reform agenda where the Bank and the
other development partners can bringthe most value added, specifically: (i)     reducing trade transaction
costs and deepening Tunisia's global economic integration. This involves both the move to a more
global (i.e., non-preferential) integration and a deepening o f the Association Agreement (AA) with the
European Union to converge to EUsafety and security norms and standards; (ii)      Further improving the
business climate to enhance competitiveness o f Tunisian firms, including services and; (iii)  Enhancing
the development o f the financial sector to increase its capacity to finance private investment. By
supporting reforms in these areas, the program would contribute to growth and macroeconomic
stability. It would also contribute to the Government's structural reform in response to (i)     increased
global competition and reduced trade protection, and (ii)        the transition to an economy based on
knowledge, innovation and diversification.

5.     While this ICL i s a stand-alone program, the dialogue around its content i s de facto
programmatic and it is likely that the Government will request another DPL at the end o f this one. The
program i s jointly supported by the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European
Union and the three institutions have jointly worked with the Government to design the program
withinthe framework ofthe 1l* DevelopmentPlan (NDP).

6.     Tunisia has had to adjust to several headwinds from the global economy since the beginning o f
the new millennium: a severe drought in2001, the impact o f September 11th on the tourism sector, the
increase inworld price o f oil, the expiration o f the Multi-fibre Agreement in2005 and, more recently,
the dramatic increase in international oil and cereal prices and the global financial crisis. Yet, in the
period 2000-2007, the economy adjusted well to these shocks and registered a 4.8 percent average
growth thanks to steady structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic management.

Trends in Growth andEmployment

7.     Gradual but steady structural reforms and sound macroeconomic management have continued to
promote strong economic performance (6.3 percent real GDP growth in 2007) and greater resilienceto
adverse shocks. However, due to demographic pressures (rapid increase in the labor supply), the pace
o f GDP growth remains insufficient to reduce unemployment which hovers around 14 percent o f the
labor force. The jump in inflation in 2008 eroded the purchasing power o f consumers, threatened the
competitiveness o f firms and made salary negotiations difficult and lengthy. Civil servants got a 4.5
percent annual salary increase for the next 3 years in November 2008 and private sector salary
negotiations are ongoing. As world commodity prices declined however, policy concerns shifted
dramatically from inflation to the global financial crisis, prompting the Government to announce in
December 2008 a series o f "presidential measures" to reduce the risk to growth o f recession in
Europe.

8.     Overall, recent growth performance reflects dynamic behaviour o f exports, robust private
consumption and growing foreign investments. At the sector level, the services sector (59 percent o f
GDP) has been the engine o f growth (7 percent annual growth on average in 2000-2007) thanks to
dynamism o f telecommunications, transport and commerce-while               growth in tourism remained
modest. In the manufacturing sector (17 percent o f GDP), the mechanical and electrical sector
witnessed a double digit growth inboth investment and exports. In2008, the sector accounted for 27
percent o f merchandise exports (against 13 percent in 1995) and captured 31percent o f FDIflowing to
the manufacturing sector (against 13.7 percent in 1995). The textile sector (33 percent o f exports), on
the other hand, weathered well to the external shock o f the MFA dismantling, as many Western
European firms having invested in Eastern Europe switched to countries like Tunisia due to rapid
increase in wages following the Eastern European countries' EU accession. It is not clear however if
the sector can expand in the future, owing to the complete dismantling by the EU and the U S o f
remaining quotas on Chinese exports scheduled in2008. The country i s still vulnerable to the vagaries
o f rainfalls as below-average harvests (driven by below-average rainfalls) often claim up 1 to 2
percentage points o f growth inTunisia.

9.      While growth has been respectable, it fell short o f the 6.1 percent target (except in 2007).
Between 1999 and 2008, unemploymentwas only slightly reduced, from 16to 14.1percent (Figure 2).
Unemployment is particularly severe for first-time jobseekers with university degree, with the rate
hitting30percent for the highlyeducatedunder thirty. It is estimatedthat between80,000 and 90,000
net news jobs would need to be created each year only to absorb new entrants in the labor market, 57
percent o f which are university graduates (World Bank, 2008b).2 Tunisia's 1I*NDP (2007-201 1)
considers that an annual growth rate o f at least 6.1 percent i s needed to reduce unemployment in the
medium term.3

Inflation andPrices

10. Tunisia has a good track record inkeeping inflation under control (at or below 3 percent). While
this performance partially reflects price controls on key foodstuffs, monetary policy helped reduce
liquidity and inflation. For instance, following a surge o f inflation to 5 percent towards the end of

  The recently released World Bank global poverty numbersindicate a poverty rate of 7 percent for Tunisia, one
o fthe lowest inthe region, and down from 40 percent in 1980. However, employment remains a key challenge.

2006 due to high oil prices and abundant money in the economy, the Central Bank o f Tunisia (BCT)
intervenedby raising its key monetary policy rate by 25 basis points and the Banks' requiredreserves
ratio from 3.5 percent to 5 percent, effectively reducing money incirculation and the growth inprices.

11. However, inflation picked up inthe half o f 2008, reaching a peak inApril 2008 (6 percent on a
year-by-year basis) before moderatinginthe last quarter ofthe year (Figures 3 and 4). Higher food and
energy prices and rising liquidity, due to capital inflows from higher foreign direct investments, were
the main drivers o f inflation. Some o f the inflationary pressure has also come from the nominal
exchange rate, which depreciated by 2.8 percent in 2007.4 The sharp decline in international
commodity prices in the second semester o f 2008 combined with liquidity tightening by the central
bank (through two increases in the reserve requirement o f banks) led to a sharp deceleration of
inflation at the end o f 2008?

Fiscal and current account deficits

 12. The rise ininternational oil and cereal prices over the last three years has had a strong impact on
public finances but offsetting evolution on the expenditure and revenues sides helpedthe Government
maintain the fiscal deficit (excluding grants and privatization receipts) at 3 percent o f GDP in 2007.
On the expenditure side, total transfers and subsidies surged from 3.7 to 4.2 percent o f GDP between
2006 and 2007, owing to a sharp rise in food and energy subsidies (Figure 5).6 However, thanks to a
drop in the public debt ratio, interest payments declined sharply and provided the fiscal space to
accommodate a sharp rise in subsidies (Table 1). The favourable evolution o f revenues also helped
accommodate rising subsidies. Total revenues increased at a slightly higher rate than GDP thanks to a
large extent to revenues from the energy sector. Corporate profit tax revenues from energy companies

jumped to 2 percent o f GDP and represented 51 percent of total corporate taxes (from 1.3 percent o f
GDP in2006). Non fiscal energy revenues (royalties) reached0.3 percent o f GDP.

13.    The impact o f the global food and fuel crisis was stronger on the 2008 budget execution. Recent
estimates by the Ministry o f Finance put food subsidies at 1billion TND (2.1 percent o f GDP), i.e.,
300 million TND above the budgeted envelope. Total fuel subsidies will have reached 800 million
TND (1.6 percent of GDP) compared with abudgeted450 millionTND(based on an average oil price
o f US$75/barrel versus an average o f US$98 for 2008). Thus the "direct" gross budgetary impact of
the sharp rise in food and fuel prices 2008 i s estimated at 1.3 percent o f GDP, o f which one has to
deduct the positive impact o f increased world oil prices on fiscal and non-fiscal revenues from the
energy sector. The government policy since 2005 has been to gradually increase consumer price o f
energy to keep the subsidy under control. Fuel prices were raised three times in 2006, twice in 2007
and twice in2008.

 14.    Tunisia's current account balance has continued to weaken but FDIinflow is significant: A 79
percent increase inthe food imports increased current account deficit to 2.6 percent o f GDP in2007-
from 2 percent o f GDP in 2006 (Table 2). The deficit could have been larger but for a 55 percent
increase in energy and miningexports. Preliminary estimates for 2008 show drop in energy and textile
exports. Imports have also slowed slightly but remain strong. On the services side, Tourism receipts
increased by 8.6 percent in the first quarter. Workers remittances were also up by 8.4 percent in the
first three months o f 2008 but they will likely moderate as EU economies slow. Current account
deficit i s projectedto weaken to 4.2 percent o f GDP in2008.

Externalfinancing conditions

 15.   Tunisia benefited from good external financing conditions in recent years, owing to its stable
investment credit ratings (BBBBaa2). In August 2007, the Government issued a 30 billion Yen


                                                         5

(US$260 million) Samurai bond on the best terms ever for the country: 75 basis points above the
benchmark swaps rate and a maturity of 20 years. To put into perspective, Tunisia's previous issue (in
June 2005) o f a 15-year 400 million Euros Eurobond (US$ 500 million) had a margin of 107 basis
points.

16.   Incontrast to the success that the government had in2007 when it issued the Samurai bond in
the Japanese market, Tunisia's sovereign spreads (EMBIGlobal spreads), along with other emerging
markets, have increased dramatically in the last few months to more than 600 basis points as o f
December 1, 2008, reflecting a higher country risk resulting from the volatile global financial
environment (Figure 5a). The EMBI Global spread for Tunisia is however way below the MENA
regional average (close to 900 basis points) and even below the Euro Spread. While spreads are
currently mainly drivenby external factors and macroeconomic conditions indeveloped countries and
are rising for all countries, the markets seem to give credit to Tunisia's prudentmacroeconomic stance
and stability. While data on corporate spreads (CEMBI spreads) for loans above US$300 million is
missingfor Tunisia, figure 7b suggests that they have dramatically increased as they reach 1000 basis
points on average for emergmg markets. Large firms in emerging countries, including Tunisia, find it
hardto obtain cheap financing inthe international market today.

17.   Tunisia's stock market has followed the global downturn since October 2008 and, as o f
December 2008 it has lost almost the entire gain realized in 2008 (Figure 5c). Finally, despite a
current account in deficit and a high level o f debt amgrtization reflecting the magnitude o f past
external debts, foreign reserves accumulation has been strong, thanks in large part to FDI inflows.
Tunisia's international reserves have risen in the first half of 2008 from its comfortable level o f $8
billion (4.5 months of imports o f goods and services) inDecember2008 (Figure 5d).

The GovernmentResponseto the Global Financial Crisis

18.   The Tunisian authorities have expressed confidence in the ability o f the economy to maintain
macro stability in the midst o f the current global financial crisis. The Governor o f the Central Bank
said inOctober that "the factors that have caused the current international financial crisis do not exist
in Tunisia". Then, the Prime Minister presented a confident perspective on the resilience o f the
financial sector and the economy. Officials, including the Prime Minister and Central Bank Governor,
gave several reasons for their optimism, noting that: (i)  Tunisia does not have a "sub-prime" problem;
real estate loans represented only 10 percent o f GDP (compared with close to 90 percent in the US)
and most o f them were long-term and fixed-interest; (ii)    local banks have little foreign exposure; (iii)
the money market i s still highlyliquid, and at the beginning o f October the centralbank hadUS$1.2bn
available to inject into the market ifneeded; (iv) foreign participationinthe stock market i s "relatively
low", at some 28 percent; (v) public debt has been reduced; (vi) Tunisia's foreign reserves have been
managed prudently. The amount held in banks (mostly with double- or triple-A ratings) had been
reduced to some 35 percent, and the rest was held in sovereign funds; and (vii) the dinar is non-
convertible for most capital-account transactions.
                                                                                                          t



19.   A main Government argument is that features o fthe local financial systemtraditionally regarded
as weaknesses, such as Tunisia's lack o f integration into global financial markets and the low foreign
participation rate in the stock market, are currently working in its favor, by shielding it from the
turmoil in the outside world. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that it is highly unlikely that the local
economy can escape negative repercussions from the expected global economic slowdown, gwen
Tunisia's reliance on Europe as a buyer o f its exports (as discussed in the outlook section below). If
the export sector i s badly hit, it could adversely affect the financial sector that finances it. This is all
the more so that the banking system has important structural weaknesses. The priority banking reforms
discussed below (see Government Program section), chiefly those related to reducing the Non-
Performing Loans (NPL)and enhancing prudential norms, are thus important for Tunisia.

20.   Infact, byDecember 2008, itbecame evident that the real economy cannot escapethe effects of
recession in Europe. Growth inthe volume o f exports declined sharply in the second semester to 1.5
percent (against 14 percent in 2007). This triggered a swift government response. A series o f
"Presidential Measures" were announced following a Cabinet meeting on December 231d. The
"Presidential Measures" include both emergency measures aimed at assisting exporting firms already

                                                    7

adversely affected by the slowdown in Europe and measures to be implemented in 2009 and 2010,
discussed with the Bank, the EU and the AFDB and contained in the matrix o f this program. The
emergency measures include: (i)      subsidy o f 50 percent o f the employer's cost o f social security for
firms witnessing a dramatic fall in exports to Europe; (ii)   a subsidy o f 100 percent o f the employer's
cost o f social security for firms that have to stop production and rundown stocks; (iii)  a subsidy o f 50
percent o f the cost o f export insurance. In addition, the government announced the measures in the
first pillar of this proposed DPL's policy matrix, aimed at reducing trade transaction costs. These
include reducing customs duties, accelerating the trade procedures related to technical controls to
reduce non-tariff bamers and improving logstics services.

21.   Another element o f response is contained inthe budget law for 2009. The Government decided
to increase public investment by 20 percent (mainly infrastructure projects: road, energy, port and
airport). T o avoid delays related to Tunisia's complex procurement procedures, an acceleration of
procurement procedures for public contracts granted to the local private sector was planned. As
discussed below, to keep the budget deficit around 3 percent, the budget law anticipates a sharp
reductionof subsidies due to the decline inthe world food and energy prices.


                 MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

22.   Today's external environment presents exceptional challenges to economic forecasting.
International oil and cereal prices, growth in Europe, regional security, and the impact o f the global
financial crisis are all elements o f uncertainty. Nevertheless, for Tunisia, there are reasons for
optimism. For more than 20 years, the country has been a consistent good performer. Inthe face o f
recent dramatic external shocks, it has demonstrated impressive resilience. The country has a clear and
comprehensive development strategy and a tradition o f pragmatic economic management. These
underlying factors augur well for a continuation o f the respectable performance o f the past 25 years
despite the difficult structural challenges at home and inthe global financial and economic crisis.

Medium-term growth outlook (2009-2011)

23.   The base case scenario o f the macroeconomic framework takes account o f (i) projected the
growth inthe EUfollowing the global financial crisis; (ii)   the projected evolution o f the U S dollar, the
internationalprice o f oil and interest spreads; (iii)heightened competitive pressure on Tunisia's textile
sector following complete dismantling o f MFA quotas on Chinese exports to Europe in 2008; (iv) the
impact o f structural reforms supported by the reform program on private investment and productivity
growth and; (v) a 20 percent rise in public investment in the 2009 Budget Law to finance large
infrastructure projects to offset the potential negative impact o f the global financial crisis on growth
(stimulus package).

24.   Under the above assumptions, Tunisia's real GDP growth i s expected to weaken further to 4.2
percent in 2009 (stimulus duly taken into account), following a slow down in 2008 (estimated at 4.5
percent against 6.3 percent in 2007), before recovering to 5 percent in 2010. Agncultural sector
growth i s expected to pick up in 2009, following a sluggsh performance in 2008. Economic growth
will be driven inpart bythe expected continued expansion o f domestic services such as commerce and
information and communication industries. Tourism, textiles and clothing as well as the mechanical
and electrical engmeering sectors are expected to suffer from weaker demand from the EU..

25.   Domestic demand, especially public investment, will thus be the main drivers o f growth. It is
expected that the major public investment efforts in 2009 and 2010 will impact growth in 2010 and
2011. The major infrastructure projects that are expected to boost growth include a new airport in
Enfhida (150 kms South of Tunis), a new refinery in Gabes and the Tunis-Medjes-Beja-Boussalem

                                                      8

highway. In 2008, foreign direct investment (FDI) increased by 40 percent thanks to significant
investment from the EU (France, Germany, Italy and the UK mainly) and the Gulf Arab countries. In
sharp, in 2009, FDI will be highly vulnerable to the spreading impact o f the credit crunch even if
Tunisia remains an attractive FDIdestination.' Domestic private investment is expected to expand in
2010, thanks to structural reforms supported by this program, including reduced trade and business
entry transaction costs and better access to non-bank finance. However, given the continuing strong
growth of the labor force and assuming no significant growth o f employment inthe public sector, the
unemployment rate will be reducedonly marginally, to around 13.5 percent by 2010 from 14.1percent
in2007.

26.    Inthe base case scenario, despite rising world oilprices, inflationis expected to remainunder
control, thanks to responsive monetary and economic policies. Tunisia's subsidy and import costs will
ease although they will remain a heavy burden. The current account deficit would stand around 3.2
percent over the projection period.8 No major terms-of-trade shock or reversal o f capital flows is
foreseen.

27.    Compared to the above base case, possible downside risks include:
          A more durable recession in Europe. Growth in Tunisia may slow down temporarily or
          persistently, depending on the duration o f the recession in Europe. Hence the importance o f
          accelerating structural reforms now in order to mitigate the potential growth risk from EU
          contagion;
          Persistent uncertainties and mutedprivate investmentresponseto structuralreforms due to
          heightened global economic uncertainties;
          Droughts that couldreduce agncultural output, adversely affecting private consumption and
          exports and therefore requiring greater quantities o f food imports and ;
          Reaonal insecurity which could affect Tunisia inthe comingyears, with tourism failing to
          reach the expected levels, and the country losing some o f its attractiveness for foreign
          investors.




7 Potentially, a large number o f mega projects inreal estate, not included in our projections, could substantially
increase FDI. According to the Government, several Gulf countries intend to invest more than USD 25 billion in
Tunisia over the next 15 years. It is not clear how much o f these amounts will actually be invested over the next
three years, especially given the current financial crisis and the global credit crunch and the drop in petroleum
prices.
* The Government    expects the private sector to play an important role inthese investments (concessions) and the
share o f the private sector intotal investment (gross fixed capital formation) to increase from 59 percent in2007
to 62 percent in2011.

Fiscal deficit financing options

28.    The context o f global financial crisis has recently led the Government to revise its sources of
fiscal deficit financing for 2009 and 2010. Initially, given the excess liquidity in the market inrecent
years (credit growth o f 10 percent versus a deposit growth o f 15.9 percent in 2008), the objective was
to increase net financing from domestic sources by 32 percent and 13 percent for 2009 and 2010
respectively (Table 4). The consequence would have been an important reduction in gross external
 financing needs. However, in a context where liquidity in the market might be less abundant than in
the past few years, that financing option may significantly suck up liquidity otherwise available for
the private sector and other economic agents ("crowding out effect"). That in turn could adversely
 affect private investment and undermine growth andjob creation.

 29.   To address financing needs in 2009 and 2010 without crowding out the private sector in the
 domestic market and without having to issue new bonds in the international market, the Government
has decided to reduce significantly domestic financing in 2009 and increase external borrowing in
 2009 (scenario 2). This i s the mainreason behind its desire to request a larger amount for the proposed
program, from USD 150 to 250 million. The cumulated amount for this program o f about USD 600
million (the Government has requested USD 250 million from the AfDB and the EU has agreed to
provide 70 million Euros in Grants) will allow the Government to face its financial needs comfortably
 and without undermining access to finance by the private sector. Scheduled amortizations of external
 debt are indeed estimated to increase by 32 percent in2010 and 56 percent in2011(Table 2).

Debt sustainability

30.   The Tunisian government is committed to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and the fiscal
deficit is projected to decline slightly to 2.9 percent o f GDP in 2011-in         line with the authorities'
intentions as shown in the Medium-Tern Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Fiscal consolidation will
come, despite the expected rise inpublic expenditure, from future acceleration o f GDP growth which
will leadto a decline inthe debt ratio and, on the revenue side, fromincreased tax revenue colle~tion.~

31. The government intends to continue its pro-active public debt management through different
instruments: (i)using privatization receipts for early repayment o f high-interest debts (in 2007,
TND358 million were repaid); (ii) management o f the riskrelated to the interest rate (in2007, a
                                       active
total o f 97 million TND were converted from variable to fixed rates and in 2008, only 8 percent o f
external debt had a variable rate); (in) active management of exchange (the share o f debt in euro has

 Current expenditures are expected to increase inthe immediate future but come back in2011just slightly above
the level of 2007 (20.3 percent of GDP) thanks to a planned gradual phase-out of petroleum subsidies and

33.     The Government's Integration and Competitiveness Reform Program (ICRP) is part o f its 1l*
National Development Plan (NDP). The framework sets out the broad package o f policies, strategies
and programs for implementation over the period 2007-2011. The 11" NDP supports the overall
vision, goals and outcomes o f Tunisia's Vision to 2016 and is the vehicle that transforms these long
term goals and outcomes into short tern priorities, strategies, programs and measures over the period
2007-2011. Employment generation is the highest priority o f the 1lth NDP. T o achieve this, the 11"
NDP focuses on: (a) accelerating private-sector driven growth; (b) maintaining macro stability; (c)
upholding social achievements and human development; and (d) preserving natural resources. While
not featuring strongly in the 1lh NDP, regional development including through development o f
competitiveness poles that integrate production, research and innovation in the same space to attract
private investment i s emerging as an additional way o f supportingjob creation.

34.     The integration and competitiveness reform program is composed of core elements o f the two
first pillars of the NDP, namely "accelerating the pace of growth" and "enhancing macro stability".'          '

10 The Bank has supported the Government (through an IDF grant) in strengthening public debt institutions in
2005-2007. This support helped strengthen capacity for debt management, the creation of a "middle ofitice"
responsible for debt strategy and the publication of an annual report on public debt management.

While all the policy actions supported by the ICRP fall under "accelerating growth", they indirectly
serve macro stability. Indeed the ICRP centers around 3 pillars, all crucial for growth and macro
stability: furthering trade integration, improving the investment climate and fostering a development
o f the financial sector. In other words, to accelerate the pace o f growth with macro stability, the
Government counts on a significant increase in exports and investment. Robust exports and FDIover
the long-term are expected to expand markets, enhance technological diffusion boost and productivity
and growth. However, inthe context o f Tunisia, for the private sector to exploit fblly the opportunities
offered by greater global integration, pursuing financial sector reforms will be crucial as well. It i s
important to note that byboostingexports, investment and growth, global integration policies will help
macroeconomic stability (maintain fiscal balance below 3 percent, improve current account balance
and generate jobs).

36. To improve trade performance, the Tunisian Government's program focuses on three main
subcomponents: (i)    tariff reforms, non-tariff barrier reforms through regulatory convergence o f norms
and standards and more efficient import controls; (ii)        preparation o f services sector liberalization and
(iii) logisticsreforms.

37. Tariff and non-tariff reforms. The move to free trade for industrial products with the EU has
introduced a substantial wedge between the duties applied to imports from the EUand those which are
applied to third countries. For industrial goods, EUexporters face a zero tariff while non-preferential
partners face an average Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff o f 21.4 percent. A recent World Bank
study (World Bank 2008a) shows that this tariff gap not only creates costly trade diversion but also



One o f the characters o f Tunisia's development strategy is that growth should not be obtained without regards to
fiscal and external equilibrium The country has limited fiscal space and is hghly exposed to shocks. Therefore,
to maintainmacro stability, it imposes itself a hardbudget constraint. Tunisia's fiscal policy rests on a restriction
o f the general budget deficit to 3 percent o f GDP to decrease vulnerability to shocks. T o that effect, the
Government's strategy is (i)  further reduce public debt ratio and interest payments w h c h stood at 2.6 percent o f
GDP in 2008; (ii)enhance the efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditures through gradual
implementation o f MTEF and performance budgeting and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) operational inkey
line ministries and (iii)
                       enhance tax revenue collection.

encourages fraud and the development o f parallel markets.12 A key objective o f the Il* i s to NDP
reduce tariff gaps by gradually reducing the MFN rates. The latter i s scheduled to decline to 15
percent by 2009 inthe NDP. The Government is also committed to scrap the number o f tariff bands in
order to simplify the tariff structure and facilitate its administration by customs. The number of tariff
bands was reduced stepwise from 54 in 2003 to 9 in2008 and it is planned to continue this reform in
2009 through 2011.

38. But as tariffs are reduced, non-tariff barriers have become more prominent. Inspite o f the several
initiatives to streamline trade procedures and remove non-tariff impediments to trade, including
through the internet platform Tunisia Trade Net, import controls and procedures remain cumbersome.
There are numerous public actors controlling imports for safety, security, technical standard
compliance, and so on. Unfortunately, the actions o f these different actors (e.g., taking a sample and
examining it at laboratory) are not well coordinated and this leads to delays and important transaction
costs for importers and exporters. The Government plans to operationalize one-stop shops at major
ports, and further harmonize norms and standards with internationalpractices to facilitate trade. Much
o f the reform on standards and norms i s embedded in the EU neighbourhood agenda, which offers
Tunisia regulatory convergence and technical assistance (e.g. twinning o f institutions for instance).

39. These reforms build on the progress made since the establishment o f the Tunisia Trade Net
(TTN). The TTN operates an automated system that provides a one-stop trade documentation and
processing system, linlungall major actors inthe chain. The centralbank, commercial banks, customs,
chamber o f commerce, and all licensing authorities are linked to this electronic network, and a
prospective exporter or importer only has to submit one document to TTN. The automated system then
channels the information to where it is needed. The introduction o f TTN in Tunisia has allowed
cutting the average time o f document processing from eight days to three days. But the TTN is not yet
fully operational as there are a number o frelevantinstitutions that needto be connectedto the network
for more efficiency (transporters, trade commissioners known as "transitaires").

40. Services integration. Inthe 1IthNDP, services are assigned a major role in the achievement o f
the country's growth and development objectives. It i s forecasted that services will grow at an annual
average rate o f 8.7 percent duringthe 2007-2011period, to contribute to 68.4 percent o f the country's
economic growth, and to represent 49.9 percent o f the GDP at the end o f the period. International
trade will serve as a growth engine for a number o f services sectors and largely contribute to the
achievement of these objectives. Services exports are anticipated to grow by an average 9.6 percent
(compared to 5.2 percent for the 10thPlan), to represent 24.3 percent o f total exports in2011. Sectors
where Tunisia has a strong potential include health, professional services, transports, tourism, and
information and communication technologies (ICT) services.

41. Reforms identified to unleash this potential are threefold. First, the Government plans to develop
a strategy for exporting services and put in place coordinating mechanisms and statistical database to
implement this strategy. Second, it plans to open many backbone services sectors -telecoms, banlung,
insurance, distribution, transport - to competition and trade. This entails specifically relaxing or
removing entry and competition barriers to these sectors. A recent World Bank study finds these
pervasive (World Bank 2008a). Bilateral negotiations with the EU are underway, as part o f the
Tunisia-EU Association Agreement. And finally, related to the future opening of the services sector,
the Government plans to put in place Mise a niveau programs - upgrading programs -in order to
enhance the degree o f competitiveness o f local services firms. Concretely, firms will be given
financial support to invest intraining, production organization, compliancewith norms and investment
innewmachineries andequipments.

42.    Trade logistics. For a country whose competitiveness is closely linked to its proximity to its
main export market, i.e. Europe, efficient transport logstics are o f paramount importance. At current
projections o f GDP growth, the volume o f trade is expected to double over the coming decade, thereby
putting substantial strains on the existing trade and transport infrastructure. Tunisia has among the
best logistics indicators in the MENA region but lags behind Turkey and Eastern European
competitors which have benefited from regulatory convergence and institutional twinningwith Europe
in recent years.I3 It faces several constraints related to the limited availability of modem logistics
platforms and warehouses. Exporters are small and atomized and often cannot by themselves fill a
whole container, putting the onus on the efficiency o f grouping and coordination by the logistics
providers. Unfortunately, the latter are also small and they have not been able to minimize
coordination failures. As a result, total logistics costs (transport, storage, delay, administration) are
relatively high in Tunisia. They are estimated at 17 percent o f total sales in the pharmaceutical and
chemical industries, 12 percent inmany industries and inthe distribution sector, and 10 percent inthe
agro-industry (Table 6).


43.    The     Government        has    an
ambitious plan reduce logisticsTable
                   to                               6. Logistics costsinpercentage of sales, percent

of large trade-related infrastructures,
including a deep water port and an
airport inEnfidha. The deep-water port
and the airport o f Enfidha, to be built
close to Tunisia's main north-south
motorway and railway line would make
Enfidha     one    o f  Tunisia's    main
transport hubs. The project will also
increase local port capacity, which i s      Source: World Bank estimates (Transport and Logistics Technical

deepwater ports in the central Mediterranean. Reforms also include establishment o f logstics
platforms (including in Enfidha), opening the logstics services sector to entry o f large firms that can
overcome coordination failures and promoting strong partnerships between logistical operators and the
customs adrmnistration inthe context o f a new customs code whose implementation will start in2009.


                                IMPROVINGTHE INVESTMENTCLIMATE

44.    The Tunisian authorities have maintained a policy o f generous privileges for investments in
selected economic activities and for exporting, by supporting the creation o f an offshore regime.
Under the offshore regime, firms were gven an enclave business environment, with duty-free raw
material and equipment imports, 10-year corporate tax holiday, free repatriation o f profits and trade
facilitation services (e.g., in-house customs clearance). Over the years, this strategy has helped address
the import substitution bias of Tunisia's trade policy and thus contributed to promoting export-
oriented gowth. Indeed, export growth in Tunisia has been led almost exclusively by the offshore
industrythat has benefitedfrom preferential export policies, leavingthe onshore industrybehind. Now
that onshore firms are less protected by high tariffs than in the past, their survival depends on the
improvement o f their business "environment" and the reduction o f the dichotomy inthe economy.

45.    In the     11'     NDP, the                  Figure9. PrivateInvestment Trends, 1970-2008
Government intends to sustain                 18
the reform momentum of the                    14--
recent years.     Indeed,     several
changes to the Tunisian tax
system, including alterations to
corporate taxation and the value-
added tax, were introduced in
2007.    The    standard rate o f
corporation tax was reduced from

to increase the competitiveness
and encourage investment. T o encourage more firms to list on the local stock exchange, the corporate
tax rate for listed companies was reduced to 20 percent. The top VAT rate o f 29 percent imposed on
luxury goods was abolished, reducing the number o f VAT rates to three (18, 10, and 6 percent). The
Ministry of Finance introduced a new option for paying taxes           -  "tddiquidation" that allow firms to
file their tax returns online and determine the exact amount o f their payment before paying the taxes at
the tax office. Furthermore, a new Law on Economic Initiative enacted in December 2007 includes
many provisions to ease business, including the abolition of the paid-in minimumcapital requirement
for limited liability companies, allowing minority investors to request a judge to call into question
transactions judged contrary to the interest o f the firm (protection o f investors) and extending the
scope o f borrower's credit history at the central bank. Still, domestic private investment is quite
sluggish in spite of its upward trend since 2006 and in spite o f dynamic FDI (Figure 9). Indeed,
Tunisia's private investment performance pales compared to East European competitors (18-19
percent in Bulgaria and Romania), fast-growing East Asian countries (28-30 per~ent),'~and many
MENAcountries (Morocco 25 percent in2007).15

46.    A key objective of the 11" NDPis thus to go further inremoving constraints to private operators
in the onshore sector. The main axes o f the reform agenda are: (i)             reducing further administrative
barriers to investment, including pre-authorizations to create a business, (ii)           enhancing diffusion o f
information on market conditions and opportunities through an operational and accessible firm
registry system, (iii)  ensuring a better matching between labor supply and demand, (iv)reducing delays
inaccessto industrialland and(v)enhancing the role andimpact o fthe competition authorities.

47.    Bankingsector. Tunisia's 1 1NDP acknowledges that for investors to exploit the opportunities
                                           ~
offered by greater global integration, Tunisia will need to fix the lingering weaknesses o f the banking
sector. An important constraint to the capacity of the banlung sector to finance the economy is the
highlevel o fnon-performing loans (NPLs). Although they have declinedover the lastthree years, they
still stood at 17.4 percent in June 2008. Furthermore, the proportion o f these risky loans provisioned i s
limited by international standards, as only 53.8 percent o f them are provisioned on average. The key
objective o f the Government is thus to reduce the level o f NPL and increase the extent to which those
are provisioned. More specifically, the objective i s to reduce the ratio o f NPLs further to 15 percent
and increase the percentage o f NPLs provisioned to 70 percent by the end o f 2009. To reach these
targets, policies undertaken over the last two years by the Central Bank (Banque Centraze de Tunisie -

BCT) will be continued. These include banning dividend distribution for banks with insufficient
provisioning, malung provisions fully tax deductible, and strengthening banlung supervision.

48.    Inlinewiththe2006FinancialSectorAssessment Program(FSAP) Update, theauthorities have
taken initial steps to improve the credit culture, promote good governance, and strengthen the legal
framework for banks. The B C T has been given (by a 2006 law) new powers to monitor the financial
system, ensure alignment with prudential norms and regulations, enforce transparency, and supervise
publication o f financial and economic data. It also aims to bringregulation closer to Basel IInorms. In
preparing for the transition to Basel 11by 2010, several preparatory measures to energize the banking
sector were planned, some of which are adopted by now. For instance, the requirement that banks
transfer their end-of-day foreign exchange balances to the Central Bank (nivellement) has been
abolished, and banks can now manage up to 20 percent o f residents' foreign exchange holdings
without surrender requirements. Banking sector reform priorities in the coming years include (i)
enhancing prudential norms in order to increase the capacity o f the sector to finance the private sector
and reduce risk o f instability. This i s expected to help reduce NPLs and increase NPLs provisioning;
(ii) ensuring that Basel 11prudential standards are adopted by 2010 and (iii)     encouraging further bank
mergers to reduce the fragmentation o f the sector.

49.    Non-bankingfinance (securities and venture capital markets). Partly due to the weaknesses
o f the banlung system, non-banking finance is largely underdeveloped in Tunisia. It contributes to
only 8 percent o f gross capital formation (Figure lo). The stock market capitalization is only 17
percent o f GDP in 2008, against around 90 percent in Morocco and 87 percent in Egypt and only 50
companies are listed inthe stock market. The development o f the securities market has been hindered
by excessive reliance on easy bank financing for large companies, and by weaknesses in Tunisia's
corporate sector (dominated by          Figure 10. Contribution of securities and venture capital market to
small family-owned firms and                                 gross capital formation

50.    As stated inthe 1l* the Government is keen in developing securities and venture capital
                             NDP,
and envisages a number o f reforms. These include: (i)the revision o f the regulatory framework o f
capital-risk institutions to transform them into real risk-takers (currently they operate mainly like
banks, providing capital under pre-determined exit conditions); (ii)enhancement o f fiscal and
financial transparency, (iii)improving the functioning of the stock and bonds market and (iv)
channelling more privatizations to the stock market in order to enhance the depth and liquidity o f the
latter. Government policies aimed at developing the capital market are an integral part o f the objective
o f gradually opening the capital account. A strong capital market i s a pre-requisite for opening the
capital account. Other complementary policies involve a shift towards a floating exchange rate, fiscal
consolidationand a new monetarypolicy framework (inflation targeting).

51. To address the need o f micro-firms, the regulatory fkamework o f micro-finance (today marked
by the quasi-monopoly o f Bangue Tunisienne de Solidaritd) also needs revision inorder to allow the
entry o f more players inthe market.16 The limited scope o f Government actions to fix the weaknesses
o f the non-banking finance sector largely explains the Government insistence in including that sector
inthereformprogramsupportedbythis loan.


                    IV.     BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY

                                             LINKTOCAS

52.    The Bank's program in Tunisia is set out in the current Country Assistance Strategy (FY05-
FY08) that was approved by the Board o f Executive Directors in 2004. The CAS proposes three
pillars:

         Strengthen the business environment to support the development o f a more competitive,
         internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the Tunisian
         economy
     0   Enhance shlls and employability of graduates and the labor force inorder to prepare them for
         a knowledge economy
         Improve the quality of social services through enhanced efficiency o fpublic expenditure.

53.    The CAS Progress Report (CAS-PR) was completed inAugust 2007 and has concluded that the
main development challenges and the CAS pillars remain valid. The CAS-PR laid out an indicative
program for the FY08-10 period (Annex B 3 o f the CAS-PR) that proposed a fifth Economic and
Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL V) for $150 million inFY09. This ECAL has been adapted
into the ICL proposed here and continues the Bank's strategy o f providing budget support as a core
element of the Bank's program in Tunisia. The context o f the global financial crisis led the
Government to be prudent about its financing needs in 2009 and 2010 and to request a larger loan
amount o f $250 million. Indeedthe Government is keen to avoid crowding out the private sector inthe
domestic market for finances by issuing large amounts in treasury bonds. The new Country
Partnership Strategy (2010-2013) i s currently being prepared and will reiterate the importance o f
pursuing reforms for accelerating the pace o f growth, maintaining solid macroeconomic management
and enhancing the incentives for increased private investment. Thus, while formally this program is set
within the context o fthe 2005-2008 CAS and the CAS-PR with its indicative program for FY09-10, its
content will feature prominently in the FY10-13 CPS which is being prepared. The I C L is a
cornerstone of the Bank's support to reforms in growth and macro stability policy areas.

54.    The I C L i s designed to be fully complementary with the current lending portfolio, particularly in
the area of export development through the synerges with the Second Export Development Project
(which supports export development through trade facilitation and promotion). The ICL also creates
significant synergies with the Bank's technical assistance activities in the area o f trade, transport and
logistics. The program also provides a platform for cooperation with other donors, as evidenced inthe
significant parallel technical assistance support provided to complement the ICL by the EC (trade
logstics). Finally, the Government has used the ICL program as a vehicle for its own internal
coordination on this agenda.




16 A part from the BTS, there is only one player in the micro-finance market in Tunisia: Enda-Inter Arab, an
internationalnon-governmental organization.

                 COLLABORATIONWITHTHE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

55.   The Bank has good collaboration with the European Commission (EC) as well as the Afncan
Development Bank (AFDB), both of which have a strong local presence inTunisia. The IMFhas no
local office inTunis and Tunisia has no formal program with the Fund, though relations are close. The
Fund undertakes two Article IV missions a year and has technically assisted the Central Bank on
monetary policy issues (e.g. inflation targeting). The IMF policy discussions as part o f the recent
Article IV Consultation mission (June 2008) centred on how to strengthen Tunisia's macroeconomic
position and advance structural reforms to achieve higher growth and lower unemployment in the
context of deeper integration to the world economy. More specifically, the discussions focused on: (a)
consolidating the fiscal position; (b) adapting the monetary and exchange rate policy framework to the
gradual liberalization o f the capital account and transition toward inflation targeting; and (c)
strengthening the financial system. The Bank has discussed with the IMF about the content o f the
program and will continue to do so in the near future. The Fund's Assessment Letter of the
Government's reforms is inAnnex 3.

56.   The proposed ICL i s being prepared jointly with the EC and the AFDB, building on the
successful experience under the ECALs. Its formulation has allowed these institutions to deepen the
policy dialogue with the Government on key economic issues. The ICL has also provided the vehicle
for coordination between the World Bank, the EC and the AFDB and is expected to provide an
additional US$200 from the AFDB and Euro 70 million from the EC inparallel financing on the basis
o f the same program matrix. All preparatory missions have been jointly conducted even if some
flexibility was needed to respond to different internal processes. The EC and the AFDB have asked
the Bank to play a leading role in the three institutions' communication with the Government and in
elaborating a macro framework for this program.


                       RELATIONSHIPTO OTHERBANKOPERATIONS

57.    The proposed ICL complements the Bank's other activities in Tunisia which encompass
investment lending, AAA, technical assistance and a range o f trust finds. The ICL serves as a vehicle
for policy reform in critical growth-enhancing areas and is instrumental to enhanced policy dialogue
and effective donor coordination.

58.    The I C L would build on the achievements reached through the series o f previous Bank loans
which     supported Competitiveness      and Pnvate Sector       Development. The Economic and
Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL) has successfully implemented its fourth phase. Through
the first ECAL, Tunisia introduced wide-ranging first generation actions aimed at promoting private
sector development; ECAL lI supported improvements in the soundness, efficiency and
competitiveness o f the banking system. ECAL 111consisted o f a broad range o f second generation
measures aimed at enhancing private sector development; and ECAL IV has developed a set o f
policies including: (a) Fiscal policies, (b) Pnvate Investment Climate Policies, including reduction in
the number o f prior authorizationfor private investors, and (c) Financial Sector Development Policies,
including enacting a law on financial security that promotes financial transparency and aims at
enhancing the quality of the financial statements o f companies.

59.    The ICL would also consolidate the results o f the Export Development Project IIwhich supports
the development o f exports through trade facilitation and trade promotion. It would also provide a
platform for addressing reforms identified through ongoing dialogue and technical assistance in the
area o f trade logdcs, access to industrial land and the business environment. Finally, it would also
support and complement the Bank's ongoing dialogue on future operations (including a potential
Export Development Project 111) and analytical activities that will be identified during the elaboration

                                                    19

o f the Country Partnership Strategy through identifying and addressing other key building blocks to
enhanced competitiveness o f the Tunisian economy.

                                          LESSONSLEARNED

60.    Lessons learned from implementing development policy loans in Tunisia and elsewhere show
that country ownership o f the proposed policies and actions is key for success. Country ownership i s
also emphasized in the draft CAS Completion Report (2008) as being critical for the success of the
Bank's program. As a consequence, the ICL and the overall dialogue and program of the Bank in
Tunisia are firmly embedded insupporting the objectives o f the 11" National Development Plan.

61.    A lesson from the experience inimplementation o f the ECALreforms is that the Bankneeds to
be flexible, to allow sequencing o f the reforms and to be sensitive to the country realities as regards
the time-frame of reform implementation. This is particularly important given the uncertainties
presented by the global financial crisis and the future impact o f this on the economy. Accepting
partial reforms in some areas and building on partial success to deepen them in subsequent operations
paid off. Drawing from this, the proposed program focuses on reforms that are feasible politically in
the timeframe o f the program and will consolidate those set o freforms before broadening further. The
ICL thus aims to pave the way for future reforms in areas where the level o f dialogue and analysis is
not yet mature or comprehensive enough to warrant specific reformmeasures.

62.    The use o f development policy lending is appreciated within Tunisia and will continue to remain
central to the Bank's program. An important element i s that the program aims to prioritize and tailor
the expected results accordingly, especially because the Bank is just one of many development
partners active in Tunisia. The Bank i s currently elaborating its future Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Tunisia with the goal o f continuing to prioritize areas where the Bank can provide most
value-added and providing a package o f services to reforms that includes lending, TA and other
support.


                                  ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

63.    The proposed program is underpinnedby a series o f analytical work recently completed (Table
7). The Global Integration report played an important role in shaping the Government's program in
trade and, through that, the content o f this program. That study took stock o f Tunisia's integration
policies since the early 1970s, examined the key remaining integration challenges that the country's
manufacturing sector i s facing and proposed further reforms to enhance the competitive position o f the
country; and (ii)  identified the specific policy reforms needed to realize the largely untapped potential
inservices. Usingawell-focusedregulatory questionnaire, therestrictionsto entry,business, andtradeinkey
backbone service sectorswere calculated (telecommunication, banlang, air transport, accounting, auditing, and
legalservices).

64.    The Global Integrationreport foundthat Tunisia's economic sectors which are highlyintegratedto
the global market have been able to attract investment, converge to EU's labor productivity standards,
and boost job creation. On the other hand, the performance o f domestic market-oriented firms (those
in the onshore sector) has been lacklustre as evidenced by the slow growth o f domestic private
investment due to lingering business climate constraints (heavy administrative burden, difficult access
to credit, unfair competition and anti-competitive practices). Finally, an important finding o f the report
i s that Tunisia's trade integration dnve has largely bypassed non-tourism service sectors, hence the
slow pace o f structural transformation o f the service sector where the country has a large potential.
This is mainly because many bamers to entry and competition are still prevalent there, reducing the
scope for investment and trade, thusjob creation.

                                                     20

65.   The preparation o f the program benefits also from a large number of other analytical work.
These include two critical pieces: a Trade Logistics Services Policy Note (2008~)and two Policy
Notes on Employment (World Bank 2007 and 2008b). The Trade Logistics Services Note summarizes
the conclusions o f a Bank technical assistance provided to the Ministry o f Transport o f Tunisia in
2007-2008, on the formulation of an Infrastructure and Logistics Services Development Strategy. If
found that: (i)Tunisia's average logistical performance is insufficient and not meeting current
challenges; (ii)important international and domestic infrastructures constraints in ports and logistics
zones are prevalent; (iii) the dissemination of the culture o f logistics in the private sector i s limited
due to insufficient slulls and training; (iv) logstics services are fragmented, provided often by small
operators usingnon-transparent procedures and that (v) several ongoing projects and reforms (customs
code, concession, and deep water port, etc.) are key to bring about positive changes. The Note also
proposes a policy and institutional reform agenda which is the basis of the measures proposed inthis
DPLon logistics.

66.   The first Bank Employment Policy Note completed in 2007 has integratedthe main conclusions
from the Bank's multi-year program o f economic and sector work program designed to address
Tunisia's unemployment problem. It covered labor market regulations, social protection, and
performance o f the education system. The Policy Note derived important policy recommendations,
mainly focused on the macro level, and supported (i)policies that focus on the accumulation of
production factors, (ii) policies that enhance the ability o f entrepreneurs to appropriate the returns on
their investments and (iii)policies that promote innovation and productivity growth. The second
Employment Policy Note in 2008 made use o f new evidence, had a more micro-focus and made
concrete and time-bound policy recommendations. It found, inter alia,: (i)a link between
unemployment and entry barriers to formal markets; (ii)    that skills suppliedby the education sector do
not fully match the demand o f the labor market, in part because the education sector has difficulties
responding; (iii) that there is a link between the rapidity o f professional insertion and the fields of
study, technical and engineering studies leadingto muchmore rapid insertion than humanity studies in
general and (iv) that most active labor market policy instruments are ineffective.

67.   The other analytical pieces that have fed into the DPL policy dialogue are numerous, including
the Development Policy Review (in finalization stage), the Small and Medium Enterprise Finance
Study (in finalization stage), the FIAS Firm Enterprise study oust completed), and the 2006
Government's (IEQ) competitiveness study, and an EU-commissioned study on security markets in
Tunisia, and so on. Furthermore, an intense dialogue on Tunisia's macroeconomic framework and
outlook has occurred during the preparation o f the program. The Government has sought feedback
from the World Bank and the IMF on its macro projections and has taken into account Bank's
comments. To enhance capacities in responding to shocks from the global economy and within the
framework o f 2009 budget preparation, a training course on development macroeconomics was
deliveredby the World Bank inOctober 2008.

68.   The Government has also requested the Bank's technical assistance on tariff reforms to
anticipate on reforms to be supported by this program. A well-attended TA workshop on tariff reform
simulations and ex-ante analysis o f the impact o f tariff changes was delivered in September 2008. A
follow-up module focused on the sectoral impact o f tariff reform i s scheduled. Finally, in order to
implement one specific measure o f the program, the unique identifier, the Government has requested
Bank technical assistance within the framework o f this program.

                                        OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

 69.    The proposed DPL is squarely linked to the first strategic pillar o f the Government's reform
 program (1l*NDP), "accelerating growth". It is also linked indirectly to the "preserving macro
 stability" pillar given the strong correlation between pillar 1and 2. The overall objective o f the DPL
 would be to support efforts to deepen Tunisia's global integration and enhance the capacity o f
 Tunisian firms to exploit the opportunities offered by greater integration.         More specifically, the
 programwould support mutually reinforcing development objectives:

     0    Reducing trade transaction costs and deepening Tunisia's global integration;
     0    Further improving the business climate to encourageprivate investment andfacilitate
          business operations and;
     0    Enhancing the development of thefinancial sector to increase its capacity tofinance
          investment.

 70.    The Bank has maintained a continuous dialogue in all the above policy domains and hence has a
 highdegree o f confidence regardingtheir strategic importance. Reforms inthese mutually reinforcing
 policy areas will not only support growth, but also macroeconomic stability, which will be jointly
 monitored during supervisions. Moreover, policy reforms in the three areas above will pave the way
 for accelerating the structural transformation o f the Tunisian economy. Indeed, weak integration o f the
 services sector, weaknesses inthe financial sector and lingering investment climate constraints are the
 main factors behind the sluggsh trend domestic investment inTunisia (World Bank 2008a).


                                                        22

71.   Within each o f the chosen policy areas, the Government has been keen in inserting only
measures which are in the 11" NDP and which they are confident o f being politically able to
implement within the timeframe o f the program. Thus the proposed program takes into account the
lessons learnt from past programs in Tunisia which point to the desirability o f not pursuingtoo many
reforms too quickly, especially given the current country and global context. Inthe area o f services
sector integration, the ongoing bilateral trade liberalization negotiations with the EU explains the
focus o f the program on critical first steps to the future liberalization o f Tunisia's services sector
rather than bolder "opening" reforms, which could be supported by a future program. In sum, the
scope o f the program is deemed adequate given current circumstances and Tunisia's development
partners share a high degree o f confidence in the feasibility o f the measures in the program's policy
matrix.

                                LOANAMOUNTAND TRANCHING

72.   The Government is requesting a loan amount of US$ 250 million from the World Bank. The
AfDB is expected to provide the same amount (US$250 million) and the EC plans to support the
program through a 70 million euro grant in parallel financing. These three institutions will use the
same matrix as the basis for disbursement o f the loan and plan to disburse around the same time. The
World Bank's first tranche i s expected to be disbursed upon effectiveness whereas the second tranche
would be disbursed upon the satisfaction of the second-tranche conditions as testified by an
assessment o fthe progress made.

73.   Interms o f the program structure and tranching, initially, a programmatic approach with prior
actions and triggers was proposed by the World Bank and other donors. Ultimately, given strong
govemment preference, agreement was reached on a stand-alone, two-tranche operation, covering the
period 2009-2010. The Government considers however this program to be the first in a series aimed at
supporting Tunisia's global integration. Inits indicative program for Tunisia, the EC has allocated a
grant o f 77 million euros for a possible follow-up program in2011/2012.

                                            POLICYAREAS

74.   The program matrix (Annex 2) describes the logic o f the program by showing for each o f the
three components o f the program, the main axes through which the main objective is expected to be
attained, the key actions and the specific measures to be implemented during the course o f the
program. The matrix shows two types o f measures: (i)     disbursement conditions that are considered as
critical for the achievement o f the program's objectives and (ii)accompanying measures that are
intended to support each reform and set the stage for further reforms in subsequent operations.
Moreover, to guide the supervision o f the program, efforts were made to specify baselines and
expected outcomes. Given that this i s a two-tranche operation, the matrix i s explicit about the
measures to be implementedby the Government under each tranche.

75.   The program includes six prior actions and 10 conditions o f second tranche release. The total 16
conditions for this operation were chosen with three "best practice" principles inmind: (i)      ownership
(they are all in the government's 11" NDP), (ii)    criticality (they are critical to the realization of the
objectives of the program) and (iii)   predictability (their effective implementation can be adequately
monitored). The right balance has been struck between the critical importance o f ownership, the
required ambition o f the reformprogram as well as realism and effectiveness o f implementation within
the timeframe o f the program.

Reduce Trade Transaction Costsand Deepen TradeIntegration

76. The main objective o f this component is to reduce trade costs and deepen Tunisia's integration
through the following three axes, which are all critical elements o f the government trade integration
program:

        Deepen international integration for trade ingoods

     0  Strengthen the effectiveness o f trade facilitation and logistics services
        Foster trade in services

77. The prior actions for this component are (see more complete formulations inbox 1above):
       Reduce the number o ftariffbands (including the zero rate) from 9 to 6
       Adopt a law related to product standards and quality norms applicable to all products imported
       or utilized inTunisia

     0 Adopt a draft Decree amending the Decree No. 2006-1826 dated June 26, 2006 regarding the
       National Council o f Services in order (i)mandate NCS to prepare a strategy for services
       development; (ii)formalize the creation o f thematic commissions within NCS; and (iii)
       strengthen the role o f the Permanent Secretariat o f NCS through the establishment o f a
       performance-based budgeting unit.

78. Reductionof tariff bands continues reform efforts by the Government over the past five years,
and will involve a further reduction in tariffs on imports from non-preferential partners. Challenges
arising from this trade liberalization are related to possible reductions in tariff revenues and
adjustment needs o f domestic producers. Regarding tariff revenues, they now represent a small share
o f the budget (3 percent) as the Government successfully managed to increase corporate and income
taxes to compensate for declining tariff revenues. The Bank has worked through a technical assistance
program with the Ministry o f Finance to develop a hands-on tariff reform simulation tool tailored to
the envisioned reforms in order to help the authorities to better anticipate the likely fiscal and
economic effects o f tariff reform. The simulations show that tariff reduction is good for consumers
and overall welfare while the adversely affected sectors - wood and paper products, metals and
products, and transport equipment -would see only a small contraction in output o f less than 10
percent over 10 years that i s expected to be more than compensated for by the output expansion in
export-oriented sectors.

79. Moreover, the Government has a number o f well-developed trade assistance programs at its
disposal to assist vulnerable domestic producers, as Tunisia has just completed the transition towards
a free trade area with the EUinJanuary 2008. The expected outcomes o f the planned reforms are that
the tariff structure o f Tunisia will be simplified, the average level o f protection will be reduced and
trade will be more diversified. Inparticular, it i s expected that the simple mean o f most favorednation
import duties at the Harmonized System 6 digts level will drop from 21.7 percent in2008 to less than
18 percent in 2010. This fall inMFNtariffs will reduce the wedge between preferential and generally
applicable tariffs, and as a result will tend to lower adverse impacts from trade diversion and
incentives for fraud on product origin and smuggling.

80. The second prior action, adoption of a draft law on productstandards and qualitynorms, i s
a critical step in Tunisia's convergence to EUnorms and standards and deeper integration following
the completion o f the duty free area in manufacturing in January 2008. The legslative reform and
subsequent implementation has been an administrative challenge and a considerable burden on the
respective service within the Government, but preparations are well under way and the agencies
involved are committed to a quick and thorough application o f the new regulations. The resulting
changes in norms and standards might involve adjustment costs for some enterprises that have based

                                                     25

their production processes on the existing regulatory framework, but for many firms, especially those
producing for export to the EU, the regulatory reforms will lower compliance costs.. The major
expected outcome from this law (together with accompanying measures identified in the program
matrix) i s to make it possible for Tunisia's standards and quality norms to converge to international
best practices. It is expected that the number of divergences (109 in 2008) will falls by more than one
thirdby the end o f 2010. While this reform falls under the Tunisia-EU integration deepening agenda,
the Government is committed to apply the reform ina non-discriminatory manner.

81. The third prior action concerns the revision of the decree No. 2006-1826 of 26 June 2006
regarding the National Council of Services (NCS) in order to prepare a strategy for services
development; formalize the creation of thematic worlung groups; and strengthen the role o f the
Permanent Secretariat. The aim o f this measure is to support initial steps in fostering services exports
in the sectors where Tunisia has demonstrated its international competitiveness inrecent years (e.g.,
medical and paramedical, legal, accounting, and engineering services) and to provide the Government
of Tunisia with the institutional and analytical tools necessary to elaborate and implement an export
promotion strategy for services trade. The main challenge will be to ensure that a sufficient number o f
services experts can be recruited for the Permanent Secretariat, and that regular, effective
consultations with other ministries concerned and private sector counterparts can be undertaken within
the NCS. But to address this challenge, the Ministry of Trade has already identified a number o f
suitable experts and the fact that the Permanent Secretariat will likely be moved to and hostedwithin a
new results-oriented management unit in the Ministry o f Commerce should strengthen interest and
ownership of the various stakeholders. The expected outcome is that the consultation process between
the government agencies and private sector representatives concerned will improve, as measured by
the number of meetings organized annually, including sessions o f thematic working groups that i s
expected to double between2008 and 2010.

82. Second tranche disbursement conditions are (see box 1for complete reference):

         Tunisia's budget law for 2010 which shall revise the Customs tariff regime by reducing the
         number o f Customs tariff rates from 6 to 5, including the tariff rate "zero", shall be enacted
         The Ministry of Commerce shall put inplace a system o f selective management o f imports
         control based on the risks presentedby the imported products and the importers inorder to
         allow speedier controls for non-risks products and importers;
         The Customs Authorities and the Rades Port Authorities shall make the first one-stop trade
         control procedures office (guichet unique) at Rades Port operational and the Ministryo f
         Transport shall make the electronic platform(M         transport) which shall connect all
         operators inthe transport chain operational;
         The Inter-Ministerial Council shall adopt an action plan to reformthe regulatory framework
         o f the services sectors, to be prepared on the basis o f a regulatory assessment to be carried out
         byNCS.

83. The first disbursement for the second tranche, i.e. the reduction of the number of tariff bands
from six to five, i s a continuation o f the trade policy reforms discussed under Prior Actions, and the
analysis o f challenges and outcomes applies correspondingly.

84. The second disbursement condition concerns the implementation o f a system of selective import
control management. The main challenge for the effective implementation o f this measure consists
o f overcoming the reluctance o f agents in charge o f border control to accept a risk-based control ratio
o f less than 100 percent as providing sufficient security. This challenge will be addressed through
information and training events organized by the respective services. The expected outcome is that
cost and delays due to technical controls will be reduced. It is expected that the share o f imports
transactions subjected to technical controls will decrease from 100% in2008 to less in2010.


                                                     26

85. The third disbursement condition refers to the operationalization o f a one-stop shop on trade
control procedures at Rad& port, and the establishment o f an electronic platform for trade
documents ("liasse de transport"). The port o f Rades is Tunisia's largest port, handling 90 percent o f
national merchandise container traffic and 22 percent of total maritime traffic. The challenge here i s
that these reforms require the collaboration of all the agencies that are intervening at the border, and
some agencies seem to date better placed than others to put the systems in place on time. But the
Government has indicated its determination to work with all the agencies in order to achieve the
objectives in a timely manner. The measure is among the "Presidential Measures" announced in
December 23rd, 2008. The buildingconstruction o f the one-stop shop has begun and is advanced and
preparatory legislative work is underway. The expected outcome from this reform is that delays
between entry and exit inthe port o f Rad& will be reduced. It is expected that the average time o fport
clearance will fall from 5.6 days in2008 to less than 3 days in2010.

86. The fourth disbursement condition calls for the adoption o f an action plan for a regulatory
reform of services sectors based on the regulatory diagnostics. This measure i s aimed at upgrading
the capacity and capability of firms in services sectors with strong export potential.          The main
implementation challenge results from the very specific profiles and needs o f firms in the target
sectors (e.g.,    medical and paramedical,        legal, accounting,    and engmeering services)       and
correspondingly different upgrading requirements. Inorder to address this challenge, the Government
i s developing an information system that will comprise statistics on sectoral characteristics and trade
flows, as well as documentation on the regulatory environment. The expected outcome i s that the
reform program will be allocated sufficient funds to carry out envisaged activities such as advisory
services and financial support for firms in the target sectors and that at least three activities proposed
inthe actionplan arereflectedinofficialdocuments.

Further Improve the Business Climate

87. The objective o f this component i s to further improve the business climate through the following
three axes, also all critical elements o f the government's program inthe area o f investment climate:
     0   Ease business entry and operations
     0   Strengthen the application o f the competition law
     0   Improve regulation and information on labor

88. The prior actions for this component are:

         The Inter-Ministerial Council has adopted a draft law amending the Urban and Regional
         Development Code (Code de l'amtnagement du territoire et de l'urbanisme), in order to
         reduce the time necessary for businesses to acquire industrialland;
         The Inter-Ministerial Council has adopted a draft L a w amending the Law No. 95-44 dated
         M a y 2, 1995 regarding the Regstry o f Commerce, in order to ensure an effective updating o f
         the information contained insuch Regstry.


89.    The main objective o f the revision of the urban code i s to reduce the complexity and time cost
involved in accessing industrial land. The government has already taken measures to increase the
supply o findustrial landbut an important issue is the current complexity o fthe procedures involved in
dividing up existing lots in industrial zones. Ineffect, lots are standardized and are often too large for
the needs o f firms. A revision o f the relevant articles o f the UrbanCode would make it easier to divide
lots into several smaller parts and would therefore greatly improve the attractiveness o f industrial
zones for firms and improve access to land for business use. The expected outcome i s that by 2010,
the average delay for approving an industrial zone outside o f the areas with existing urban
development plan will be reduced from three year and half in 2008 to 6 months (average delay


                                                     27

reduced by 3 years!). Furthermore, the average delay for allotting land within an approved industrial
zone would be cut by 6 months.

90.   The objective o f the new legal framework on the Registry of Commerce is to allow for the
building an integrated, up-to-date electronic registry and making it operational. Existing firms'
registries are regionally-based (from the statistics bureau, the Chamber o f Commerce, the tax
administration, etc.) and are outdated and display large mismatches across sources. This is a major
impediment since information on firms in operation is key to adequate policymalung, essential for
business development and important for transparency and governance. The expected outcome of this
reform i s that the business registry will be improved, as measured by the number o f companies
recorded with updated data and the number o f online consultations o f the regstry. This prior action
would also prepare the ground for the subsequent creation o f a unique identification system across
different public agencies (see second tranche condition for this component).

91. The second-tranche disbursement conditions are :

         The Prime Minister shall sign an executive order     (e)     reducing by half the number o f
         activities where operators are required to obtain a prior authorization in order to start their
         businesses
     0   The Inter-Ministerial Council shall adopt an action plan for the establishment o f a unique
         common identification number for businesses to be used by the National Statistics Institute,
         the tax authorities and the social security authorities, based on a feasibility study to be
         conducted with the support of the Bank.
         The Competition Council shall be requested by the relevant sector Ministries to conduct a
         regulatory and competition assessment o f businesses in two new sectors within the services
         sector.


92.   The reduction of prior authorizations i s a continuation of a policy that has been implemented
for years and supported by similar programs. Under E C A L IVYthe list of activities subjected to prior
authorization was brought down to 115, from 225. Under this program, the number o f remaining
authorizations would be reduced to 48 by 2010 and replaced with the requirement to comply with the
terms and conditions o f specified business conduct rules ("cahier des charges"). The Government has
already established lists o f activities concerned and has started worlung with the professions. A
challenge would be to select the activities where prior authorizations present big constraints and result
in large forgone investments. The Government's objective is to boost private investment and private
sector development and that the focus will be on the most important sectors. The expected outcome o f
this reform (along with accompanying measures identified inthe program matrix) is that the growth of
the number o f companies created in the sectors where prior authorizations have been eliminated will
be superior to the national average.

93.    The adoption o f an action plan for the establishment o f the unique identificationnumber is a
key building block to a reform crucial for transparency and governance. A unique identification
number for businesses to be used by the National Statistics Institute, the tax authorities and the social
security authorities would go a long way in enhancing fiscal revenue and transparency. The main
challenge is however that this measure requires the collaboration o f several entities within the
government and i s a challengmg reform to implement technically. It is also a politically challenging
reform as many will resist the reform within the Government and protection o f private data provisions
i s another obstacle. The Government has requested a TA from the Bank to help bring international
experience on how to implement this. The expected outcome from this measure is the identification by
a government's official document o f the institution in charge o f the implementation o f the unique
identificationnumber.


                                                  28

94. The third disbursement condition calls for the Competition Council to conduct a regulatory and
competition assessment o f businesses in two different services sectors, by a request from the
Government Authorities. Since its creation in 2005, its financial and administrative independence has
been reinforcedbut its activity and impact inservices sectors have remained limited. The objective o f
the proposed measure i s to foster competition, which will inturn contribute to increasing productivity
and enhancing competitiveness o f Tunisian firms as well as encouraging private sector investment.
Strengthening the role of the Competition Council is a key component o f this objective. The main
challenge concerns the limited human resources o f the Council and will be overcome by another
measure supported by the ICL program (see program matrix) and designed to increase the number o f
rapporteurs in 2009 and 2010. The exuected outcome is that anti-competitive practices will be
reduced in the two sectors where the Competition Council has conducted an assessment. Bank's
supervision missions will review the results o f the assessments conducted by the Council and monitor
whether the sectoral competition assessments contain concrete actionable recommendations on pro
competitive policy or regulatory changes

Enhance the Capacity of the Financial Sector to Finance Investment

95. The objective o f this component i s to strengthen the financial sector with a strong focus on non-
banking finance. It i s pursuedthroughthe following four pillars:

    0   Improve the performance and the risk management o f the financial sector
        Enhance the development of venture capital and regulatedmutual funds
    0   Strengthen the Tunis Stock Exchange depth and liquidity
    0   Develop the microfinance market inTunisia

96. The prior action for this component is:

        The Law No. 2008-78 dated December 22,2008 has been enacted. Such Law amends the Law
        No. 88-92 dated August 2, 1988regardingventure capital companies (SociCtCs
        -
        d'Investissement   a CapitalRisque), and mutual venture funds (Fonds Communs & Placement
        -arisque), inorderto: (i) encourage venture capital companies' risk tahng by eliminating pre-
        determined exit conditions and basing exit from financedprojects on the performance of the
        venture capital company at the time o fthe exit; (ii)
                                                            simplify taxation o fventure capital
        companies; (iii)  encourage venture capital companies to invest inregional development areas;
        (iv) eliminate the requirement that mutual venture funds must liberatethe totality o f the
        subscribed funds inorder to benefit from tax exemption.

97.   Tunisian SICARs (venture capital companies) currently operate like banks, providing capital
under pre-determined exit conditions. The objectives o f amendingthe law on SICARs are to make
exit conditions dependent on the actual performance o f firms and not on a predetermined price
("contrat de portage"). The challenge i s that the success o f the implementation is in the hands o f the
banks as most o f the SICARs are owned by banks. The banks would probably overcome some o f their
reluctance by investing more resources in the training of their specialized staff and their potential
clients on venture capital financing. The expected outcome o f this new legal framework i s that it will
encourage SICARs' risk talung and enhance access to non-banking finance to accompany firms'
development as measured by the volume o f projects financed. Another objective o f the law is to
support regional development o f SICARS outside o f Tunis.The challenge here will be to convince the
SICARs to invest in regional projects based on return on investment. The new law will also include
provisions to improve return on investments for the FCPR.




                                                   29

98. The second-tranche disbursement conditions are :

         The Central BankofTunisia shall publishstatistics for 2010 that shall show a decrease inthe
         rate ofnon-performing loans to fifteen percent (15%), and an increase inprovisioning o fnon-
         performing loans to seventy percent (70%).
    0    The Stock Market shall publish its annual reports that shall show an increase o f the stock
         market capitalization to at least twenty percent (20%) o f the Borrower's Gross Domestic
         Product, due inparticular to the increased number of privatizations implemented through the
         stock market.
    0    The Government shall adopt institutional and regulatory provisions in order to improve the
         performance o f the Borrower's micro-finance market, to be adopted on the basis o f a study to
         be carried out by the Ministry o f Finance.

99.    Reducing the rate o f non-performing loans (NPLs) to 15 percent and increasing provisioning
to 70 percent are crucial to shore up the banlung system and enhance its competitiveness and
effectiveness. With the growing global financial crisis facing all economies, the challenge will be, on
the one hand, to stick to these targets and to implement a dynamic approach to reducing NPLs,
including a better risk management system and, on the other hand, to avoid a credit crunch which
could lead to higher level of companies defaulting and therefore higher level o f WLs. An added risk
would be related to the consequences o f the global financial crisis on the tourism sector, which could
inflate NPLs. However, the Central Bank remains confident that these targets will be met, given past
trends and the effectiveness o f their NPL-reducingplan.The expected outcome would be to strengthen
bank's balance sheets and put access to finance on a strong footing, so the intermediation margin
would fall from its baseline level (2007).

100. The increase in stock market capitalization rests critically on revitalizing the privatization
process through the stock exchange. The objective is to significantly develop the capitalization o f the
stock exchange with a target o f at least 20 percent o f GDP by the end o f 2010. This i s sought primarily
through a shift in the Government's mode o f privatization o f public enterprises. The Government i s
determined to channel a large proportion o f plannedprivatization operations through the stock market
and to open partially the capital o f some public enterprises to the public. The challenge here lies inthe
feasibility o f the privatization process with a market under the stress o f the actual financial crisis.
However, the government is committed to pursue these objectives. The expected outcome is that the
depth and the liquidity o f the financial market will be reinforced.

101. The third disbursement condition refers to the development o fthe market for microfinance. In
Tunisia, the Microfinance Law currently provides that the only legal entity that can carry out micro-
lending activities i s the BTS (Banque Tunisienne de Solidarite? through a network o f microcredit
associations to which it provides finances. Close to 90 percent o f microfinance clients are served by
the BTS, the remaining borrowers are being served by a micro-lending program operated by an
internationalNGO, currently operating outside the law under permission by the Tunisian Authorities.
This legal and regulatory framework poses major constraints to the development o f microfinance
activities, including interest rate caps imposed on all relevant types o f lending and lack o f competition.
The objective o f the measure supported by the I C L program i s to reassess institutional and regulatory
arrangements with the view to increase the effectiveness o f microcredit provision. The main challenge
would be to build strong ownership o f these reforms among Tunisian stakeholders who prefer this
status quo. This challenge will be addressed by making sure that the study carried out in 2009 is
undertaken by an independent expert with relevant international experience and good knowledge o f
particularities o f the Tunisian model. The expected outcome is that new institutional and regulatory
measures will support the establishment o f a level playing field for different players and make it
possible for these players to offer their services to different segments o f the microfinance market,

measuresthat the Government believes are necessary andpolitically possible.

The policy matrixreflects the Government's priorities andlessons learnt bythe three institutions insupporting
similar programs o fthe Government. The Bankhas been flexible in boththe loanamount, Government

moving quickly to accompany the Government's commitment to accelerate reforms inthis context.

The Government has asked the Bank to maintain the focus of this program on three areas: trade integration,
business climate and financial sector, i.e., all crucial part o f the Government growth andjob creation program.
This focus allows the Bank's efforts to be more effective and to choose prior actions and second-tranche
conditions that are both criticalto the success

performance-based financial support

The selected prior actions and second-tranche disbursement conditions can be effectively monitored, providing
predictable and performance based financial support. Tunisia has always strived to implement all the measureso f
its program matrix inthe past, not to mention prior actions and disbursement conditions. Recourse to waiver has
beenexceptional inthe past.

 102. The actions supported by this operation-- enhancing Tunisian firms' competitiveness through
reducing trade transaction costs, increasing access to finance and enhancing the business climate are
expected to support growth and provide employment opportunities for the youth and university
graduates (one o f the key objectives o f the Government). Inother words, to the extent that the reforms
succeed in helping Tunisia withstandthe consequences of the global financial crisis and in increasing
growth in the medium term, employment opportunities should increase and the poor should benefit.

Generally spealung, faster growth would lead to increasedjob creation, thereby supporting household
income (7 percent o f the population is considered as

103. More specifically, the program does not support any reforms that are expected to have
significant negative impact on the poor and a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) was
considered not to be warranted. At this stage, there are no specific measures aimed at changing
subsidies (which are a central element of Tunisia's public finance program) although this would o f
course present an important need for PSIA if reforms were to be carried out in the fbture. The tariff
reform-reduction     o f tariff bands and o f non-preferential tariff rates- will, with a high degree o f
probability, benefit the poor through lower prices o f clothing, footwear and other items that feature
prominently inlow income consumptionbundles.

104. The distributive effects o f tariff reforms were analyzed thoroughly in the World Bank Global
Integration Study (World Bank 2008a). The starting point o f the analysis is that Tunisia's main tariff
issue is its dispersion, inparticular the large gap betweenpreferential and non-preferential tariffs. For
instance, the tariff vis-&vis the EU, where Tunisia derives 60 percent o f its imports, is zero for
industrial goods compared to 21.6 percent for non-preferential partners. Simulations in the GIS
showed that the welfare cost of tariff dispersion now dominates gain from further preferential tariff
dismantling. Tariff gaps indeed create a trade diversion phenomenon and fbel fraud and parallel
markets. Gradually reducingtariff gaps is therefore overall welfare-enhancing.

 105. However, while tariff reduction is good for consumers and welfare overall, it will affect
Tunisia's economic sectors differently. The GIS found that the worst affected sectors -wood and
paper products, metals and products, and transport equipment -would see a contraction inoutput o f
less than 10 percent after about ten years as a result o f cutting tariffs on imports from non-EU sources
by 25 percent (much higher than the implicit 17 percent tariff reduction supported by the program).
The report found that even when import competing sectors contract in response to tariff cuts, the
production units that remain are more competitive, and can also improve their export performance,
albeit sometimes from a very low base.


                    IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

 106. Implementation and coordination responsibilities: The responsibility for implementing the
program in Government rests with the Ministry o f Development and International Cooperation which
 will coordinate all relevant activities with other Ministries. The Government will take the lead in
 monitoring progress in implementation, both in the context o f this operation as well as in the overall
 context o f the NDP implementation.

 107. Supervision by the Bank: Regular supervision will allow the Bank to continue providing
 policy advice and technical assistance to the institutions involved in the implementation o f the
 program o f reform.     The Bank will continue to maintain continuous dialogue with' the relevant
 Government ministries and will conduct regular reviews in close collaboration with other partners.
 This will take the form o f joint missions with the EC and the AfDB and shared analytical
 underpinnings.

 108. Monitoring and Evaluation: The monitoring and evaluation o f the program and its expected
 results will be fully embedded in the M&E framework o f the NDP. The World Bank and other
 development partners will continue to provide support to the Government to strengthen M&E,
 improve data quality and management and enhance capacity for using development outcomes to
 inform policy making. The Bank's program o f investment lending incorporates aspects o f M&E in

naturally feed into the overall dialogue on the ICL.


                                        FIDUCIARYASPECTS

109. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), a core diagnostic undertaken by the
Bank in 2004, shows that the fiduciary framework o f the Government o f Tunisia is basically sound
and provides a strong control environment. The main findings o f the CFAA are that the Tunisian
public financial management system i s reliable and that the related fiduciary risk i s low. The complete
budget process (preparation, planning, and negotiation with line-ministers) is sound. The budget
execution i s also o f good quality andreliable.

110. The reporting and accounting are reliable, even though there is a room for improvement and
modernization; the computerization of the budget and accounting is rather simple, but well spread
among the public operators and its architecture allows a timely reporting. The cash and debt
managements are made ina professionalway, due notably to a strong technical assistance o f the Bank.
The whole area o f control and audit i s comprehensive and reliable, but still lacking sufficient public
disclosure, notably for the annual report o f the Cours des Comptes which is only partially disclosed.

111. Although the CFAA was conducted about five years ago, yearly CPIA assessments based on
Bank expert knowledge continue to point to a low fiduciary risk. However, the CFAA did identify a
few areas o f improvements that are still relevant. As part o f the DPL dialogue, the Government has
accepted to launch a PEFA inthe first quarter o f 2009 with the support o f the World Bank and the EC.
This planned exercise will be an opportunity to assess the progress on the PFM reform agenda and
would be used by the Government to monitor areas where performance will need to be improved.


                                  DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING

112. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
support and will be disbursed in two instalments. Once the loan i s approved by the World Bank's
board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the loan will be disbursed in compliance with the
stipulated tranche release conditions. Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective,
the proceeds o f the first tranche will be deposited by IBRD in an account designated by the Borrower
and acceptable to the World Bank at the Central Bank o f Tunisia at the request o f the Borrower. The
proceeds o f the second tranche will be deposited after all the conditions o f the second tranche release
are met. The Borrower should ensure that upon the deposit o f the Loan into said account, an
equivalent amount i s credited in the treasury current account at the Central Bank. The approved
tranches releases will not be tied to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements. The
administration o f this loan will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Finance.

113. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account
and credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds o f the loan are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to
promptly upon notice refund an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to IBRD. Amounts
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration o f this loan will be the
responsibility o fthe Central Bank.

                                   ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

114. The ICLprogram i s a development policy loan in support of a program o freforms for which the
environmental requirements of OPBP8.60 apply. Overall, policies supported by the proposedloan are
not likely to have any significant direct effects on the environment andnatural resources and safeguard
policies (such as OP 4.01 Environmental Impact Assessment) do not apply to this operation.

115. There i s however one measure supported by the ICL program whose possible environmental
impact deserves attention. The measure i s related to the revision of the urban code, which is intended
to allow for the creation o f smaller lots o f industrial land in order to reduce the time requiredto obtain
industrial land. Tunisia's legal framework provides for the necessary measures to monitor and mitigate
the likely effects of the new lots allocation system on the environment or natural resources o f Tunisia.
Article 11o f the urban code and decree No. 2005-1991 dated July 11,2005 provide that, depending on
their size, all types of adaptation or construction work are subject to either a prospective impact
evaluation study or a set o f specific rules determined by the Ministry o f Environment. Based on the
findings o f the impact evaluation study, the Ministry o f Environment might request modifications of
the proposed work in order to avoid or mitigate any impact on the environment. Tunisia's legal
framework in the area o f environment thus provides for reasonable safeguard for avoidinghitigating
the possible negative environment impact o fthe revision o f the urban code.


                                   RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION

116. At this critical juncture, the program faces two main risks. The first risk is related to the direct
impact of the global financial crisis on Tunisia's growth and development. Slow growth in Europe i s
bound to affect Tunisia through various channels, chiefly exports, FDI and remittances. Growth in
Tunisia may thus slow downdemporarily or persistently, depending on the duration o f the recession in
Europe. By accelerating the series reforms through this program, the Government expects to mitigate
the potential growth risk from EU contagion.            The Government's strategy i s to recognize that
Tunisia's economy is small compared to the European market, and that enhanced competitiveness in
these difficult times may help Tunisia seize opportunities out o f the global crisis. In addition,
Tunisia's development partners have come together to provide a common platform o f support to help
the country respondto the more difficult external environment.

117. The second risk relates to the expected response o f the private sector to the reforms whlch may
be slow or muted given the global economic uncertainties. This would translate into lower increases
in private investment. To mitigate this risk, the Government expects to step up investment climate
reforms, support access to finance for enterprises and improve its communication strategy in order to
enhance private investment. Furthermore, as discussed above, Tunisia's offshore sector has an
exceptional "enclave" business environment, and i s expected to continue to attract FDIs.

118. Yet, other risks to growth and this program's objectives cannot be ruled out. These include
droughts, regional instability and concerns o f terrorist attacks in the Maghreb Region. Regonal
insecurity could affect Tunisia in the coming years, with tourism failing to reach the expected levels,
and Tunisia losing some o f its attractiveness for foreign investors. On the other hand, drought typically
reduces agricultural output significantly and can claim up to 1 percentage point o f growth. However,
as shown inthe macroeconomic section o f this document, Tunisia has been extremely resilient to these
types o f shocks and the economy has always rapidly rebounded thanks to pro-active macroeconomic
policies and continuous structural reforms.

119. Major risks related to the implementation of specific program components are not foreseen
because the reforms are mature, underpinned by sound analytics, supported by technical assistance

                                                      34

(for instance tariff reform) and widely discussed within the Government and with donors. The synergy
between reform areas i s crucial. For instance, developing non-banking finance will critically depend
on the pace o f reforms in the banking sector advancing well. Indeed, the banlung sector
overwhelmingly dominates the financial sector and is the largest player inthe non-banking segment o f
the financial sector. Rapid progress on banlung reform measures i s thus needed for an impact o f non-
banking finance measures. Inparticular, the level o f non-performing loans should decrease from their
current level (17.4 percent) and the 2006 bankinglaw shouldbe fully implemented.

120. The proposed program provides a key underpinningto the results-based framework in the new
CPS that i s under preparation. Policy dialogue with the Government inthe context o f the preparation
and implementation o f the CPS should help maintain the reform momentum to achieve the key
expected outcomes and thus mitigate some o f the risks attached to specific components o f the
program. The Bank will continue to work with the government o f Tunisia to design and implement
tailored technical assistance program as needed to ensure effective implementation o f the proposed
reforms.

Par ailleurs, les &carts de productivitci! par rapport aux pays de

Cette crise n'a pas affecte l a place financiire tunisienne pour
plusieurs raisons : l e s y s t k de t i t r i s a t i o n demeure f o r t
limit&et ne concerne que deux opcirrations bien encadrees pour un
montant inferieur          a 300 millions d'USD. Les pr&ts fonciers sont

c a p c i s de remboursement des bedficiaires e t ne representent
                                                     ,
que 10 % des engagements bancaires. La capitalisation boursiire
ne reprksente que l e cinquihe du PIB. Les placements des
reserves tunisiennes en depises sont want a eux regis par des
rQgles prudentielles strictes e t sont sous fonne de t i t r e s
sowerains en dollars e t en euros e t dans l a limite de 30 % de
dep6ts auprgs des banques de premier rang.


Au niveau de l a sphere reelle,               des conditions de credit
defavorables e t une confiance des menages e t des entreprises
fortement degradee &sent           sensiblement sur l a demande dans fes
principaux pays partenaires de l a Tunisie. De ce f a i t ,            les
principaux secteurs drexportation de l a Tunisie se trouvent
affect&,         en f'occurrence l e secteur des composants automobiles,
l e t e x t i l e e t l e tourisme.


D&s l'apparition des signes prbcurseurs de cette crise,                 l a
Tunisie a observe une vigilance soutenue pour prisvenir ses
cons&quences e t cerner ses retombees sur lleconomie natlonale i
travers l a crbation d'une commission pour suivre l a conjoncture
financiere e t Qconomique internationale e t proposer les mesures
correctives adbquates.


Dans ce cadre, d'importantes actions ont et& dkcidees par l e
president de l a Republique Tunisienne l e 7 novembre 2008 e t un
programme a bte adopt6 avec des mesures a court terme pour
soutenir         les    entreprises   qui connaissent    des   difficultes
notaannent les entreprises exportatrices e t des mesures d'ordre
structure1 qui s'articulent autour de 5 axes principaux, en
lloccurrence l'm&lioration des prestations fournies par l e
secteur public,            l'optimisation  des procbdures    ctu  commerce
exurieur,           l'acc81eration    des  programmes   d'investissements
publics essentiellement dans l e domaine de l'infrastructure e t
des Qquipements collectifs,            l e renforcement de l a formation
professionnelle e t l a consolidation des fondamentaux dans les
domaines dconomiques e t financiers.


Grsce & ces mesures e t xualgre l a recession k o n d q u e nobmment
dans l a Zone Euro (-2 % en 2009 e t 1 %           attendu pour 2010), l a

pour attendre 5.5% en 2010 e t 6% en 2011. Ces niveaux restent
toutefois en de75 de l'objectif de 5.1% par an retenu dans l e

tarifaires des biens en vue de les simplifier e t de reduire les

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article I V Consultation with
Tunisia
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 08/136




On August 6, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article I V consultation with Tunisia.'
Background
Tunisia's sound economic policies and pragmatic approach to structural reforms continue to bear
fruit, as evidenced by strong growth and improved social indicators. Real GDP growth averaged
5 percent a year while the macroeconomic and financial position strengthened substantially
during the past decade.
Tunisia has so far weathered relatively well the difficult international environment. Real GDP
growth increased from 5.5 percent in 2006 to 6.3 percent in 2007-a record over the last
decade-underpinned by strong performance of agriculture, energy, manufacturing and the
services sectors. On the demand side, vigorous exports and investment powered the growth
acceleration. Inflation has picked up, due mainly to rising international fuel and food prices and,
to a lesser extent, growing liquidity in the banking system reflecting increasing foreign direct
investment (FDI). Year-on-year inflation reached 6 percent in April 2008 before pulling back to
4.9 percent in June 2008. The Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) responded by tightening monetary
policy starting in the second half of 2007.

The fiscal deficit was kept within the 2007 budget target of 3 percent of GDP. Revenue exceeded
expectations owing mainly to stronger oil revenue-notably from oil companies' higher profits
due to surging oil prices and increased domestic production. The additional revenue offset
expenditure overruns mainly caused by rising direct food and fuel subsidies. Continued fiscal
consolidation and privatization receipts further reduced public debt-to-GDP ratio to about
51 percent at end-2007.
The current account deficit widened due to declining terms of trade, but the significant increase
in FDI inflows increased reserves to over US$S1/2 billion, largely sufficient to cover short-term
liabilities.

Bank performance improved significantly in 2007, including banking activity, profitability, and
prudential indicators. The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans declined from
24 percent in 2003 to 17.3 percent in 2007, largely accounted for by the proactive management
of such claims, while the provisions-to-NPLs ratio increased from 43.1 percent to 53.8 percent.
The short-term outlook is encouraging despite the challenging international environment. I n
2008, real GDP growth is projected to decelerate moderately to 5.5 percent. Inflation would
remain around 5 percent if international prices taper off and monetary policy continues to be
restrictive. High fuel and food prices are expected to widen the current account deficit to
3.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain at 3 percent of GDP, owing to
buoyant revenue, notably from the hydrocarbon sector. The medium-term outlook remains
favorable with growth projected at above 6 percent sustained by strong FDI. Risks to the

outlook are essentially related to the international environment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the notable resilience and continued strong
performance of the Tunisian economy, which has been founded on prudent and forward-looking
economic policies and market-oriented structural reforms. The outlook remains favorable, with
buoyant FDI supporting growth, although there are downside risks related mostly to the global
economic turbulence. Directors considered that the key immediate challenge confronting the
authorities will be to address the pressures arising from the global food and fuel price increases
while maintaining macroeconomic sustainability. Over the medium term, employment creation
and income growth will be key to improving economic welfare in Tunisia.

Directors commended the authorities' commitment to fiscal prudence, which will remain
essential for lowering the public debt. They endorsed the authorities' decision to contain the
fiscal deficit within the 2008 budget target, which will require tight control over current spending
and likely additional adjustments to domestic petroleum prices. They noted that buoyant fiscal
revenues, particularly from the hydrocarbon sector, have accommodated the gradual pass-
through of international oil and food price increases to domestic prices under the current
subsidy system. Directors noted, however, that the current subsidy system is not sustainable,
and suggested its replacement with a targeted safety net for the most vulnerable groups that
would better support medium-term fiscal sustainability, reduce the country's vulnerability to

shocks, and create the fiscal space for additional social and infrastructure expenditures. I n this
context, they welcomed the authorities' intention in the XIth Plan to phase out subsidies for
petroleum products by 2011 and to ensure better control of expenditures for food subsidies.

Directors supported the restrictive monetary stance of the BCT. They recommended that the
authorities stand ready to increase the BCT's key policy interest rate if inflationary pressures
intensify, given that growth still has significant momentum. They supported the BCT's efforts to
manage persistent excess liquidity in the financial system, and to continue to build an inflation-
targeting framework for monetary policy.

Directors considered that the exchange rate of the Tunisian dinar is broadly aligned with
fundamentals and that the authorities' policies are consistent with external stability. Some
Directors saw merit in an accelerated transition toward the authorities' commendable objectives
of a floating exchange rate and an inflation-targeting framework.

Directors welcomed the continued strengthening of the banking sector's performance, with
greater profitability, a decline in nonperforming loans, and improved loan-loss provisioning,
Further strengthening of the banking sector should remain a high priority as the authorities
continue to gradually open up the capital account. They welcomed the potential growth and
employment benefits of the large FDI-financed projects, but counseled prudence with respect to
real estate projects in particular, which may create a credit risk for the banking sector and
contingent liabilities for the government. Directors supported the authorities' objective of
implementing the Basel I1system by end-2009 and achieving full compliance with international
Anti-Money Launderinglcombating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards over the
medium term.

Directors welcomed the steps being taken by the authorities to deepen the global and regional
integration of the Tunisian economy. They praised the authorities for their pragmatic approach
to trade and financial integration, and noted the recent important milestone of achieving
bilateral free trade in industrial goods with the European Union. They looked forward to further
simplification and reduction of tariffs on a most-favored-nation basis.

Directors welcomed the steps aimed at further improving the business climate. They looked
forward to further progress in liberalizing the services sector and reforming the tax and customs
administration, in order to promote domestic and foreign investment.

Mr.Robert B.Zoellick
President
The World Bank Group
Washington, D.C.

                                Letter ofDevelopmentPolicy

Dear Mr.Zoellick:

Tunisia's development process has been marked by the enormous progress made in the areas
o f economic     liberalization and modernization, human resource development,             the
consolidation o f social well-being, and the steps made toward laying the groundwork for
sustainable development. All these achievements have helped our country move up the ranks
inthe group of emerging countries.

These performances have been possible because o f the efforts made and the determination
shown to persevere on the path o f reforms in various economic and social areas. This has
ensured continuity and efficiency in development work and helped improve the country's
ability to take up challenges and withstand exogenous shocks.

Having started as o f 2007 to implement the XIthDevelopment Plan (for the period 2007-1 l),
Tunisia i s now facing a harsh international environment marked by the exacerbation o f
competition at the global level, especially with the dismantling o f the Multi Fibre
Arrangement as o f 2005, the huge rise inhydrocarbon and commodity prices as o f 2007, and,
more recently, the outbreak o f the international financial crisis, which quickly triggered an
economic recession, primarily indeveloped countries.

Tunisia's real economy has been subjected to the repercussions o f this crisis because o f the
decline in a number o f export activities linked to the contraction o f international demand,

                                                      2


especially in Europe. Inlight o f this and to support enterprises affected by the crisis, shore up
economic activity, and enhance the competitiveness o f the economy, the Tunisian
Government has decided to implement a specific program consisting o f cyclical and other
structural measures,

Achieving the established objectives and strengthening the adaptability o f the national
economy require further efforts to accelerate the GDP growth rate, promote the innovative
high value-added sectors, and instill a culture o f quality in all areas. This calls for a new
generation o f structural reforms that can help the country meet these challenges and make the
most o f new opp,ortunities.

These reforms represent the continuation o f past development policies and programs and are
based on the achievements o f previous years at the same time as they draw on goals for the
future, namely, consolidating the competitive positioning o f the national economy, preparing
the services sector for the era o f openness, strengthening direct finance, and promoting
private sector vibrancy. These actions are expected to help increase the global integration o f
the national economy.

Based on these considerations, the Tunisian Government hereby requests assistance from the
World Bank to launch a new Integration Support Program (PAI), the purpose o f which i s to
build on the results o f previous reforms and measures-especially        in the context of four
programs to improve economic competitiveness (PACE Ito PACE IV) supported by the
World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the European Union-and               to sustain the
reforms initiated within the framework o f the XIth Development Plan, aimed at firmly
anchoring the national economy inthe global sphere.

I. Experienceandachievementsofpastyears

Tunisia has managed for more than a decade to achieve appreciable performances despite the
pressures generated by harsh economic circumstances marked, at the domestic level, by
adverse climatic conditions and increasing labor market pressures and, at the global level, by
political and security events, the exacerbation o f competition, the upward spiral of
hydrocarbon and commodity prices, and the outbreak o f three financial crises, the scope o f
which has affected the entire global economy.

These performances can be attributed to the soundness acquired by the national economy.
They also attest to the economy's capacity to withstand the hazards o f the national and global
economic circumstances and highlight the effectiveness o f the strategies, programs, and
policies adopted in the economic and financial areas and with respect to human resource
development, employment incentives, and social sector promotion.

                                                       3


More particularly, the performance o f the Tunisian economy i s evidenced by the
achievement o f an average growth rate o f 5.2 percent since 1996, when the Association
Agreement with the European Union became effective, as well as by the diversification o f
the production base, with an increase in the share o f the services sectors (58.2percent
in2008, compared with 47.2 percent in 1996). Such an outcome can be attributed, in
particular, to the emergence o f new, buoyant, innovative sectors, characterized by a strong
knowledge content,        the GDP share o f which has incessantly improved,               rising
from 12.8 percent in 1997 to 23.4 percent in 2008.

These performances have also been accompanied by an improvement in the contribution of
the global productivity o f factors (GPF), which rose to about 41 percent over the past five
years, compared with 36 percent on average for the period o f the IXthDevelopment Plan
(1997-2001).    This can be attributed to the boost generated by the reforms launched to
improve the business climate and ensure optimal allocation o f available resources.

Investment has developed considerably, representing 25.1 percent o f GDP in2008, compared
with 23.2 percent in 1996. This was accompanied by an increasingprivate sector contribution
(61.5 percent in2008, compared with 53.4 percent in 1996), attesting to the growing interest
inthe enhancement o fprivate initiative.

There was also fresh momentum in foreign direct investment (FDI) as a result o f the efforts
made to improve the business climate generally and develop mechanisms likely to attract
more investors o f a new type and steer them toward areas that are promising and o f priority
for the national economy, such as manufacturing industries, communications, the financial
sector, and infrastructure projects in the context o f concessions. Inthis regard, FDIincreased
by 65.4 percent in2006,        35.1 percent in2007,      and 50 percent in 2008,     excluding
privatization operations. Their share in GDP thus grew, reaching 5.6 percent in2008,
compared with 1.6 percent in 1996, and their share in global investment was 20.8 percent,
compared with 6.2 percent in 1996.

Job creation intensified, totaling 79,800 in 2008; 90 percent o f the additional demand was
thus met. Nonetheless, the rate o f unemployment remains high, at about 14 percent, although
it has started to fall by comparison with its 1997 level (16.8 percent).


Moreover, the domestic and external financial balances have been preserved. The current
account deficit and the budget deficit have been contained, respectively, at about 2.6 percent
and 2.9 percent o f GDP during the period 1997-2007,               compared with 5.9 percent
and 3.7 percent during the period 1992-96,       and inflation has been controlled, holding
at 3.1 percent in 2007, compared with 3.7 percent in 1996.

These performances resulted from the efforts made to enhance the competitiveness o f the
Tunisian economy and increase its integration into the global economy. Market share in

                                                    4


the EU grew from 0.59 percent during the period 1997-2001 to 0.62 percent currently, and
the indicator o f catch-up with EU countries reached30.2 percent for the period 1997-2007,
compared with 25.1 percent during the period 1993-96. In this context, the rate o f openness
stood at 102.6 percent in2008, compared with 86 percent in 1996, because o f the buoyancy
that has characterized foreign trade, especially in the area o f exports, whose share in GDP
grew to about 47 percent during the period 1997-2007, compared with 42.4 percent during
the period 1992-96.

In addition, the productivity gaps by comparison with EU countries seem relatively low at
about 27 percent in the sectors most open to competition, such as mechanical and electrical
industries and the textiles sector, whereas these gaps reach 55 percent in the case o f other
sectors. The program to upgrade the industrial sector that accompanied the process o f
liberalization and integration into the global economy has helped improve the competitive
capacity o f Tunisia's industrial base. The Tunisian economy thus has large margins for
improving its competitiveness and, therefore, for accelerating the rate o f growth.

At   end-2008,     4,145 industrial   enterprises had joined       the   upgrading  program,
including 474 during the period 2007-08, compared with 500 projected by the XIthPlan for
that period. The number o f approved applications totaled nearly 2,843, for an overall
investmentamount o f TD 4,670 million, and the grants made totaled TD 652 million.

An assessment o f the program revealed that it contributed greatly to modernizing the
productive apparatus, establishing quality and IT systems, and organizing management
methods. The program also helped raise the management to staff ratio from 9 percent
to 17 percent.

In addition, for further improvement of the corporate environment, a major industrial
modernization program was established. Its main objective i s to support the ongoing efforts
to restructure the industrial sector and modernize the private sector through development by
innovation and creativity, the consolidation o f quality, metrology, and standardization, the
promotion o f industrial ownership, and the improvement and facilitation o f access to
financing for small and medium-sized enterprises.

At end-October 2008, the industrial modernization program had initiated 570 actions, 417 of
which were completed for investments totaling some 27.4 million, or 86 percent o f the
program's operational budget o f 32 million. It i s noteworthy that nearly one-third o f the
investmentsrelate to quality improvement programs.

Meanwhile, major social gains were recorded during this period, as can be seen from the
improvement in the indicators related to education, higher education, vocational training,
health, and living conditions generally. For instance, life expectancy at birth was 74.8 years
in2008, compared with 71.6 years in 1996; the enrollment ratio of the six to fourteenyear-

                                                     5


old cohort climbed from 86.2 percent in 1996 to 94.8 percent in2008; and the real social
coverage rate rose from 77 percent in 1996 to 93.3 percent in2008.

These economically and socially convincing results represent the crowning o f a sustained
effort to implement wide-ranging reforms in a gradual, clear-sighted way. This reform drive
was geared especially to continuing to open up the Tunisian economy through the
completion, since January 2008, o f the program to remove customs tariffs for industrial
products, initiated in the context o f the Association Agreement with the European Union.
This action was accompanied by a gradual lowering o f customs duties with Tunisia's other
partner countries with a view to reducing trade diversion. These assorted measures paved the
way for a harmonization o f the various rules and procedures and for a reduction o f corporate
transaction costs. Inthis regard, real protection was reduced to 16 percent in2007, compared
with 73 percent in 1997.

This integration within the global economy was also pursued through the signing of
partnership agreements with other regional groupings, such as the European Free Trade
Association and the Arabic-Mediterranean Free Trade Agreement (Agadir Agreement), and
at the bilateral level with Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Libya, and Turkey.

The reform drive also concerned export promotion through the building o f export promotion
institutions and mechanisms, the adoption o f a new customs code, and the pursuit o f the
reforms launched within the framework o f two consecutive export development programs
supported by the World Bank and seeking to build the export capacity o f enterprises,
including the use o f the proposed single-bundle procedures for imports and exports and
a transport-related bundle. The thrust o f the reforms also concerned the simplification o f
customs clearance and goods removal procedures, as well as the facilitation and development
o f trade logistics. Efforts in this context were also geared toward helping exporters gain
access to new markets and strengthening the export financing pre-shipment guarantee
mechanisms.

Particular attention was also paid to encouraging private initiative and enterprise creation
through the intensification o f support and advice for new promoters, the development and
modernization o f support bodies, the simplification and reduction o f administrative red tape,
and the creation o f one-stop shops and a network o f enterprise nurseries and business centers,
technological hubs, and support structures at the regional level.

In this regard, the December 2007 promulgation of the law on economic initiative was
a decisive step forward on the path to investment liberalization and simplification o f the
procedures for enterprise creation, the protection o f investors, the facilitation o f access to
financing, and the encouragement o f micro-enterprises opening up new horizons to
promoters.

The laying o f the groundwork for a knowledge-based economy is one o f the principal
characteristics o f the work done to develop Tunisia. The efforts ongoing in this area were
intensified to ensure better use o f the available sources o f intelligence and knowledge
through modernization o f the systems o f education, training, and higher education, and their
inclusion in the knowledge-based economy, the promotion o f scientific research and
technological innovation, and the facilitation o f access to the various components o f the
knowledge-based economy, in addition to the development and intensification o f remote
services invarious areas.

The reforms also concerned improving the yield o f the tax system and modernizing the
financial sector. Indeed, a high point o f the tax reform was the promulgation o f the tax
procedures and duties code, revision o f the direct and indirect taxation rates, and
modernization o f the tax administration, especially as regards collection and control.

The financial sector, for its part, was the subject o f sweeping reforms that affected all o f its
components. In the area o f banking, the actions taken involved establishing rules for
prudential management in conformity with international standards, restructuring the sector
through the establishment o f multipurpose banking and the privatization o f a number o f
banks, and consolidating the banks' financial resources by purging their portfolios o f
problem loans and provisioning loans. Efforts were also geared toward modernizing the
services provided by expanding electronic payment systems, introducing remote clearing,
developing data centers, and diversifying financial products. The organizational framework
o f the Central Bank o f Tunisia was also restructured with a view to increasing the control o f
monetary policy and modernizing its mechanisms, inparticular by moving toward a policy o f
inflation targeting.

The financial market expanded because o f the measures adopted throughout recent years to
diversify securities, modernize mutual funds, encourage companies to become listed on the
securities exchange, develop financial security, improve the market in debt instruments,
develop risk capital, and establish an alternative market.

The insurance sector, for its part, i s experiencing real momentum in its progress and
development as a result o f the overhauling o f its legislative and institutional framework,
related to strengthening the prudential regulations, the automobile insurance reform, the
development o f life insurance and other vibrant subsectors, such as export insurance and
agricultural insurance, in addition to improving the services provided by reducing
compensation time limits and procedures, boosting the internal management of insurance
companies, and giving administrative autonomy to the general insurance committee to ensure
proper functioning o f the sector.

As regards human development, for the purposes o f better meeting the economic growth and
development needs and o f encouraging the laying o f the groundwork for a knowledge-based

                                                       7


economy, steps were taken to improve the yield o f the education, vocational training, and
higher education systems. In this context, the education and schooling policy law was
promulgated, and the university diploma system was revised through the gradual adoption o f
the LMD system in conformity with the pertinent international rules and standards and an
increase o f hiring capacity in the buoyant, labor-intensive subsectors. The arrangements
made also relate to diversifying the vocational training subsectors, increasing the capacities
o f training centers, supporting scientific research, and opening up corporations to education
and research structures so as to improve their yield and effectiveness.

Employment received particular attention and was hoisted to the highest level o f national
priorities. This position o f choice can be explained by the interest shown in the human factor
in triggering growth and achieving development objectives. It can also be explained by the
increase over the past decade in the additional demand for work and the evolution o f its
structure.

The recommended employment policy was based, in particular, on accelerating the growth
rate, promoting investment, and encouraging private initiative, as well as implementing and
strengthening programs and mechanisms designed to improve the employability o f those
seeking work and to facilitate their inclusion in the world o f work. These mechanisms,
relating especially to the creation o f the Tunisian Solidarity Bank and the National
Employment Fund and to the introduction o f a microcredit system, have, from their inception
to end-2008, benefited 528,000 persons.

Meanwhile, various measures were decreed to encourage enterprises to recruit higher
education graduates and foster private initiative, as well as to consolidate the actions o f
programs to promote the employment o f young people.

Regional development has also received particular attention through the promotion o f private
investment in the priority regions and the strengthening o f infrastructure and community
facilities, as well as consolidation o f the projects and programs designed to preserve the
environment, protect natural resources, and improve living conditions.

The reform drive is continuing more vigorously within the framework o f the XIthPlan, first
in light o f the objectives set for meeting national aspirations, especially inthe area o f growth
and job creation, and secondly in light o f the unfavorable economic developments, which
began in2007 with the upsurge in hydrocarbon and commodity prices and which continue
with the outbreak o f the financial crisis that has shaken financial markets and affected
numerous international banks.

11.     Outlook for developmentfor the period2009-11

Tunisia i s approaching a new key phase in its development process, buoyed by its
experiences and performances in all areas and aspiring to move forward and make progress
toward a better future.

On this basis, the development objectives adopted for the XIthDevelopment Plan (2007-1 1)
were formulated in conformity with the priorities identified as a result o f national aspirations
and bearing the imprint o f far-reaching changes, both domestic and international.

At the domestic level, it is worth highlighting the importance o f the demographic changes
that have occurred and the resulting challenges inthe areas o fjob creation, the health system,
and maintenance o f financial balances, as well as the pressures on natural resources. At the
international level, the economic environment i s marked by the acceleration o f changes in
light o f the expansion o f globalization, the exacerbation o f competition, and the adverse
trends characterizing the international economic scene, as well as commodity price
fluctuations and exchange rate volatility.

The mainobjectives recorded inthe XIthDevelopment Planrelate essentially to:

        Acceleration o f GDP growth to an average rate o f 6.1 percent. Achieving this
        objective in a context that has become more difficult requires the contribution of all
        the productive sectors. It will depend on the performances o f the modern services
        sector and on the consolidation o f the share o f high value-added knowledge-based
        activities, which i s expected to represent 27.5 percent o f GDP in2011, compared
        with 20.4 percent in2006.

        The targeted growth rate also assumes continued improvement o f the GPF, whose
        contribution to growth will be some 48 percent, compared with 41 percent over the
       past five years. This requires, in particular, the pursuit o f human resource
        development, the more widespread use of new information and communication
       technologies, the development o f research, and innovation for diversifying products
        and improvingtheir competitiveness; and

       Pursuit o f an income redistribution policy aimed at improving the human
       development indicator, consolidating the middle class, and reducing poverty.

Given the deep changes characterizing the domestic and international scenes as well as
national aspirations and choices, the achievement o f the above-mentioned objectives
requires:

                                                         9


        Further integration o f the national economy into the global economy through export
        promotion, inclusion in the international networks o f production and distribution, the
        garnering o f foreign direct investment, the development o f partnership relationships
        with strategic investors, the facilitation o f investment abroad by nationals, and access
        by national enterprises to external sources o f financing;

        Optimization o f the allocation o f available financial and natural resources as well as
        human resource development to ensure the efficient use o f available resources and so
        improve GPF and ensure the sustainability o f economic growth;

        Preservation o f the financial balances conducive to ensuring the soundness o f the
        economy, improving its adaptability to exogenous shocks, limiting the impacts o f the
        current economic reversals, and as far as possible meeting economic globalization
        needs. Achieving this objective depends on controlling the current account deficit,
        reducing indebtedness, preserving the budget balances, and containing inflation; and

        Consolidation o f social progress and optimization o f income policy inthe direction o f
        equity and poverty reduction, as well as establishing a positive social climate and
        strengthening the programs designed to preserve purchasing power and support
        people with special needs.

Accordingly, the fundamental pillars o f the development approach for the current
development plan (2007-1 1) are accelerating the economic growth rate, guaranteeing its
sustainability, and intensifying its employment content, while safeguarding the stability o f
the financial balances and optimizing the allocation o f available resources.

However, although the transition period for implementation o f the Free Trade Agreement
between Tunisia and the European Union ended in January2008 and the economy is
becoming more integrated into the Euro-Mediterranean space, new challenges are arising
because o f the volatility o f commodity and raw material prices and the financial crisis that
has created turmoil in the financial markets, with severe consequences for global economic
activity.

This crisis has not affected the Tunisian financial market for several reasons: the
securitization system i s still extremely small and concerns only two well-managed operations
totaling less than US$300 million. Real estate loans are granted at fixed interest rates based
on the recipient's ability to repay and represent only 10 percent o f all banking liabilities.
Market capitalization accounts for only one-fifth o f GDP. The investment o f Tunisia's
foreign currency reserves, for their part, is governed by strict prudential rules; these reserves
are maintained in the form o f sovereign securities denominated in dollars and in euros and
within the limit o f 30 percent o f deposits with first-tier banks.

                                                    10


As regards the real economy, negative credit terms and considerably diminished household
and enterprise confidence are weighing heavily on demand in Tunisia's main partner
countries. As a result, Tunisia's main export sectors-namely,         automobile components,
textiles, and tourism-are  affected.

As soon as the precursory signs o f this crisis appeared, Tunisia remained constantly vigilant
so as to forestall its consequences and perceive its effects on the national economy by
creating a committee to monitor international economic and financial developments and
propose adequate remedial measures.

In this context, major decisions on actions to be taken were made by the President o f the
Tunisian Republic on November 7, 2008 and a program was adopted with short-term
measures to support enterprises indifficulty, inparticular those involved inexporting, as well
as structural measures linked to five key areas, namely: improving public sector services,
streamlining foreign trade procedures, accelerating public investment programs essentially in
the area o f infrastructure and community facilities, strengthening vocational training, and
consolidating the economic and financial fundamentals.

As a result o f these measures and despite the economic recession, especially inthe Euro Area
(-2 percent in2009 and 1percent expected for 2010), GDP growth is projected at 4.5 percent
in2009 andwill accelerate to 5.5 percent in2010 and 6 percent in2011.These levels remain,
however, below the objective o f 6.1 percent a year adopted in the XIthPlan and result from
the slowdown inexport growth, estimated at 1percent in2009.

Efforts will continue to control inflation and contain it at 3 percent a year for the next three
years.

Preservation o f the domestic and external financial balances will be pursued; the goal i s to
contain the current account deficit and the government budget deficit at reasonable levels
compatible with the national economy's means o f financing. The amounts saved by lowering
the food and oil product subsidies are expected to allow for an increase in capital expenditure
and support to economic enterprises in2009.

Special attention will be paid to private investment through the pursuit and deepeningo f the
reforms to improve the investment climate. Inthis regard, the Tunisian Government i s firmly
committed to further intensifying and accelerating the economic and financial reforms as part
of the thrust toward extensive integration into the global economy, so as to seize the
opportunities afforded by a greatly changing environment.

To that end, and to achieve the assigned objectives and build the capacity to withstand
shocks, the Tunisian Government, in close consultation with its donors and lenders, has

                                                     11


prepared a new integration support program and wishes to obtain substantial support from the
World Bank, in the form o f a quick-disbursing operation.

111. The IntegrationSupport Program

The economic integration support program, designed in collaboration with the World Bank,
the African Development Bank, and the European Union, seeks to support the Tunisian
economy further on the path toward integration into the global economy. This follows the
major steps Tunisia has made to improve competitiveness through a series o f reforms
introduced in four consecutive programs in support of economic competitiveness.

The program is o f key importance, given its conformity with a number o f milestones for the
Tunisian economy, such as the effective establishment o f the Free Trade Area with the
European Union as o f 2008 and the preparation o f negotiations on the liberalization o f the
services and agriculture sectors, as well as the steps taken toward Tunisia's establishment as
a regional business and services market.

This program falls within a particular context, marked by the advent o f the global financial
crisis, the effects o f which are being felt by the national economy as a result o f the
contraction in external demand. The reform measures and actions planned under the program
support the objectives set inthe XIthDevelopment Plan and relate to improving the corporate
environment, facilitating the entry o f Tunisian enterprises into foreign markets, modernizing
their management methods, and consolidating the vibrant sectors that generate employment
for skilled persons.

On this basis, the program has three key components:

    1.      Reducing transaction costs and deepening commercial integration;
    2.      Improving the business climate; and
    3.      Improving access to financing.

1.      Reducing transaction costs and deepening commercial integration. This objective falls
within the framework o f a discerning use o f the opportunities afforded by the global market
and the achievement o f sustained integration within the global economy. The actions
envisaged in this context will relate especially to the continued reconciliation o f the
merchandise tariff systems, so as to simplify them and reduce the risks o f trade diversion, as
well as to the convergence o f standards and regulations with the mainmarkets targeted.

They will also concern the development o f export services in light o f the sector's growing
vibrancy, its huge potential, and its contribution to GDP growth and job creation. Particular
attention will also have to be paid, inthe context o f this program, to streamlining the logistic

                                                         12


   services, given their role in increasing the competitiveness o f the economy and facilitating
   foreign trade procedures.

   More concretely, the commercial reform measures will relate to three key areas:

          Deepening the reforms related to merchandise trade by reducing the number o f
          customs tariffs from nine to six in2009 and from six to five at end-2010 and thus
          paving the way for a reduction in the average tariff to 17 percent in2010, clarifying
          the import control system, facilitating commercial procedures and transactions,
          strengthening the standards and rules on quality, and consolidating the mechanisms to
          combat counterfeiting;

          Pursuing the reforms related to trade in services by increasing the prerogatives o f the
          National Services Council through the creation o f a management unit for each
          objective, endowed with adequate budgetary and human resources, as well as
          adopting an action plan for the reform and promotion o f those services sectors with
          high commercial potential, based on an analysis o f the regulatory framework to be
          established. The key areas o f reform in this regard should also concern improving the
          statistics apparatus related to services activities and trade, by adopting a common
          classification o f services, and creating an information and statistics system on
          international services activities and trade, as well as adopting an action plan for
          upgrading the services sectors so as to encourage and facilitate exports; and

          Streamlining logistic services by reducing port transit costs and time limits and
          facilitating international logistic operations for exporters and service providers on the
          basis o f the new customs code arrangements.

   2.     Improving the business climate. The business climate has received special attention
   and, over the past few years, has established a record o f development work structured around
   private sector vibrancy and integration into the globalized economy. Improvement o f the
   business climate will continue in the coming period with a view to increasing the
   competitiveness o f the economy further, encouraging private initiative, and attracting more
   foreign direct investment.

*,
   The key areas o fthe program will be geared, at this level, toward:


       0  Continuing to improve the administrative arrangements governing corporate activities
          by effectively reducing to seven days the time limit for VAT refunds on export
          products, replacing one-half o f the remaining approvals with specifications,
          establishing and putting online the new trade register system, and reducing the time
          limits for making industrial land available;

                                                     13


        Improving reporting and the regulatory framework for better convergence o f labor
        supply and demand by compiling a guide on labor legislation for enterprises,
        preparing training modules on labor regulations, and studying some aspects o f the
        labor market; and

        Increasing the protection o f investors in the society and the transparency o f market
        corporations by amending the companies code to enable minority shareholders to gain
        access to information on a company's position, go to court, and manage risky
        operations involving conflicts between the personal interests o f executives and those
        o f the corporation they manage.

The legislative and regulatory environment o f competition, for its part, has received special
attention, in that the attributions o f the competition council have been strengthened, its
administrative and financial autonomy has been established, and a requirement has been
introduced to seek its opinion on certain legal documents. Actions will continue in the
context o f this program to strengthen its involvement in specification reviews and increase
the human resources available to it.

3.      Improving access to financing. The development o f nonbank financing for enterprises
represents the pillar o f the financial policy reform for the coming period. The aim i s to
consolidate the banks' financial resources, reduce the over-indebtedness o f enterprises and
increase their capital, and shore up the economy against vulnerabilities to shocks in a context
o f growing integration.

With this in mind, the logic o f financing should be based on better risk management by the
banks and proper assessment o f the profitability o f investment projects, in addition to
implementing the Basel I1 principles on prudential regulation, reforming the investment
capital legislative and regulatory framework, increasing the depth and liquidity o f the
financial market with a view to giving a further boost to the Tunis securities exchange and
enhancing its role in the financing o f private investment, and developing microfinance
activities.

The reforms adopted by the program inthis area will relate to:


    0   Improving the effectiveness and competitiveness o f the banking sector by reducing
        the weight o f classified claims inbank portfolios to 15 percent in2010, increasing the
        rate o f provisioning by the banks to 70 percent in2010, and establishing a Basel I1
        action plan, as well as strengthening the guarantee system by developing the
        indemnification arrangements and pricing policy o f the Tunisian Guarantee
        Company;

                                                    14


       Reforming the legislative and regulatory framework o f investment capital, in
       particular by improving conditions for the outflow o f project capital on the basis o f
       corporate performances and adopting an accounting framework specific to risk capital
       activities, based on international accounting measures regarding risk capital;

       Building the depth and liquidity o f the financial market, in particular.by increasing
       privatizations through the securities exchange, enhancing the liquidity o f the share
       and bond markets by raising the share o f treasury bills for auction that foreigners are
       allowed to acquire from 20 percent to 30 percent, and authorizing international
       institutions to issue debenture debt on the Tunisian financial market on the same
       conditions as local operators; and

       Developing microfinance activities by improving the performance o f the Tunisian
       Solidarity Bank.

In conclusion, the Tunisian Government believes the program o f reforms outlined in this
letter will enable Tunisia to consolidate its process o f integration into the global economy,
increase its competitiveness, and take up the challenges it will face in the future, especially as
Tunisia will have, in coming years, to bear the impact o f the global economic crisis that i s
currently rocking the economies o f all the countries inthe world. The implementation o f this
program would be largely facilitated if the request for a quick-disbursing operation in the
amount o f US$250 million were to be accepted by the World Bank.
