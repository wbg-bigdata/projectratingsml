I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a
class of toxic chemicals that, as their name suggests, persist in the environment for long periods of time,
are able to travel long distances from their points of origin, carried by natural soil, water and air processes,
and accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms. Exposure to POPs can lead to serious health effects
such as reproductive or development disorders, nervous system damage, and immune system diseases.

Given their toxicity, persistence and trans-boundary properties, in 2004 the global community adopted a
multilateral environmental agreement to address the challenge. The Stockholm Convention on POPs1
requires Parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment. China
was actively involved in the development of the Convention, participating in all preparatory meetings and
ratifying the agreement on August 13, 2004. At the time of project appraisal, the Stockholm Convention
addressed twelve distinct POPs divided across three broad categories: pesticides, unintended by-products
and industrial chemicals2.

Sector and Country Contexts: As a Party to the Stockholm Convention, China’s obligations include
eliminating the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in equipment by 2025, and pursuing
environmentally sound PCB waste management and management of equipment containing PCBs as soon
as possible, but no later than 2028. Used in industry as heat exchange fluids, in electric transformers and
capacitors, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics, PCBs are shown to disrupt
endocrine and immune systems, cause developmental and behavioral disorders in children, and possess
carcinogenic properties.

PCBs were manufactured in China by three production facilities in Xi’an, Suzhou, and Shanghai from
1965 to early 1974. Production of penta-chlorobiphenyl (PCB5) was used in open systems, such as oil
paints while that of tri-chlorobiphenyl (PCB3) was principally used in the manufacture of capacitors used
in the electric power supply industry.

In the 1980s, it was recognized that China’s PCB problems emanated principally from the electric power
sector and some large-scale industrial enterprises. The Chinese Government therefore, issued a series of
regulations regarding the import, collection, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of PCBs and
PCB-containing electrical equipment, compelled by growing health and environmental concerns. At this
stage, the bulk of PCB-containing capacitors were removed from service and stored in a unique system of
temporary underground storage facilities, referred to as “concrete coffins?, or in caves. And, in this same
period, a series of severe PCB contamination incidents occurred in Zhejiang Province.

 PCBs are one group of compounds listed in the Stockholm Convention’s initial ‘dirty dozen’, which also included a range of
pesticides, industrial chemicals and by-products. In 2009, the Stockholm Convention amended its Annexes A, B and C to include
9 new POPs, and in 2011 was further expanded to include the insecticide endosulphan.


                                                             1
At the time of project appraisal, investigations supported by bilateral activities (the Italian Persistent
Organic Pollutants Trust Fund3 (Italian POPs TF) and the Canadian POPs Trust Fund (CPTF)4) indicated
that many ‘temporary’ disposal sites had exceeded or were approaching their design lifetime and that
there were indications that some of the sites were leaking PCBs into the surrounding environment.

Project Background: The project was designed to help China address challenges with respect to PCB
management and disposal emanating from incomplete PCB baseline data, weak institutional and policy
framework for PCB management, lack of PCB disposal technology and facilities, and insufficient public
awareness. Given the vast size of China and the scope of the problem, the project adopted a
demonstration approach in order to focus on determining and demonstrating the most cost-effective
practices and technologies to address PCB management and disposal issues at the provincial level,
through which the foundation would be laid to design and cost a full scale replicable nation-wide PCB
management program in future. Zhejiang Province was selected as the demonstration province based on
its history with PCB leakage incidents and its overall transformer capacity, data for which had been made
available through implementation of activities under the Italian POPs Trust Fund.

At the global level, the project was designed to address China’s obligations under the Stockholm
Convention, while in tandem contributing indirectly to the objectives of two other chemicals-related
multilateral environmental agreements, the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior
Informed Consent Procedures for Certain Hazardous Chemicals. At the national level, the project sought
to support implementation of China’s 2003 National Program for Construction of Hazardous and Medical
Waste Disposal Facilities, as well as the country’s ongoing efforts to reduce the risks to human health and
the environment from industrial pollution.

Rationale for World Bank Support: The Bank possesses experience in streamlining environmental health
considerations into solid and hazardous waste and wastewater management, as well as control of pollution
from industry, energy, agriculture and health care activities, which laid the foundations to extend
assistance to clients in complying with their obligations under the Stockholm Convention through the
Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Convention’s interim financial mechanism. In addition, the Bank
was assisting China in tackling issues of PCB management through a CPTF-funded grant that supported
the development of methodologies and training programs for PCB site assessment and remediation 5 ,
which both co-financed the project’s GEF preparation grant and informed the project’s design. In tandem,
funding from the Italian POPs Fund supported the development of a PCB inventory methodology in
Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces and launched preparation of a draft strategy on approaches and options
for disposal and reduction of PCBs.

The Bank’s technical and policy expertise in waste and chemicals management, complemented by its
experience in the design and implementation of GEF projects, made it well placed to extend assistance to
China’s POPs program in line with the GEF 3 Focal Area Strategy on Persistent Organic Pollutants and
consistent with the Bank’s 2006-2010 Country Partnership Strategy for China.

   The Italian Grant for an Italian Persistent Organic Pollutants Fund at the World Bank (TF051188) became effective in December 2002. In all,
the project carried out 21 activities focused on two provinces – Zhejiang and Liaoning.

   The CPTF was established by the established by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). For more information visit:

   A $175 K CPTF-funded project supported a training program in China that helped: promote awareness of PCB issues; build capacity to gather
inventory data for PCBs, inspect storage sites, collect environmental data samples and work safely with potentially contaminated equipment and
sites; and, assess PCB destruction technologies.

                                                                      2
1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project’s development objective (PDO), as captured in the project appraisal document (PAD), was to
identify and demonstrate environmentally-sound and cost-effective policies, procedures and techniques
for safe management and disposal of China’s temporarily-stored PCBs, their associated PCB-
contaminated wastes and remaining in-use PCBs equipment. The original Grant Agreement6 synthesized
this broad objective to read: assist the Recipient in mitigating the impact of PCB threats to human health
and the environment by establishing a cost effective framework for cleaning up PCB.

The Global Environment Objective (GEO), as captured in the PAD, called for the Project to help China
eliminate PCBs, one of the 12 POPs covered by the Stockholm Convention, given the potential harm they
bring to human health and to the environment.
Two related Outcome Indicators were identified:
    1. Lessons from Zhejiang Province’s demonstration of the most cost-effective, environmentally-safe
         policies and methods for identifying, excavating and cleaning-up temporary PCB storage sites
         documented and disseminated nationally and globally;
    2. China’s national PCB management program and policy/regulations [are] refined to reflect lessons
         from Zhejiang’s experience.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The GEO and Outcome Indicators remained unchanged throughout the life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project’s main beneficiaries included Government officials from the Foreign Economic Cooperation
Office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), which is responsible for overseeing
implementation of activities to ensure that China meets its obligations under the Stockholm Convention,
and members of the National Leading Group for Implementation of the Stockholm Convention (NLG)7
composed of central Ministries and state commissions. At the provincial level, the Solid Waste
Management and Supervision Center of the Zhejiang Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), provincial-
level employees of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), and the dedicated Project
contractors, the Hangzhou Dadi Environmental Protection Co. Ltd (DADI) and the Shenyang Hazardous
Waste Disposal Technical Center were expected to benefit. Locally, populations living in proximity of
PCB storage sites in Zhejiang Province were also seen to be beneficiaries, as was the public at large.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project, as originally approved, included six components, summarized below:

Component 1: Institutional strengthening (US $1,945,000): The objective of the component was to

project implementation unit (PIU) in the Zhejiang Province; (c) provision of PCB management training to
provincial authorities and technical personnel, as well as project management training for both PIU staff
and the PCB project team in the CIO; (d) a study tour on PCB disposal technologies, and (e) public
awareness activities.

Component 2: Development of a Policy Framework for PCB management and Disposal (US $810,000):
The objective was to support development and improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for
safe management of PCBs in Zhejiang Province, including adoption of a PCB pollution
prevention/control regulation, development of a technical guideline for PCB management and disposal
and elaboration of an emergency response plan for PCB accidents targeted at relevant authorities. At the
national level, existing relevant policies and regulations governing PCB management and disposal would
be reviewed, revised, and supplemented, as necessary, under the auspices of the development and
adoption of a national regulation on PCB management and disposal, while a series of national pollution
control and environmental quality standards for PCBs8 would be designed to facilitate implementation of
the demonstration project and support China’s broader environmental regulatory framework. To support
the sustainability of Project inputs and efforts, a study for a funding mechanism for co-financing PCB
management and disposal in China into the future, would be prepared to underpin the effective
implementation of the national PCB reduction and disposal strategy to be developed under Component 6.

Component 3: PCB Management in the Zhejiang Province (US $15,016,000): The clean-up of an
estimated fifty-six (56) sites would form the basis for the PCB storage site remediation framework in
Zhejiang Province, and results would inform the design of the national replication program for PCB
elimination (Component 6). A series of feasibility studies9 would be completed, the exact location of PCB
sites would be identified and preliminary quantification of the volume of buried PCBs wastes using
Georadar (ground penetrating radar) undertaken, followed by clean-up, according to a specific protocol10,
of sites identified as containing PCBs. Highly-contaminated PCB wastes (>500 ppm) would be
transported to a temporary PCB storage facility in Zhejiang, containerized then transported, in accordance
with a strict transportation protocol, to Liaoning Province for destruction by incineration. The sub-
component also funded establishment of a government-owned suitable storage facility for PCB waste in
Zhejiang that would be used in the national replication program. Low-concentration contaminated PCB
wastes (between 50ppm to 500 ppm), whose estimated volume was calculated to be in the order of 20,000
tons 11 , would be treated in Zhejiang Province. A mobile thermal desorption system (able to treat 50
tons/day), whose selection was based on the evaluation of alternative PCB treatment/disposal
technologies prepared during project preparation, would be procured to treat PCB wastes low
concentrations. Verification and monitoring of PCBs sites post-clean-up would be undertaken within one
year of remediation. This sub-component also sought to compile information on large transformers, test

   Including: i) pre-treatment of buried PCBs equipment prior to shipment for final disposal; ii) determination of optimum PCB storage (fixed or
mobile) for Zhejiang; iii) determination of optimum types of vehicles for inter-provincial transportation of PCB wastes; and iv) determination of
fixed or mobile thermal desorption facility for Zhejiang.
10
    A comprehensive overview of the procedures to be followed is found in Section B and Annex 4 of the PAD.
11
    Analysis within the context of the Italian POPs project had estimated that, on the basis of overall transformer capacity in 1980, Zhejiang
province has about 22,500 PCB capacitors and a total of about 247.5 tons of PCB oil. From this, it was estimated that between 1,980 - 2,475 tons
(2,000 tons was used as the project indicator) of PCB capacitors and highly-PCB contaminated soils (PCB >5OOppm) would require disposal,
while in the order of 19,800 - 24,750 tons (20,000 tons was used as the project indicator) of low-PCB contaminated soils and water
(PCB</=5OOppm) were estimated to require clean-up. (PAD, Section B, para. 22 e, p.16)

                                                                        4
PCB transformer decontamination technologies, decontaminate up to 10 selected in-service transformers
installed prior to 1980.

Component 4: Disposal of Highly-contaminated PCB Wastes in Liaoning Province (US $13,609,000):
This component would address the final destruction of highly-contaminated PCB wastes (>500 ppm)
collected in Zhejiang Province at an existing, but not fully completed, incineration facility in Shenyang,
Liaoning Province. As referenced under Component 3, highly-contaminated PCB wastes recovered in
Zhejiang Province would be transported to Liaoning Province for disposal. Specific actions called for
under this component would include: provision of support for waste characterization and analysis at an
existing laboratory; upgrade the existing Shenyang rotary kiln incinerator to meet Stockholm Convention
specifications for disposal of PCBs; training of Shenyang Center technical personnel in the areas of PCB
safe storage, safe operation of the PCB incineration facility and dioxin/furan minimization and
monitoring; and, successful disposal of highly-contaminated PCB wastes transported from Zhejiang
province.

Component 5: Project Monitoring and Evaluation (US $127,000): Project specific monitoring and
evaluation activities would focus on tracking results with respect to the number of sites cleaned and the
volume of waste treated and disposed of. Results would be introduced into a national POPS management
information system (POPS-MIS). To support M&E efforts, a workshop on the monitoring system
designed for PCB management in Zhejiang Province would be organized, and three annual workshops
would be organized to review and take stock of Project progress.

Component 6: Design of a National Replication Program (US $3,290,000): The results and experiences
generated by the demonstration activities in Zhejiang Province would be shared nationally and
internationally through workshops. More importantly, they would inform the design of a national
replication program to be disseminated throughout China.

1.6 Revised Components

A number of indicators and activities defined under Project Components 2, 3 and 4 were revised as
follows:

Component 2, intermediate results indicator in adoption of regulatory frameworks. In December 2010,
the technical standards that were to be issued on PCBs in surface water, groundwater, air and soil were
dropped since the Government decided to adopt integrated environmental quality standards for all
chemicals, including PCBs, outside the timeline of the project. Instead, two new indicators regarding the
issuance of National Regulations on PCB management and disposal, and National PCB pollution control
standards were introduced.

Component 3, intermediate results indicator on the number of temporary PCB storage sites in Zhejiang
Province identified. Given that identification of the actual number of sites requiring clean-up formed part
of the Project’s activities, and given that in the course of site investigation it became clear that that, in
addition to there be fewer sites, not all would require clean-up. In December 2010 the number of PCB
storage sites that might require clean-up (estimated at 56) was revised to target identification of ‘all’
temporary PCB storage sites, without attaching a specific number.

Component 3, intermediate results indicator on in-use large PCB transformers. The results indicator that
10 in-use large PCB transformers installed before 1980 be decontaminated and more transformers tested
was dropped in December 2010, given the determination that no such PCB transformers remained in-
service. The funds that had been allocated to this activity were transferred to the transportation of highly-
contaminated PCB waste from Zhejiang Province to the Shenyang incinerator in Liaoning Province,

                                                     5
which had been identified in the PAD as a project activity but had not explicitly been included in the
Project description included in the Grant Agreement.

Component 4, target values for the intermediate results indicators associated with volume of PCB-
containing capacitors and volume of PCB oil and contaminated soils to be disposed. Given the decrease
in the actual number of sites requiring clean-up, the number of PCB-containing capacitors and the volume
of contaminated PCB oil and soils to be disposed of were amended in December 2011 as follows:
     a) Incinerator operational records confirm Zhejiang Province’s approximately 1,200 T of PCB-
         containing capacitors and highly-contaminated PCB waste (compared to 22,500 PCB-containing
         capacitors, as originally estimated) disposed of in an environmentally sound manner; and
     b) Incinerator operational records confirm Zhejiang Province’s approximately 10,000 T of PCB-
         contaminated soils (compared to 20,000 T, as originally estimated) disposed of in an
         environmentally sound manner12.
These changes were introduced due to the following three reasons: (i) the PCB-containing capacitors were
mostly broken and such poor condition that it would be impossible to ensure proper counting; also size of
the capacitors differed from site to site – therefore tons of highly-contaminated waste was deemed to be a
more appropriate indicator; (ii) PCB oil was in most cases leaked out of PCB-capacitors and mixed with
the surrounding soil, therefore proper measurement of PCB oil was impossible; (iii) the decrease of PCB-
contaminated soil was due to decreased number of actual clean-up sites and actual contamination levels
that can only be determined once the clean-up is performed.

1.7 Other significant changes

Grant Agreement Amendments and Closing Date Extensions

Over the life of the Project, the GA was amended four times, three with the approval of the World Bank
Country Director and one with the approval of the Regional Vice President:

1) November 13, 2006 - an amendment was introduced to change the GA’s disbursement modality from
SOE to the use of Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) as the basis for disbursement and project
management.

2) June 28, 2010 – a level 2 restructuring was approved to allow a 6-month extension of the Project’s
Closing Date, to December 31, 2010, in order to allow sufficient time to resolve key bottlenecks related to
meeting project withdrawal conditions and key short-term project milestones to be achieved13.

3) December 27, 2010 – a level 2 restructuring was approved to: 1) extend the Project’s Closing Date to
December 31, 201114; 2) reallocate Grant proceeds from the Works and Services categories to Goods to


12
     Reflects the final targets adopted following the Project’s final restructuring in December 2011.
13
    A 2-year extension in Closing Date was originally sought, based on results and recommendations expressed at MTR. The Project had suffered
a number of systemic delays that were impeding the actual clean-up of PCB-contaminated sites and the disposal of contaminated wastes and soils.
The Project team therefore, argued for an initial 6-month extension that would allow demonstration of clear actions to resolve pending obstacles
to implementation and achievement of the agreed milestones by the new deadline, as well as development of a credible action plan, satisfactory to
the Bank. Assuming these targets were met, an additional 18-month extension would be considered.
14
    Based on progress achieved over the initial 6-month Project extension period, the Recipient requested an additional extension of 18 months to
complete clean-up activities in Zhejiang Province, initiate disposal of low-level and highly contaminated PCB soils and wastes, and complete the
design of China’s National Replication Strategy. According to the action plan developed, it was projected that all activities could be completed
within a 12-month period, with the exception of the clean-up and disposal of PCB wastes from the 32 pre-identified contaminated sites. At the
time of restructuring, only 16 of the 32 sites were confirmed to have levels of PCB-contamination requiring clean-up, and the action plan
indicated that their clean-up and disposal of their PCB wastes could be completed within a six to nine month timeframe. Given the projected
timelines, the Project team recommended a 12-month extension, along with the recommendation that pre-monitoring of the remaining 16 sites be

                                                                          6
cover increased costs associated with procurement; and, 3) modify Part C of Schedule 2 of the GA to
include an additional Project activity, “(g) transportation of highly-contaminated PCB wastes from
Zhejiang to Shenyang?, and adjust the intermediate results targets to reflect the number of PCB-
contaminated sites identified to 35, as well as changes in the process of adopting regulatory frameworks.

4) December 13, 2011 – a level 2 restructuring was approved to extend the Project’s Closing Date to
December 31, 2012, and amend the GA to capture the final intermediate results targets agreed upon by
the Recipient and the Bank team, based on the actual number of PCB-contaminated sites identified as
requiring clean-up.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Overall, the design of the Project’s components is considered to have been sound. The Project’s aims and
structure were appropriately responsive to China’s interest in addressing the technical, policy, regulatory
and information challenges of PCB management and disposal so as to meet Stockholm Convention
requirements, as well as to support the government’s efforts to reduce environmental pollution and protect
human health.

Project Background Analysis that Informed Design: The background analysis that informed Project
preparation was comprehensive and commensurate with the technical complexity of the issue to be
addressed. The demonstration Project was designed as part of a multi-phase suite of internationally
supported POPs and PCB-specific activities aimed at improving China’s capacity for PCB management
and disposal. Prior CPTF and Italian POPs TF-supported activities helped prioritize Project components
related to institutional arrangements, policy options, and available treatment and disposal technology
choices. Related GEF-funded POPs-focused activities undertaken in cooperation with the Bank, such as
the Demonstration of Alternatives to Chlordane and Mirex in Termite Control Project [P116786], and
development of China’s National Implementation Plan (NIP) for the Stockholm Convention, prepared by
the Convention Implementation Office (CIO) under FECO/SEPA (now MEP) with the assistance of
UNIDO, also informed the Project’s design.

Government Commitment and Support for Design: The comprehensive management structure adopted for
the Project at various levels of government further underlined the country’s commitment. The
involvement of the 11-Ministry NLG for Implementation of the Stockholm Convention ensured
coordination, both with respect to the relevance of the Project’s design to the Government’s broad
pollution management objectives, as well as through the coordinated use of resources, US $14 million of
which were provided as counterpart funding. The establishment of a PCB Project Team within the
CIO/MEP, as well as one at the provincial level within the Zhejiang Environmental Protection Bureau
(EPB), involving EPB staff with environmental monitoring and solid waste management experience, plus
staff from the Zhejiang Power Company, drew upon previous experience gained working through the
long-standing China-World Bank partnership under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer, that had demonstrated the value of working through a dedicated local project management
team. The Project’s design adopted this model as part of its capacity-development efforts focused on
institutional arrangements.




fast-tracked in order to determine whether any exceeded acceptable PCB levels. It was agreed that should the pre-monitoring confirm high levels
of PCB-contamination at all 16 sites, a further action plan and possible final extension of closing date could be considered.

                                                                       7
Analytics used in the Design: Project design was overall, sound. Given that the unique temporary storage
system for PCBs and associated PCB-contaminated wastes (e.g., PCB-contaminated soils and water)
adopted in China precluded verification of complete baseline data prior to Project implementation, the
Project design made use of the best available data to develop rational objectives and indicators to support
the identification and demonstration of environmentally-sound and cost-effective policies, procedures and
techniques for the safe management and disposal of PCB wastes. Two Environmental Assessments (EAs)
were prepared during Project design, one for Zhejiang Province and the other for the Shenyang
incineration facility, each of which included an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that detailed
specific PCB mitigation and monitoring measures, institutional coordination and capacity building, as
well as thorough implementation and cost schedules.

Possible critical environmental risks and risk mitigation measures were overall, adequately identified and
fleshed out during project design.
     The inclusion of focused training and capacity development activities sought to mitigate the risk
        that limited technical and operational capacity, particularly amongst partners and stakeholders at
        the provincial levels, might impede implementation.
     In recognition of the inherent environmental risks associated with handling PCBs, due diligence
        was paid during the preparation phase to gauging projected storage and disposal requirements
        with the intent of minimizing risk to the environment and surrounding communities.
     On the question of storage, the Project design embedded the requirement for preparation of three
        additional EAs during implementation: one associated with construction of the PCB storage
        facility and another for the thermal desorption unit (TDU) for soil decontamination, both in
        Zhejiang Province; the third would address construction of the PCB storage facility to be erected
        at Shenyang. Regarding the question of disposal, a total of seven alternative scenarios - ranging
        from no action, to situ monitoring, to disposal abroad - were considered and rejected in favor of
        the thermal desorption option ultimately adopted.
     The selection of the TDU, a mature technology used in developed countries, was made based on
        the fact that China’s PCB wastes were principally identified as low-concentration PCB-
        contaminated soils, and on the understanding that thermal extraction was the only in situ process
        that preserved at least a limited set of the soil’s properties, thereby allowing for the return of
        treated soil to its site of origin (see Annex 2 re: issues regarding selection of a mobile or fixed
        TDU option).

Based on technical analysis and international experience, high temperature incineration was accepted as
the most widespread and proven technology by which to destroy high concentration PCB wastes in
accordance with Stockholm Convention standards. The decision to have the Project upgrade and use the
Shenyang Hazardous Waste Disposal Center in Liaoning Province, which had been designed to meet all
applicable Chinese regulations and standards, but not the levels specified under the Convention, versus
building a new incineration facility in Zhejiang Province was technically and financially sound given cost
considerations regarding new construction versus transportation, the relatively low volume of estimated
high concentration PCB wastes in Zhejiang Province that would require incineration, and the projection
of large amounts of PCB wastes buried in China’s northern provinces that would require incineration
under the national replication plan in future.

The extent of legislative reform anticipated at both the national and provincial levels to ensure
sustainability of efforts and promote national replication of the demonstration Project’s results is also
considered to have been reasonable. The existing regulatory frameworks in place at the time of Project
design, or baseline scenario, attested to the Government’s early legislative responsiveness on the issue,




                                                    8
while also highlighting the limitations they imposed 15 , and China’s ratification of the Convention
assured its commitment to align its policies with the Convention’s objectives into the future.

In hindsight however, two related issues are considered to have been deserving of more attention during
preparation. One centers on the single sourcing of the Project contractors, Hangzhou Dadi Environmental
Protection Co. Ltd. (DADI), identified as the Project partner for site clean-up and treatment of low-
concentration PCB wastes, and the Shenyang Center, identified as the Project partner for final disposal
through incineration. The other concerns the lack of clarity with respect to the licensing requirements for
contractors to handle, treat and dispose of PCB wastes. Both were critical to Project implementation.
Indeed, the confidence demonstrated at entry regarding the DADI and the Shenyang Center was so high
that their being licensed was included as a withdrawal conditions in the Grant Agreement. When the
licensing processes stalled, no sites could be cleaned and no contaminated materials treated, resulting in
extensive Project delays (see Annex 2). A more thorough review of the rationale for application of the
single source modality for the Project contractors and a more robust dialogue regarding the terms of the
regulations governing hazardous waste operations may have avoided the complications that arose and the
delays that ensued.

2.2 Implementation

Project implementation took a total of six years, 30 months longer than planned, and the Project closed on
December 31, 2012. Project objectives overall, were achieved, as discussed in Section 3.2, despite the fact
that implementation faced a number of challenges and delays, particularly in relation to Components 3
and 4.

Components 1, 2 and 5, which respectively sought to address institutional strengthening requirements,
develop a policy framework for PCB management and disposal at both the national level and in Zhejiang
Province, and ensure effective monitoring and evaluation of Project progress, met their objectives writ
large, as outlined below:
 Technical capacity related to PCB management and disposal has been internalized and will underpin
    China’s ongoing work in this sector in future and project management skills were, overall, enhanced.
 Significant progress was made regarding the development of an over-arching policy framework for
    PCB management and disposal including, technical guidelines, national policy standards and
    provincial regulations regarding PCB contamination management and control. The decision to
    integrate PCB management and disposal considerations into a broader national regulatory framework
    on chemical substances bodes well for the future sustainability of PCB management in China
    however, the chemical substances regulation had not yet been adopted at the time of Project closure,
    making it difficult to assess its impact.
 An abstract of a study on financing mechanisms for disposal of PCB wastes in future that was
    prepared identified three cost scenarios for ongoing PCB management and disposal under the
    auspices of the national replication program (Component 6). The most cost-effective, least-cost
    option proposed calls for the ongoing use of Project inputs. While this raises optimism with respect to
    the potential for ongoing sustainability, the absence of a robust immediate-term replication action pla,
    precludes the possibility of comprehensively assessing the study’s recommendation or the sustained
    impact of its proposal.
 M&E reporting on activities and results was performed by FECO/CIO and the Zhejiang PIU through
    semi-annual project progress reports. The Project also generated site specific data which was
    introduced into the national POPs management information system (POPs-MIS), developed in


15
     PAD, Annex 15.

                                                     9
       partnership with the Demonstration of Alternatives to Chlordane and Mirex in Termite Control
       Project that was under implementation at the same time.

Of the fifty-six (56) sites estimated as requiring clean-up at appraisal, a total of 35 sites were identified as
contaminated using geo-radar (ground penetrating radar) technology, but only 16 sites were eventually
cleaned, having been deemed contaminated and/or accessible (see Table 2-4, Annex 2).

Implementation of Component 3 generated a number of delays throughout Project implementation. One
issue surrounded the question of licensing of the Project contractor, the Hangzhou Dadi Environmental
Protection Co. Ltd. (DADI). The firm had been selected as a single source contractor for the recovery of
PCB wastes, treatment of contaminated soils and decontamination of PCB-contaminated transformers at
design stage based on (i) its experience in waste management under the National Program for the
Construction of Hazardous and Medical Waste Disposal issued by the State Council in 200316, (ii) its
prior experience in cleaning-up PCB sites, and (iii) the expertise it had gained thanks to a decade’s worth
of Project-relevant technical training its staff had received from the German aid agency, GTZ. MEP
confirmed at design stage that DADI would be the only company granted an official license to handle
PCB wastes, excluding final disposal of highly-contaminated PCB waste. Yet requirements under the
Measures for Administration of Hazardous Waste (HW) Operation Permits (2004) that appear to not have
fully been understood at preparation, would impede the process and raise a persistent implementation
delays, not least because the licensing requirement was one of the withdrawal conditions written into the
GA. Extensive inter-ministerial consultations finally allowed for understanding to be shared by all Project
proponents and for the licensing issue to be resolved in 2010 (see Annex 2).

Procurement and location of the TDU also created challenges. The initial TDU site location had to be
revisited due to local government and civil opposition, the TDU procurement process had to be re-bid,
which delayed implementation by many months and, once installed, the TDU experienced a series of
persistent technical problems that resulted in delays in the equipment being able to complete the Proof of
Performance (POP) Test required. The problems were somewhat compounded by the lack of capacity on
the part of FECO/CIO, the Zhejiang PIU and DADI with regard to complex Bank procurement processes.
As a result, for example, the warranty period was linked in the contract to equipment delivery as opposed
to the hand-over of equipment, which caused additional challenges at the local level. This issue of
capacity also affected the design of clean-up plans and cost estimates once the TDU began operation in
earnest (see Annex 2). Ultimately, the PCB contaminated sites identified were cleaned and remediated,
but the process was at times arduous.

Component 4 - the Shenyang Hazardous Waste Incineration Center was upgraded for PCB waste
incineration, including construction pre-treatment and storage facilities, upgrading of the on-line
monitoring system and automatic control system, and construction of a hazardous waste
characterization/analysis laboratory. The Shenyang Center also faced similar issues with respect to
licensing, but the issue was more easily resolved. The facility now meets the Stockholm Convention
BAT guidance, which imposes stricter emission standards compared to those imposed by Chinese
regulations. Concern exists that the stricter emission standards which the incinerator is designed to reach
make the Shenyang facility less cost-competitive compared to other similar incineration facilities (see
Annex 2).

In relation to Component 6, the results achieved in Zhejiang Province were expected to inform the
development of a national replication plan that, together with the study that would outline a financing

                                                                   10
mechanism, would allow China to address remaining PCB management and disposal issues into the future.
At mid-term review (MTR) it was reported that Beijing Normal University was contracted to prepare the
plan, in cooperation with the FECO/CIO team and the CTA. A nationwide PCB inventory/survey has
been conducted since 2010. The results of the first two surveys indicate significantly smaller volumes of
PCB waste as compared to estimates which, according to FECO/CIO, is the result of deficiencies
associated with the surveying process and low awareness among local authorities on PCB contamination.
FECO/CIO has continued updating surveys on an annual basis in parallel with provision of in-depth
training to local EPBs on the results of the demonstration Project results, and trial site clean-ups in the
provinces beyond Zhejiang. During the final stages of the Project’s implementation, a national 12th 5-
year POPs plan was finalized and approved. This strategic plan covers PCBs and its preparation has been
largely informed by the Project’s lessons. Project results have been disseminated during international and
national workshops. However, no further analysis of the short-term national replication action plan was
possible at the time of ICR preparation, given that no indication has been provided to the ICR team that
the replication plan, and its associated financing study, had been operationalized.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

As per the PAD, the Project developed a M&E strategy by which to track progress toward project
objectives and facilitate learning that would support the preparation of the national replication program.
Interim outcome indicators were developed to track the sound management and disposal of PCBs wastes
from contaminated sites, the development of PCB policies, regulations and standards, and associated
capacity building. Achievement of these intermediate outcome indicators would, cumulatively, lay the
foundation upon which to reach the Project’s desired outcome, adoption of a national replication program
for PCB management and disposal, which is key to achieving the long-term sustainability of the
investment made.

The Results Framework (PAD, Annex 3) included a comprehensive set of indicators that helped track
progress of project implementation. The indicators were generally adequate to track progress under each
component, and were clear, measurable and specific. The indicators related to clean-up targets were
however, too narrowly defined at appraisal, considering the absence of baseline information available
regarding the number of PCB-contaminated sites and therefore, the extent of the clean-up that would
ultimately be required.

Overall, monitoring and reporting of the Project’s implementation – administrative and technical, and
output and intermediate outcome-based - was conducted satisfactorily. M&E reporting on activities and
results was performed by FECO/CIO and the Zhejiang PIU through semi-annual project progress reports.
While progress reports were submitted on a regular, if sometimes delayed, basis throughout the Project’s
implementation, in the last year of implementation there was no consolidated report submitted until the
very end of the Project. In its stead, ad hoc reports detailing key implementation progress aspects and
disbursements were submitted regularly. A POPs management information system (POPs-MIS) was to be
developed early on during implementation in order to facilitate monitoring, allow for generation of
aggregate national level data and demonstrate effectiveness results. Its development, which was
undertaken in tandem with that of an MIS system for the Demonstration of Alternatives to Chlordane and
Mirex in Termite Control Project, was delayed and hence, it was not put into use until 2010.

The project was classified as a Category A project. The project triggered Operational Policy 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment (EA) and Operational Policy 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. Overall, the
implementation of the Project’s environmental safeguard measures is considered satisfactory. The
Environmental impacts associated with the Project included possible PCB leakage resulting in
contamination at storage/burial sites and to the surrounding environment during PCB waste excavation,
clean-up, containerization, treatment by thermal desorption, temporary storage, transportation, and
destruction by incineration. In response, two Environmental Assessments (EAs) were initially prepared,
one for Zhejiang Province and the other for the Shenyang incineration facility, followed by three
additional EAs during implementation that addressed the construction of PCB storage facilities in
Zhejiang Province and at the Shenyang Facility, as well as for the TDU for soil decontamination.. The
detailed safeguard measures developed for site clean-up, packaging, transportation, storage, disposal,
health and safety etc., further informed the development of a series of formal technical specifications and
guidelines for PCBs waste management in China, which lay a solid foundation for implementation of the
national replication program into the future, as well as for the national 12th FYP POPs program. Further,
in accordance with the Project Grant Agreement requirement, the Zhejiang team and Project contractors,
DADI and Shenyang Center, implemented the Project’s Environmental Management Plan (EMP) in a
satisfactory manner, ensuring that implementation was undertaken in accordance with sound
environmental practices and standards.

Social Safeguards

The project was expected to generate significant social benefits by reducing public health risks associated
with the release of PCBs through enhanced management, site clean-up and disposal of PCBs and
contaminated materials. Possible social risks assessed at design included the threat of public exposure to
contaminated sites, buildings and/or water supplies during site clean-up in Zhejiang Province and
transportation processes, as well as on location at the disposal facility in Shenyang. Overall, these risks
were considered minor in comparison to the expected local and global benefits. They were nevertheless,
carefully considered during design and addressed through application of high technical standards,
establishment of effective communication with local residents, and involvement of stakeholders in all
potentially controversial aspects of the project.

Overall, the implementation of the Project’s social safeguard measures is considered satisfactory. A
Resettlement Policy Framework was developed to address possible land acquisition and resettlement
issues, with site-specific resettlement planning to be prepared on a case-by-case basis, involving local
governments, affected villages, institutions and households in the inventory of impacts process and
development of the compensatory packages. In Zhejiang Province, the fact that PCB site treatment would
require temporary land acquisition, as well relocation of structures and PCB ‘coffins’ raised concerns
regarding possible social impacts. Given that the exact location of PCB burial sites was not known and
required additional field work, social impacts emanating from site treatment could only be known and
addressed as the work progressed. The people affected by the Project’s activities were consulted and kept
involved in relevant resettlement and response decisions. The cost of land affected was fully remunerated,
affected enterprises, infrastructure and public facilities were fully compensated and the livelihoods of
those affected were restored. Based on the evaluation of the resettlement monitor, as well as the numerous
site visits and mission observations, the Project’s resettlement implementation is deemed satisfactory.




                                                    12
Of the 35 PCB-contaminated sites identified, very little adverse social impacts resulted. Of the 16 project
sites ultimately cleaned, 5 were located within the compound of power transmission stations, 4 were in
warehouses of local companies or public facilities, and 7 were public areas including, a mountain cave
and a barren river bank. Only two triggered involuntary resettlement: one village-owned enterprise and 3
households were directly affected. In one case, the project site encroached on approximately 1.5 mu of
village land, part of which was rented out to another village for the production of plums. Compensation
standard applied to this case was much higher than the local government regulation and the affected
village and people were very satisfied with very much sufficient cash and in-kind compensation. At
another site, adverse impacts of a limited nature affected three households whose domiciles abutted a
project site fence. After consultation and agreement with the affected people, adequate compensation in
the form of cash was paid to the households for the impacts of noise and dust, for absenteeism from work
on site clean-up days. The local PIU and relevant stakeholders conducted thorough consultations in
coordination with of local township governments, the implementation of the social safeguard
management in these cases were in compliance with the local government regulations and consistent with
the Bank’s OP/BP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement.

Fiduciary Safeguards

Financial Management
Overall, financial management was satisfactory. The Project implemented an adequate financial
management system in accordance with MOF regulations and requirements outlined in the Grant
Agreement. A special project account was created and financial statements regarding the use of funds
were prepared in a timely manner, in line with Bank procedures. At Project completion, 98% of the
Project funds had been disbursed. A breakdown of the final distribution and division of funds at the
national and provincial levels is outlined in Annex 1.

Within less than 6 months of effectiveness, the Project, with the agreement of the client, replaced the
Statement of Expenses (SOE) disbursement modality with financial report-based disbursement, Financial
Monitoring Report (FMR). This modality was new to both FECO/CIO and the PIU and, as a result,
slowed disbursement in the Project’s initial stages due to a lack of training. Eventually, the Project teams
were able to take advantage of comprehensive training provided by the Bank in March 2008 under the
auspices of the sister Demonstration of Alternatives to Chlordane and Mirex in Termite Control Project,
also executed by FECO/CIO. Following this training, the FMR process flowed more smoothly though
disbursements remained slow into 2010 as a result of implementation delays associated with Components
3 and 4.

 The IFRs could be submitted to the Bank as required by legal agreement. All the project annual audit
reports were submitted to the Bank with unqualified opinion.

Procurement
Procurement plans were developed and shared with the Bank team for review and no objection in a timely
manner and, in accordance with Bank requirements, updated procurement plans were disclosed publicly.
Procurement Post Reviews conducted by the Bank found that overall, the procurement of works and
goods, as well as the selection of consultants, was carried out in a satisfactory manner in accordance with
the Bank’s Procurement and Consultants Guidelines. In order to ensure that staff of the Zhejiang PIU, for
whom Bank procedures and policies were new, as well as those staff new to the FECO/CIO, were able to
manage key procurement processes in a manner that would satisfy project implementation needs,




                                                    13
procurement training, as called for in the PAD17, was provided by the Bank to ensure that all procurement
documents, including payment records, were properly completed and filed.

The overall handling of procurement procedures aside, obstacles were nevertheless encountered in the
procurement process, the most important case relating to procurement of the TDU which ultimately, was
delayed by over a year. This resulted from the Bank’s refusal to accept the results of the first competitive
bidding process due to concerns regarding the financial and technical viability of the supplier selected.
Given the importance of procuring technology that would indisputably be able to function in accordance
with the technical specifications outlined in the Project (and in accordance with the Stockholm
Convention), the Bank team requested the Project team to re-bid the TDU. This ultimately delayed
implementation and saw the total cost of the equipment rise, which required the Project to reallocate
funds in order to meet the costs of the TDU eventually selected. The impacts of the re-bidding process
may have been attenuated had the Bank, FECO/CIO and PIU teams worked more closely together to
facilitate the process.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

A series of PCB policies, regulations and technical standards developed including, national PCB pollution
control and environmental quality specifications are being used to inform the development of a national
regulation governing chemical substances. Project results also contributed to the design of China’s 12th
Five-Year Plan that emphasizes, inter alia, decreasing use of major pollutants and strengthening economic
and environmental governance, and have contributed positively to addressing China’s commitments under
the Stockholm Convention to control POPs in general, and in particular, to pursue environmentally sound
PCB waste management and management of equipment containing PCBs by not later than 2028. The
results will also continue to support priorities expressed in China’s Stockholm Convention NIP with
respect to development of effective policies, procedures, capacity and techniques for safely managing and
disposing of stored PCBs and associated PCB-contaminated wastes.

Overall, the Project is considered to have contributed positively to the baseline level of national expertise
against which future PCB management programs in other provinces will be able to draw. Important
lessons have been generated with respect to the challenges and costs associated with the sustainable
management and disposal of PCBs, lessons that will be of significant value if and when they are used to
effectively inform the strategic planning behind the PCB national replication program and its related
financing mechanism. A brief abstract of the anticipated financing mechanism available at Project
completion identifies an optimum cost structure under which the Government believes the national
replication strategy can be financed and implemented. In order to maximize use of the demonstration
Project’s inputs, namely the TDU and the upgrade of the Shenyang incineration facility, authorization for
their continued use will rely on the adoption of relevant legislation and regulations. At project completion
however, both the short-term national replication action plan and its related financing structure remained
to be operationalized.

Lastly, Zhejiang Province has developed a Clean Soil Action Plan that seeks to accelerate soil pollution
prevention and control. The Plan incorporates the province’s 12th Five-Year Plan for POPs Pollution
Prevention and Control, and specifically references ongoing PCB management and disposal.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

The Project’s results were relevant to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006-2010, and remain so
under the current CPS 2013-2016, -as well as to both China’s country level and global environmental
priorities. Under Pillar 3 of the CPS 2006- 2010, which addressed managing resource scarcity and
environmental challenges, the Project supported the aim of mitigating the environmental impacts of
human activities and, more directly, the Government’s desire to observe international environmental
conventions by piloting phase-out projects for PCBs. The current CPS 2013-2016 explicitly maintains
this focus under outcome 1.6, ‘Demonstrating Pollution Management Measures’, which seeks to,
‘[support] efforts to reduce hazardous waste, by continuing to support the reduction of persistent organic
pollutants (POPs) - the byproducts of industrial production and the world's most toxic chemicals-from the
regulatory level to emissions control and urban site clean-up.’ At the national level, the government goal
of eliminating POPs and reducing risks to human health and environment from toxic chemicals through
the promotion of best environmental practices has remained a high priority (see Section 3.2).

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on assessment of project outputs, weighed against the Project’s performance indicators, the Project
is considered to have achieved its GEO in spite of the delays that plagued aspects of its implementation.
The demonstration of cost-effective, environmentally-safe methods for PCB management and disposal
was successful and has contributed to mitigating the impact of PCB threats to human health and the
environment. All PCB-contaminated sites in Zhejiang Province that were identified and deemed
technically feasible for clean-up were remediated of PCB wastes, while those that could not be cleaned
due to inaccessibility of the sites continue to benefit from ongoing monitoring to mitigate risks and ensure
safety. A total of 11,428 tons of low- and 1,040.5 tons of high-concentration PCB wastes (Zhejiang + 12
other provinces) have been disposed of using technologically appropriate, environmentally-safe thermal
desorption or incineration techniques, in accordance with Stockholm Convention guidelines and
standards18. The safe removal and disposal of these volumes of low- and high-concentration PCBs and
PCB contaminated wastes, and the increased monitoring capacity generated by the Project mean that the
potential for future accidental releases of PCBs in Zhejiang Province has been eliminated. In tandem, the
potential for the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic (immune, nervous, reproductive and endocrine
systems) effects associated with PCBs to affect human health and the environment in Zhejiang Province,
as well as nationally and globally, has been mitigated.

Technical and management skills related to PCB management and disposal have increased and a wide
variety of relevant stakeholders, at both the national and provincial levels, have benefited from
dissemination of Project results. A series of important PCB policies, regulations and technical standards
have been developed and adopted. These have contributed to elaboration of a framework for a National
Regulation for PCB Management which will, as a result of experience gained during Project



18
     Of which 8,572t of low-contaminated and 769.4t of high-concentration, by Dec. 31, 2012



                                                              15
implementation, now be integrated into a broad national regulation governing chemical substances as
opposed to a stand-alone regulation. This is expected to enhance synergies and facilitate enforcement.
Analysis of possible financing scenarios has been undertaken and an optimum cost structure identified
which the Government believes could finance the sustainable implementation of the national PCB
management and disposal replication strategy. Further, China’s 12th Five-Year Plan emphasizes, inter
alia, decreasing use of major pollutants and strengthening economic and environmental governance in
part as a result of the Project’s implementation. At the time of completion, Project results and lessons
were being applied to scale-up PCB management activities in 12 other PCB-target provinces, and had
served to inform the design of the national 12th Five-Year POPs Plan. Project results also contributed
positively to China’s commitments under the Stockholm Convention by directly supporting achievement
of NIP priorities for development of effective policies, procedures, capacity and techniques for safely
managing and disposing of stored PCBs and associated PCB-contaminated wastes.

Overall, the Project generated important lessons learned in terms of managing and disposing of PCBs in a
cost-effective and sustainable manner and demonstrates good potential for long-term sustainability of
outcomes. Its.. At Project closure however, the short-term national replication action plan was not yet
available for review. Given that its completion and effective adoption are key to the ongoing
sustainability of PCB management efforts in China, and given the delays in Project implementation
outlined above (Section 2.2), this outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The demonstration project was designed to contribute both local and global public good by reducing the
risk of the release of PCBs into the environment. Due to the lack of reliable baseline data and difficulties
associated in measuring the impact of the overall environmental, health and related socio-economic
impacts under a ‘without project’ scenario, it was not possible to conduct a traditional economic or
financial cost-benefit analysis for the Project. Nonetheless, benefits to both the local and global
environment and human health that would accrue by reducing the potential for PCBs to leach into the
environment, though difficult to quantify, were understood to be significant and therefore, considered to
exceed the demonstration Project’s associated costs.

At the design stage, an estimate was made by FECO/CIO of the cost-effectiveness associated with
operation of the TDU system under Project Component 3, with an estimated thermal desorption treatment
cost of US $270/ton between end 2006 and mid-2009. The actual TDU treatment cost turned out to be
higher than projected for two main reasons: one, the value of the RMB, the currency used for operating
cost estimates incurred by the local contractor, dropped against the US dollar by the time the TDU
treatment process began in December 2011, raising the cost of treatment/ton19; and two, due to the fact
that the TDU was unstable and prone to frequent break-downs (see Section 2.2, Annex 2), only lower
contaminated soil loads could be treated, while fixed costs did not alter as they were not dependent on
actual treatment capacity. As a result, the average treatment cost increased to US $460/ton during
December 2011-December 2012 period. For incineration of the highly-contaminated wastes recovered, at
appraisal the costs of incineration were estimated to be US $2,000/ton, excluding transportation, based on
European/North American data. Actual disposal costs, once again turned out to be higher than projected,
totaling US$ 4,123/ton for the first 100 tons incinerated in 2011, and US$3,717/ton for the 669.4 tons
incinerated in 2012. The key factors in this case pertain to the amount of soil available for treatment,


19
   In 2011, the RMB dropped to 6.4 against the US dollar. In comparison, its value in 2006 stood at 7.9 RMB to 1 US$, and at appraisal, it had
been even higher, at 8.1 RMB for 1 US$.

                                                                      16
given that fewer sites than projected required remediation and the volume of high-concentration PCB-
contaminated waste was lower than had been estimated, and the high proportion of fixed costs.

The average cost per Project site of US$ 230,000 was also much higher than projected, due to broad
variations in costs per site and ton (see Annex 3). These findings are all indicative of the challenges posed
by the particularities of China’s PCB problem where site characteristics are not uniform but rather,
diverse: some sites were easily accessed while others required significant effort and cost to access, and
some contained virtually no contaminated materials but nevertheless incurred significant costs to access.
Assessing the average cost/ton clean-up is therefore, not a good indicator of efficiency. Comparison with
PCB project results in other countries also does not yield useful comparative data. For example, the
Moldova POPs Stockpiles Management and Destruction Project reported an average cost/ton eliminated
of US $4,183/ton. However, the characterization of the PCB problem was vastly different in Moldova,
which allowed clean-up to be addressed in a much more consolidated manner, something which the
particularities of China’s temporary PCB storage system did not allow. This heralds an important lesson
regarding cost considerations that will necessarily have to be taken into account as China rolls out its
national replication program.

An incremental cost analysis was conducted at the time of preparation (see Annex 3) and demonstrated, to
the satisfaction of the GEF, that the demonstration Project, compared to the “without project? scenario,
would be an efficient means by which to assist the government of China to fulfill its obligation under the
Stockholm Convention to better manage its PCB baseline data, enhance its institutional and policy
framework for PCB management and develop the technical know-how and tools to handle, treat and
dispose of PCBs in an environmentally sound manner. Annex 3 examines efficiency with respect to the
incremental costs provided in greater detail. The baseline scenario the Project faced invoked the potential
for the release of significant quantities of PCBs into the environment and of scattered, ad hoc national
capacity with which to address the problem. The positive results generated by the Project at the policy and
technical levels are considered transferable within the context of a funded PCB national replication
program strategy that promotes use of Project inputs as an efficient way to scale-up national action on
PCB management. While the Project is considered overall to have made efficient use of the funds
approved, given that the replication program and the financing strategy have not yet been operationalized
nationwide, the potential for further efficiency of Project inputs in support of China’s national PCB
management objectives cannot be assessed. For this reason, the efficiency outcome is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Project achieved its GEO. Environmentally sound and cost-effective policies, procedures and
techniques for safely managing and disposing of China’s unique temporarily stored PCBs and associated
PCB-contaminated wastes were identified and successfully demonstrated. Institutional capacity was
strengthened, which enabled the development of targeted policy and regulatory arrangements for the long-
term control of PCBs within the context of broader national chemicals management objectives. The
Project’s concept and design was, and remains, highly relevant to China’s obligations under the
Stockholm Convention and to its national priorities with respect to pollution and hazardous waste
management and environmental protection, as expressed in the 12th FYP. Project results were overall
achieved in a cost-effective manner. It is clear that overall, the Project has generated value however, it is
not possible to overlook the substantial delays experienced during implementation, which ultimately
pushed back Project completion by 2.5 years. Nor is it possible to ignore the fact that the long-term
sustainability objectives inherent within the Project’s design cannot proceed in the absence of an endorsed

                                                     17
and active short-term PCB national replication action plan supported by a sustainable financing structure.
Based on these factors, the overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

n/a.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

As a result of Project implementation, capacity was built and strengthened at several levels. At the level
of government, capacity within FECO/CIO, the PIU and the Zhejiang EPB was strengthened with respect
to technical aspects associated with the development of regulations and legislation in conformity of
Stockholm Convention obligations and provincial/national environmental concerns. Implementation of
the Project also strengthened FECO/CIO coordination capacity with respect to other ministries within the
NLG, with provincial government agencies, and through partnership with various academic and scientific
institutions that generated valuable research, all of which can now positively contribute to replication of a
PCB management strategy at the national level. The same can be said to be the case for the Zhejiang EPB
at the provincial level, which has become a knowledge center that other provinces, in future, can consult.
Capacity was also necessarily developed with Project partners at DADI and the Shenyang Center.
Overall, results achieved were internalized by Project partners at all levels, such that they can be drawn
upon in future, as required.

In addition, from the perspective of administrative management, capacity in both the PIU and FECO/CIO
was enhanced with regard to financial management and procurement procedures. It is also clear that
public awareness was enhanced during the course of the Project’s implementation, and that the general
population now understands the health and environmental risks that exposure to PCBs and PCB waste
pose. Given the unique temporary storage means adopted in China and the poor record-keeping associated
with the temporary storage, such awareness is key.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

n/a.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

In December 2012, two National Dissemination and Training Workshops for the PCB Management and
Disposal Demonstration Project in China were held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and in Liaoning at
the Shenyang Center. The workshops objective was to disseminate lessons learned and regulatory,
technical, and managerial experiences gained through implementation of the Project, and to seek
perspectives from a broader audience regarding how PCB management and disposal follow-up actions
can best be implemented nationwide. Over 85 individuals from 24 EPBs participated in the workshops
and presentations were made by FECO/CIO, Zhejiang PIU, Shenyang Center, DADI, Qinghua University
and the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate



                                                     18
The risk to development outcomes is rated as moderate. Although Project outputs are considered
sustainable in the long-run, the sustainability of outcomes, namely the replication of an effective and
sustainable PCB management and disposal program at the national level, may face risks. In particular,
scale-up to the national level may be hindered by internal or political issues faced by MEP, the agency
tasked with implementation of the Stockholm Convention, and financial considerations.

The results achieved by the Project with respect to mitigation of environmental and health concerns
associated with PCB wastes are positive, particularly at the level of Zhejiang Province. Public knowledge
regarding the environmental and human health risks associated with PCBs, in general, and interference
with PCB burial sites has been enhanced. The regulatory and legislative work concluded to date, which
supports PCB management and disposal in accordance with Stockholm Convention guidelines lays the
foundation for future efforts. Still, it will be important to stay the course in order to ensure that national
PCB regulations are effectively captured within the broader chemical substances regulations currently
under development. So too does the analysis contained in the financing study that clearly demonstrates
the cost-effectiveness that can be gained by building upon the results of the demonstration Project and
using its inputs in replicating the strategy nationwide. In addition, the dialogue opened with EPBs from
other provinces prior to Project completion is an important step with respect to engaging stakeholders and
building consensus and support for replication.

In order to sustain the impact of the PCB management and disposal achieved in China to date, it will be
important:
 to secure endorsement of the short-term PCB national replication action plan in a timely manner;
 to act on the recommendations contained in the financing study to solicit support at the government
    (national and provincial) and private sector enterprise levels to secure the financing necessary;
 to facilitate access to Project results and inputs (i.e. the TDU) more broadly.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank performance during the Project’s design phase is considered to have been moderately satisfactory.
The Project’s objective supported what was, and what remains, a conviction on the part of the Chinese
Government to protect public health and the environment, as well as the global commons, witnessed by
China’s active participation in the development of the Stockholm Convention. Furthermore, the Project’s
goals were clearly tied to several of the country’s NIP priority components including, strengthening
institutional readiness, enhancing POPs inventories, introducing best available and best environmental
practice technologies to address waste disposal and contaminated site remediation, and identifying means
of financing replication of targeted action plans (see Table 2-3, Annex 2).

Relevant stakeholders including, government at the national and provincial levels, the private sector,
academia, international and national technical experts and local communities were involved in the design
process. Such dialogue was especially valuable given the particular challenges that were faced in
designing a Project that would be able to effectively address China’s unique PCB sector particularly given
the lack of certainty with respect to the location of contaminated sites and the volume of PCB wastes that
would ultimately need to be addressed. In this regard, the internalization of capacity developed, and data
generated, by the CPTF and Italian POPs TF projects helped design a robust framework that balanced the
difficulty in quantifying impact with certainty.

                                                     19
As aforementioned, two related issues would have benefited from more rigorous attention at entry - the
single sourcing of the Project contractors and the issue of licensing for the handling and treatment of
PCBs and associated PCB wastes – both of which contributed to delay implementation of Components 3
and 4 and were key to the Project being downgraded to MU in 2010. These potential issues were likely
unforeseen within the context of the overall risk analysis that was undertaken at entry, particularly since
certification was provided for the Project contractors by the relevant Ministry. Nevertheless, given the
vital role these entities were to play in implementation, there should have been greater attention paid to
the potential risks associated with the roles, responsibilities and qualifications of such key Project
partners. Taking into consideration the significant problems the Project would face as a result of these
issues, and weighing the otherwise rigorous preparation process undertaken, Bank performance in
ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

For the bulk of the Project’s implementation, the Bank team provided Government and other Project
counterparts with consistent, timely and best available policy and technical advice, including guidance on
financial management, procurement and environmental and social safeguard issues, through fairly regular
supervision missions, as evidenced by thorough aide memoires. As the aide memoires demonstrate, the
Bank team maintained a constructive dialogue with FECO/CIO and the Zhejiang PIU to address the
various complex implementation issues that arose. Specific FM and procurement training was provided
for FECO/CIO and PIU staff in order to ensure that the Project’s fiduciary and procurement requirements
were respected.

Given the risky nature of the clean-up, remediation and disposal work to be undertaken, the active
involvement of safeguard specialists ensured that environmental management concerns and stakeholder
voices were respected throughout implementation, where required. Site visits were undertaken to ensure
compliance with safeguard policies and community and worker safety, and to verify physical works and
remediation achievements. This oversight support contributed to the Project closing without any incidents
being reported. The quality of supervision over the full implementation period did suffer some
difficulties. The quality of supervision is consequently rated Moderately Satisfactory for the reasons cited
below:
i) Despite the challenges the Project was facing, in 2009 as noted above, Bank supervision appears to
have waned for an 18-month period until mid-2010. Although the MTR was completed by the Project’s
Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) during this period, no ISR ratings or aide memoires are on file to record
supervision of implementation efforts or progress made.
ii) The turning point that brought Bank supervision back on track occurred in 2010 when management
proposed the application of a new approach for implementation support. Both Bank supervision and the
accuracy of ratings improved, as IP and GEO ratings were downgraded to ‘MU’ to reflect the magnitude
of the concerns that had been raised by past supervision missions, as well as in the MTR.
iii) The importance of the new approach for implementation support cannot be overlooked in terms of the
contribution that it made in guiding the Project to a positive conclusion: focused supervision increased,
detailed reporting was recorded through aide memoires, ISRs and regular video-conference minutes, and
three time-bound restructuring extensions, carefully structured to ensure that milestone goals were being
met, were processed. The renewed energy infused into the Bank’s supervision efforts from 2010 onwards
raised the quality of supervision back up, which justifies the rating of Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                                    20
Given the Moderately Satisfactory ratings for both quality at entry and supervision, the overall Bank
Performance rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Government performance, rated across the spectrum of the Project’s full implementation is considered to
have been Satisfactory. The Government was and remains a strong advocate for action in support of the
Stockholm Convention, demonstrated by the fact that Project results served to inform the 12th FYP.
Agencies involved through the NLG and at the provincial level through the provincial leading group, all
played a role, to varying degrees, in ensuring the development of comprehensive policy frameworks at the
national and provincial levels, advancing a diverse national capacity base to address the issue into the
future, and promoting awareness about the importance of sustainable hazardous waste management.

The Project benefited from political will and commitment, witnessed by total counterpart funding
commitments of US $13.7 million, from both the national and provincial Governments, which contributed
to national and provincial Project team operations, to the development of a sound framework of policies,
regulations and standards, as well as to the design of the national replication program and its initial
operationalization efforts. Given the evident support generated for this Project, the one reproach that may
be levied with respect to Government performance centers on the lack of clarity that surrounded the issue
of licensing for the handling of PCB wastes. It seems clear, in retrospect, that a more open and
constructive dialogue, particularly within MEP between the FECO/CIO and the Pollution Control
Department (PCD), could have resolved the issue far earlier than was done, which would have eliminated
some of the delays experienced. Overall however, performance was Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The technical complexity of the Project was reflected in the complex management structure adopted to
oversee the various aspects of its implementation. The MEP, the agency that oversees implementation of
the Stockholm Convention, as well as other multilateral environmental agreements in China, established a
PCB Project team in FECO/CIO to manage and monitor all central level Project operations. FECO/CIO
was well acquainted with Bank operations and procedures, given previous experience managing Bank-
implemented Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund-funded projects, as well as other GEF-funded
initiatives. To address technical issues or concerns, FECO/CIO recruited a CTA, a National Technical
Advisor (NTA) and other technical experts who contributed valuable input to Project operations. Overall,
the performance of the FECO/CIO team was satisfactory with respect to daily management and
partner/stakeholder liaison. However, issues related to the licensing of the project contractors detracted
from the team’s overall performance, as has the lack of confirmation of uptake of a comprehensive short-
term nationwide replication action plan based on Project results and experiences.

Unlike the FECO/CIO Project management team, the Zhejiang PIU had no experience in working with
Bank operations or in managing a financially and technically complex Project province-wide. The
Zhejiang EPB committed an important level of financing and technically qualified staff to ensure
implementation success and the PIU performed a good job in developing the provincial policy,
regulations and standards required to sustain the eventual elimination of PCBs, including building Project

                                                    21
results into a Clean Soil Action Plan for Zhejiang Province. However, the PIU struggled at times under
the various burdens of Project implementation, particularly as the procurement processes under
Component 3 became increasingly complex.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, Borrower performance is considered to have been moderately satisfactory. Commitment to
achieving the GEO, in accordance with obligations under the Stockholm Convention, was manifested
throughout Project implementation and FECO/CIO and PIU teams were committed to managing and
monitoring for results, despite certain difficulties with respect to management capacity, as noted above.
However, persistent issues with regard to intra-ministerial communication during implementation and
importantly, the fact that there was no indication that the Project’s national replication action plan and its
associated financing study, considered the tools by which to replicate and sustain results and experiences
nationwide, were officially adopted and in the process of being operationalized at the time of Project
closure, results in a rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

(1) The principle behind the demonstration project modality is that it allows a client to test initiatives or
    the viability of processes in sectors in which mature technologies have not yet been actively
    deployed, diffused or transferred, and where lessons learned can be of value for future activities,
    nationally or globally. Given its nature, the demonstration modality allows for a more flexible, testing
    approach to guide implementation. Two lessons emerge:
        a. At the Project design stage, in situations where baseline data such as the number of sites
            contaminated, the extent of site specific contamination and the level of clean-up required, is
            either difficult to determine or simply not known, outcome indicators developed should err
            towards the conservative, to avoid setting overly ambitious targets that may require down-
            grading through time-consuming restructuring in future. As the Project learned firsthand,
            even where site locations were confirmed through interviews and geo-radar testing prior to
            implementation, it was possible during site remediation to discover that PCB coffins had
            disappeared (for example, site #43).
        b. Inherent within the demonstration concept is the understanding that lessons learned will be
            applied more broadly and ensure sustainability of the demonstration investment made. It is
            therefore, key to begin work early on a clear plan for immediate next steps involved in the
            application of a national PCB replication program, endorsed by relevant government and
            private sector partners, and ensure the ongoing use of high-value project inputs, such as the
            TDU. In this respect, roll-out of national replication efforts should figure as a key outcome
            indicator as opposed to an intermediate outcome indicator.

(2) Effective PCB management in accordance with Stockholm Convention guidelines involves treatment
and disposal using technology that meets best available techniques and best environmental practices
(BAT/BEP). Access to, or use of such equipment is costly. When investing in such technology, thorough
and comprehensive prior assessment must be undertaken on the proposed alternatives. For the purposes of
the Project, thorough analysis regarding the use of the TDU was undertaken at preparation however, the
costs associated with TDU treatment turned out to be higher than originally planned. Ongoing use of the
TDU at a nationwide scale is projected within the context of the financing mechanism study as the most
cost efficient option for replication in other provinces and, is likely the best option in countries the size of
China, although where faced with small sites in remote locations in different regions, the added costs of

                                                      22
transportation are likely to reduce cost efficiency. Only once the national replication program is fully
implemented will this be known.

(3) Retrofitting one national service provider to a level that meets international standards while national
standards remain less stringent does not incentivize use of the upgraded facility. These implications need
to be considered at the outset of a Project’s preparation. The Shenyang Center, having retrofitted its
incinerator to meet the Stockholm Convention's stringent BAT/BEP standards is now in a position to
dispose of PCB in an environmentally sound manner, in line with international specifications. Yet
Chinese regulations remain less stringent. Shenyang’s services are now more expensive, placing it in a
less competitive position compared to other facilities in the country. The adoption of stricter standards in
Beijing, and the fact that the Project has supported the design of improved national environmental quality
standards that will serve to inform a national regulation governing chemical substances, including PCBs,
can serve to even the playing field. Nevertheless, a sustained effort, ideally through the implementation of
a comprehensive, and properly funded national replication plan, will be required to benefit from the
investment.

(4) In projects where legal dispensation is required to carry out work (licensing/permitting), it is vital that
the relevant legal requirements be clearly understood and the centers of authorization engaged from the
outset of a project.

(5) Bank supervision teams must ensure that local project partners possess the knowledge and capacity
required to manage complex procurement actions effectively in order to avoid situations such as when
modifications were made to contracts in the absence of prior Bank approval, resulting in delayed
completion of works at one site and determination of ineligible expenditures at another.

(6) Projects that require extensive technical management on the part of project implementation units and
national contractors to allow, for example, for the preparation and review of site specific remediation
plans, must include specific training to build such capacity so that smooth and efficient processing ensues.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

FECO/CIO and Zhejiang PIU prepared a draft Project Completion Report dated March 2013. In
evaluating Project design and achievements, the report indicates satisfaction with Project outcomes, based
on the fact that of the 25 outputs called for under the Project’s 6 Components, 23 were fully completed.
The two outputs where completion results were rated less than fully completed centered on monitoring
and evaluation. The impact that the Project’s implementation had with respect to raising consciousness
with regard to PCB management issues at all levels of society is considered to be key to the sustainability
of efforts. A summary of Recipient’s completion report can be found in Annex 7.

The draft ICR was shared with FECO/CIO, their comments incorporated in the final report and
concurrence received on June 24, 2013.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The Project was consistent with the strategic priorities identified in the GEF 3 (2002-2006) POPs Focal
Area Strategy and the objectives of the corresponding draft GEF Operational Program for Reducing and
Eliminating Releases of Persistent Organic Pollutants (OP14), which sought to provide assistance, on the
basis of incremental costs, to developing countries for:
a) targeted (foundational) capacity building including, awareness-raising among various stakeholders
    and management and dissemination of information on integrated management of POPs, including best
    management practices;
b) implementation of policy and regulatory reforms, as well as priority on-the-ground investments; and
c) demonstration of innovative and cost-effective technologies and alternative practices, including the
    management and phase-out of PCBs.20

In ratifying the Stockholm Convention, China officially committed to the obligation under Part II, Annex
A, to take measures to manage and dispose of PCBs and PCB-containing materials in accordance with the
Convention’s requirements. From an over-arching perspective, this commitment laid the foundation for
future results generated during the demonstration Project to be applied in the country’s remaining
provinces in the future, as outlined in Project Component 6, National Replication Program.

Prior CPTF and Italian POPs TF-supported activities helped prioritize Project components related to
institutional arrangements, policy options, and available treatment and disposal technology choices. The
CPTF funded a series of national and provincial-level awareness-raising workshops, along with a capacity
building project that supported the initiation of a PCB management training program covering, inter alia,
safe site assessment, establishment of safe storage sites, assessment of PCB destruction technologies,
environmental sampling and worker safety, all of which formed the genesis for the development of the
more extensive training supported by the Project. The CPTF also funded a toxicity study of POPs on
women and children, based on biological and environmental sampling in Zhejiang Province that
confirmed moderately high levels of exposure to PCBs. The Italian POPs TF supported the development
of the key PCB inventory methodology that was used in Zhejiang and Liaoning Provinces, as well as the
preparation of the draft national strategy on PCB reduction and disposal.

Component 1, Institutional strengthening: Activities undertaken under this component helped build the
capacity necessary to bring the Project to successful completion and internalize knowledge and skills
regarding PCB management and disposal that will serve to underpin China’s ongoing work in this sector.
Funding supported knowledge-building within FECO/CIO, the arm of MEP that manages all international
projects. The FECO/CIO PCB Project Team was responsible for the overall planning and supervision of
Project activities. A key role involved liaison within the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), the
agency in China tasked with implementation of the Stockholm Convention, as well as with key NLG
partners, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC).
Coordination of national–level activities related to the development of regulations and quality standards
for PCB management and disposal, development of a funding mechanism for co-financing future PCB
management and disposal in China, and public awareness and outreach fell under the FECO/CIO PCB
Project Team’s purview.

The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established in Zhejiang Province was staffed by individuals from
the Zhejiang EPB, which helped build consensus, cooperation and dialogue amongst provincial-level
stakeholders. The PIU was responsible for provincial level Project supervision including, administrative
and technical support services, and liaison with the provincial level leading group composed of the
government general office, the department of environmental protection, the financial bureau, the
development and reform commission and the provincial level power company, as well as with the
principal Project contractor, DADI.




Relations between the Project’s national and provincial management teams were positive and very
constructive. The only perceived drawback involved the number of levels through which information had
to pass within the Project’s overall management structure. A case in point involved the lack of clarity
surrounding the regulatory requirements governing the handling of PCB wastes, an issue controlled by the
Pollution Control Department (PCD) in MEP, which caused confusion and delays that, for a time,
compromised implementation under Component 3 (see below, overview of Components 3 and 4).

A total of 362 technical and policy staff from national and provincial authorities including, the Zhejiang
Solid Waste Management Center and PIU, FECO/CIO, the local EPBs and power companies received
technical PCB management training covering site monitoring, risk assessment, PCB storage, treatment
and disposal, all of which were key to the successful completion of the Project’s other components.

the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), as well as other international and national
experts. The Project also benefited from the involvement of international and national technical advisors

PCB contaminated site clean-up in the province and, in overall technical direction and guidance, as well
as from the involvement of an expert group convened to assist the Zhejiang PIU in drafting a plan for
PCB contaminated site clean-up in the province.

Component 2, Development of a Policy Framework for PCB Management and Disposal: The Project
successfully advanced the development of an over-arching policy framework for PCB management and
disposal at both the provincial and national levels. Effective coordination and partnerships between
various government ministries, experts and academia are seen to have facilitated the elaboration of these
policy-related Project activities. At the national level, the framework includes a series of regulations
made up of eight technical standards/guidelines and six policy regulations that address the various aspects
of PCB management including, identification, inventory, risk assessment, emergency response,
extraction, handling, transportation, monitoring, disposal and incineration (Table 2-2). During
implementation, the decision was taken to not develop stand-alone national PCB control standards but
rather, to embed national PCB pollution control and environmental quality standards into a broader
national regulatory framework for all chemical substances, now under preparation by MEP. This
approach is considered reasonable and likely to yield good long-term synergies. At the provincial level,
three PCB contamination management regulations were enacted including, the Zhejiang Province PCB
Contamination Environmental Prevention and Control Regulation, the Zhejiang Province Emergency Plan
for Sudden PCB Contamination Incidents, and the Zhejiang Province PCB Contaminated Sites Clean-up
Project Acceptance Management Regulation.

The Project also funded the elaboration of a study to ascertain options for developing a funding
mechanism to finance PCB management and disposal in China into the future, associated with the
national replication program. At Project completion, an abstract of the Study was provided to the ICR
team. The abstract indicates that the recommendations proposed, which outline 3 possible future funding
scenarios, are based on a nationwide investigation in which 75 PCB equipment storage points housing
7,863 domestic and imported PCB electrical appliances, of which 400 online capacitors were identified in
20 provinces. The provinces are not indicated, nor are the potential sites in need of remediation. It further
indicates that results and experiences gained during implementation of the demonstration Project allowed
for costs associated the future management and disposal of both low concentration and high concentration
PCBs to be assessed. Three management and disposal options are identified, ranging in cost from 1.138
billion Yuan to 610 million Yuan. The least cost option proposes third party use of the thermal desorption
technology funded under the Project to dispose of the low concentration PCB wastes in all 20 provinces,
and treatment of high concentration wastes at the Shenyang and Tianjin incinerators. Funding, it is
explained, will emanate principally from Government and private enterprises according to a 4:6 ratio,
with the Government contribution further being divided 6:4 between central and local governments. No
background data is presented in the English-language abstract to support the assumptions and
recommendations presented. Nor is there any analysis of how the cost considerations associated with the
Project’s implementation have been weighed and measured. This is worrisome given the diversity of
PCB-contaminated sites encountered during the demonstration Project, the expectation that such diverse
site characteristics may surface in other provinces, and the wide range of costs that such diversity was
shown to engender in Zhejiang. While the abstract’s least cost option relies internalizing the positive
aspects of the Zhejiang demonstration and speaks to the potential for long-term sustainability of the GEF

                                                                  30
investment, in the absence of access to the comprehensive study, it is impossible to gauge how realistic
the assumptions presented may be.

The activities to be conducted under Component 3 were designed to form the basis for the practical
technical framework for cleaning-up PCB storage sites in Zhejiang, and would inform the design of the
national replication program for further PCB elimination. Of the fifty-six (56) sites estimated as requiring
clean-up at appraisal, a total of 35 sites were identified as contaminated using geo-radar (ground
penetrating radar) technology, but only 16 sites were eventually cleaned, having been deemed
contaminated and/or accessible (see Table 2-4).

Implementation of this component generated a number of delays, throughout the life of the Project. Many
centered on the Project contractor, the Hangzhou Dadi Environmental Protection Co. Ltd. (DADI). DADI
had been selected as a single source Project contractor for the recovery of PCB wastes, treatment of
contaminated soils and decontamination of PCB-contaminated transformers at design stage. At the time of
project preparation, a total of 300 hazardous waste disposal facilities were planned in China, but the
Government indicated that only two were to be granted the right to handle PCBs, including that operated
by DADI, which covered services for the mid-to southern China. This designation was based on the
company’s experience in waste management under the National Program for the Construction of
Hazardous and Medical Waste Disposal issued by the State Council in 200321, its prior experience in
cleaning-up PCB sites, and the expertise it had gained thanks to a decade’s worth of Project-relevant
technical training its staff had received from the German aid agency, GTZ. MEP confirmed at design
stage that DADI would be granted an official license to handle PCB wastes, excluding final disposal of
highly-contaminated PCB waste. The question of licensing would raise issues for much of the Project’s
implementation, not least of which was their being issued a license was one of the withdrawal conditions
written into the GA.

The problem initially centered on the issue of ownership. It was understood at project preparation that the
handling of PCB wastes, in accordance with the regulations on Measures for Administration of
Hazardous Waste (HW) Operation Permits (2004), included collection, storage and disposal. What was
not known and what did not surface until later, was that in addition, China’s HW regulations stipulate that
in order to obtain a license, the licensee must own and operate a PCB disposal facility. Because the TDU
was purchased using Project funds, its ownership resided with the Government and could not be
transferred to DADI. Therefore, DADI could not be issued a license, nor were they able to collect,
transport store or treat PCBs or PCB-contaminated soil.

A number of extensive inter-ministerial consultations were organized to clarify the PCB-contaminated
waste permitting process. Eventually, in 2010 the Project received clarification from the Pollution Control
Department of MEP, the authority in charge of HW policies and regulations, that HW permitting
regulations only require licensing for disposal of HW, and that PCB-contaminated soil was not considered
a HW therefore, a license was not required for excavation and temporary storage of PCB wastes (i.e.,
clean-up of PCB contaminated sites). As such, it became clear that MEP issuing a license was not the
solution and so, to satisfy the GA’s withdrawal condition, it was proposed to have the provincial EPB
approve the PCB clean-up plans, involving collection and storage of soil and capacitors, and that MEP,
while not required by law, would issue a national level approval for DADI to operate the TDU for
disposal purposes. In July 2010, the Zhejiang EPB reviewed and approved two site clean-up plans
prepared by DADI and MEP issued an approval to operate the TDU facility on September 19, 2010,
which coincided with the installation of the TDU.

Procurement of the TDU and determination of a location for the TDU facility and storage site also faced
difficulties. The Project indicated the intent, at design, to have a mobile TDU treat soil in situ, though it
was acknowledged that a final decision regarding selection of a mobile or fixed TDU option would
require preparation of a feasibility study, pending completion of the site characterization work and
consideration of the Project’s eventual national replication component needs.22 Ultimately, the Project
opted for a central TDU treatment location. Difficulties arose with the first location selection made due to
local government reluctance to accept all PCB waste for the province within the locality, a concern that
was supported by the local community. The TDU site and storage facility therefore, had to be changed
during implementation. The issue was well-managed by the Zhejiang PIU, but resulted in delays due to
the need to engage in new negotiations to identify another suitable location. With respect to the TDU
itself, the initial bidding process, which closed in late October 2007, resulted in submission of only one
bid. The bid was rejected by the Bank on the grounds that the financial requirement regarding registered
capital had not been met, that the bid security provided did not meet the requirements in the bidding
document issued, and that the pricing schedule did not tabulate.23 It was noted at that time, that the bid
price for the TDU was nearly twice that at appraisal. In order to attract more potential bidders, the Bank
team suggested that the TDU be procured through ICB, with supplementary equipment procured locally.
A re-bid by ICB was therefore initiated. The bidding, contracting, delivery and installation process would
finally be completed by September 2010.

Once installed, the TDU, long-anticipated, immediately faced a host of technical problems including, an
initial inability to achieve the environmental performance standards required under the Stockholm
Convention which had been clearly specified in the contract, and difficulties in reaching a reasonable
operating capacity due to frequent breakdowns. Resolution of these problems would take over a year,
which resulted in the contract for the TDU’s operation only being authorized in December 2011. In the
interim, the TDU underwent more than 25 trial runs, as well as mini tests in order to secure the Proof of
Performance (POP) test required to ensure that the process was reaching the specifications outlined in the
bidding document and contract, and required under the Convention.24 This situation affected not only the
cost-effectiveness of operations, but also made for additional work on the part of all parties involved due
to the need to establish individual contracts dependent on the actual number of tons of PCB waste treated
and the associated fixed labor costs.

The issue of fixed costs also raised disagreement between Zhejiang PIU and the Bank team on the cost
proposal submitted by DADI. Even once the POP test had been passed, it was clear that the TDU would
never run at 100% capacity during the Project’s lifetime, yet the clean-up plans and cost estimates
submitted by DADI included fixed costs for labor based on a costing for continuous full-capacity TDU
operation employing 47 staff. The Bank team considered this to be high given that the available soil was
approximately 3-4 times less than could be processed by the TDU per month, and twice less than actual
typical monthly processing capacity given the unstable equipment availability rates, yet the number of
workers proposed remained the same. Compromise was finally met when DADI, the PIU and the Bank
agreed that direct costs were dependent, and would be paid based on the actual amount of soil treated, and
that the existing number of workers needed to be maintained in order to respect labor law/contractual
implications, and equally importantly, to allow them to benefit from on-site training to ensure availability
of trained staff once normal operation of the TDU resumed.

Component 4 provided funding for the final destruction of highly contaminated PCB wastes collected in
Zhejiang Province by incineration at a facility in Shenyang, Liaoning Province that required upgrading in
order to be able to dispose of PCBs and PCB wastes in compliance with the Convention’s specifications.

The Shenyang Hazardous Waste Incineration Center was upgraded for PCB waste incineration, including
construction pre-treatment and storage facilities, upgrading of the on-line monitoring system and
automatic control system, and construction of a hazardous waste characterization/analysis laboratory.
Initially, the Shenyang Center faced similar issues to those faced by DADI with respect to licensing. In
Shenyang’s case, FECO was finally able to confirm that the Center was in possession of a license that
allowed for the trial operation to proceed in order to demonstrate the safe disposal of PCBs in accordance
with Chinese environmental emission standards. The trial run was successfully completed in 2009, with
emission results in compliance with agreed standards. A report, outlining the environmental impact
parameters of the trial, including minimization of dioxins, and demonstrating that emissions were within
the limits agreed for the operation under the EIA, was submitted to the Bank. External monitoring was
conducted by third party institute during the incineration process. The facility now meets the Stockholm
Convention BAT guidance, which imposes stricter emission standards compared to those imposed by
Chinese regulations.

Prior to Project completion, the Bank and the FECO/CIO team discussed the Shenyang incineration
facility’s future operation prospects. The situation in Shenyang is different from that with the TDU given
that the facility can process a large majority of hazardous waste, however concern exists that the stricter
emission standards which the incinerator is designed to reach make the Shenyang facility less cost-
competitive compared to other similar incineration facilities. On the positive side, discussion on
decreasing dioxin and furan emission standards from 0.5ng TEG/Nm3 to 0.1 has been making headway,
with Beijing recently adopting the 0.1 standard for solid waste incineration. This may pave the way for
the rest of China to follow suit in the near term. Regardless, within the context of the final elaboration of
the replication program, it was agreed an incineration plan for the remainder of highly-contaminated
wastes from Zhejiang and other provinces, as well as a business plan, would be prepared by early 2013.

Component 5 outlined the means by which the Project would track progress toward project objectives and
facilitate learning and capture results that would, in turn, inform preparation of the national replication
program goals. A series of comprehensive outcome indicators Results Framework (PAD, Annex 3) were
developed to track implementation and results achieved under each Component including, the sound
management and disposal of low and high-concentration PCB contaminated wastes, the development of
PCB policies, regulations and standards, and associated capacity building and outreach. Achievement of
the outcome indicators was expected, cumulatively, to lay the foundation upon which to develop a
national replication program for PCB management and disposal, considered a key Project output with
respect to the potential for long-term sustainability of the investment made. The indicators were, in
general, adequately conceived to track progress under each component, and were clear, measurable and
specific. In retrospect however, the indicators associated with clean-up targets, both with respect to
number of sites and tons cleaned, are considered to have been too narrowly defined at appraisal, given the
absence of reliable baseline information regarding the number of PCB contaminated sites and, by
extension, the lack of clear knowledge regarding the extent of the clean-up that would ultimately be
required.

Overall, monitoring and reporting of the Project’s implementation, including administrative and technical
(FM, procurement), as well as against output and intermediate outcome indicators, was conducted in a
satisfactory manner by FECO/CIO and the Zhejiang PIU. M&E reporting on activities and results was
performed through preparation of semi-annual project progress reports. On the whole, these progress
reports were submitted in a timely manner, with the exception of the final year of implementation, an

                                                     34
oversight acknowledged by the FECO/CIO in the Project Completion Report as the reason that one
outcome indicator was not fully met (see Annex 7). During the final year, which was also the period
during which the bulk of the treatment of low-concentration PCB-contaminated soils was undertaken, the
submission of semi-annual progress reports was replaced by submission of a series of ad hoc reports that
highlighted implementation progress, disposal achievements and status of disbursements. In addition, the
POPs management information system (POPs-MIS) that was expected to facilitate monitoring, allow for
generation of aggregate national level data and demonstrate effectiveness results, was developed later
than expected and consolidated to include the data management needs of the POPs pesticide Project.

In relation to Component 6, the results achieved in Zhejiang Province were expected to inform the
development of a national replication plan that, together with the study that would outline a financing
mechanism, would allow China to address remaining PCB management and disposal issues into the future.
Beijing Normal University was contracted to prepare the plan, in cooperation with the FECO/CIO team
and the CTA. Beginning in 2010, a nationwide PCB inventory/survey was conducted. The results of the
first two surveys indicated that significantly lower volumes of buried PCB waste were in evidence than
estimates projected. FECO/CIO was of the opinion that the results generated during the surveys contained
deficiencies associated with both the surveying process itself and low awareness about PCB
contamination among local authorities.
During the final stages of implementation, with the Province’s PCB contaminated sites remediated and
the TDU in operation, FECO/CIO and the Zhejiang PIU initiated provision of in-depth training to local
EPBs on Project results. In December 2012, two national workshops (“China PCBs Management and
Disposal Demonstration Project Publicity and Training workshop?), involving participants from 24 EPBs,
as well as an international workshop, were held to promote achievements and discuss issues associated
with Project sustainability. In tandem, a national 12th 5-year POPs plan was finalized and approved with
the aim of safely disposing of identified PCB-contaminated equipment waste from the power sector, and
cleaning and disposing of high-concentration PCB-contaminated soils by 2015.

Regrettably, a comprehensive assessment of the short-term national replication action plan was not
possible at the time of ICR preparation, given that no indication had been provided to the ICR team that
the replication plan, and its associated financing study, had been operationalized and was being
systematically applied.

                                                              35
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

An incremental cost analysis that compared the baseline scenario with the GEF-Alternative scenario was
conducted at Project appraisal. The baseline scenario involved the ongoing application of a series of
existing ad hoc regulatory, policy and management approaches to the issue of PCB management25 at the
national and provincial levels. In addition, the status quo operation of the Shenyang pilot incineration
facility would continue, despite the fact that it was not in compliance with Stockholm Convention
requirements due to dated control systems and a lack of online monitoring systems. Effectively, the
baseline scenario outlined the continuation of the management practice adopted in the 1990s that had
shifted from dismantling to finding and monitoring temporary storage sites, with recovery of PCBs only
conducted in the face of serious identified leakages or other accidental releases, or when a site was
required for another use, and only on a case-by-case basis. Projections under the baseline scenario were
that approximately 5% of the temporary PCB storage sites would be remediated, and that these would be
the sites with serious leakages identified, and neither Zhejiang Province, nor the Central Government
would develop comprehensive management and policy frameworks to ensure the environmentally sound
management and disposal of PCBs.

Nonetheless, under the Baseline Scenario, with GEF support China would prepare and submit to the
Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention, a National Implementation Plan (NIP) by August
2006 that would describe China’s POPs situation, prioritize actions and outline intended management
responses. This action would be undertaken in tandem with implementation of the ongoing Italian POPs
TF, that was collecting PCB baseline information in Zhejiang and Liaoning Provinces, and the CPTF, that
provided training for PCB management.

Under the GEF Alternative Scenario, and based on an incremental cost calculation of US $32 million, of
GEF funding would provide US $18.34 million, the Project would comprehensively identify and
demonstrate in Zhejiang province, where a good number of serious accidental PCB leakages had occurred
in the past, demonstrate how the PCBs would be safely and most cost-effectively recovered from their
temporary storage sites, how those sites could be remediated, and the PCBs transported and disposed of in
an environmentally sound manner, all in compliance with the objectives of the Stockholm Convention.
This experience was expected to build practical PCB management experience in China and lay the
foundations needed to achieve complete disposal of all PCBs in-country by 2028, as specified in the
Stockholm Convention. In particular, the GEF-Alternative scenario would support:
1. Identification of all PCB storage sites and PCB transformers still in use26 in Zhejiang province;
2. Recovery, transportation and disposal of all PCB equipment and PCB wastes from temporary storage
    sites and PCBs from transformers still in use in Zhejiang Province, following which sites would be
    restored to their original condition consistent with international environmental practice;
3. Disposal of recovered PCBs in an environmentally-sound manner at China’s designated national
    center for PCB disposal in Shenyang, which would be updated for that purpose by December 2005;
    and
4. Development of capacity and practical experience in managing PCB elimination at the national level,
    which would then be translated into preparation of a detailed national PCB management plan.

In the absence of established guidelines on what constitutes incremental costs under the Stockholm
Convention, the Project’s incremental cost calculation was made based on the general guidelines


25
     PAD, Annex 15, paragraph 7, sub-paragraphs a-f, p.122.
26
   This component was eventually dropped when it became clear that no PCB transformers remained in service, and was replaced with efforts to
ensure the safe and environmentally-sound transportation of high-concentration PCB contaminated waste from Zhejiang province to the
Shenyang incinerator.

                                                                    36
contained in GEF guidance on Incremental Cost (GEFK.7hnf.5). These guidelines define the principle of
“incremental cost? as “a measure of the future economic burden on [a] country that would result from its
choosing the GEF-Alternative in preference to the course of action would have been sufficient in the
national interest.? It did not include a rigorous incremental cost breakdown component by component but
rather, adopted a more qualitative assessment by comparing ‘without’ and ‘with’ project scenarios, and
explaining the incrementality in terms of the fact that actions ‘with’ project would not have occurred in
the absence of obligations under the Stockholm Convention, supported by that body’s financial
mechanism.

Thus, based on an assessment of the global and national risks/benefits associated with each scenario, the
total GEF-Alternative cost was calculated to be US $32.5 million, with incremental costs totaling US
$31.5 million. In recognition of the fact that China would realize some national benefits from the
incremental expenditures, the Government offered to co-finance the Project by US $11.34 million, plus
generated additional co-financing of US $1.84 million from the Governments of Italy, Japan, and the
United States. GEF support of US $18.34 million provided the balance of the incremental costs.

Overall, the incremental cost analysis estimate was accurate, as the incremental costs incurred as a result
of Project activities made almost 100% use of the GEF grant, as well as the co-financing and bilateral
contributions received. Given the acknowledgement of the broad Project achievements, from a cost-
efficiency perspective, the Project achieved a satisfactory result.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

The demonstration project was designed to contribute both local and global public good by reducing the
risk of the release of PCBs into the environment. Due to the lack of reliable baseline data and difficulties
associated in measuring the impact of the overall environmental, health and related socio-economic
impacts under a ‘without project’ scenario, it was not possible to conduct a traditional economic or
financial cost-benefit analysis for the Project. Nonetheless, benefits to both the local and global
environment and human health that would accrue by reducing the potential for PCBs to leach into the
environment, though difficult to quantify, were understood to be significant and therefore, considered to
exceed the demonstration Project’s associated costs.

At the design stage, an estimate was made by FECO/CIO of the cost-effectiveness associated with
operation of the TDU system under Project Component 3, with an estimated thermal desorption treatment
cost of US $270/ton between end 2006 and mid-2009. The actual TDU treatment cost turned out to be
higher than projected for two main reasons: one, the value of the RMB, the currency used for operating



                                                                                   37
cost estimates incurred by the local contractor, dropped against the US dollar by the time the TDU
treatment process began in December 2011, raising the cost of treatment/ton27; and two, due to the fact
that the TDU was unstable and prone to frequent break-downs (see Section 2.2, Annex 2), only lower
contaminated soil loads could be treated, while fixed costs did not alter as they were not dependent on
actual treatment capacity. As a result, the average treatment cost increased to US $460/ton during
December 2011-December 2012 period.

For incineration of highly-contaminated waste in Shenyang, appraisal relied on the cost of incineration in
European/North American countries, which stood at approximately US $2,000/ton, excluding
transportation. As in the case of the TDU, actual disposal costs in Shenyang turned out to be higher than
projected, amounting to US$ 4,123/ton for the first 100 tons incinerated in November 2011, and
US$3,717/ton for the 669.4 tons incinerated in November-December 2012. The key factors in this case
pertain to the amount of soil available for treatment, given that fewer sites than projected required
remediation and the volume of high-concentration PCB contaminated waste was lower than had been
estimated, and the high proportion of fixed costs.

From a cost per Project site perspective, at appraisal, US$ 4.55 million was allocated for the clean-up of
56 sites, many of which had not yet been identified. The average cost per site would have been
US$ 81,232.00. Following Project completion, US $3.68 million had been disbursed to clean-up 16 sites,
for an average of US $230,000/site. Clean-up costs ranged from US $10,075 to US $1.069 million per site
and the average clean-up cost/ton of soil ranged from US $131/ton at one site to US $14,940/ton at
another. The variation in costs per site and ton is indicative of the challenges posed by the particularities
of China’s PCB problem where site characteristics are not uniform but rather, diverse: some sites were
easily accessed while others required significant effort and cost to access, and some contained virtually no
contaminated materials but nevertheless incurred significant costs to access. The average cost/ton clean-
up is therefore, not a good indicator of efficiency. Comparison with PCB project results in other countries
also does not yield useful comparative data. For example, the Moldova POPs Stockpiles Management and
Destruction Project reported an average cost/ton eliminated of US $4,183/ton. However, the
characterization of the PCB problem was vastly different in Moldova, which allowed clean-up to be
addressed in a much more consolidated manner, something which the particularities of China’s temporary
PCB storage system did not allow. This heralds an important lesson regarding cost considerations that
will necessarily have to be taken into account as China rolls out its national replication program.

   In 2011, the RMB dropped to 6.4 against the US dollar. In comparison, its value in 2006 stood at 7.9 RMB to 1 US$, and at appraisal, it had
been even higher, at 8.1 RMB for 1 US$.

SUMMARY
FECO/CIO, MEP; March 2013

Background/Project Rationale

      In order to eliminate the hazards of POPs to environment, speed up PCBs power equipment and
waste clean-up and disposal, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China(MEP )(formerly SEPA) and
World Bank cooperated to develop the “China PCBs Management and Disposal Demonstration
Project?(hereafter referred to as PCBs project). Aim to clean-up and dispose PCBs power equipment and
waste. Meanwhile, explore and demonstrate environmentally sound and economically effective PCBs
equipment management and disposal policy, method and technology. PCB project will replicate safe and
effective PCBs management and disposal technology nation-wide through demonstration which will play
the lead and promotion role to eliminate PCBs equipment and waste nation-wide. MEP had authorized
institution affiliated to MEP-Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) of MEP to act as PCBs
project domestic implementation agency, undertaking project daily management work.

Project implementation and management

Project management
(1)Work plan management
       According to the requirement of WB and “project implementation manual?, based on project
document, FECO coordinated PIU, experts and relevant institution to formulate project overall work plan,
clarified each activity content, time frame, responsible party, and funding arrangement, and will adjust
periodically during the implementation stage based on actual progress.
(2) Procurement management
      Based on WB “WB guideline on selection and recruitment of consultant?, “WB procurement
guideline “, “Project grant agreement? and “Project implementation manual?, with reference to “P.R.
China Bidding Law?, and “FECO procurement work manual? compile by FECO specifically targeted at
foreign grant use management regulation, each year will periodically draft project annual procurement
plan, clarify major content of each activity, budget, procurement method, review method, timely update
and submission of procurement plan to WB for approval.
(3)Financial management
      Based on MOF “International financial organization and foreign government loan and grant
management method?(MOF directive 2006 No. 38), and “China PCBs management and disposal
demonstration project financial management method?(FMM), from funding claim reimbursement and
fund raising, assets management, financial accounting, file management to financial report, all these
procedures strictly follow the relevant regulations and rules.
      Project special account is setup at MOF, provincial PIU submit quarterly FMR, FECO will
summarize and verify, and submit to MOF for funding application. MOF will make advance
disbursement of funding based on next quarter budget, to ensure smooth running of all activities. During
project implementation, in order to upgrade funding disbursement efficiency, after multi-parties
negotiation, reimburse method is changed to “reimburse based on actual expenditure, and MOF will
reimburse the cost based on SOE table?. Which means FECO submit SOE to MOF for occurred
expenditure reimbursement, Zhejiang PIU submit SOE to MOF through provincial financial dept. for
expenditure reimbursement. This kind of reimbursement method is kept until project closure which
achieved good effect.
      MOF as the project grant management window, will exam and verify FECO and PIU’s grant use
situation, and periodically submit funding application to WB and report funding use details.

                                                  44
Supervision and Evaluation
(1)Daily routine Supervision
     Based on project activities requirement, FECO and WB will carry out 1-2 times project progress
evaluation annually, and go to demonstration province to have field visit, and timely follow up latest
project progress and achievement. Targeted at issues occurred during project implementation in
demonstration areas, all parties will timely communicate and coordinate and formulate improvement or
adjustment plan.
(2) Annual audit
      During project implementation, State Auditing Administration will carry out annual audit during
March-April each year, including project performance and financial audit. And fully exam all the
activities being carried out during project implementation in detail.
      Audit result showed that there is no major audit issues during project implementation period,
provincial PIU had cooperated actively for auditing, and timely improve their work based on audit
comments, try their best to perfect project outcome.

                                                                45
     At local level, Zhejiang Dept. of Environmental Protection issued 3 PCBs contamination
management and control regulation in Jan. 2009, which are “Zhejiang province PCBs contamination
environmental prevention and control regulation(trial implementation), “Zhejiang province emergency
plan for sudden PCBs contamination incident “(trial implementation), and “Zhejiang province PCBs
contaminated sites clean-up project acceptance management trial regulation? respectively.
      Issuance of above-mentioned PCBs management regulation and completion of all kinds of technical
outputs provided policy management basis and technical support for demonstration province PCBs burial
site management and clean-up. Which will play full demonstration role of the PCBs project. Example had
been setup for other province and regions to learn or replicate PCBs waste management and disposal after
the project closure.
Establishment of PCBs contaminated site technical and management route
      PCBs project carried out 7 times of personnel training and technical workshops, among which 1
time for management capacity strengthening, 6 times for technical training and workshops. Domestic and
international experts from relevant institution or fields, project stakeholders and local environmental
protection bureaus participated in the training. Total trainees reached 362 person times, which built a
solid foundation for PCBs project smooth implementation and advancement.
     Based on risk assessment result, Zhejiang PIU determined remediation target of contaminated site
according to site future use properties. It is 14mg/kg for industrial/commercial land, 1.5mg/kg for
residential land, 0.1mg/kg for agriculture land. During the site clean-up, rapid detection is combined with
lab analysis to ensure clean-up reached the remediation target.

PCBs waste treatment and disposal capacity establishment and improvement
（1） TDU’s procurement and trial run
      Through two times international competitive bidding (ICB), the final review in Dec. 2008
determined the TDU and auxiliary facility supplier. And installation had been completed in Sept. 2009 in
Hangzhou Jiande TDU site. This set designed treatment capacity is 3 tons/hour, it can run for 24 hours
continuously.
      In year 2011, FECO and Hangzhou Dadi Environmental Protection Engineering Co. Ltd
(Hereinafter refer to Dadi company) signed Entrustment Agreement and entrusted DADI to be
responsible for daily operation and management of TDU and its auxiliary supporting facility.
      In May 2012, hosted by Zhejiang PIU, all other stakeholders participated in the TDU environmental
acceptance test, the results showed that during the operation of the TDU: all the indicators such as dioxin
in flue gas, PCBs emission and PCBs concentration in soil after treatment all meet the local
environmental protection standard, which signified PCBs project had setup the PCBs contaminated soil
treatment and remediation capacity.

（2） High temperature incineration and upgrade of relevant equipment
     Based on the PCBs project arrangement, from 2007 to Nov. 2008, through plan compilation
evaluation, engineering design, competitive bidding procedure, by using project grant , for Shenyang PCB
incineration facility they add one more component to build pre-disposal hazardous waste characteristic
analysis and identification unit. Whole set of instruments include: heat value analyzer, water detector etc.
for physical property identification, GC-MS, Atomic absorption spectrophotometer, element analyzer,
ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer etc. for chemical component analysis, and server, storage and
database for data analysis and handling. And they had completed all set of lab instrument and equipment
installation and tuning including the large scale instruments like GC-MS by June 2009. The setup of
hazardous waste characteristic analysis and identification unit realized multiple functions such as basic
data collection for PCBs and its waste, entering into warehouse sampling and analysis, distinguish
labeling and confirmation, pre-treatment process analysis, relevant technical standard and norms
collection and sort out, relevant data collection and research, technical training and exchange, etc.

                                                    46
       Meanwhile Shenyang center/Shenyang Academy of Environmental Sciences raised fund on their
own to improve flue gas online monitoring system and automatic control system for PCBs incineration
facilities:
      Automatic control system improvement mainly include centralized display system for working
condition, main parameters automatic control for incineration and flue gas treatment, each sub-system
data processing component, and major working condition parameter storage upgrading. Compiled
specialized software to record and store the system status data, and realized dynamic connection through
internet to Shenyang Academy of Environmental Sciences. Data could be transferred and displayed in
real time.
       After the upgrading of the equipment, daily disposal capacity is 15 tons/day, annual disposal
capacity is 4000 tons. The trial burn result in Sept. 2009 showed that the DRE of PCBs reached over
99.9999%, dioxin emission in the flue gas is below 0.1ngTEQ/Nm3 which meets the project requirement.
All parameter of emission and process data meet the pollution control standard of hazardous waste
incineration which possessed the condition of safe, efficient, environmentally sound incineration to
dispose PCBs waste.

(3) Construction of Storage Facility

     From 2007, through plan formulation and evaluation, engineering design, goods procurement,
construction and warehouse equipment procurement and installation, PCBs project built storage facility in
Hangzhou, Zhejiang and Shenyang center respectively for the purpose of storage/pretreatment of high
concentration PCBs waste and temporary store/transfer low concentration PCBs waste.

      The temporary storage facility construction in Shenyang is completed in Nov. 2008, supporting
equipment installation, upgrading and sub-system tuning had been completed by July, 2009. The storage
unit has passed expert acceptance organized by Shenyang Environmental Protection Bureau. Hangzhou
temporary storage facility goods procurement is done by FECO, Zhejiang PIU is responsible for leasing
temporary site, selection of construction subcontractor and supervision company. It is finally built in Jan.
2011.
      The newly built PCBs waste storage facility capacity reached 1000 tons and 300 tons in Shenyang
center and Zhejiang Hangzhou respectively, which provided guarantee for high concentration PCBs waste
temporary storage, transportation and disposal.
PCBs contaminated site clean-up and remediation
      Based on PCBs inventory investigation result, Zhejiang had identified 35 PCBs equipment burial
site and PCBs contaminated sites, distributed into 10 cities except Zhoushan. There are 7 each in
Hangzhou and Shaoxing, 4 each in Ningbo, Jiaxing, Jinhua, 3 in Wenzhou, 2 each in Quzhou and Huzhou,
1 each in Taizhou and Lishui. Based on PCBs project overall progress plan, through prior preparation
work such as geographical detection, pre-monitoring, social safeguard survey, compensation for
occupying famers land, finally clean-up PCBs equipment and contaminants, contaminated soil
transportation and site closure for 16 burial sites which possessed the condition for clean-up. By end of
2012, 11,428 tons of low concentration PCBs contaminated soil and 715.91 tons of high concentration
PCBs contaminated wastes were cleaned up in Zhejiang in a timely manner, risk was effectively
controlled, which achieved the overall objectives for PCBs waste clean-up and contamination control.
PCBs waste treatment and disposal
（1） TDU treatment for low concentration contaminated soil in Hangzhou, Zhejiang
     According to the PCBs project arrangement, Hangzhou Dadi Environmental Protection Engineering
Co. Ltd undertook the TDU treatment for low concentration contaminated soil from site clean-up. From
Sept. 2010 TDU installation and trial run until the project closure on Dec. 31, 2012, total treated


                                                    47
contaminated soil amount to 8572 tons, among which 7400 tons are treated after Dec. 2011 when the
TDU is running under stable condition.

      In Dec. 2012, DADI optimized soil storage in TDU treatment storage site. They changed ways of
storage from simply pile up loose soil to pile soil sacks together. The contaminated soil storage capacity
increased from 1200 tons to 3000 tons, which provide guarantee for the large amount of temporary
storage and treatment pressure at final stage of project implementation.

（2） High concentration PCBs waste incineration disposal in Shenyang, Liaoning
      According to PCBs burial site clean-up work progress in Zhejiang, in accordance with PCBs project
arrangement, FECO signed two high concentration PCBs waste incineration disposal contracts through
direct procurement method with Environmental Protection Hazardous Waste Disposal Engineering
Technology(Shenyang) Center (Hereinafter refer to Shenyang Center) in Oct. 2011 and Nov. 2012
respectively. Since Sept. 2011 Shenyang center received high concentration PCBs waste totaling 1040.5
tons from Zhejiang and 12 provinces in the national replication program. Until Dec. 31, 2012, 769.4 tons
of waste had been safely incinerated. The environmental monitoring done by Dalian Institute of Chemical
and Physics, CAS and Shenyang Environmental Monitoring center station showed that in the two
incineration process, all kinds of emission indicators meet the requirement of “Hazardous waste
incineration pollution control standard (GB18484-2001), meanwhile dioxin emission also meet the
control standard of 0.1TEQng/Nm3 required by PCBs project.


National Replication Program
      At the final stage of PCBs project implementation, under the circumstances that treatment and
disposal technology establishment and rich achievement be made from PCBs contaminated site clean-up
and remediation, in order to publicize and promote project achievement, meanwhile consider project
sustainability, and “The 12th five year plan for POPs pollution control and prevention in major sectors in
China? mentioned should realize the following objectives:
 should safely dispose identified PCBs power equipment and waste, clean-up and disposal of high risk
    PCBs contaminated soil by 2015, based on the results of national POPs environmental statistic survey
    led by Dept. of Pollution Control and Prevention of MEP, during the national replication stage, a
    series of activities including burial site contamination sources detection and analysis, above-ground
    temporarily stored PCBs equipment collection and disposal, cave stored PCBs contaminated soil
    clean-up and disposal had been added, and part of counterpart fund is used to support these activities,
    in order to reach the replication objective of the PCBs project.

      The national replication activities completed 3 PCBs equipment burial sites environmental safety
status sampling analysis and evaluation in Hebei and Jiangsu provinces. 2669 sets of above ground
temporarily stored PCBs power equipment distributed in 29 storage sites in 12 provinces collection and
transportation, 1 stone cave stored contaminated soil clean-up in Tianshui, Gansu province. And high
temperature incineration disposal for the PCBs power equipment and waste collected in 12 provinces. In
Dec. 2012, “China PCBs Management and Disposal Demonstration Project Publicity and Training
workshop? had been held in two demonstration provinces: Zhejiang and Liaoning respectively. In order to
systematically introduce and publicize all achievements made from the PCBs project. There are total 88
participants including WB, project stakeholders and 24 provincial environmental protection agencies
delegates attended these two workshops, which had been approved by WB.




                                                    48
Project Funding Status

     Total budget of the project is 35.097 million US dollars, comprised of 18.34 million USD GEF fund,
14.733 million USD co-finance, and 2.024 million USD bilateral funds.

     93.58% of total project budget has been disburse, specifically, 77.82% were used to set up and
improve PCBs treatment and disposal capability, clean-up PCBs burial sites, and PCBs waste treatment
and disposal; 5.42% were used in institutional capacity building, policy system establishment, and project
monitoring and evaluation; 7.97% were used in the national replication program. Generally, the project
funds were reasonably and effectively spent to complete the designed activities.

Overall evaluation and impact
Evaluation for project design and achievement
(1) The completion status of activities designed by project
      There are 25 items in 6 components plan to be completed in the project, 23 items of activities had
been completed on time, 2 items: contaminated soil TDU treatment and high concentration PCBs waste
incineration had reached 90% and 80% of the expected quantity. It is mainly because during the clean-up
process, some unexpected factors such as some sites PCBs leakage is so serious that it exceeds the
expectation so clean-up work continued until end of 2012. So part of contaminated soil and high
concentration PCBs waste couldn’t be treated and disposed before the project closure. Zhejiang PIU had
applied for counterpart fund to continue to complete remaining contaminated soil treatment and high
concentration PCBs waste disposal. It is expected to complete by end of March.
 (2) Project Sustainability
       There are three aspects regarding project sustainability: first of all, PCBs project established and
strengthened PCBs waste treatment and disposal capacity and technology, TDU is mobile unit, it could be
transferred to suitable sites based on PCBs contaminated soil treatment needs. Shenyang center’s
incineration facility PCBs waste disposal capacity is 4000 tons/year, it could meet disposal demand
completely. Secondly, the “PCBs Containing Equipment and Waste Pollution Control Technical
Specification? compilation project which had been setup in Dept. of Science, technology and standard of
MEP had advanced to comments inquiry stage based on the absorption and adoption of multiple research
results of PCBs project; In addition, the first draft of “PCBs equipment and waste environmental
management technical guidance manual? targeted at guiding PCBs treatment and disposal for local
environmental protection agency manager and PCBs owner had been completed. Thirdly, to carry out
national replication activity to publicize and conduct training for PCBs management and disposal in full
scale, had upgraded environmental protection worker’s consciousness, promoted local environmental
protection agency and PCBs waste owner’s enthusiasm. Therefore, the strengthening of PCBs
management and disposal capacity provided foundation and safeguard for follow-up management and
disposal, all level of environmental protection dept. especially PCBs waste owner’s consciousness
upgrading is the primary power for follow-up management and disposal.
(3) Possible impact made by project outcome
     The smooth completion of PCBs project signified that China’s convention implementation progress
had achieved mile-stone like achievement. There formed one set of effective and feasible measures,
technologies and policy system through exploring and target at management and disposal of PCBs
equipment and waste buried underground which is special characteristic of China. The elimination of new
contamination and hazard of PCBs to China’s eco-environment and human health also provided valuable
experiences and references for POPs phase-out in China in the future which had made great contribution
to China’s environmental protection cause.

Evaluation of Project implementation and management
      There are three aspects in the project implementation evaluation: project funding use efficiency,
project timeliness and project supervision and management level.
(1) Project funding use efficiency
       For the project funding use, based on project objectives, all implementation agencies in China had
made sufficient project activities and scientific and reasonable budget, after review and approved by WB
and project experts, will carry out procurement activities. During the whole process of project
implementation, all implementation agencies in China strictly follow WB procurement and financial
management rules, for competitive bidding the bid winner is selected based on “lowest price win the bid?
principle and negotiated with bid winner regarding unreasonable part. For direct procurement sector
experts are engaged to review all cost component rationality, to ensure project funding is used in
sufficient, effective, and reasonable manner.
(2) Project supervision and management level
      PCBs project had setup effective communication and coordination management mechanism at
national and local level. Through irregular scheduled project coordination site visit, progress report, video
conference etc. to timely feedback and understand project progress status to ensure project management
consistency and efficiency at international, national and local level. Meanwhile timely discover and solve
the difficulties and issues emerged during project implementation, adjust project activities in flexible
manner, active promotion role is played to ensure smooth and successful project completion.
(3) Timeliness of project management and decision making
      For some issues emerged during project implementation, all levels of management agency will
report to higher level to timely feedback, and corresponding judgment and decision making will be made
by main responsible institutions, activities should suit social environment while ensuring project advance
in high efficiency at same time.
      During the third extension of project, DADI company is not the sole company which possess PCBs
burial sites clean-up work capacity, so WB project management team decide the procurement method of
PCBs burial site clean-up sub-contractor will be changed from direct contract to NCB; During the final
phase of project implementation, the reduction in numbers of PCBs burial sites to be cleaned-up will
cause project fund saving. So FECO suggested to add a series of national replication activities with
certain counterpart funding support and had been approved by WB. The above-mentioned not only make
the project implementation and management more strict and reasonable, but also enhanced project
implementation efficiency, expanded project impact scope, which actually played active role on
demonstration and guidance.

Project experiences and lessons

(1) Establish effective project running and coordination mechanism to ensure smooth implementation of
project
      In order to complete the PCBs waste management and burial site clean-up and disposal in Zhejiang
province, multi-level and multi-dept. at national and local level cooperation is needed, including
environmental protection dept. , financial dept. and power sector etc. multi-dept. cooperation and
coordination. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of project, at national level, under the
guidance mechanism of National Stockholm Convention Implementation Coordination Group(NCG),
relevant ministries and commissions like MEP, State Electricity Regulatory Commission(SERC)
provided effective national administrative support for the smooth implementation of the project.
Meanwhile, FECO setup special PCBs project team, mainly responsible for project daily management,
communication and coordination. At provincial level, Zhejiang province setup “Zhejiang PCBs
investigation, disposal and management project leading group? which is consisted of provincial
government general office, provincial dept. of environmental protection, provincial financial bureau,

                                                     50
provincial development and reform commission and provincial power company. It is responsible for
project supervision and management to ensure project implementation in orderly manner at local level.
 (2) Issuance of corresponding policy and regulation, completion of technical guidance document
       In order to meet the need of clean-up work, demonstration province need complete technical support
of relevant policies and regulations. So under the management of FECO, multiple technical outputs for
PCBs management and disposal had been developed by the project. Under the promotion of Zhejiang
EPD and PIU, Zhejiang province issued a series of pollution management and control regulations. The
issuance of these regulations and technical outputs provided policy management basis and technical
support for PCB-contaminated site management and clean-up in demonstration province. Meanwhile fully
utilized project demonstrative role, provided referable or replicable example for PCBs waste management
and disposal in other areas and regions.
(3) Introduction of mature foreign technology to provide technical guarantee for PCBs waste
environmentally sound management and disposal
      The introduction of TDU for PCB-contaminated soil remediation enhanced China’s capacity on
PCB-contaminated soil treatment and disposal. After training, technical and operational workers mastered
the essentials of TDU operation, TDU treatment capacity is fully reflected and expressed. Not only
relevant activities in demo project had been completed, but also related fields scientific research topics
had been raised. This has played a very active role for promoting and facilitating the environmentally
sound disposal capacity enhancement for PCBs and other wastes in China.
(4) National replication program expanded the project impact
      A series of activities such as PCBs burial site sampling and detection, above-ground temporarily
stored PCBs equipment and contaminated soil clean-up and disposal, international and domestic publicity
training workshops at final phase of project, publicized stage-wise achievement from the PCBs project,
and popularized the experience of the PCBs management and disposal to benefit other areas in addition to
demo province. Moreover, it is in line with the five years objective “to eliminate and dispose identified
PCBs equipment and waste? set in “The 12th five-year plan for POPs pollution control and prevention in
major sectors in China?. While the national replication activities had achieved good replication effects, it
is time for PCBs management and disposal to move from demonstration stage to national action after the
project closure.
Lessons
      PCBs project had been extended for three times, project implementation period was extended for
two and half years. Although the factors caused extension couldn’t be simply summarized as single aspect
reason, for the project implementation in the future the following two points management strengthening is
quite necessary:
(1)       Strengthen basic information investigation and public awareness raising, leave room for
unknown factors
      TDU site location had been changed due to the objection of surrounding residents, some burial site
clean-up had been delayed due to compensation negotiation. For the project management in the future,
basic information investigation for project activity and public awareness raising should be enhanced. For
activities arrangement should be more flexible, in order to leave room and time for suitable adjustment in
case of unavoidable and unexpected things happen.
(2) Strengthen technical experts support during carrying out activities
      TDU procurement had to go through second bidding process due to first ICB failed. During clean-
up of some burial site the supplementary clean-up plan had to be prepared and approved by WB again due
to insufficient estimation of actual contamination magnitude. The above-mentioned circumstances could
be reduced in certain way under the sufficient participation and strengthening of technical experts during
the prior preparation process.
