MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
FOR AN EDUCATION AND MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Mozambique for SDR 11.7 million (US$15.9 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity. It will help finance an education and
manpower development project.
2.       Background.  The project has been designed within the context of
Mozambique's Economic Rehabilitation Program, the urgent need to respond to
pressing manpower shortages in the short-term, and the demands for
comprehensive education sector planning in the longer-term. It supports
activities that are feasible under the present economic and internal
security constraints, and will help create a firmer basis for human
resource development.
3.       Although the Government has made significant progress in providing
education since Independence, Mozambique's education and training sector
remains critically underdeveloped. Over 60 percent of the population is
illiterate, only 22 percent have two cv more years of schooling, 6 percent
have four or more years, ana a mere two percent have secondary level
education. The formal education system, though wide at the bottom, with
about 500,000 children in the first grade, remains very narrow at the top,
with only 1,000 students in the tenth grade and about 300 entering
university each year. At the primary level, enrollment expansion has been
achieved at the expense of quality and efficiency. Leatning is hindered by
large class size (60 students per classroom on average), the short number
of classroom hours caused by the imposition of a triple-shift system, and
the use of Portuguese as the language of instruct;.in (only about 1% of
Mozambican children learn Portuguese at home). At the secondary level,
enrollments have increased dramatically since the 1970s but the gross
enrollment ratio remains at only 6%, compared with an average of 20% for
all sub-Saharan African countries. Only modest gains have been achieved in
technical education, and university enrollments have not yet recovered to
pre-Independence levels. As a result there is an acute shortage of
professionals, technicians, and skilled and semi-skilled workers. These
problems are compounded by weak managerial structures at the provincial and
local levels, a cumbersome central administrative system, and serious
financial constraints.
4.       The Government's financial contribution to the sector is
substantial, representing about 11% of total Government recurrent
expenditures. However, serious constraints are encountered in meeting
investment cost requirements, as well as in trying to expand the system
without creating a further burden on the already tight financial situation.



-2-
Donor assistance to the sector represents about 102 of total foreign aid
and is provided mainly by bilateral donors for instructional materials,
construction and equipping of technical schools and adult education
training centers, as well as for food aid to primary schools.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA assistance will be valuable
for three reasons. First, the effective linking of education strategies to
economic recovery is a complex tsok requiring analytic expertise and
institutional capabilities that are not well established in Mozambique.
IDA can provide valuable assistance in developing analytical capabilitifts
and the required institutioxaal foundation, based on an understanding of
macro-economic issues and their sectoral implications. Second, the
experience that IDA has in assisting African countries to develop theic
education systems can help facilitate more rapid progress towards cost-
effective solutions to meet manpower needs. Thl.rd, IDA can facilitate
discussion of a long-term strategy for the sector with other donors and
assist Mozambique in coordinating aid requirements.
6.       Proiect Oblectives.  The project is intended as a first IDA
operation that would selectively respond to immediate needs while assisting
in developing a better krowledge of system requirements and a comprehensive
sector strategy. The project's objectives are threefold. First, it will
raise the quality ind efficiency of primary education in order to increase
literacy and numeracy among primary school-age children. Second, it will
strengthen the training system in order to fill critical manpower gaps.
Third, it will strengthen the capacity for education sector polity analysis
with a focus on financial management and planning.
7.       Project DescriRtion.  First, the project would raise the quality
and efficiency of primary education in the City of Maputo by renovating and
enlarging facilities, training school managers and principals, and
providing children with essential school supplies. Second, it would
strengthen the quality and relevance of training for accountar.ts, office
managers, bookkeepers, customs officials, engineers, and econtmists through
provision of educational materials and equipment, curricula development,
and support of fellowships. Third, the project would improve education
sector plannina and financial management through training of budget
officers, carrying out studies on financing and management of education and
developing a strategy for strengthening the education system in line with
objectives of the ERP.
8.       The project, to be carried out over six years, provides funds for
civil works; furniture, equipment, materials, supplies, and vehicles;
technical assistance; training; and salaries and current costs for the
Project Management Unit. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was approved
by IDA in November 1987 to finalize preparatory activities including:
topographic site surveys, consultant services for educatiotr planning,
curriculum development in the Faculty of Economics at the University
Eduardo Mondlane, organization of the Project Management Unit and training
of its staff.



.3.
9.       The recurrent expenditure implications of the project w4lI be
limited to the cost of maintaining project schools in the City of Maputo.
There will be no increase in the number of classes or teachcrs at the
primary level and no additional personnel will be required at other
project-supported institutions. Total cost of the project is estimated at
US$17.9 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
.Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing s.vents and the status of Bank Group operations in
Mozambique are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7084-MOZ was issued on April 15,
1988.
10.      Aareed actions.  During negotiations, the Government gave the
following asurances. First, it would prepare by March 31, 1992 a strategy
for financing and managing the development of the education system on the
basis of findings of the financing, management, and mother-tongue languages
studies carried out under the project. The strategy would includes (i) a
statement on growth targets for the formal education system; (ii) levels of
recurrent costs needed to increase coverage of primary, secondary and
university education; (iii) a statement of priority investments to be
financed between 1990-2000, and (iv) a plan for strengthening the
managerial structure and efficient administration of education at national
and provincial levels'. Second, the Government would conduct jointly with
IDA, annual project implementation reviews not later than April 30 of each
year.  Third, it would prepare and furnish to IDA for its review and
comment reports on the financing, management, language, and manpower
development studies. Fourth, it would select, not later than December 31,
1988 all consultants needed to assist the Government in project execution
and not later than May 30, 1989 appoint all consultants. Fifth, the
Government would introduce in the national budget for 1990 a school
maintenance line item and allocate to it funds sufficient to carry out
annual maintenance of project schools. Sixth, in accordance with the
resettlement plan, the Government would take all necessary measures to
ensure that the sites required for the primary school construction program
are free of all occupants.
11.      Benefits.  The project will strengthen Mozambique's educational
system to make it more responsive to the country's urgent needs for skilled
manpower and effective human resource development. Higher quality primary
education will help pupils and the nation develop a stronger foundation for
sustainable long-term growth. Upgraded training in commercial fields,
engineering, and economics will help alleviate skilled manpower shortages
and enhance quality in key areas essential for economic planning,
industrial development, and construction activities and will help
compensate for the loss of expatriate university-level professionals.
Development of a long-term sector strategy, and improvement of MINED's
financial management snd planning capability will permit more efficient use
of education sector resources. Finally, the project will also build
project management skills within the Ministry of Education.



-4-
12.      Risks.  Risks are twofold.  First, Mozambique's experience in
managing education projects is still quite limited, there are few trRineo
managers, and there is littlo exnerience in project management and in
procedures such as international bidding, project monitoring, beeping
accounts or performing audits. This risk is being addressed through the
creation of a Project Management Unit within MIXED, which will be supported
through intensive staff training and the provision of technical assistance.
Second, the ongoing security situation presents special difficulties. This
risk has been taken into account by targeting project activities
predominantly in Maputo, which is a secure area. In light of these design
features, the risks would be minimized and the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for initial investment in educational sector
improvement in Mozambique.
13.      I am satisfied that the propc%ed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Associaticn and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
