INTERNATIONAL DEVELPMTT ASSOtCION
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVEDPMET CDIET TO THE
ARAB REPJBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR THE BANK OF ALEIANDRIA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
IDA credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of US$15
million to finance part of the foreign exchange requiranents of the Bank
of Alexandria (BOA)'s new development finance operations through 1974h.
PART I - THE ECONTONY
Economic Perfo mance
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Arab Republic of Egypt" (R73-16) dated December 30,
1972 was distributed to the Ebcecutive Directors on January 23, 1973. A
Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I to this document.
3.        With the impetus of the First Five-Year Plan (1961-65), Egypt's
economic growth accelerated in the early 1960's to an average annual rate
of about 6 percent -- nearly reaching the ambitious Plan target of 7
percent and considerably faster than the pace of growth in the 1950's.
However, the increased investment rate of the early 1960's was accompanied
by growing defense expenditure which led to serious inflationary and balance
of payments pressures by the mid-1960ls. In 1966/67 the government imposed
severe import restrictions and deflationary policies resulting in negligible
growth in that financial year. The war of June 1967 compounded an already
difficult situation, and there was a substantial fall in GDP in 1967/68.
4.        In the succeeding two years the economy recovered rapidly but the
growth rate fell to 4 percent in 1970/71 and was probably about the same in
1971/72. Defense has taken a progressively greater share of rgyptls resources
(reaching 15 percent of GNP in 1970/71), largely at the expense of investment
expenditure, Which has fallen to about 12 percent of ClNP in recent years.
The share of private consumption in GNP has remained at about 68 percent --
implying a growth rate in per capita private consumption of about 1-1/2
percent annually.



-2-
5.        The heavy claims of defense have not only squeezed investament
and developnent resources, but have also given rise to inflationary
yressures. Although transfer receipts from Arab countries under the
Khartoum Agreement (amounting to about BEEaO million annually) have
mpore than offset the loss of Suez Canal reveniies, a severe scarcity of
foreign exchange continues to limit both the utilization of existing
productive capacity and the implementation of new development programs.
Rnployment has grown only slowly (by about 2 percent annually in recent
years), so that unemployment and underemployment have increased. Average
wages have risen faster than productivity, adding cost-push inflationary
forces to existing demand-pall forces, exacerbated by a high-level of
Central Bank deficit financing. Price controls and a rapid rise in imports
have absorbed sorie of the inflationary pressure. However, a consequence
of greater import >romth has been a deterioration in the balance of
payments. Net foreign exchange reserves, which have fallen steadily
in recent years, fell by roughly $200 million in 1971 and rose by an
estimated $50 million in 1972. By late 1972, short-term foreign liabi-
litie3 exceeded foreign assets by the equivalent of about six months
imports.
Debt Service Burden
6.        Egypt's outstanding medium and long-term external debt at the end
of December 1972 was reported at $1.2 billion disbursed, or $1.6 billion
including undisbursed credits -- equivalent to about one-fourth of GNP.
The USSR is Egypt s principal creditor, followed in importance by the
UMnited States, Kuwait, Germany and Italy.  IBRD debt comprised less than
one percent and IDA debt comprised about 4 percent of the total reported debt
(including undisbursed) at the end of 1972. The debt service ratio in 1970/71
was about 32 percent, according to balance of payments data.  In recent years
declining gross capital inflows and rising debt service payments have
resulted in net resource transfers from Egypt. The near-term debt-servicing
burden will remain difficult as 36 percent of the reported debt outstanding
at the end of 1971 was due to be amortized within two years, 51 percent
within t'hree years, and 74 percent within 5 years. The implication of
Egypt's debt profile is that rising gross capital inflows or substantial
reschedulings will be needed to sustain even a zero net resource transfer,
at least during the next few years.
Development Prospects and Constraints
7.        In comparison -with. many less-developed countries, Egypt is
relatively favored in terms of its geographical, natural and human resources;
the size of its domestic market; the extent of existing infrastructural
development3 the level of education and skill of its labor force; and its
associations with Arab nations and some developed countries.  These factors



3-
suggest that the long-term growth potential could be promising. On the
other hand there are a number of fornidable constraints to development in
the short and medium term. The most severe are the defense burden, the
scarcity of convertible foreign exchange (particularly funds not tied to new
investment projects), the debt burden (notwithstanding recent reschedulings)
and a highly centralized administration which regalates nearly all pro-
duction, distribution, employment and financial decisions, leaving little
room for the market mechanism or for individcal incentive ,_
8.        Egypt has a serious demographic problem.  The population is
already one of the most densely settled in the world and is growing
rapidly. A high rate of natural increase is combined with a high rate of
internal migration to urban areas, resulting in growing urban congestion --
especially in Cairo. In the longer run continuing rapid popalation growth
heightens problems of unemployment and underemployment and causes greater
pressure on the land. A promising beginning has been made with a national
family planning program. But more needs to be done both in family planning
and in regional and urban planning.
9.        In the absence of significant new political developments in the
Middle East, Egypt's ability to effect major changes in resource allocation
is likely to remain limited. However some encouraging developments have
taken place in the Ceon0y in the last two years. These include a rapid
growth in government revenues, fuller utilization of industrial capacity,
a resurgence of tourism in 1971 aid 1972, the conclusion of new trade,
aid and debt rescheduling agreements with Western countries and promising
indications for petroleum development. In an effort to attract private
western and Arab capital, an International Bank for Trade and Development
was established, a new investment code adopted and liberal tax exemptions
and incentives made available to industries establishing in "free zones".
Egypt also became a member of the International Ceater for Settlement
of Investment Disputes. The government has taken steps to confer more
operational autonomy on public sector industrial enterprises, increase
wage incentives, stimulate the small private sector, and study price
reforms. Thus far, however, the net affect of these steps on the economy
has been small.
10.       In the summer of 1972, agreement was reached between the Heads
of State of Egypt and Libya calling for the unification of the two states
by September 1973. A number of joint committees are currently studying
the problems of unification and their implications for Egypt's future
economic development.



Development Priorities
11.       In the aftermath of the 1967 war, Egypt temporarily suspended
medium-tern planning.  A new Five-Year Plan (1973-77) currently under
discussion aims at GNP growth of about 6-1/2 percent a year and a total
investment of BE3 billion. The highest priority is given to investment
in industry, followed by transport, communicatiLons, and agriculture.
In contrast to the investmenit priorities of the first Plan, which
emphasized the High Dam and other agricultural projects, the new Plan
emphasizes iron and steel production and petroleum development. Achieve-
.1ent of the Plan's investmert targets will require both a major effort
in domestic resource mobilization and a reallocation of resources which
will be difficult to reconcile with the priority that the government
accords to defense.
PAR' II - BANK GRDUP OPERATICNS IN EGYPT
12.       The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's sixth operation
in Egypt and would bring Bank and IDA commitments to $163.7 million. The first
Bank loan was for the Suez Canal Expansion Project ($56.5 million) in 1959;
a $26 million credit for the Nile Delta Project was approved in 1970 and
one for $30 million in 1972 for the Egyptian Railway Rehabilitation Project.
An erngineering credit of $175,000 was approved in November 1972 and $36
million credit for the Upper Egypt Irrigation Project on June 7, 1973.
Annex II contains a summnary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of
April 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.   There
have been no IFC investments in Egypt so far and none are under consideration.
13.       The main purpose behind the IDA lending program, which began in
1969, is to alleviate  the shortage of foreign exchange for high priority
projects in agriculture, indcustry and infrastructure. With limited IDA
funds available, the program is modest in relation to Egypt's size and
absorptive capacity. The proposed credit is the Balk Group's first project
in the industrial sector and will be followed shortly by another provid.-
ing assistance to   phase oneB of a rehabilitation program for the cotton
ginning industry. A population project is expected to be ready for Board
consideration early in FY74. Two missions visited Egypt in April 1973,
to help prepare projects in teleconmunications and fertilizers, both for
possible lending in FY74.   Wo agricultural projects -- a soil amelioration
project and a rural development project -- are under consideration. A
second phase of the railway rehabilitation program is also being prepared.



-5-
PAR? III - INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
14.       Egypt has a long-established industrial sector. Between the
1930's and 1950's, indastrial activity was concentrated in agro-based
industries, essentially textiles, leather and food, although new
investments were being made in cement, oil refining, fertilizer and
engineering and electrical goods industries. In the late 1950's, the
government decided to assume a major role in this sector and considerable
weight was put on the establishment of heavy and resource-based industries
such as steel, building materials and chemicals. Major industrial units
were nationalized in the early sixties, and a predominantly private
enterprise system gave way to a centrally-controlled one with large government-
owned industrial enterprises.
15.       Since then, the industrial sector has become the leading growth
sector in Egypt. Public sector investment in industry, essentially in heavy
resource-based enterprises,    averaged nearly 13El0 million a year up to
1965/66; following a drop after the June 1967 war, industrial investment
again rose to that level in 1968/69 and thereafter increased to about
mE125 million annually. Most of this public sector investment was under-
taken with USSR and East European assistance. At the same time, financing
required for the import of capital goods for the private sector continued
to be constrained. Overall, the value added by industry in the last decade
averaged about 6 percent per annum and more recently  has risen to about
10 percent a year. Industry's contribution to GDP was nearly 23 percent
in 1971. Cotton, textiles, and other agro-industries accounted for about
40 percent of this_output, engineering and electrical goods for about 30
percent and heavy and resource-based industries for the balance.
16.       Although there is no clear-cut sectoral distribution between
public and private sector industries, all basic indUstries such as steel
and fertilizer are state-owned. The private sector remains strong in
textiles, food and leather, in which there are a number of firms employing
200 to 300 workers. The public sector accounts for about 75 percent of the
value of industrial output, with the private sector contributing the balance.
The private sector also accounts for about 25 percent of the output in
textiles, food, chemical and engineering industries.
17.       Manufactured exports rose in 1971 to aZl10 million, or 40
percent of total exports, of which the private sector accounted for
about 16 percent, principally in textiles and leather. There has been
little change in the composition of Egyptian exports over the past few
years.



- 6 -
18.       There are good prospects for the continued growth of the
industriaal sector. Egypt has a large domestic market, considerable human
and natural resources, a favorable geographical situation, a reasonably
well-developed infrastructural base and relatively skilled labor force;
it also has demonstrable comparative advantage in the production and
export of textiles, leather, food and engineering goods. On the other
hand severe foreign exchange shortages, particularly of convertible curren-
cies, have resulted in shortages of spare parts and raw materials. This,
besides the premature establishment of large units unable to export, still
results in some under-utilization of capacity especially in metal and
chemical industries. Foreig.n excharLge scarcity has also led to a
considerable backlog of modernization and rehabilitation needs, particalarly
in the private sector.
19.       Although the emphasis on the public sector will continue, in
recent policy statements the government has made clear its intention of
encouraging private entrepreneurs to be more   active  in Egypt's industrial
development. Steps like the creation of "free zones" and the International
Bank of Trade and Development are designed to attract foreign private
capital. Comparable measures to encourage local entrepreneurs have not yet
materialized. However to buttress the confidence of both foreign and loeal
entrepreneurs, in 1971  the government indicated its intention not to
underbake further nationalization. For some time the government has been
anxious to provide term financing for the further development of the private
sector through the proposed project.
20,       Industrial investUment is largely controlled by the General
Organization for Industriali zation (GOIndr), chaired by the Minister of
Industry, one of fifty or sCo general organizations which, under the wings
of various ministries, ran public sector enterprises. GOIndr approves all
public sector investment proposals and those for the private sector
exceeding bg,OOO. For the latter, GOIndr's role is limited basically
to checking the consistency of a proposed investment with the government's
allocations of imported or scarce domestic industrial materials and foreign
exchange.
21.       Most industrial irivestment in the public sector is self-financed
from depreciation allowances, reserves -- normally 20 percent of net
income is retained for this purpose by each entity -- and budget appropriations.
Tne private sector has so fEir relied largely on self-generated funds,
renewable bank overdrafts and limited term lending facilities from the now
defunct Industrial Bank of Egypt (IBE). Following the reorganization of the
banking industry in 1971, when BOA absorbed IBE, the private sector is
obliged to seek industrial t.erm financing only from BOA.



-7-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed credit of $15 million would assist BOA in meeting
a part of the foreign exchange requirements of its development finance
operations for both private and public sector ind:ustrial enterprises
throagh 1974. The details are summarized in the "Project and Credit
Summary" in Annex III and covered fully in an appraisal report entitled
"Appraisal of a DFC Project - 3ank of Alexandria" (Report No. 148a-UAR
dated May 30, 1973) circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
23.       In late 1970 the government sought Bank Group assistance with
the development financing activities of IBE. A reconnaissance mission
supported the proposal but suggested that institutional changes were
required to enable IBE to undertake these activities satisfactorily.
Subsequent to the reorganization of the domestic banking system in
September 1971, when IBE's responsibility for term-financing for pro-
ductive enterprises was taken over by BOA, the government renewed its
request for DA support.   The Association assisted in preparing   the
project which was appraised in November 1972. Negotiations took place
in Washington on May 21 and 22. The Egyptian delegation was headed by
Mr. Ahmed Abdel Ghaffar, Chairman of BOA.
24.       GOIndr has licensed private sector investment of between LDO
and 20 million over the past two years. While it is difficult to quantify
the pent-up demand for term financing in Egypt it may be assumed that private
sector investment will at least approach this level through 1974. Since
BOA is the only term lending financial institution in Egypt, it would be
expected to finance between 30 and 40% of these investments if given the
necessary resources. The balance would be mainly self-financed by the
enterprises concerned. For the public sector, preparatory work done by
GOIndr indicates that over the next two years BOA is likely to be presented
with projects with term financing requirements of at least LE4 million of
foreign exchange and the same amount in local currency.
25.       BOA has ample local currency resources for its term lending
operations. For foreign exchange both the government and BOA look to IDA
since BOA has no such resources at this time. For the eighteen months
through 1974, BOA's projected foreign exchange requirements for term
lending amount to approximately $21 million. Allowing for some delay in
BOA's term lending operations getting underway, it is recommended that IDA
should finance approximately two-thirds or $15 million of the projected
requirements.



- 8 -
26.       BOA's total tenmp lending operation is likely to constitute
less than D percent of total industrial investment over the next two
to three years.  Nonetheless, the credit would be an important factor
i-n the goverrmuent's plans to give the private sector an irmediate
boost and would help establish a better climate in the longer term
for private sector investment.   It should also assist the private
sector in maintaining and probably increasing its 16 percent share
of manufactured exports.
On-Iefidir,g
27.       The proposed credit would be ma.de available to the government
on standard IDA terms. The credit would be onlent by the government to
BOCA,with repayment over 17 years  including 3 years of grace,at Lk, percent
plus a Ministry of Finance, Economy and Foreign Trade charge of 2½ percent,
making an effective cost to BOA of 7 percent per annum.   BOA would relend
the proceeds of the credit at 7 percent plus the 2½ percent Ministry
charge, giving an effective cost to sub-borrowers of 9; percent, with
repayment    up to 15 years. This would give BOA a reasonable spread
of 2½2 percent.  Interest rates presently play a less important role in
governing resource allocation in Egypt than in other countri.es.  But the
7 percent rate and BOA's relending at 9z percent are evidence that the
governmiert wants interest rates to reflect more realistically the cost
of resources. The government would assume the foreign exchange risk.
28.       The proceeds of the credit would be made available to finance
replacement and new capacity.   BOA would carry out a full appraisal of
development projects from the private sector. lPublic sector projects
would be submitted through GOIndr, who would have carried out their own
appraisal, upon which BOA would rely substantially although BOA would
have the right to reject any project recommended by GOIndr. BOA has
given undertakings that at least half of the credit would be made avail-
able  to the private sector and would be spread over    a relativrely large
n-umber of medium and small projects covering a number of industries. BOA
would be granted a free limit on individual sub-loans Wnich do not exceed
$100,000 for each project or $4 million in the aggregate. BOA has stated
that its Board would be required to approve all term-loans which raised
BOA's exposure in any enterprise by this method of financing above $100,000.
29.       With respect to procurement the practice in Egypt is that licenses
to import,through the state-owned foreign trade corporations, are granted
only after competitive bids have been secured by the appropriate statutory
committees according to the type of commodity involved.   For imports
financed under the proposed project, the same procedure would be adopted.
The government has undertaken to ensure that, for projects being financed
by BOA, import licenses would be granted promptly.



-9-
Bank of Alexandria
30.       BOA was forned in 1957 to take over the Egyptian assets of
Barclay's Bank which were sequestrated by the government. Four years
later all banks in Egypt were nationalized. BOA subsequently absorbed
two commercial banks in the early sixties and in 1971 took over IBE.
BOA is now the largest commercial bank in Egypt; its share capital is
fully owned by the Central Bank of Egypt (COE).
31.       Under the new banking system BOA operates as the only "mixed"
bank in the country providing, in addition to commercial credit, term
financing for produrctive enterprises primarily in the private sector
and, to a limited extent, in the public sector. An important aim of
the merger with IBE, whose financial position had deteriorated, was
to create an institution of greater organizational and financial strength
to engage in development f'inancing principally in the private nadtstrial
sector. BOA was chosen for this task because of its general competence,
its experience in industrial financing and its extensive branch network.
Account was also taken of the good reputation BOA currently enjoys with
public sector entities and the private sector.
32.       GOIndr's control over public sector industrial investment and
the budgetary financing of most public industrial enterprises will mean
that BOA will have a limited role in financing public sect-or investments
in industry. Public firms, or the General Organization supervising them,
may approach BOA for term financing only if the government is unable to
provide the investment funds. BOA's role is therefore complementing that
of the GOIndr in the public sector. BOA can reject a public sector request
by its own investment criteria but cannot prevent the planned investment
being undertaken with other resources. In the private sector BOA appears
well placed to take advantage of the more favorable climate for private
investment which the govenument is tryinYg to create. The fact that the
proceeds of the proposed IDA credit would be usable in all the Bank's member-
countries and Switzerland would facilitate this task.
33.       Following the take-over of IBE, BOA's share capital was increased
to ME3.0 million. At the end of 1972, BOA's net worth stood at LB7.421
million, including free reserves of LE4.421 million, But these figures
understate BOA's real net worth dae to the conservative use of provisions
for bad and doub*l debts and other contingencies. Short-term public
and p-rivate deposits make up the bulk of BOA's resources. Largely due to
the 1971 baniking reorganization, BOA's deposits rose by 40% in 1972. BOA
has rediscount facilities totalling 16 million with CBE but in recent
years has not needed to make use of them. BOA's foreign currency balances
are insignificant now that the National Bank of Egypt is responsible for the
financing of foreign trade. The proposed IDA credit would be BOA's first
long-term borrowing operation in foreign exchange.



- 10 -
Managemend        anization
34.       AL1l nine members of BOA's Board of Directors are full-time
officers of the Bank. Fivve of them, including the Chairman, are appointed
by presidential decree for indefinite periods. The Board meets monthly
and decides a11 important issues including major credit applications.
Rporting to the Chaiman, there are five general managers on the
commercial bankinrig side. At the end of 1972, BOA employed over 3,500
staff of -whom about 60 percent are professionals includidng a small number
tni th term lending experience with  IBE. Most senior staff have long
records o' se-mrice,many dat:ing back over fifteen years.
35.       The tesmu lending operat'ion will come under a sixth general
manager. Following a review of IBE's organization and procedures in
1972, BOA set upi a development banking departmnent entitled (somewhat
misleadingl.y) "Special Services to Private Industrial Sector" (SSPIS).
The struuture of SSPIS lays emphasis on the involvement of BOA's branch
network in the p.rocessing o:E loan applications. Branch managers, espec-ially
in the major cit.ies, will have limited discretionary powers of approval
for medcUami-tein loans to the private sector.  SSPIS' activities are
presently limited to the handling of term loans previously granted by
IBE. Canvassina for new business is expected to gather steams once SSPIS'
new structuxre has been implemented and the proposed IDA credit has been
approved. There will be separate internal accounting for BOA's commercial
as opposed to development financing activities.
36.       Policy- and proce(t.re guidelines for SSPIS, being formulated by
BOA after consultation with I.DA, are in line with policies normally
followed by devel.opment finance companies associated with the Bank Group.
SSPIS recognizes that it will have to develop expertise in evaluating the
economic benefits of i1vestment projects and will initially concentrate
its efforts in tnis respect on the private sector.  Diring its formative
period SSPIS will paEy particaular attention to developing a successful
working r,elationship wi.th the GOIndr; strengthening its technical staff
capability for appraisal work; and assisting clients to improve their
accounting system.
37.       The general manager of SSPIS is an able and experienced BOA
staff member, formerly of the rank of Assistant General Manager.  Middle
management and professional posts in the new unit will be filled by
existing BOt; staff includinrg some former IBE personnel.  BOA has expressed
considerable interest in ge-tting Bank Group assistance with training BOA
stuaff and arr;angements were made for fouir officers-designate of the new
unit to undergo training with ICICI in India and TSKB in Turkey.



BOA's Perfornance
38.       In its commercial activities BOA's past earnings performance
has been good although no clear trend can be identified over the last
four years. BOA operates within a comfortable 5% spread despite its
relatively high exposure in low-yielding liquid assets. Following the
1971 banking reorganization BOA's operational portfolio increased
sharply resulting in the liquidity ratio falling to 45.5% as of December
31, 1972. In 1972, the return on net worth (including excess provisions)
was almost 22%. Write-offs have been negligible. The quality of the
term-loan portfolio inherited from IBE is sound. Since it came into
existence SSPIS has processed a number of small projects but no assessment
of its performance thus far can be made.
39.       As of December 31, 1972 BOA had an operational portfolio of
BE 161 million constituting 61% of total assets. BOA has experienced
no difficulties with the sectors -- mainly textiles, electronics and
food processing -- represented in its portfolio. BOA's creditworthiness
should be assured given its record of conservative financial management
and the control exercised by the Central Bank. BOA estimates that its
short-term credit portfolio wi-l1 grow on average by 4-51 per annum
through 1977 -- a seemingly modest projection.
40.       Since BOA will remain principally a commercial bank in the
foreseeable future, the maintenance of its overall financial soundness
will remain the responsibility of CBE. CBE does not propose, at this
juncture, to lay down any special rules to take account of BOA's term
financing operationse However it has been agreed between BOA and
the Association tnat,should long-term project financing become a
significant part of BOA's business, the implications of this development
2)r BOA's financial position as a pablic deposit bank would be jointly
discussed. In the meantime BOA has confirmed that it will use its
short-term resources to fimnance its term-lending operations only to the
extent compatible with the maintenance of BOA's sound financial and liquid
position. In time and in consultation with the Association, BOA intends to
set appropriate limits on the use of its short-term resources for term lending.
41.       The absence of standard financial protection covenants is
unusual in a DFC-style project. However, as long as BOA's main activity
is in the commercial banking field, with the bulk of its funds derived
from short-ternm deposits and term lending accounting for only a small
part of its business, such provisiorn as the standard debt/equity
limitation would be inappropriate. CBE will continue to monitor BOA's
liquidity. As a safeguard in the event that BOA's medium and long-term
portfolio reached a level six times BOA's net worth as stated in the
balance sheet, there would be consultation between BOA and the Association
on ways of expanding BOA's equity base.

prevailing during the period covered.
2/ GNP and savings are defined here inclusive of net transfer receipts, most of which consist in payments
from Arab countries to compensate Egypt for the loss of Suez Canal dues.
3/  Accurate constant price growth rates are not available owing to insufficient information concerning trade
deflators. Moreover, the export growth rate for this period is biased by the drop in Suez revenues after
1966/67. Between 1967/68 - 1970/71, exports ( in current prices) rose on the average by 12.5 percent
annually, imports by 10.6 percent annually.

Tr rNo. 181         Nile Delta Drainage Project; US$26 million Credit
2ofi-1     , 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Nile Delta Drainage Authority (NDDA) was established in 1970
under the Ministry of Irrigation for project execution.   Many of its senior
vacancies were left unfilled.   Appointment of consultants was a condition of
credit effectiveness and protracted negotiations with the consultants se-
lec-ued (bVBB of Sweden) delayed this for 12 months.  Since then ineffective
manaoement, inadequate utilization of existing equipment and an unwillingness
-t.o use the consultants have beetn major problems. TBA expressed to the
government its disappointment with thls project's slow progress. A revised
:i,mlementation program was prepared, extending the project until 1978 and,
following discussions in December 1972, the goverrment agreed to take a
number of actions recommended by 3A to improve performance and provide an
effective management. In February 1973, NDDA and the Egyptian General Authority
for Drainage (EGAD) were merged in the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage
Projects (EPADP) established by- Presidential Decree.  A new Chairman and Vice
Chairmen for the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt drainage projects were appointed
and the staff  reorganized and strengthened by the appointment of additional
qualified personnel. A panel of experts was nominated to undertake project
evaluation and ac-tion is being taken to replace the consultants for the Nile
Delta project whose contract expired in March 1973, by new consultants who
would advise and assist the authority on the implementation of both the
Nile Delta and Upper Egypt projects.   The new Authority is actively working
on the arrangements for the maintenance of equipment and the storage of spare
parts and has drafted the terms and conditions under which project equipment
will be transferred to local contractors for construction of drainage works
and for the manufacture of drainage tiles.
Cr No. 28)4          Egyptian Railway Project; US$30 million Credit of
February S. 1972; Closing Date: (i) December 31, 1973
for track materials, locomotives and spare parts; and
(ii) September 30, 1976 for signalling and telecommu-
nications equipment and installation.
The project has started satisfactorily. Most of the procurement
contracts have been awarded. Some complaints have been received about eva-
luation procedures. It appears that delays have occurred in passing out
information to potential bidders. IDA has discussed this problem with
EgJyptian Railways and steps are being taken to improve procurement procedures
and increase the number of staff in the procurement office.
*-T'hese notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
Wrhich are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
.hey should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
pOroject execuation.
