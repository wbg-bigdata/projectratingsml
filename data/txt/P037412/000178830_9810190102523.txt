PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ISRAEL: INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1116-IS)
PREFACE
This report deals with the performance under Loan 1116-IS, an
industrial developmenit loan comprising three complementary components:   (a) a
(fourth) loan to the Industrial Development Bank of Israel; (b) an industrial
research and development component; (c) a vocational training component.    The
Bank loan signed May 30, 1975, was in the amount of US$35 million to the
Government for 15 years; the closing date for the loan was January 30, 1981.
The Government on-lent US$25 million to the Industrial Development Bank, while
the research and development, and the vocational training components were each
funded with US$5 million.   As Israel's per capita income now exceeds the
eligibility limits for Bank lending, no further loan in any of the sectors is
contemplated.
The Project Completion Report was based on the findings of a Bank
mission in February 1982. The institutions receiving the benefits of the Bank
loan:  the Industrial Development Bank of Israel, the Office of the Chief
Scientist, and the Manpower Training and Development Bureau of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs, fully cooperated with this Bank mission and have
provided the data on which this report is based.
Comments received from the Borrower and its agencies are shown in
Attachments A, B and C and have been incorporated in this Project Completion
Report.
The project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ISRAEL: INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1116-IS)
HIGHLIGHTS
The three components of the loan: a conventional dfc-type loan to
IDBI, financial and technical support to promote research and development, and
vocational training, all achieved or exceeded their objectives. Of particular
interest are the R&D and vocational training components, which had many
innovative features with an adaption potential to other countries.
The conclusions regarding the IDBI Component are given in para. 3.25;
noteworthy is the offer by IDBI to provide training and technical assistance
to other dfc's. The conclusions resulting from the highly innovative R&D
support project component are given in paras. 4.15-4.17, while Annexes
8-12 detail the technical assistance provided and sub-projects sponsored. The
summary and conclusions reflecting on the very efficiently executed vocational
training component are given in paras. 5.11-5.12. Of particular interest
are the high utilization of the equipment and facilities provided under
the project, and the low cost of training workers to high standards.






PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ISRAEL: INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN 1116-IS
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Industrial Development Project comprised three complementary
components:(a) a (fourth) loan to the Industrial Development Bank of Israel
(IDBI); (b) an industrial research and development (R&D) component; (c) a
vocational technical training component. The Bank loan was in the amount of
US$35 million to the Government for 15 years. The Government on-lent US$25
million to IBDI, while the R&D and training components were each funded with
US$5 million. The loan has been described in the President's Report P-1626-IS
and in Staff Appraisal Report 656a-15, both dated May 7, 1975.
1.02     The three project components were supervised separately:   The IDBI
component by staff of the Industrial Development and Finance Division (IDF),
the R&D component by IDF staff in conjunction with a consultant and assistance
from the Office of the Science and Technology Adviser in -he Bank, and the
training component by the Education and Manpower Development Division with
consultant assistance.   The PCR reflects this, and each component is reviewed
separately.  The PCR Project File contains detailed IBDI financial data, and
the original reports of consultants who assisted in the preparation of the PCR.
1.03     All three components are considered successful, although there was
some delay in their implementation. However, as Bank lending to Israel has
been phased out, the PCR puts more emphasis on the innovative project
components, namely the R&D component and the vocational training component, as
these components have a cross-country adoption potential. By contrast, the
IDBI component was a fourth loan to a classic development finance institution
without major innovative aspects.
1.04     The inflation in Israel reached annual levels of over 100%, and the
currency devaluated against the dollar by a factor of 24 over the disbursement
period of the loan. Such conditions would make any strictly financial
conclusions suspect. The financial analysis of the components is thus limited
and emphasis is placed on concepts.
1.05     The institutions receiving the benefits of the Bank loan:   IDBI, the
Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) for the R&D component, and the Manpower
Training and Development Bureau (MTDB) of the Ministry of Labor and Social
Affairs (MOLSA) for the vocational training component, fully cooperated with
the PCR mission and have provided the data on which this PCR as well as the
attached consultants reports are based.

II. THE ENVIRONMENT
2.01     Following several years of rapid economic growth, economic
developments became distinctly less favorable in Israel in the period
1973-1975. There was a serious deterioration in the balance of payments in
these years, with current deficits growing to $4 billion, and GDP growth
slowing to about 3% per year.  Ihe Government's policy measures to counteract
this trend produced some positive results in 1975 and[1976, such as a
moderation of private consumption, a curtailing of imports, and a slowdown in
inflation. By 1976 there was also some improvement in the balance of payments
situation, although the economy remained static and inflation had begun to
accelerate. With a more resolute implementation of a policy of devaluation
and higher taxation, prices were further pushed up, causing labor to demand
additional pay increases.  The resulting growth of wages and profits sent
prices spiralling again, causing another round of wage demands. By 1977-78
inflation had accelerated to 51%, from an average annual rate of 35% over the
previous three years.
2.02     There was some increase in economic activity from 1977 to 1979 when
the average annual growth of GDP was 4.4%, but the growth rate has subsquently
declined to less than 1% in 1980. This slowdown reflected three factors: the
increase in imported fuel prices, which gravely impaired the balance of
payments; a striking decline in labor productivity, which grew at less than 1%
per year compared to around 5% per year in the early 1970s; and an appreciable
increase in the real cost of labor, thereby greatly impeding the
implementation of policies aimed at reducing inflation and strengthening the
balance of payments. The slowdown in economic activity continued in 1980,
together with continued high levels of inflation (around 130%). In 1981,
there was'some expansion in economic activity, stemming mostly from growing
domestic demand, especially private consumption and government expenditures.
Exports continued to grow, and with a slowing down of import growth, the trade
deficit stabilized in real terms at the end-1980 level.   There has also been
some deceleration in the rate of inflation, due to a government policy of
refraining from adjusting controlled prices to match increased costs, and by
reducing indirect taxes.
III. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ISRAEL (IDBI) COMPONENT
(US$25 million)
1. Objectives
3.01     In line with previous loans to IDBI, the purpose of the loan
component was to support industrial, high technology projects in the
less-developed region of the country, as well as export oriented projects
regardless of their location. All projects were to be situated within the
January 1, 1967, boundaries, and were not to be defense oriented. As the Bank
funding provided only a small part of the foreign exchange requirements, the
loan was also intended to stimulate IDBI to mobilize other foreign exchange
resources.

2. IDBI - The Institution
3.02     IDBI was established in 1957 to assist in the development of the
private industry in Israel. The Bank has made four loans to IDBI
totalling $85 million. The loan under review, 1116-IS, is the fourth loan for
an amount of $25 million.
3.03     The most recent Bank reports on IDBI are the fourth loan Appraisal
Report 656a - IS dated May 7, 1975, and the Supervision Summary dated
January 30, 1980. PPARs have previously been issued for the third loan to
IDBI (Loan 689 - IS) on February 17, 1977, and for the second loan to IDBI
(Loan 519 - IS) on July 1, 1974.
3.04     IDBI is a well-managed and financially sound institution and
continues to play a significant development role, being the most important
financial institution for implementing the Government's industrial policies.
With a highly capable managing director, experienced senior staff, and
carefully selected more junior staff, the efficiency and quality of IDBI's
work is secured. Appraisal reports, documentation provided (including for the
PCR) and contacts with the staff and management all attest to this.
3.05     During the period under review, 1975-1981, IDBI has experienced a
substantial growth in the volume of operations as well as in the scope of
services provided. Projects and loans processed increased from 374 in 1974
to 839 in 1981; preparation of follow-up and special study reports increased
from 108 to 128 during the same period.  In addition, IDBI extended its range
of services to include foreign loan transactions, loans for transportation and
agriculture, and foreign exchange dealings.
3.06     The substantially increased work load has been handled without an
increase in the total staff.  IDBI staff at the end of 1981 was 158, compared
with 159 at the end of 1975. This has been possible through computerization
of all accounting functions, loan disbursement and collections, follow-up work
as well as part of the appraisal process. The introduction of standard
procedures and terms of reference for actions and responsibilities instituted
by the Managing Director have also contributed to the continued eficient
operation of IDBI. Administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of
average total assets rose from 0.5% in 1975 to 0.8% in 1981, reflecting the
increased salary costs, higher automation, and a larger percentage
professional staff in the latter year; the 1981 expense percentage figure is
still among the lowest in EMENA development finance companies.
3. Operational and Financial Results
Lending Operations
3.07     Forecast approvals, commitments and disbursements for 1974-79 made
during the appraisal of the fourth loan are compared with the actual results
over the same period in Annex 1. Actual approvals and commitments during
1974-79 exceeded the forecasts for the same period by 37% and 16%
respectively, while disbursements were in line with forecasts. To ensure a
more meaningful degree of comparability, actuals were deflated by an
appropriate index. Thus, real term approvals during 1974-79 were below



- 4 -
forecasts by 26%, while real term disbursements were 45% below the projected
amounts. This shortfall is for the greatest part explained by the stagnation
in the Israeli economy compared to the economic forecasts underlying the 1974
appraisal projections.  If, as a further refinement, a correction is applied
to take into account the lower fixed capital formation in industry as compared
with the forecasts, a more realistic picture will be obtained on how IDBI
performed under the difficult prevailing conditions. On this basis, IDBI's
approvals over the period 1974-7 9 exceeded adjusted projections by 9% while
disbursement fell short by 16% of adjusted projections. The calculations are
shown on page 2 of Annex 1.
Loan Portfolio
3.08     At the end of 1981 outstanding loans to industry amounted to IS 5,137
million ($329.3 million), which represent an increase of 8% over the
corresponding dollar equivalent at the end of 1980, but still falls about 7%
short of the dollar loan figure at the end of 1974. However, the distortions
introduced by the changing dollar rates do not make these figures
significantly different.  The end 1981 loan figures are very substantially
below the overly optimistic appraisal projections of about $900 million
equivalent, although the 1974 projection of IS 739 million (IE 7,390 million)
have of course been far exceeded due to the high inflation rates.
3.09     The loan portfolio is sound. Total arrears at the end of 1981 of
more than 3 month account for only 1.3% of the outstanding loan portfolio,
affecting 5.7% of outstanding loans. This compares with total arrears of 1.8%
in 1980 and 3.5 % in mid-1974. Details of the arrears and applicable
guarantees are shown in Annex 2.
3.10     Of the loans granted by IDBI   since 1975, 56% went to the
less-developed regions of Israel. While in 1975 only 6% of the loans went to
government-supported enterprises, this proportion reached a peak of 40% in
1979, decreasing thereafter to 35% in 1980 and 30% in 1981. These figures
indicate a substantial change in IDBI's policy, partly spurred on by the lack
of demand in the depressed industrial sector. The wide distribution of the
IDBI loans by sectors is given in Annex 3.
Profitability
3.11     A comparison with projections (income statements) made at the time of
the appraisal is difficult in absolute terms, as during the last years
inflation in Israel has been at about 10% per month, and all costs, salaries
etc. are indexed-linked. In Annex 4 a comparative analysis is made, showing
the substantially increased interest spread (the low levels of which caused
some concern at the time of the previous PCR) from 3.0% in real terms in 1975
to 6.5% in 1981, which is satisfactory. The net profit on average net worth
(indexed) increased from 9.3% in 1975 to 48.0% in 1980, before dropping to
32.3% in 1981; these figures are, of course, influenced by inflation.



-5-
Resource Mobilization
3.12     Domestic resource mobilization is controlled by the Government, and
most resources received came from the Treasury (Annex 5). The total amount
received is indicated for each of the years 1975 through 1981, but totalling
the loan amounts - which are indexed - would produce a meaningless figure.
IDBI has, however, been successful in mobilizing foreign resources, signing 56
foreign loan agreements over the same period for a total equivalent value of
$458 million.
4. Financial Position
Debt/Equity Ratio
3.13     In August 1976, taking into account IDBI's strong financial position,
and institutional maturity, the Bank agreed to an increase of the debt-equity
ratio of 5:1 as specified in the Loan Agreement to 7:1.  This was done on the
understanding that IDBI would increase its equity base before the end of 1977.
3.14     This latter agreement was not immediately adhered to by IDBI. Due to
its partial foreign currency indebtedness, and its Israeli Shekel equity base,
the debt equity ratio exceeded the limit of 7:1 at the end of 1977, 1978 and
1979, in spite of pressure exerted by the Bank.
3.15     The situation was resolved by the sale of dollar-denominated
preference shares during 1979-1981 for a nominal amount of $98 million.   This
has brought the debt equity ratio down to 3.2 at end 1980, and to 3.6 at end
1981, thus securing IDBI's strong financial base and resolving the dispute
with the Bank. Details of the transactions and calculations are given in
Annex 7.
Assets
3.16     The 1974 appraisal report projected assets of IS 739 million (IE7,390
million) for end 1979. No inflation projection was used in the appraisal
report. Total assets at end 1975 were IS 400 million, equivalent to $563
million.
3.17     Assets as of end 1979 amounted to IS 2,662 million, equivalent to
$752 million. The assets subsequently increased to IS 10,760 million at the
end of 1981, but due to the massive exchange rate changes the equivalent value
of IDBI's assets dropped to $690 milliom. Unless very complicated inflation
accounting is used, which is outside the scope of this PCR, no direct
comparison with the projections can be made. The difference shown between
1979 and 1981 is not considered significant, although the clear long term
growth of assets between 1975 and 1981 is welcomed. See Annex 4.
5. Use of Bank Loan
3.18     The proceeds of the Bank loan of $25 million to IDBI has assisted in
the financing of 47 projects (5 type'A', 42 type 'B'). Thirty-five projects
(75%) were located in the less developed regions of Israel, while the other 12
projects all were export related.



- 6 -
3.19     Of the 47 projects part-financed, 2 have closed due to losses or
technical problems; the Bank loan amount involved is $1.38 million (5.5% of
the loan). Two other projects, involving a total of $0.12 million of Bank
funds (0.5% of the loan) appear to be in serious difficulty.
3.20     The remaining projects appear all viable, and have in total provided
employment for 13,400 workers, at an average cost of $10,230 per worker.
Together with the IBRD loan, $113.5 million in other financing was attracted.
Although all plants are not yet at full production, exports in 1981 from 11
new plants were estimated at $99.8 million 1/ for a total investment of $80.7
million ($9.6 million from IBRD). Further export-oriented projects were
expansion projects with no clear additional export figures for the projects as
such; however, using the same project cost to export ratio as for new plants,
additional exports from 27 exporting plants can be estimated at $59.0 million,
bringing the total annual exports of projects part-financed from the $25
million Bank loan to about $140 million. 1/ Details of the companies, project
cost, employment and export are in files, but as these data are of a
confidential nature they are not attached to this report.
6.  Summary and Conclusions
3.21     The Bank's cooperation with IDBI over the period of the four Bank
loans, 1965-1982, has been fruitful and very cordial.
3.22     IDBI has developed into a strong, efficient development institution,
operating in a difficult economic climate and under rapidly changing financial
conditions imposed by events not under its own control. Management and staff
experience and resources are at a premium in such circumstances, and IDBI has
lived up to the challenge (para 3.04). The financial position is
satisfactory, and the foreign exchange resource mobilization effort has been
substantial (para 3.12).
3.23     Operations and outstanding loans (on a dollar-equivalent basis) of
IDBI appear to be on a plateau, and no further dramatic increases in
operations are foreseen unless there is a strong upswing in the economic
activities in the country.  IDBI has taken a greater share of
government-supported projects than previously (para 3.10) to off-set the lack
of demand from the more depressed private sector, and has also expanded in
other fields (para 3.05).
3.24     The fourth Bank loan of $25 million has fully met its objectives.
The projects part-financed by the Bank loan, in conjunction with $113.5
million of other financing, have created 13,400 jobs at a very modest
investment cost of only $10,230 per worker, and the geographic location of the
projects has been mainly in the less-developed regions (para 3.18 and 3.20).
Exports resulting from the projects are substantial (para 3.20).
3.25     The Bank loan component to IDBI has followed the traditional dfc
pattern. However, the following observations can be made in reflecting on the
loan and the institution:
1/ Gross exports. Figures for the import component of these exports, as well
as value added for the industries, were not made available.



a.   IDB has expressed willingness to assist with training of staff
of other dfc's, either in Israel or by secondment of IDBI
staff. In view of the efficiency with which IDBI operates, its
advanced stage of computerization of operations, and its
experience in inflation accounting and indexing, this offer
should be seriously considered in appropriate circumstances.
b.   The high inflation rates and resulting sharp exchange rate
changes were not foreseen at the time of appraisal.
c.   As with all other dfc operations, the importance of the quality
of staff and management to overcome formidable economic and
financial difficulties has again been clearly demonstrated.
Bank appraisals and supervision reports of dfc projects should
perhaps focus even more on this aspect than in the past.
IV. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) COMPONENT
(US$5.0 million)
1. Objectives
4.01     The primary objective of the R&D Component was to assist the
Government of Israel, specifically the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) in
the Ministry of Industry and Trade, to improve its ability to promote and
support commercially oriented R&D and to develop techniques to assess and
monitor such R&D activities. A further objective was to provide the Bank with
an opportunity to experience the problems associated with development of an
organization such as the OCS. The Loan Agreement provided for simultaneous
support of several subprojects representative of technological infrastructure,
pre-commercial and commercial activities, as a vehicle for the development of
the OCS's capabilities and to permit observation of the variety of factors
which can affect the growth of commercial R&D. Initially these were the Negev
R&D Authority ($1,650,000); two pre-commercial R&D subprojects, solar
ponds($300,000) and jojoba beans ($400,000); and three commercial R&D
subprojects, rural telephone system ($1,000,000), prime movers ($950,000) and
tomographic scanner ($550,000). In addition there was a loan allocation for
technical assistance to the OCS ($150,000) bringing the total R&D Component of
the loan to $5 million 1/. The project was developed and supervised with
assistance from the Bank's Science and Technology Adviser and from outside
consultants. A detailed description of OCS's operations and function in
Israel is given in Staff Appraisal Report No. 656a-IS of May 7, 1975 (paras
4.33 through 4.47, and Annexes 20, 28 and 29).
4.02     A further objective of the R&D Component was to study the Israeli
system of incentives for industrial R&D and the venture capital market in
Israel. The purpose of these efforts, carried out under the loan allocation
for technical assistance to the OCS, was to provide a basis for government
actions to improve the climate in Israel for private support of industrial
R&D. A final objective of the R&D Component was to gain information with
1/ As the projects developed, some re-allocation of funds to the various
separate sub-components was agreed upon in 1977; see Annex 8, para 5 for
the actual use of loan funds.



- 8 -
possible application to the industrial R&D programs of other developing
countries.
2. Activities and Results
4.03     With few reservations, the objectives of the R&D Component were
accomplished with marked success, as summarized below. Further details are
available in Annexes 8 through 12, which also give details of some of the
commercial possibilities of products developed with financing of the R&D
component. The allocation of funds under the R&D component is given in
Annex 8, page 2.
A.  The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS).
4.04     The relatively small amount of the loan allocated to the R&D
Component nevertheless gave credibility and prestige to the concept of R&D
support by the OCS, and allowed the OCS to use the loan as seed money to
attract funds for the project many times greater than the loan. Furthermore,
the program established a requirement for expansion of OCS capabilities in the
areas of proposal screening, project assessment, budgeting and supervision.
As a result the OCS has grown from 10 to 35 staff (over one-half of whom are
professional) during the term of the Bank loan, while the level of R&D support
by it has grown during the same period from about $10 million to nearly
$34 million per year. OCS has become an efficient organization for the
continuing promotion and support of R&D, and for maintenance of an effective
information and control system; the Bank, through the loan and through
associated technical advice, assisted in this development. A further,
detailed description of OCS's activities and scope of operation is given in
Annex 8.
4.05     Under the Technical Assistance category of the loan, the OCS
sponsored studies by the Center for Policy Alternatives (CPA) at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology of the Israeli system of incentives for
innovation and the sources of venture capital in Israel. These studies were
completed, and represented the first comprehensive reviews done in these
areas; as such, they have proven useful in bringing to the attention of
various government authorities the importance of incentives for innovation and
of expanded sources of risk capital. The recommendations of CPA, both
relating to the R&D project as well as general R&D policies in Israel, are
given in Annex 9.
B. Infrastructure Subprojects (for a more detailed description of the
subprojects see Annex 10).
4.06     Multi Purpose Facility in the Negev.   The infrastructure subproject
contemplated a multi-purpose facility located at the University of
the Negev (Beersheva) to provide a testing service facility, a unit
process laboratory and other R&D services to attract new industry and
to support existing industry in the area. It was expected that there
would be sufficient sponsorship by industry of the activities to make
the facility self-supporting. Midway through the subproject it was
recognized that the objectives were overly ambitious, because new
industry was not attracted to the area and because of the reluctance
by industry generally to subcontract appreciable R&D. Therefore,
funds allocated from the loan to the subproject were reduced to about
one-third of those initially programmed. While the resulting



- 9 -
facility has proven of value, especially to the important ceramics
industry, it is doubtful that it can operate without about 35%
government support to supplement the fees (approximately $1.6 million
per annum) earned from industry. However, such a level of Government
support is lower than in many comparable institutions in other
countries.
4.07     The Standards Institute.   Some of the funds originally allocated to
the Negev subproject were re-allocated to the purchase of equipment
for the Standards Institute, which was not originally included in the
project. The Standards Institute provides services to exporting
industries to assist them in meeting the non-tariff requirements of
importing countries.  These services include provision of information
concerning technical requirements, design assistance and testing.
The Institute has processed over 800 inquiries in its Information
Center since 1978, and the activity continues to grow.   The testing
services for industry also are expanding as a result of equipment
purchased with funds from the Bank loan. The overall activity still
requires substantial government support, which is expected to reduce
as the fees from industry increase and self-sufficiency is expected
within a few years. However, the true economic value of the
Standards Institute lies in the support it provides to exporting
industries. A quantitative measure of such economic value is not
feasible.
4.08     The Center for Materials Research.   This activity was also financed
in part by funds which became available as a result of the cut-back
in the Negev subproject. The Center for Materials Research is a
consolidation of six entities, the Metals Institute, the Ceramics and
Silicate Institute, the Rubber Research Association, the Paint
Research Association, the Noble Metals Center and the Analytical
Laboratory, and provides product development and testing services for
a broad range of Israeli industry. While the institutes comprising
the Center for Materials Research maintain independence, their
association has led to administrative and operational improvements
and to the acquisition of equipment too expensive for a single
institute. For example, the Center, through the portion of the Bank
loan allocated to it, was able to purchase a scanning electron
microscope and many accessories, equipment for salt-spray, humidity
and other environmental testing, and other sophisticated equipment
which permit expanded interdisciplinary research. Although the
development of the Center is in its early stages, there has been a
substantial increases in research support capabilities for industry,
especially in the noble metals where Israel has substantial export
activities. As is the case for the Standards Institute, the economic
value of the Center for Materials Research lies in its aid to
exporting industries.
C. Pre-commercial Subprojects (for more detailed sub-project descriptions see
Annex 11)
4.09     Jojoba.  The objective was to convert the wild jojoba plant to a
cultivated, commercial crop, and to develop a family of chemical
compounds of commercial value equal to or higher than those derived
from sperm oil and carnauba wax. However, higher than anticipated
production costs for jojoba, coupled with the availability of new
low-cost synthetic oils with comparable properties, have removed
jojoba as a viable substitute for sperm oil. Nevertheless, there



- 10 -
appear to be a number of applications of the unique properties of
jojoba wax to cosmetics and phamaceuticals.   The Scientific Research
Foundation, which sponsored the subproject, has formed a subsidiary
with private capital to develop and market a line of such products.
It also expects to market jojoba plantlets which it raises through
cell propagation techniques developed under the subproject, and
expect sales of one million plantlets (at $1.00 each) per year within
a few years. Cell propagation allows considerable control of plant
properties with resulting significant improvement in crop quality and
quantity. The plantlets are expected to provide a valuable export
product to countries where land and water are in greater supply than
in Israel. In addition, it is believed that some of its plant
propagation techniques developed are applicable to other varieties of
plants.
4.10     Solar Ponds.  The solar ponds subproject had the dual objectives of
studying the technical problems and economic feasibility of using
nonr-convecting ponds to collect and store solar energy on a
commercial scale, and of constructing a small-scale prototype working
pond. By 1977, two years after the start of Bank support which was
important to get the work started, the subproject had progressed well
beyond its original goals. A joint venture, Solmat Ltd., was formed
by the subproject sponsor, the Scientific Research Foundation, and
Ormat Turbines Ltd., a manufacturer of prime movers which also
received OCS support under the Bank loan. During the same year, the
subproject was transferred to the newly formed Ministry of Energy,
and Bank support was ended. The OCS and the Bank, however, continued
to monitor progress of the solar ponds development and the subproject
must be considered a significant success. The original objectives
were completed and solar ponds under construction near the Dead Sea
are expected to be delivering 5 megawatts of peak electric power by
the end of 1982. The ponds will utilize a turbine generator
developed by Ormat Turbines Ltd. under another Bank financed R&D
subproject. In addition, Solmat is carrying out a feasibility study
relating to the use of a solar pond in California's Salton Sea, and
has proposals for similar studies outstanding to other countries; the
solar pond development has attracted wide attention in the world.
Solmat now estimates the investment cost for electric power generated
by solar ponds in conjunction with turbogenerators to be about $3,000
per kilowatt exclusive of land, water and salt costs (about 3x the
investment cost for conventional oil-fired stations).   Of this cost,
about one-half is attributed to pond construction (about $8 per sq.
meter).
D. Commercial Subprojects (for a more detailed description see Annex 12).
4.11     Rural Telephone System.   This subproject, sponsored by Tadiran Ltd.,
called for the development of an electronic telephone system for use
by small communities (100 to 400 subscribers), for which it was
believed a large market existed. While a system meeting most
technical objectives has been developed, three factors have adversely
affected sales. First, the current world-wide demand is now
estimated to be only one-tenth that originally projected because of
depressed economic conditions. Second, Tadiran has been unable to
develop "market presence" against well-established competitors who



financing to customers.  As a result of these adverse factors,
Tadiran has sold only one system to date. The sale was to a South
American country and consisted of 80 exchanges of various sizes plus
spare parts, with a total price of a few million dollars. Successful
performance of this system may result in broader recognition and
acceptance, and may lead to further orders. At present Tadiran
continues a low level of development, and the program is no longer
supported by the OCS.
4.12     Prime Movers.  The sponsor of this subproject was Ormat Turbines
which, as noted above, is associated with the sponsor of the solar
ponds subproject, Scientific Research Foundation. Ormat is a pioneer
and technological leader in the field of turbines using organic
working fluids. The original scope of the subcontract covered
development of five different prime movers and was soon recognized as
overly ambitious for a company of Ormat's small size. Accordingly,
the scope was reduced to cover a "village prime mover" (3 kilowatts),
a smaller unit for rural TV systems, and the conceptual design of a 1
to 10 megawatt turbogenerator.
4.13     The rural TV unit development was abandoned when it became apparent
that the turbogenerator approach was too expensive for such low power
applications. While the 3 kilowatt development was successful, a
significant small-village market did not develop because
manufacturing costs were much higher than originally estimated.
However, there appears to be a substantial market for pipe line
communications and other applications where high cost is offset by
the need for reliable, unattended operations. The 1 to 10 megawatt
turbogenerator has gone well beyond "conceptual" design, with a 5
megawatt unit nearing completion for use with a solar pond. In
addition geothermal and waste heat turbogenerators operating in the
50 to 300 kilowatt range have been developed, and substantial exports
are forecast for those units. The subproject represents a
significant success with export sales of turbogenerators already
exceeding $1 million, and with forecasted annual export of $4 million
by the end of 1982 growing to $12 million by 1985.
4.14     Tomographic Scanners.   Tomographic scanning is a recently developed
technique for using a computer and X-rays to locate tumors and other
diseases, and is considered to be one of the major innovations in
radiology. Following OCS funding through the Bank loan, government
funding of about $6.5 million was made available by Elscint Ltd., the
sponsor of the subproject, which then was able to carry out a highly
successful development, production and marketing effort. Through
1981, Elscint shipped some $50 million in tomographic scanners,
almost entirely exports. The company's total sales have grown
from $8 million in 1975 to about $120 million currently of which
about one-half is for tomographs; Elscint employs about 1000
employees in connection with the tomographic scanner program. While
the Government's support of the project was nearly six times that of
the Bank loan, it must be noted that without the Bank loan, and the
confidence in the value of such a project as indicated by the Bank's
participation, it is doubtful that the OCS would have been able to
secure such government support.



- 12 -
3. Summary and Conclusions
4.15     While the principal purpose of the R&D component was to enhance
Israel's exports through expanded development of technological products, it
also provided a vehicle to gain experience in methods of industrial R&D
promotion and support applicable to other developing countries. The Bank
participated, as well, in the selection and supervision of projects to be
supported under the Bank loan.
4.16     The close working relationship between the Bank and the OCS proved
valuable to both parties. Bank participation through the loan and through
approval of project selection, gave "credibility" to the OCS through which it
was able to obtain significantly greater R&D support funds from the
government. In addition, the Bank's requirement for project planning
documents and periodic technical and financial reports provided the OCS with a
supportable basis for requiring such information from the project sponsors.
The OCS indicated that the Bank's participation assisted in the OCS program to
increase the industrial R&D effort and expenditures in Israel which nearly
doubled. Industrial exports based on local R&D grew in the same period from
$233 million to over $1 billion, although this growth was not by any means due
only to the Bank-supported subprojects. It is concluded that OCS benefited
substantially from the association with the Bank in this project.
4.17     The experience with this program suggests several points for
consideration by the Bank in future similar programs:
a.   The Loan Agreement should be less specific with respect to
organizational and procedural requirements imposed on the OCS or its
equivalent in order to allow a growing organization maximum
flexibility in meeting diverse requirements as they appear. However,
this flexibility should be matched against the experience of the
organization (CCS equivalent) involved.
b.   Documentation requirements for reimbursement of foreign exchange
expenditures should be simplified. Many items of foreign purchase
were for small dollar value and the cost of documentation required or
the difficulty in obtaining it can be disproportionate.
c.   The Bank's reimbursement only for foreign exchange costs can
encourage use of foreign goods and services even though domestic
equivalents are available; such a potential bias should be avoided in
future similar loans.
d.   Priority should be given to support of the R&D efforts of smaller
firms where OCS funds and participation are more meaningful and where
OCS can exercise greater influence than in large concerns. Although
prior approval by the Bank of the larger projects financed under the
loan component was useful, allocation to a larger number of smaller
projects would require delegating the full appraisal of such projects
to the OCS or similar entities.
e.   On average the Bank carried out annual supervision missions, somewhat
more frequently at the start of the program and somewhat less
frequently later. It is believed that for a program of this
complexity, annual missions are sufficient for technologically
sophisticated countries such as Israel.



- 13 -
f.   The Loan Agreement originally required the OCS to submit quarterly
reports in considerable detail. This requirement was a burden to the
OCS because level of data required frequently exceeded that readily
available from the sponsors. It is recommended that in future
technological programs, the Bank consider a form of "exception"
reporting whereby interim reports consider only material deviations
from a previously issued detailed project plan. The project plan, in
turn, should be reviewed and reissued annually and form the basis for
the quarterly "exception" reports of the following year.
V. VOCATIONAL TRAINING COMPONENT
(US$5.0 million)
1. Objectives
5.01     The vocational training component had as its objective to reduce the
constraint on Israeli industry imposed by a shortage of skilled workers and
technicians, particularly in the electronics and metal trades. Specifically,
it aimed at improving and expanding selected vocational/technical training
centers by enabling the Borrower to replace existing small and uneconomic
centers by expanded regional facilities offering a wider range of training
programs.
5.02     The centers and institutions originally selected for assistance are
listed in Table 1. At the request of the Government, four additional
vocational training centers (VTCs) received equipment under a re-allocation of
funds in February 1980, i.e. Acre, Beit Shemesh, Carmiel and Ashkelon.

2. Implementation and Project Management
5.03     In accordance with Section 4.01 of the Loan Agreement, a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) made up of experienced managers and engineers, was
promptly established within the MTDB. The PIU evolved into an effective
implementation term, encountering few if any problems in its management
responsibility for equipment procurement and civil works on the basis of
international competitive bidding.
5.04     Given the uncertainties of the political situation of the area, no
foreign contractors submitted bids for civil works. An adequate spread of
bids was received, however, from the well-developed Israeli construction
industry, and in all cases contracts were awarded to the lowest evaluated
bidder. Minor delays were experienced with new construction, despite a change
of contractor being necessary on the site of the Tel-Arza vocational training
center (VTC) in Jerusalem. However, renovation of an existing workshop,
laboratory and classroom spaces was delayed by up to 19 months, due in part to
the MTDB's sound policy of employing the trainees themselves for many
operations, and in part to the fact that all such work was only done during
holidays to minimize disruption of scheduled classes. Tables 2 and 3 outlines
details on the construction and implementation schedules.

5.05     Equipment procurement took about a year longer than expected due to
the methodical and meticulous way in which staff of the PIU consulted with
various expert authorities to ensure that every item of equipment or tool
ordered was not only ideally suited to the task required, but was also the
cheapest available. The original equipment allocation from the loan was for
US$3 million, but at Government request, was finally increased to US$3.8
million through the reallocation of funds from the civil works and unallocated
categories.
3. Educational and Training Objectives
5.06     In all the training centers and institutions assisted by the project,
enrollments and annual output of trained personnel have exceeded the appraisal

5.07     Positive measures taken to ensure successful completion of training
were: (a) a reduction in the instructor/student ratio; (b) the introduction
of aptitude tests which ensure that trainees have the required capabilities;
and (c) improved curricula and equipment which has led to meaningful training
courses which, by the very nature of their industrial bias, have been a
motivating factor.
5.08     By using a system of two daily shifts plus one evening shift, the
VTCs are operational for 14 hours each day for six days each week. This high
utilization rate has not, however, resulted in excessive "down-time" for
equipment, since the policy in each center is to carry out necessary
maintenance repairs using trainees and instructors for the purpose. The
mission saw two 15-year old center-lathes which had just been put back into
service following the replacement of helical drive-shafts which had been made
by staff and trainees themselves.
4. Unit Cost per Trainee
5.09     After scrutiny of recurrent costs of the project institutions (staff
salaries; utility charges; cost of training materials; and allowance for an
annual 8% depreciation on equipment and 5% on buildings), the average annual
costs for (a) the vocational training centers; and (b) the technician/
practical engineering institutes, were arrived at. On this basis, the costs
of training practical engineers/technicians in various disciplines and skilled
workers in various trades were derived.

Figures include salaries, utility charges, equipment and buiiding
depreciation, plus costs of all teaching and training materials.
5.10     These costs compare favorably with those found in the U.S. and Europe
for similar categories of technicians and skilled workers. Based on
observations and discussions with trainees, the higher technicians or
"practical engineers" graduating from the Higher Technical Institutes such as
Beer-Sheva after 2-1/2 years are of equivalent standard to the holders of
Higher National Diplomas in Britain. Likewise, the technicians, after two
years of training, possess skills comparable to the City and Guilds Technician
Certificate from London. The skilled workers also compare well with their
overseas counterparts.
5. Summary and Conclusions
5.11     Following discussions with major industrial employers, senior
administrators, principals, heads of departments and trainees, and visit to 11
project-assisted institutions, (concentrating on those with a civil works
component as well as a large equipment provision), it was concluded that, in
all respects, the vocational training component of the Industrial Development
Project had succeeded in meeting, and in some respects exceeding, its manpower
development objectives. Thorough preparation by the MTDB prior to
negotiations, coupled with competent management by the PIU certainly
contributed to this result. A significant project benefit is that the
Manpower Training and Development Bureau (MTDB) of the Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs (the responsible implementing agency), was able to develop
standard curricula and equipment which have in turn facilitated the
establishment of a national network of training centers. The costs per
trainee is another indication of the impressive performance of the project
institutions, comparing most favorably with those obtained in similar
institutions in developed countries.

5.12     Several factors contributing to the successful implementation of the
training sub-project, from which lessons applicable to all industrial
vocational training projects can be learned are:
(a) the timely establishment of a PIU staffed by properly qualified and
experienced professionals and enjoying the full support of senior
managers. The Director of the PIU (holder of an M.B.A.) has
excellent management skills and his two main assistants on
construction and equipment procurement are both graduate engineers
with industrial experience;
(b) locating the PIU within the organizational structure of the Ministry
of Labor and Social Affairs which is directly responsible for
training industrial manpower. This measure ensures continuous
dialogue between employers and the managers of project institutions
regarding the numbers and specializations of trainees required on a
year-to-year basis;
(c) flexible curricula capable of meeting the needs created by changes in
technology and hence the performance levels of skilled workers and
technicians;
(d) all instructors in vocational training centers are mature individuals
with wide practical industrial experience, mostly gained in Western
and Eastern Europe. Their ability to motivate trainees through their
sheer practical ability is impressive;
(e) the extremely high utilization factor of project facilities resulting
from the fact that principals and heads of departments are
experienced in institutional management; and
(f) related to the above factors, a conscious search for cost-effective
training reflected by the obvious effort of training staff to get the
most out of expensive, imported equipment (including the replacement
of major machine components by new parts fabricated by the trainees
themselves).

S OTES:
1)  Projections have been stated in current prices assuming some rise in price levels of industrial fixed capital formation          I
in Israel (See Forecasted Price Inflator in Annex 5-2). Since there had been a significant divergence between
forecasted and actual price increases, we are displaying both projected, as well as actual figures in fixed prices of 1973. @
2) Projections have been based on forecasted fixed-capital formation in industry and I.D.B.I.'s prospective share in financing
those investments. Since the actual annual real rates of growth in investments fell short of the forecasted ones, we
corrected the forecasted figures (in fixed prices) by a factor which is the ratio of actual to forecasted rates
(See Annex 5-2).

THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SCIENTIST (OCS)
OCS Organization
1.       The OCS totals 35 employees versus 10 at the inception of the Bank
loan. These include 12 with technical background, 6 with background in
economics and 5 with other professional backgrounds. The organization is
divided into three principal activities. The Technological Division monitors
OCS supported activities in electronics, chemistry, metals and raw materials
through monitors assigned to each area. The Administrative Division
administers contracts, makes disbursemens, collects royalties, etc. The
Economic Division is primarily a planning and evaluation unit; as such it
provides the Chief Scientist with analyses of past performance, with
projections and with assistance in formulation of economic policy. Other
activities within the OCS include international liaison and data processing.
Project Selection
2.       The OCS solicits applications for industrial research funds from
Israeli industry. A request for such funds is required to include a technical
proposal, cost estimates, economic and export projections, manpower
requirements and financial data relating to the company. After the monitor
assigned by the OCS reviews this material and meets with the company, he
submits his recommendations to the Research Committee chaired by the Chief
Scientist and composed of OCS staff, representatives of the Ministry of
Industry Trade and Tourism, a representative of the Finance Ministry, and two
industry representatives. Final determination of the level of support, if
any, is made by this committee.
Information and Control System
3.       The existing information and control system differs from that
established at the outset primarily with respect to numbers and composition of
committees, with respect to frequency of monitor visits to plants, and with
respect to level of sponsor reports. It was found early in the program that
standing committees were impractical and unnecessary whereas ad hoc committees
chosen to meet specific project needs were of value. Similarly it was
determined that a fixed schedule of plant visits by the monitor, e.g. monthly,
was less desirable than an approach whereby program status determined when a
visit was useful. Finally, the report procedure evolved calls only for
semi-annual and annual reports. More frequent reporting was found to be a
burden to the sponsors and not particularly useful to the monitor, who could
maintain interim cognizance through visits and telephone conferences.
Scope and Activities
4.       The OCS currently supports projects with funding varying from 80% to
30% depending upon perceived importance and level of risk. Most projects
receive support at 50%. In 1981 more than 500 projects were approved with



- 28 -                  Annex 8
Page 2 of 2
support totalling nearly $33 million. An additional $900,000 was granted some
120 infrastructure projects.  These figures compare to a similar number of
projects funded in 1975 but the level of financing has trebled. It is also
noteworthy that requests for funds in 1981 were more than 5 times those in
1975 while the budget was increased by only a factor of 3.5. There thus is
great pressure on available OCS funds, a situation which the OCS does not
expect will improve in the near term.

INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION & VENTURE CAPITAL STUDIES
(MIT/CPA RECOMMENDATIONS)
1.       Under the provisions of the Loan Agreement pertaining to Technical
Assistance to the OCS, the contract was awarded by the OCS to the Center for
Policy Alternatives (CPA) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
study industrial innovation and venture capital in Israel. This contract
culminated in CPA report number 79-19 dated August, 1979 and entitled "A
Summary Report on a Study of Industrial Innovation in Israel", and supporting
reports (see Annex 13)
Recommendations on R & D
1.       It was concluded that a policy of subsidizing projects that are
expected to be a commercial success is wasteful because companies are likely
to finance such projects on their own.   The OCS should apply its resources to
high-risk projects or, even better, should finance some percentage of a firm's
annual budget rather than use a project-by-project approach.
2.       The OCS should continue to fund on a project-by-project basis those
projects where social benefits exceed social costs, but where private benefits
are less than private costs.
3.       The OCS should consider a totally new program for small/new firms.
Such firms have particularly great difficulty in finding funds and warrant
special attention because of their innovativeness and because there is
generally no relationship between their potential contribution to exports or
employment, and the resources at their command.
4.       The CPA study surveyed the venture capital markets in Israel and
discussed problems of obtaining risk capital with many business men. The CPA
findings suggest areas where actions should be considered.
5.       Inflationr-proof and almost risk-free yields on indexed government
bonds discourage investment in high risk ventures.
6.       Capital gains from private placement of equities are taxable, while
such gains from publically traded stocks are tax-free. This fact discourages
investment in new, non-public ventures.
7.       The capital market does not provide for trading of over-the-counter
securities.
8.       There is a lack of people trained in business/finance who can
understand and assess the potentials of a new venture. The entrepreneurs
generally are met and analyzed by bankers who place undue emphasis on
collateral.

General Policy Recommendations
1.       While Israel has a well developed institutional infrastructure and
policies for the development of science, it lacks a purposeful national policy
on technological development. It needs to strengthen and interrelate agencies
and institutions involved in technological development and develop criteria
for resource allocation. This statement does not detract from the
considerable accomplishments of high-technology firms in Israel in
contributing to the exports of self-developed high value added products, and
thus in laying the foundations for further growth.   It does imply that if
Israel is to meet its growth targets in exports in he face of increased
competition from several developing countries and to overcome protectionish
measures from industrial countries whose economies are themselves in the
doldrums, it must seriously re-examine ad reformulate its technology
policies. The following are some of the major recommendations resulting from
the study.
a)   A thorough examination of taxation and subsidy policies is needed.
Existing policies and programs require modification if a favorable
climate for investments and profitability is to be created,
especially in the high inflation regime in which the country finds
itself. In particular, this policy should at least be neutral
between investments in new ventures and those in goverment and
publicly quoted securities.
b)   Promote closer collaboration among agencies devoted to industrial
development and transfer of technology to arrive at an integration of
policies and programs related to technological development.
c)   Establish industry priorities in consultation with enterprises, and
make greater use of the analytical capabilities of universities and
other institutions.
d)   Develop educational programs in the management of technology at
Israeli universities to redress deficiencies of managers of
technology-based enterprises, and to provide assistance to firms in
their internal venturing activities.
e)   Promote technology transfer through R&D worker mobility and personnel
interchange among industry, research institutes, and universities.
The OCS has a system of incentives which has worked reasonably well to
stimulate R&D in industry. However, its impact can be improved by the
following measures:



- 31 -                        Annex 9
Page 3 of 3
a)   Reduction in the bureaucratic delays in grant processing and
disbursal, through new procedures.
b)   Development of a program aimed at providing financing for new/small
firms that cannot draw on parent companies, kibbutzes, or capital
markets. Consideration should be given to working through existing
financial institutions.
c)   Establishing a sounder basis and criteria for the allocation of
available resources among sectors and within them. This would
require a staff development program to provide an improved capacity
of project selection, appraisal and monitoring.
d)   Development of a service to provide more up-to-date information to
firms on international trends in technology and markets.
e)   Development of an information and data base system to follow up on
the growth of supported firms in order to identify capital and
technology needs at different stages of development of the firms.
Some approaches are: (1) state-of-the-art reviews by universities and
research institutes with industry collaboration; (2) active
industrial advisory committees in selected sectors; and (3)
conferences on problems faced by Israeli firms in connection with
safety, health and environmental regulations of countries to which
Israeli companies export (e.g., FDA approval of drugs).
f)   Development of a data base on R&D intensive firms incorporating
firm-level time-series data on sales, assets, employment, R&D
expenditures and investments, licensing royalties and payments,
patents, firm ownership, assistance in determining the productivity
of R&D, lags in its effect, and the characteristics of above-average
firms.

INFRASTRUCTURE SUBPROJECTS
The original infrastructure subproject, the Negev R&D Authority, was joined
midway through the term of the Bank loan by two others, the Standards
Institute and the Materials Center.
1.       The Negev R&D Authority
This subproject had as its purpose the expansion of a facility in the
Negev, at Beersheva, to provide specialized industrial R&D and other technical
services on a contract basis to industrial enterprises and university
laboratories. The expanded facility was scheduled to include a unit process
laboratory containing multipurpose, intermediate sized pilot-plan equipment to
scale up processes developed in laboratories, which would permit in-depth
studies of processes and products.   The subproject would also include a
Testing Service Facility to provide support for R&D, manufacturing and quality
control activities.
It was intended that these facilities would provide additional,
specialized R&D and other technical service to large industries already
equipped with laboratories of their own, and to furnish similar services to
industries too small to provide for their own laboratories and which therefore
lacked such services.  With respect to this latter category of industry, it
was hoped that availability of the multi-purpose facilities would encourage
small businesses to move from urban areas to the Negev, an area the government
was anxious to develop industrially. Finally, the facility was to perform
work for university laboratories on a contract basis. It was hoped that
income from services would grow during the term of the Bank loan to the point
where the facility would be self-supporting.
The R&D Authority soon recognized that its goal of self-sufficiency
by 1980 was unattainable because economic conditions in Israel discouraged
moves to the Negev by existing small industries or start-ups by new
businesses. Also, it was found that large industry in the area was often
reluctant to purchase R&D, testing or other services which it was generally
competent to do inr-house. In view of the low level of contract support, the
budget was substantially reduced. The Bank loan apportioned to the Negev R&D
Authority was also reduced and final expenditures under the Loan were $1.02
million versus the $1.65 million originally programmed.
The OCS considers that the objectives of the subproject nonetheless
were realized in terms of scope, although not in magnitude. It believes that
the Testing Facility is especially strong in inorganic materials, greatly
strengthening the ceramics division of the R&D Authority. This expanded
capability has resulted in desirable research contracts from industry. In
addition R&D work performed at the Facility was instrumental in the
establishment of two new companies specializing in sophisticated ceramics
products.



- 33 -                        Annex 10
Page 2 of 3
It is estimated that in the most recent period for which figures were
available,(1981-9 months), expenses of the Negev R&D Authority were about
$1.35 million of which nearly 25% was provided in the form of government
grants. From these figures it is apparent that the facility is still
dependent upon the government for its support. The OCS does not expect this
situation to change, and now accepts that the most likely model for the budget
of the R&D Authority is one-third services to industry, one-third contract
R&D, and one-third direct government support.
The Standards Institute
The Standards Institute was allocated $400,000 under the Bank loan to
cover the foreign exchange costs of equipment to expand its Information
Center, Thermal Laboratory and Fire Laboratory. All three are fully
operational, providing valuable services to industry and growing in scope.
The Information Center collects regulations and other material
relating to non-tariff barriers of various countries to which Israel exports
or hopes to export its products, and provides this information upon request to
industry. More than 800 such inquiries have been answered since November of
1978 and the Center is currently processing about 30 inquiries per month.
These inquiries cover the areas of electricity and electronics (26%),
mechanical engineering (24%), pharmaceuticals and cosmetics (15%), solar
energy (10%) and others including furniture, flammables and building
components (25% combined). The Center also publishes a newsletter on
international developments in the area of standards and import regulations,
and has prepared and distributed several publications on topics of interest to
specific industrial sectors. Although there is a nominal charge for the
Center's services, receipts cover only a small part of the costs. Income from
other Institute activities and government support are required to cover the
balance of costs of operating the Center.   However, it is accepted that the
Center's contribution to the export capabilities of Israeli industry,
especially small firms, is of great value and warrants support.
The Thermal Laboratory provides testing facilities for solar collectors,
radiators, cooking ranges and heating devices.   This area of investigation
requires expensive, high-technology equipment and its acquisition was made
possible through the Bank loan which financed the purchase of thermographic
equipment, and other sophisticated instrumentation.
The Fire Laboratory has filled an important gap in Israel and, since
acquiring new equipment under the Bank loan, the Standards Institute has
become recognized as the center in Israel of the materials related aspects of
fire. Although much of the Fire Laboratory effort currently relates to
domestic safety problems, the advanced equipment acquired has permitted
expanded testing of export products such as plastics for solar collectors and
upholstery for civilian aircraft. In the current year, the Fire Laboratory is

expected to have income in excess of $50,000 as a result of work for about 25
exporters which is being performed with one engineer and one technician. This
activity is expected to grow.
At a late stage in the subproject, it was decided to provide a
Photometric Facility to render testing services in the field of illumination.
While the facility is too new to measure its impact on industry, it is
believed it will have important applications to product quality and energy
conservation, and is expected to be of particular importance to exporters of
lighting fixtures. Exporters of a wide range of other products will also
benefit from the spectroradiometer purchased with Bank funds. This instrument
is finding use in precisely defining the color of products ranging from
textiles to tomatoes, thus assuring product quality and uniformity. The
Photometry Facility currently employs one engineer and one technician.
The Center for Materials Research
The Center for Materials Research is an association of four existing
institutes: the Metals Institute, the Ceramics & Silicate Institute, the
Rubber Research Association and the Paint Research Association.   Of these, the
Metals Institute is larger, with 60 personnel, with the other three combined
having 40. Of the total Bank loan apportioned to the Center, the Metals
Institute was granted $450,000, while the balance of $100,000 was distributed
nearly equally among the remaining 3 Institutes.
The objective of the association of the 4 independent units, promoted
by the availability of Bank funds to participating members, was to enhance the
R&D capabilities of the institutes through interaction among them. It was
also the intent through newly acquired equipment to assist in the
establishment within the Metals Institute of a Center for Noble Metals to aid
the important but technology limited jewelry industry. The Metals Institute
is located in and is operated by the Technion (Technical University in
Haifa). About 15% of its efforts are devoted to testing, 35% to short-term
development and analysis projects, and 50% to long-term, R&D projects. Its
Center for Noble Metals serves not only the jewelry industry but the
electronics industry (semi-conductors and printed circuits) and has already
received several industry grants. Other groups within the Institute provide
to industry broad services in industrial R&D, materials and product testing
and related areas. During the past 18 months, since acquisition of equipment
under the Bank loan, the Metals Institute has been nearly self-supporting
while undertaking numerous projects with a budget of $365,000, of which
$50,000 was for contract services and $315,000 was in R&D grants.
The remaining participants in the Center for Materials Research are
each quite small and barely qualify as "Institutes". However, as they become
more efficient and demonstrate expanded capabilities as a result of their
participation in the Center, it is expected that they will grow and prosper.

PRE-COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT SUBPROJECTS
Solar Ponds
This subproject was intended to study the technical and economic
feasibility of solar ponds to collect and store solar energy on a coumnercial
basis, to construct and place into operation a small-scale prototype, and to
provide a conceptual design for a desalination plant and for the production of
electric power in the range of 10 MW.
In 1977, responsibility for the activity was transferred from the
Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism to *the Ministry of Energy. Direct
Bank participation was then halted. The OCS, and through it the Bank,
continued to monitor progress of the program during the balance of the term of
the Loan.
Also in 1977 the Scientific Research Foundation, sponsor of the
subproject, joined with Ormat Turbines, Ltd., to form a jointly owned
subsidiary, Solmat Ltd., to continue development of solar ponds. Ormat's
primary interest in this joint venture was the application of solar ponds to
its line of Rankine cycle turbogenerators Solmat currently has a 30 month
budget of $17 million, supported in major part by a grant from the Ministry of
Energy. Solmat has recently completed a solar pond feasibility study at the
Salton Sea in California and a continuing study of this application is under
way. The Dominican Republic has also contracted for a feasibility study with
Inter-American Bank support.
On the shores of the Dead Sea, a 0.67 hectare 1/ pond is regularly
supplying 30 KW of electric power (150 KW peak), and is connected to the
national grid. Nearing completion at the north end of the Dead Sea is a 4
hectare pond which is expected to be delivering power in mid 1982, while an
additional 21 hectare pond is also under construction nearby. By the end of
1982, it is expected that the combined 25 hectares of solar ponds will be
producing up to 5 MW of peak electric power. The generator in each instance
cited above is a turbogenerator developed by Ormat with support of the Bank
loan.
Indications to date are that the large, land-based pond cost,
exclusive of charges for land, salt or water, is approximately $8 per square
meter. In Israel that area of land will produce stored heat adequate to
generate approximately 20 KW-hours of electricity per year. On the basis of a
1/ A hectare is 10,000 square meters or approximately 2.47 acres.



- 36 -                       Annex 11
Page 2 of 3
4000 hour year (50% utilization), the pond construction cost is approximately
$1600 per KW. Ormat estimates large turbogenerator cost at $1500 per KW.
Thus solar pond generated power is estimated to have an investment cost
somewhat more than $3000 per KW exclusive of land, water and salt costs. When
cost alone is considered, solar pond generator power is not now competitive
with more conventional methods. However, when problems of fuel supply and
maintenance are taken into consideration, solar ponds can become a viable
method of generating hot water and electric power, especially in less
accessible areas, or where skilled personnel are not available.
Solmat is also constructing a one hectare prototype pond in the Dead
Sea to test the "floating" pond concept.   If this approach proves successful,
it is anticipated that pond costs will be reduced by 50% or more.   Floating
ponds driving 50MW turbines are envisioned for use during peak periods, and it
is believed this technology may be applicable to similar situations throughout
the world.
Jojoba Beans (liquid wax)
This subproject had as its objectives research to convert the jojoba
from a wild plant to a commercial crop in the Negev, and to develop a family
of chemical compounds of even higher commercial value than those derived from
sperm oil and carnauba wax. The subproject had two primary components,
agriculture and chemistry. The agricultural approaches took the forms of
plantings from cuttings of existing bushes, of plantings with seeds, and of
plantlets grown in the laboratory through tissue culture techniques.   Five
hundred dunams (a dunam is one-tenths of a hectare) of commercial plantation
have been planted with 125 dunams using cuttings and the balance planted with
seeds. Plantlets grown by tissue culture take 8 months to grow to usable
size, take an additional few months to "harden" to a natural environment and
then have a low survival rate. It is expected that it will take another 2
years before plantlets suitable for commercial plantings are available.
At the present time, jojoba oil costs about $60 per kilogram. The
rapid advance of synthetics makes the present price in Israel uneconomical for
the purposes for which jojoba was originally planned. Therefore, emphasis is
now placed upon developing the tissue culture technique and establishing
plantlet nurseries to the point where the present plantlet cost of 42 each can
be reduced to $1. At this lower cost, it is believed that a substantial
market for plantlets will exist in countries with lower land and water costs
than in Israel.
In the area of jojoba chemistry, emphasis is being placed on a pilot
plant for solvent extraction of the oil. Research is being carried out in
applications to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other products where the high
cost of jojoba wax can be tolerated.



Annex 11
Page 3 of 3
The R&D Authority, sponsors of the subproject, has joined with
private investors and with an Israeli company to develop a line of cosmetic
products such as shampoos and creams. Also, it is being sponsored by the
largest pharmaceutical company in Israel in the development of applications of
jojoba derivatives to burns, bruises and infections.
To date the program has had an income of about $25,000 through a
"know-how" agreement and through sales of 10,000 plantlets. During the next
two years, the R&D Authority, in addition to its work in cosmetics and
pharmaceuticals, will build up its capabilities of raising plantlets with the
goal of selling about 1 million units at $1 each within 3 years. No forecasts
are now available for sales of cosmetics or pharmaceuticals.
Because foreign exchange requirements of this program were lower than
anticipated, and because of an influx of private capital, actual Bank loan
expenditures on the program were $130,000 versus the $400,000 originally
allocated.

COMMERCIAL PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT SUBPROJECTS
Rural Telephone System
This subproject had as its objective the development of a series of
electronic telephone systems especially designed to provide telephone
communications for communities of 100 to 400 subscribers. The system was to
consist of an all-electronic exchange, multiplexer and radio link,
pre-packaged, pre-installed and relocatable. The development program was
undertaken as a result of extensive market studies undertaken by Tadiran,
Israel's largest manufacturer of electronic equipment and a company with a
proven record of success in telecommunications, which indicated an extensive
market for such equipment.
Throughout the development of the equipment, market studies were
continued and design parameters adjusted to meet what were perceived to be the
market requirements. However, as a result of subsequent studies which showed
a market shrunken to 1/10 that originally forecast because of international
economic conditions, equipment compromises were made and development effort
was reduced.
Two systems, the RTS-1 and the RTS-2 were developed. The RTS-1
provides up to 200 lines while the RTS-2, a later model, can provide 400 or
more lines by combining units. Both systems use Time Division Multiplexing
(TDM) and Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM). An originally planned RTS-3 model
to use Pulse Code Multiplexing (PCM) has been dropped. Instead the units
already developed will be adapted to PCM.
One system consisting of 80 exchanges of various sizes has been sold
to Colombia and it is hoped this sale will lead to others which are being
sought actively. Tadiran believes broad market penetration has not been
achieved as originally forecast because of its inability to establish market
presence against well-established telecommunications firms who were able to
meet market requirements by down-grading existing equipment. Furthermore,
competitors have been able to offer buyers better financing terms than Tadiran.
Expenditures by this subproject under the Bank loan were $300,000
versus the original allocation of $1 million. The OCS contributed an
additional $2.4 million but no longer supports the activity.
Prime Movers
This subproject originally provided for the development of five prime
movers (engines) based on the Rankine cycle turbogenerator developed by Ormat
Turbines Ltd., the sponsor. The 1-5 horsepower village engine, the 5-15
horsepower tractor engine developments, and the engine for pumping water were
discontinued near the outset of the subproject when it was determined that the



- 39 -                      Annex 12
Page 2 of 3
program was overly ambitious in view of the small size of Ormat and the
limited funding available. Furthermore, there arose considerable doubt as to
the advantages of turbines for these applications.
One of the two remaining objectives of the subproject, a 3KW power
generator for rural television and local telecommunications was realized with
qualified success. While performance was achieved, manufacturing costs were 5
times or more greater than originally forecast and the unit price is now about
$20,000 in small quantities. The high cost greatly diminished the market for
the 3KW unit for village applications. However, the sponsor continues
development in the hopes of a break-through in boiler/condenser and turbine
technology coupled with large production orders which could greatly reduce
cost.
A market has developed for the 3KW turbogenerator for pipeline
communications and other applications where the reliability and
maintenance-free characteristic of the turbogenerator offset its high cost.
These units use natural gas, diesel or low-grade alcohol for fuel. Despite
the high costs and resulting market limitations, over $1 million in
turbogenerators with outputs up to 3KW have been shipped, and current sales
exceed $500,000 per year.
The remaining objective of the subproject, conceptual design of a 1
to 10 megawatt turbogenerator for production of electricity from geothermal,
solar or ocean thermal gradients, has been exceeded by a wide margin and with
great success. Conceptual design of 1 to IOMW turbogenerators was given
emphasis early in the subproject when it was determined that a substantial
market had developed for this and lower range large units. The sponsor was
able to develop 50 to 300 KW geothermal unit, a 150 KW unit for use with a
solar pond and a 300KW unit using waste heat.
The sponsor is completing development through its subsidiary, Solmat,
of a 5MW unit for use with a solar pond. It is currently promoting a 50 KW
geothermal unit for use in larger villages and has established a subsidiary in
Mexico for this purpose as well as to market smaller units for pipeline and
village use. The 300 KW waste heat unit has a cost of about $1000 per KW
depending upon installation conditions and the sponsor estimates the pay-back
period to be from 2 to 5 years.
The sponsor's decision to emphasize large-size turbogenerators has
proven to be valid. Turbogenerator sales in the period 1980-1981 were near $3
million. Sales are projected at $4 million in 1982 and increasing to $12
million per annum by 1985. In excess of 75% of these sales are related to
large size turbogenerators and exports are expected to comprise the major
portion of total sales. The sponsor currently employs 120 personnel in
connection with the turbogenerator project. The OCS provided $5.9 million in
support of the subproject of which $1.08 million was provided under the Bank
loan (versus $950,000 originally allocated).

Tomographic Scanner
In economic terms, this subproject can be considered justification
for the entire R&D Component of the Bank loan.   In this instance, a loan of
$1.15 million ($550,000 was allocated originally) has led to sales through
1981 of about $50 million, almost entirely in exports. The sponsor, Elscint,
Ltd., which had total sales at the inception of the Bank loan in 1975 of $8
million will have sales near $120 million, mostly exports, in 1982 of which
over one-half will be in scanners developed as a result of the loan. The
company now employs about 1700 people of whom about 1000 are the direct result
of the scanner subproject.
Elscint currently enjoys about 10% of a world-wide market against
competition of companies many times its size and with long-standing
reputations in the medical electronics field. Elscint owes its success to a
highly qualified technical staff, aggressive marketing, and a management
willing to take the risks of technological innovation and respond to market
demands. The ability of a small company to react quickly and efficiently
probably accounts for the low development costs, estimated at $15 million of
which approximately $6 million was provided by the OCS (including $1.08
million from the Bank loan).
This subproject, while unusual in its dramatic degree of success,
demonstrates the effect of Bank participation.   In this instance, a relatively
small Bank loan, coupled with Bank review and approval of the proposed
subproject, provided the OCS with the independent and expert support necessary
to obtain nearly 5 times as much financial assistance from the government.
The availability of support at the level of 80% of costs permitted
the sponsor to undertake a high-risk and costly project, which otherwise would
have been outside its reach. A successful development followed by significant
sales then permitted the sponsor to invest nearly twice the amount provided by
the government to continue development and to establish production and
world-wide marketing facilities.

Dear Mr. Kapur,
Re: Project Completion Report on Israel:
Industrial Development Project (Loan 1116-IS)
We were pleased to receive your letter of Dec. 20, 1982 and to know
that the Israeli projecl was selected for the new kind of treatment.
Concerning the report attached to your letter, I would like to point
out that part of the delays (mentioned in para. 5. 04, p. 14) were due to
the fact that the policy of the PIV was to carry out all the renovations
during holidays and by doing so to enable the schools to perform the annual
working plan with minimum or no disturbances at all. This policy was
adopted with a view to the current needs and because of a lack of sub-
stitutional facilities.
I would like to thank you for the cooperation, support and guidance
given to us by the World Bank. This support enabled us to carry out
the project and to reach the goals of the project as planned.
Sincer ly,

Dear Mr. Kapur,
At the request of Dr. Yakir Plessner, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel
(who has replaced Dr. E. Sheffer to whom your original letter was directed),
I should like to express the Bank of Israel's satisfaction at the Project
Completion Report on the Industrial Development Project (Loan 1116-IS) which
you were kind enough to forward to us.
Dr. Moshe Y. Mandelbaum, Governor of the Bank of Israel, is the former
Executive Vice-Chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of Israel (IDBI),
and was consequently particularly pleased to see that the World Bank found
the IDBI to be "a well managed and financially sound institution (which).....
continues to play a significant development roles,being the most important
financial institution for implementing the Government's industrial policies."
Relative to paragraph 3.25(a), I should like to add that following recent
discussions with the current senior management of the IDBI, that institution
continues to offer its assistance in training and guidance to similar
institutions in other developing countries. Hopefully, following this
Project Completion Report, other developing countries may,in fact,avail
themselves of this assistance.
With kind regards, I remain
ssincerely,
/ ~C1rnnaWe      rg
