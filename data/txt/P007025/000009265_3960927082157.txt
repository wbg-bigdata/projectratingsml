NEMORANDUK AND RhCOKH}RDATION OF THE
PESIDENT OF TE INTENTIONAL U          OR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CENTRAL MANK OF THE DOMKNICAN REPUBLIC
WITE THE GUARANTEE OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL PREE ZONE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following Memorandum and Recomendation on a proposed Loan to the
Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, with the guarantee of the Dominican
Republic, for US$30.0 million equivalent, is submitted for approval. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, and would finance an industrial free zone
development project.
2.       Background.  The Industrial Free Zone (IFZ) program of the Dominican
Republic was launched in 1969, in an effort to encourage foreign investment and
generate employment. Since that time, the program has grown, from a single
industrial zone to the current 13 operating zones (8 private, 3 public, and 2
mixed), housing 211 industrial enterprises and providing 80,000 jobs, represent-
ing 4? of total national employment. The IFZs' net foreign exchange
contribution has increased from US$44 million in 1980 to over US$105.0 million
by mid-1988. In addition, free zones have stimulated technology transfer and
economic growth in less developed regions of the country. Economic linkages
between free zone firms and the local economy are also beginning to take place
in the electronics sector and in the shoe and plastics industries.
3.       Free zone perfoxmance in the Dominican Republic has been spectacular,
in the Caribbean context. In 1980, of the total value of preferential imports
entering the U.S. (the major export market) from the Caribbean Region under
preferential trade agreements, free zone exports from the Dominican Republic
accounted for 23Z--the highest share in the Region. In 1986, the Dominican
Republic moved to 452 of the total. The fast growth of IFZs shows the positive
response by foreign investors to the favorable investment climate, including
production cost factors, image of political stability, and access to markets,
strengthened by preferential trade agreements. In addition, the increasing
participation of sophisticated and strongly entrepreneurial local private
business groups in free zone promotion activities has been a major economic
force in developing international linkages and in directing resources to new
dynamic growth sectors. There is currently a high pent-up demand for free zone
factory space, with investors having to wait 12-24 months. To accomodate the
high growth trends of the last three years, estimates show that between 2 to 3
million sq. ft. of new factory space must be provided within the next three
years.
4.       Although thus far the country's free zone experience has been positive,
the rising demand in the absence of overall policy guidelines and rational
criteria on locational priorities, cost recovery, and financial feasibility,
could lead to a proliferation of free zones and inefficient resource use. Also,
scarce finance and unreliable electricity supply could prevent investors'
ability to capture new opportunities.



- 2 -
5.       To clarify the policy framework for future free zone development, the
Government has clearly articulated its free zone development policy in a broad
Policy Statement, which includes clarification of the institutional and regula-
tory framework and a commitment to develop a free zone long-range plan, based on
a realistic assessment of the country's absorptive capacity. Moreover, the
Statement reaffirms the Government's commitment to: (i) review rental policies
and adjust rents to Lover full economic costs; (ii) design criteria and develop
guidelines for the designation and approval of future free zones; and (iii)
transfer management and complete or partial ownership of some public free zones
to the private sector.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's lending and industrial
development strategy is to support the Government's broad objective, as stated
in a recent medium-term policy framework agreed with the Bank, to move to
export-led growth, through tariff reforms and gradual elimination of trade
restrictions. The proposed project, which is the first Bank operation in the
Dominican Republic's industrial sector, is seen as a first step in expanding the
basis for a dialogue on trade policy reform, by spreading free trade benefits
through streamlining the 'temporary admissions" regime, reinforcing linkages
with the domestic economy, and increasing private sector participation in free
zone trade activities. In addition, the proposed operation, by addressing the
badly needed term financing needs of the private free zone sector, would provide
an effective mechanism to support the Government's export-led growth strategy,
generate foreign exchange, and reduce unemployment, currently estimated at 27Z.
The Bank's involvement would be critical at this time, as demand pressures are
building up for additional factory space, to assist the Government to
rationalize free zone development through private sector initiatives and a well-
defined policy framework.
7.       Project Obiectives.  The Project would assist the Government in:
(a) formulating an effective and comprehensive strategy for the development of
new zones and the expansion of existing ones, including strengthening the
monitoring and control of the environmental impact of free zones; (b) reducing
unemployment, increasing foreign exchange earnings, and strengthening backward
linkages with the domestic economy; (c) alleviating scarcity of term financing;
and (d) improving the capacitv of institutions involved in financing,
regulating, and promoting free zones.
8.       Project Description.  The Project comprises:  (a) a credit program to
finance private free zone investment projects (US$49.6 million, or 97Z of total
project cost--estimated at US$51.0 million equivalent), primarily for the
expansion of existing zones, through the Investment Fund for Economic
Development (FIDE--the rediscount window of the Central Bank), for the
construction of factory space and supporting infrastructure; and (b) technical
assistance (US$1.4 million, or 3X of project costs). The Bank loan would
finance 61? of the total project cost (excluding technical assistance), or 1OOX
of foreign exchange costs. FIDE/Central Bank, as the implementing agency, would
finance 8X from its own resources, with the balance financed from FIs (about
5Z-10Z) and final beneficiaries (21Z-26Z). The FIs would bear the credit risk.
U.S. dollar-linked peso subloans to final beneficiaries would be at 105? of the
Bank's standard variable interest rate (which includes an estimated premium, to
partially compensate for the cross-currency risk to be carried by the Central
Bank), plus a spread of 1-1/2 percentage points for FIDE to cover administrative
costs, and up to 3-1/4 points for the FIs to cover administrative costs and



- 3 -
credit risks and provide a reasonable return. The technical assistance
component comprises: (i) US$0.5 million to strengthen FIDE's institutional
capacity in implementing the proposed operation; (ii) US$0.7 million to the
Investment Promotion Council (IPC) to support an initiative for promoting
linkages between free zone industries and domestic producers, assist the
Government in streamlining customs procedures to facilitate access to a
"temporary admissions" regime by exporters outside the free zones and carrying
out a study ior the rationalization of free zone development; and (iii) US$0.2
million to strengthen the National Council of Free Zones's (NCFZ) institutional
capacity in evaluating, regulating, and approving free zones. The Bank has
submitted a request, on behalf of the Government, to the Japanese Grant Facility
to finance the technical assistance component. Although this funding is highly
likely to materialize, other suitable sources have also been identified to
finance this component. A breakdown of the costs and financing are shown in
Schedule A, with procurement methods and disbursement amounts indicated in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Dominican Republic are given in Schedules C anu D,
respectively. A map showing the location of free zones in the country is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7519-DO, dated March 8, 1989, is also
attached.
9.       Aareed Actions.  The Central Bank and the Government have agreed on:
(a) onlending terms and conditions, spreads, and maturities; (b) the content of
participation agreements between the Central Bank/FIDE and the FIs, to specify,
inter alia, relending terms from Central Bank/FIDE to the FIs and to final
beneficiaries, appraisal guidelines, required documentation, and minimum
commitments; (c) counterpart contributions, including contributions by Central
Bank/FIDE and FIs and final beneficiaries; (d) a mid-loan review, to be carried
out by FIDE with Bank assistance, to review onlending terms and assess demand
for factory space and required adjustments in project implementation; (e) the
establishment of mechanisms in FIDE to follow up FIs portfolio performance;
(f) a commitment that Central Bank monetary restrictions would not affect FIDE's
foreign-funded operations; (g) a commitment that the Government would authorize
private investors to set up power plants in the free zones to generate and
provide electricity to free zone tenants; (h) timetables for implementing the
technical assistance component, including action plans resulting from the
studies in the Policy Statement; and (i) implementation agreements satisfactory
to the Bank to be signed between the Government and the Borrower, CPI, and NCFZ,
respectively, for the technical assistance component.
10.      Signing of the participation agreements, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Bank, of the Central Bank/FIDE with at least two
participating financial intermediaries; formal authorization by the Monetary
Board ("Junta Monetaria") of the onlending terms applicable to this project; and
effectiveness of a technical assistance grant agreement, and/or alternative
financing arrangements for the FIDE technical assistance (para. 8), are
conditions of effectiveness.
11.      Proiect Benefits.  The project's main economic benefits would be
employment creation, foreign exchange generation, regional development,
strengthening of backward linkages, and technology and skills transfer. It is
estimated that, under the proposed project, approximately 30,000 direct new jobs
would be generated by project completion, at a cost of between US$2,000-S3,000
per job. Additional jobs would be created by the strengthening of backward



- 4 -
linkages. Net foreign exchange earnings, estimated at over US$105.0 million in
mid-1988, are expected to reach US$145 million by project completion. Given
that the vast majority of employees (nearly 70Z of total) are women from low-
income groups, the proposed project would make an important contributio to
promoting women's participation in the development process and, in particular,
to reducing income disparities. As the proportion of new growth sectors (elec-
tronics, data processing, etc.) increases, it is expected that higher levels of
skills, income, and technology transfer would be generated and greater opportu-
nities would be created for locals to gain competence in production planning and
managerial fields. It is estimated that nearly 20Z of the micro-entrepreneurs
in the Santo Domingo area have acquired their skills in the IFZs. Finally, a
major contribution of the project wa ld be to strengthen institutions involved
in IFZ promotion and ensure a rational development of the free zones, including
introduction of economic rents for public sector zones.
12.      Proiect Risks.  Future demand could be affected by a serious downturn
in export markets and/or a deterioration in the country's macroeconomic condi-
tions. However, rental space would be constructed in a phased manner, to avoid
overbuilding, and the Government is expected to pursue sound macroeconomic poli-
cies, including a realistic exchange rate, given its commitment to an export-led
growth strategy. A mid-loan review would also be included, to ascertain demand
for space and required adjustments in project implementation.
13.      Some delays may also occur, given that the onlending arrangement of
peso subloans linked to the U.S. dollar are new and untried. However, this risk
is expected to diminish, given that: (a) both the FIs and final beneficiaries
seemed receptive to these terms in discussions during project appraisal; and
(b) the Central Bank and the Bank would closely review the onlending terms and
monitor developments every six months to take the necessary corrective measures.
14.      Unreliable electricity supply could pose some threat to foreign invest-
ors. However, the risk is likely to be substantially reduced, given that:
(a) firms can operate their own generators; (b) the Government, as stated in the
Policy Statement, would allow private investors to set up power plants in the
free zones to generate and provide electricity to the free zone tenants, while
an energy assessment study, to be carried out jointly with the UNDP and the Bank
beginning in March 1989, examines, inter alia, technical and financial operating
principles, to ensure implementation within an overall plan of the electric
power sector; and (c) an ongoing Bank-supported power project is expected to
upgrade the national power system.
15.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
