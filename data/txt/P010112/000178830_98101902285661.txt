INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$17.0 M
on standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Highway Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Review of the Economic
Situation of Nepal" (Report No. 1180-NEP) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 30, 1976. The principal findings of the report and the
developments since then are described below. Country data are shown in
Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income in 1975 was
estimated at $110. It has a population of 12.6 M, estimated to be growing at
around 2% per year. A large proportion, nearly 96% of the population, live in
rural areas. Health and education facilities are below the standards achieved
in the rest of South Asia. Nepal has an infant mortality rate of 200-300 per
thousand live births, an adult literacy rate of 14%, and a life expectancy at
birth of less than 44 years.
4.        The country has a difficult topography which severely limits the
area of arable land. Yet population density is now 450 per square kilometer
of arable land for all of Nepal and 930 persons in the Hill areas where 59% of
the people live. Already the results of pushing the area of cultivated land
beyond economically feasible and ecologically safe limits are being felt
in the Hill areas. Agricultural yields have declined, and soil erosion and
landslides have resulted in these areas. In the Terai plains where food-
grains, sugar and jute are grown, little room is left for extending the cul-
tivated areas. The traditional grain surpluses produced in the Terai are
declining as population has grown.
5.        The landlocked position of the country imposes an additional con-
straint. Far removed from sources of supplies of development goods and ac-
cess to export markets, development is more costly in Nepal than in many
other countries. Moreover, uncertainties of trade and transit over the sub-
continent complicates all economic decision-making, necessitates the holding
of relatively large foreign exchange reserves, and reduces the country's
attraction to private investors.
1/   Part I of this Report is substantially identical to Part I of the Report
and Recommendation of the President to the Executive Directors on a
proposed credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for a Nepal Industrial Develop-
ment Corporation Project (Report No. P-2050-NEP of April 19, 1977).



- 2 -
6.        The economy is predominantly agricultural.   About 68% of total
value added originates in agriculture, and over 90% of the labor force is
engaged in this activity. Agricultural products constitute more than 80% of
Nepal's exports. Ninety percent of these exports go to India. Rice, the main
export, accounts for about 60% of the total export value, while jute is the
second most important. Industrial value added amounts to only 4% of GDP and
Nepal, therefore, has to import almost all of its capital goods and a large
part of manufactured consumer goods.
7.        Between 1965 and 1975, Nepal's GDP growth rate averaged 2.4% per
year, marginally above the rate of population growth. Thus far, development
efforts have been mostly directed towards building an economic and adminis-
trative infrastructure. This was necessary since it was only in the early
fifties that the Government adopted economic and social development as major
objectives. The investments in infrastructure made since then were the
country's first steps toward modernization. They have not yet paid off,
however, in terms of accelerated economic growth.
8.        There have been no significant changes in the trend of economic
growth in 1975/76. The weather continues to be the main factor which deter-
mines yearly fluctuations in growth. Last year, weather conditions were
very favorable, the grain crop was large, and GDP grew by about 6%, well above
the average of 2.4% of the past decade. The balance of payments benefited
from temporarily larger rice exports, improved administrative control of rice
exports, increased incomes from tourism and increased inflows of remittances.
At the same time, imports of petroleum products,. fertilizer, cement, and iron
and steel declined, because these items had been overstocked in the previous
year. Foreign exchange reserves rose by 6% to $119.7 M, the equivalent of
about nine months of imports. Last year's higher GDP growth rate and the
improvement in the balance of payments were chiefly due to fortuitous factors
rather than to an improvement in the longer term growth trend of the economy.
9.        After substantial efforts in the last two decades to build up the
country's infrastructure, Nepal's planners believe that the time has come for
a shift in the development strategy. The leading principle of the current
five-year plan (1976-80) is that Nepal should aim its development efforts at
deriving increased production benefits from its past efforts to establish and
expand the infrastructure. The allocation of investment funds under the plan
shows a drop in the share of transport and communications (from 41% to 23% of
the total) and corresponding increases in the share of agriculture, industry
and the social sectors. Attention is to be concentrated on quick-yielding
projects, mostly in agriculture but with an appropriate component of viable
import substitution in industry.
10.       The most important opportunity to reap production gains lies in
agriculture. Present yields in the Terai, where most of the foodgrains
are cultivated, average only 1-1.3 tons per hectare. These yields can be
increased substantially by improvements in agricultural extension, by in-
creased application of inputs, and by minor irrigation. Similar improve-
ments could also be extended to sugar and jute cultivation which also have



- 3 -
very low yields. The wide difference between growing conditions in the
Hills and in the Terai offers scope for increased specialization and ex-
change of products. For the time being, the Hills must continue to empha-
size food production in view of the serious food deficits in the area.
However, in the long run, the Hills area is comparatively well-suited to
produce cash crops -- fruits, spices, vegetables, potatoes and natural silk,
etc. On a limited scale these items are already being produced. Achieve-
ment of production gains will also require the strengthening of marketing
and credit institutions. Some progress in institution-building has already
been made in recent years, as evidenced by the establishment of the Agricul-
tural Development Bank and the Agricultural Projects Services Center.
11.       Although agriculture must occupy a predominant position in Nepal's
development strategy, opportunities also exist in other directly productive
sectors, mainly industry and tourism, and these should be vigorously pursued.
The contribution of modern industry to GDP is still small, about 4%, but it
has been growing. Most of the sector consists of the processing of agricul-
tural products such as rice, wheat, vegetable oil, sugar and jute. The re-
mainder is made up of factories producing simple consumer goods, wood products,
bricks, tiles and cement. The small size of the market, lack of raw materials,
competition from Indian products, and the shortage of domestic entrepreneurs
and trained workers will continue to be limiting factors for some time. Modern
industry, nevertheless, has its role in Nepal's future development. The scope
for processing of agricultural products for domestic use and export should
increase with the intended diversification of agriculture. Further growth of
the economy will also present scope for more import substitution.
12.       Tourism has grown at 11.5% per year over the last five years;
tourist arrivals at present are estimated to be above 85,000. Foreign ex-
change earnings from this source are equivalent to those from merchandise
exports. In line with a master plan for the sector, prepared with German
assistance, a number of projects are to be undertaken to develop hill stations,
observation points, and national parks as well as to restore ancient temples,
and to strengthen the hotel school. While small in size, these projects are
important for the long-term development of tourism.
13.       On the basis of these and other considerations, it appears that
there is sufficient scope for development of the directly-productive sectors
to allow a modest acceleration of GDP growth to perhaps 3.5% a year during
the last years of the decade and 4-5% in the 1980s. The proposed develop-
ment strategy appears to be appropriate to Nepal's circumstances. The past
ratio of investment (8.5-10.5% of GDP) to growth (2% of GDP) appears to be
very high and, in view of the scarcity of resources in Nepal, the planners
are right in looking for opportunities for more rapid growth without neglect-
ing the need for completion of the basic infrastructure.
14.       Nepal has made commendable efforts to mobilize domestic resources
for development. In the last five years, real revenue growth has averaged over
7% per year, much higher than the growth rate of GDP, and budgetary savings



-4-
were maintained at 40% of revenue, slightly over 2% of GDP. This result was
obtained in the face of serious difficulties. On the revenue side, Nepal
suffers from the constraints of extreme poverty and low degree of monetiza-
tion of the economy. The open border with India, moreover, makes it difficult
to control foreign trade and to levy the trade taxes which play such a large
role in the tax system of most developing countries. On the current expendi-
tures side, the Government has to cope with rising claims for maintenance of
infrastructure and the need to raise government salaries from levels which
are low even by the standards of a poor country.
15.       In view of the pressures to increase current expenditures, all that
can be realistically expected in the next few years is that the Government
maintains its savings rate at 2% of GDP. Only when economic growth starts
to accelerate significantly in the 1980s will there be prospects for an in-
crease in this rate. Given the constraints on mobilizing domestic resources,
which will prevail even with continued satisfactory fiscal management,
foreign aid will remain a decisive factor in Nepal's economic develop-
ment. In fact, since public savings are likely to increase less rapidly than
public investment during the period of the current five-year plan, aid will
become, at least temporarily, more important. In view of this scarcity of
public savings, aid will have to cover not only the foreign exchange cost of
projects, but, as a rule, also at least part of local cost. Total aid dis-
bursements during 1971-75 (the previous five-year plan) averaged $33 M a year
in constant (1974/75) prices and covered 45% of public investment. During
1976-80 (the present five-year plan), this proportion would have to rise to
57% if public investment is not to be held back by lack of financial resources.
Under these circumstances, disbursements in real terms would have to rise by
around 12.5% per year to average about $60 M in constant (1974/75) prices and
about $90 M in current prices.
16.       The international community has thus far been very responsive to
these aid needs of Nepal. Shortage of finance has not yet been a bottleneck
and prospects are that aid flows of the required magnitude will continue
to be available. The real factor determining Nepal's development pace will
remain the growth of absorptive capacity, and it is this factor which will
determine the actual level of aid disbursements. The essential questions
regarding aid to Nepal are, therefore, what donors should do to attune their
aid programs to Nepal's development priorities and what they can do to help
raise absorptive capacity.
17.       These questions, obviously requiring consultations between the Nepal
Government and the donors, provide the focus for the Nepal Aid Coordination
Group which had its first meeting in Tokyo last December. On the basis of
sector and project documentation prepared by the Government, the meeting
reviewed the type of projects needed to support the Government's development
strategy and the type of technical assistance programs needed to build up
absorptive capacity. Sustained attention to these matters in the framework of



the Group is expected to lead to improvements in the composition of aid and to
speed up the still very slow rate of disbursement of aid funds.
18.       As of December 31, 1976, official foreign debt amounted to $236 M,
of which 33% was to IDA.   Of the $236 M, $192 M remained undisbursed.    This
low utilization is largely due to the fact that the bulk of foreign loans has
been contracted since 1970.   Debt service was about $1.5 M in 1975 or equiva-
lent to about 2% of exports of goods and services.    Most external loans will
probably continue to be on concessionary terms, which is highly desirable in
view of Nepal's poverty and limited export prospects. In view of the accele-
rated development efforts, external public debt is expected to rise and, based
on the trend in recent years, may reach about $350 M by 1980, of which approxi-
mately 50% could be in IDA credits. The total debt service ratio by 1980 is,
however, projected to remain below 10%. Debt service to the Bank Group alone
would be less than 2% of exports of goods and services.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
19.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 M equivalent was
made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed by credits
for highways ($2.5 M), tourism ($3.2 M), irrigation ($6.0 M), a second telecom-
munications project ($5.5 M), a water supply and sewerage project ($11.8 M),
a settlement project ($6.0 M), a power project ($26.0 M) and a rural develop-
ment project ($8.0 M). Approved in FY77 were a groundwater project ($9.0 M),
a technical assistance project ($3.0 M), a second water supply and sewerage
project ($8.0 M), and a Nepal Industrial Development Corporation Project
($4.0 M). The proposed credit would bring the total amount of IDA assistance
to Nepal to $111.7 M equivalent, net of cancellations. No Bank loans have been
made to Nepal. IFC made its first investment in Nepal ($3.2 M) in a hotel
project in Kathmandu in FY75. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank Group operations as of May 31, 1977, and notes on the execution of
ongoing IDA projects. It shows certain delays in the implementation of these
projects, particularly during the initial periods. These delays have been
largely due to Nepal's limited technical and managerial capabilities. In order
to assist Nepal in coping with this constraint, considerable technical assist-
ance is being given by Bank Group staff, including our Resident Mission in
Kathmandu. As a result, improvement in the rate of disbursements is being
realized. During the first ten months of FY77, $4.9 M were disbursed compared
to $6.9 M disbursed during the entire previous six years. There is, however,
substantial scope for further improvement.
20.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level com-
pared to the country's need for, and total receipts of, external assistance.
The international community has persistently shown considerable interest in
Nepal's economic development and, to date, shortage of funds has not been a
bottleneck. The main constraint on the utilization of increased aid has been



- 6 -
Nepal's limited absorptive capacity, affecting the pace of project preparation
and implementation. The Bank has agreed to assist the Government in project
preparation through the technical assistance credit and by acting as Executing
Agency for a number of technical assistance projects in the current UNDP
Five-Year Program. The Bank Group has also addressed the problem of absorptive
capacity through its role in organizing the Aid Coordination Group for Nepal
(para 17).
21.       The Bank Group's current strategy places major emphasis upon the
directly-productive sectors (particularly agriculture) and the development of
complementary infrastructure, including feeder roads (particularly connecting
the Hills to the Terai), communications and hydroelectric power. Preparation
of projects in irrigation, telecommunications, rural development and horti-
culture is underway.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Overview
22.       Historically, transport in Nepal has been over trails by means of
porters and, to a smaller extent, by pack animals. These means are still of
great importance, especially in the Hills. However, with the Government's
emphasis on infrastructure since the 1950's, a road network has begun to
emerge, and numerous airports and landing fields have been built. Railroads,
ropeways and waterways play a minor role in Nepal's transport system.
23.       In the past, transport demand has been local in nature, between
nearby villages and rural areas in the Hills. Since the 1950's, with the
eradication of malaria in the Terai and increased trade with India, transport
demand has been largely concentrated in a north-south direction. Grains and
manufactured goods move in a northern direction into the Hills, while herbs
and spices come south. More recently, with the development of the East-West
highway system, lateral transport demand has started to develop along the
Terai.
24.       All modern modes of transport are regulated and/or operated by the
Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MWT). While there is no separate
entity within the MWT which specifically coordinates the various modes, problems
of inter-modal competition are minimal. Some assistance is provided in trans-
port planning by a transport economist financed by the United Nations Develop-
ment Program (UNDP). Also, the Center for Economic Development and Adminis-
tration is now carrying out a study to evaluate the relative merits of invest-
ment in various modes of transport, particularly in the Hills. Investment
plans are reviewed by the National Planning Commission and final approval
for implementation rests with the Ministry of Finance.



- 7 -
25.       Nepal's investment strategy in transport has been generally based on
a 1965 survey organized and financed by IDA which concluded that roads should
be the prime mode. Most development expenditures have been financed by exter-
nal agencies, primarily by Mainland China, India, U.S.S.R., U.K., U.S., and,
more recently, Switzerland and the Asian Development Bank. Although external
assistance has been essential for the development of infrastructure, the
preference by donors for major self-contained projects, usually designed
and supervised by them, has sometimes made it difficult to plan and execute
investment plans in optimal fashion.
B. Highways
26.       Although road transport is the dominant modern mode of transpor-
tation, Nepal still has one of the smallest road networks, either in relation to
surface area or to population, of any country in the world. Road construction
outside the Kathmandu Valley was only started in 1953. At present, the total
road network is about 4,200 km of which about 1,600 km are paved. The two
main national roads are: (i) the north-south road from the Indian border at
Birganj to Kathmandu and then to the Mainland Chinese (Tibet) border; and (ii)
the East-West Highway in the Terai which, when completed (about 1985), will
traverse the length of the country. By 1982, the total road network is ex-
pected to be about 5,800 km (about a 40% increase over the present system).
27.       Over the last five years, the vehicle fleet has grown at an average
rate of 9% per annum, and, in 1976, there were 15,500 registered vehicles
(about 35% were trucks and buses). However, with no information on scrapping,
only about two-thirds of these vehicles are estimated to be in operation.
Traffic over the road system is light, with the exception of the Kathmandu
Valley. In general, traffic seems to be growing at about 5% per annum, al-
though the growth rates vary considerably throughout the system, especially
in the rural areas.
28.       Extremes in topographic and climatic conditions are the major obsta-
cle to reliable and inexpensive road transport in Nepal. The rugged, moun-
tainous terrain and the large number of rivers and streams, together with heavy
monsoon rains, create great difficulty in the construction of roads, and make
Nepal's road network one of the most difficult in the world to maintain. Land-
slides are a constant threat within the mountainous regions, while in the Terai,
flooding and washouts are a major problem.
29.       During the current Five-Year Plan (1976-80), the Government is
aiming at the completion of about 1,200 km of roads, including continued
construction of the East-West Highway. The Government recognizes that these
roads are being constructed in advance of heavy traffic, but regards the
network currently planned as the minimum required for integrating the country,
improving access to the Hills, and stimulating overall economic development.
At the same time, the Government realizes that, as the network increases,



- 8 -
greater emphasis will have to be given to road maintenance. In addition to
construction of road and trail suspension bridges, the IDA Highway I project
(Cr. 223-NEP) included support for a four-year road maintenance program com-
prised of equipment, workshops, spare parts, and a commitment by the Govern-
ment to provide adequate funding for recurrent costs and further purchases
of equipment and spare parts. Although there were delays in initiating the
project implementation, followed by further delays due to shortages of
materials (notably cement), transportation difficulties in the Hills, and
contractual difficulties due to price increases, the general objectives of
the project have been realized. Some improvements in road maintenance took
place, but these were not sufficient largely because funds were not adequate.
In 1976, only about NRs 22.0 M (US$1.8 M equivalent), or about 11% of the
Roads Department's total expenditure (NRs 196 M including NRs 121 M from
external sources), was spent on road maintenance. The Government is now
taking steps to overcome this situation, including a near doubling of road
maintenance funds budgeted for 1977 and the reintroduction of an equipment
rental system with updated charges reflecting the full cost of purchasing
and maintaining road maintenance equipment.
30.       The Government also realizes that, as the basic network nears
completion, increased emphasis and expenditures will be required for the
construction of feeder roads in support of the directly-productive sectors,
primarily agriculture. However, past investment decisions will limit the
Government's flexibility in budget allocations for some years. The recently-
formed Aid Coordination Group is prepared to assist the Government in the
planning and programming of such investment decisions.
31.       The Roads Department (headed by a Chief Engineer) is responsible for
the design, construction, maintenance, and administration for all national
roads. The extension of the road system in recent years, and the associated
maintenance workload, has taxed the Department's operational capacity and
highlighted deficiencies in institutional arrangements, maintenance and repair
of road equipment, and professional and technical skills. In recognition of
these limitations, and as a result of the UNDP-financed institutional improve-
ment study included under IDA's Highways I project, the Department is being
decentralized in accordance with a phased expansion plan over the next five
years. Four regional offices are being set up which will eventually be
self-contained with respect to maintenance and all but major construction
projects. At headquarters in Kathmandu, the Department will continue to
administer major works and maintain technical and administrative backup
services.
32.       To assist in carrying out the Roads Department's program, the
Government is keen to promote the development of the local contracting
industry. At present, there are about 300 contractors in Nepal, but only
5-10 are medium-sized firms with the largest being the Government-owned
National Construction Corporation of Nepal. Several foreign contractors
are active on externally-financed projects. Small contractor's operations
are labor-intensive, while the larger contractors use a blend of labor
and equipment. Constraints to the development of the industry are the lack
of access to credit, shortage of skilled labor, lack of equipment, and, until
recently, one-sided contract conditions favoring the Government. A study



of the industry is being carried out by Nepal's Center for Economic Develop-
ment and Administration, but it is concentrating only on specific road proj-
ects. At the Government's request, an IDA-financed specialist will shortly
begin to assist the Center in broadening the scope of the study to take into
account all types of construction and to address the full range of constraints.
Also, the U.K. is financing a construction unit to train staff in feeder road
construction techniques, with emphasis on on-the-job training and self-help
projects.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The feeder road component of the proposed project was identified in
late 1973 on the basis of a UNDP-financed road feasibility study carried out
during 1971-1973 by COALMA (Italian consultants). After delays in engaging
consultants for further feasibility studies and detailed engineering, the
project preparation work, undertaken by N.D. Lea and Associates (Canadian
consultants), began in January 1976. The Thankot-Naubise Road upgrading
component was identified by the Government in March 1976. The project prep-
aration work was carried out by the Government's Roads Department with IDA
assistance in early 1977, and the detailed engineering is well underway (com-
pletion expected in late 1977). The road maintenance component was first
discussed in 1973 and was prepared by the Roads Department, with IDA assist-
ance. At the request of the Government, the project was appraised in November
1976. A report entitled "Nepal - Appraisal of a Second Highway Project (No.
1439a-NEP)" is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C., during May 3-4, 1977. The Gov-
ernment was represented by a team led by Dr. D.R. Panday, Additional Secretary,
Ministry of Finance.
A. Project Description
34.       The proposed project would provide equipment for the construction
of a 50-km feeder road, together with improvements to connecting local roads.
It would also provide for the upgrading, on the existing alignment, of the
mountainous Thankot-Naubise section (17.5 km) of the main Kathmandu-Indian
border road. In addition, it would provide equipment, spare parts, and
workshop facilities and equipment in support of a nationwide Five-Year Road
Maintenance Program (FY1978-1982). Consultants' services would be included
for: (i) the feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the feeder road,
as well as assistance in construction supervision; (ii) feasibility studies
for the remaining 190 km of the East-West Highway; and (iii) assistance in
technical investigations. Finally, the project would provide for the training
of construction and maintenance equipment mechanics.
Feeder Road Construction
35.       The feeder road (50 km), to be constructed in the Far-Western Re-
gion, would improve the link from the East-West Highway in the Terai to the



- 10 -
Dang Valley. Within the Valley, the proposed road would link the main trading
town of Ghorai to the new government administrative (Zonal) headquarters at
Tulsipur. The project would also include culverting and other minor improve-
ments to numerous local roads and tracks. While construction would be pri-
marily labor-intensive, some construction equipment would be provided under
the project for heavy work. The equipment would be rented (at commercial
rates) or sold to contractors working on the feeder road either outright or
on a hire/purchase basis. The Government would maintain its equipment in
good operating condition (Section 3.07(i) of the Development Credit Agreement).
On completion of the construction, the rented equipment may be sold to con-
tractors, and the workshop would be used to house a maintenance unit for the
feeder and other roads in the area. For equipment not sold, the Government
would arrange for the equipment to be made available to contractors on other
road works or included in the Department's road maintenance fleet (Section
3.07(ii) of the Development Credit Agreement). To avoid difficulties for the
contractors, the Government would not charge a road cess on the feeder road
during the construction period (Section 4.05(i) of the Development Credit
Agreement).
Main Road Upgrading (Thankot-Naubise)
36.       The 17.5 km section of the main road between Kathmandu and the
Indian border is located between Thankot in the Kathmandu Valley and Naubise,
the junction with the main road to Pokhara. This is the most heavily-used
road in Nepal, presently serving about 300 vehicles per day (about 80% trucks
and buses). Upon completion of the upgrading in 1980, the traffic is expected
to increase to about 375 vehicles per day. The present alignment is tortuous,
traversing a mountain pass subject to landslides which, during the rainy
season, often block the road for several days. The road surface is in poor
condition with frequent undulations and jagged edges, and many sections have
failed completely. Also, side drainage is poor and several bridges need to
be replaced. Upgrading work would comprise pavement widening (from 3.5 to
6.5 meters), minor realignments, drainage improvements, and landslide pro-
tection. No disbursements would be made until the Association approves the
detailed engineering, contract drawings, specifications, construction program
and arrangements for construction supervision (Schedule 1, para 4(ii) of the
Development Credit Agreement).
Five-Year Road Maintenance Program (1978-1982)
37.       The Five-Year Road Maintenance Program, prepared by the Roads De-
partment in late 1976, is aimed at achieving adequate road maintenance on
the 2,700 km of main roads within the country's existing network (4,200 km)
and the expected network increase of 1,600 km during the period. While the
Program is under continuous review by the Department, a technical assistance
team would provide a detailed review and make recommendations for improve-
ments and assist in its implementation.   The services would include, inter
alia, technical assistance in planning, programming and budgeting during
the initial critical stages of the Department's decentralization program,
project preparation procedures. reevaluation of rcad maintenance equipment
and materials, spare parts and tools, facilities, and man-power requirements
and other recurrent costs, training of road overseer-s aad other technical



- 11 -
staff, and assessing additional staffing and training needs. The Government
would employ such a technical assistance team on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Association (Section 3.02(b) of the Development Credit Agree-
ment), and arrangements are nearly completed for the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) to finance the team (four specialists for an initial
period of 18 months each beginning September 1977). For mechanics' training,
the International Labor Organization (ILO) has agreed, at the Government's
request, to assist in the preparation and execution of a program which the
Association considers suitable.
38.       As presently conceived, the Program covers the Department's esti-
mated needs for equipment and materials, spare parts and tools, workshops (in
the Eastern and Western Regions), including recurrent costs, to maintain the
country's main roads. The total expenditure is estimated at NRs 330 M, in-
cluding NRs 130 M in capital costs and NRs 200 M in recurrent costs. The pro-
posed credit would finance about 67% of the capital expenditures (NRs 89 M).
The Government would require the technical assistance team to review the
Program in detail and make its recommendations by March 31, 1978 (Section
3.03(i) of the Development Credit Agreement). Also, the Government would,
with respect to the Program, review and exchange views with the Association
regarding the team's findings and major recommendations (Section 3.03(ii) and
Section 3.03 (iii) of the Development Credit Agreement) and carry out recom-
mendations mutually-agreed with the Association (Section 3.03(iv) of the De-
velopment Credit Agreement). In addition, the Government would release funds
required for the Program in a timely fashion, including adequate funds for the
procurement and maintenance of road maintenance equipment (Section 3.03(v) of
the Development Credit Agreement). The funds required are in keeping with the
amounts the Government is presently allocating for this purpose.
Consultants' Services
39.       The Road Department's consultants (N.D. Lea and Associates, Canada)
prepared the feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the feeder road
during 1976 (about 44 actual man-months). Prior to the award of any construc-
tion contracts, the Government would engage an engineer to assist with con-
struction supervision having qualifications and experience acceptable to the
Association, and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association (Section
3.02(a) of the Development Credit Agreement). The Government has requested
that N.D. Lea and Associates provide an engineer to perform this function,
as well as to train on-site Department staff and local contractors in road
construction techniques (estimated at 38 man-months).
40.       The consultants' services also include the preparation of a four-
month pre-feasibility study for the remaining unbuilt section of the East-West
Highway (190 km) in the Far-Western Region (estimated at 18 man-months). If
the study (expected to be completed by January 1978) indicates that further
project preparation work is justified, funds provided under the project would
be used for this purpose (about 32 man-months). These studies are intended to
provide the basis for the Government to request external financing for con-
struction. To carry out the studies, the Government would engage consultants
with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Association, and on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Association (Section 3.02(a) of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).



- 12 -
41.       In addition, the consultants' services to be financed under the
proposed credit include investigations of pavement and slope stability related
to the improvement of a mountainous Thankot-Naubise section of the main
Kathmandu-Indian border road, that were carried out during 1976 (4 actual
man-months).
Mechanics' Training
42.       The mechanics' training program, to be prepared and executed by
the Government with ILO assistance, would (i) upgrade the Road Department's
staff of mechanics and recruits, and (ii) train school-leavers over a three-
year period. Two trainers would be provided for an initial period of three
years to assist the Engineering Institute of Nepal in conducting the program.
The Government would submit the proposed program to the Association for
approval by December 31, 1977 (Section 3.09(i) of the Development Credit
Agreement).
B. Prolect Execution
43.       The Roads Department would be responsible for the overall execution
of the project. With the equipment, other capital inputs, technical assist-
ance, and training to be provided under the project, the Department is capable
of carrying out this responsibility. The Government would improve the col-
lection of vehicle registration data so that a more accurate estimate of the
running fleet is available (Section 4.02(b) of the Development Credit Agree-
ment). The Government would also strengthen the Planning Branch of the Roads
Department, in order to upgrade its capability to undertake appropriate
economic and technical analyses for all major investments in the highway
sector (Section 4.06 of the Development Credit Agreement). Recognizing the
inefficiencies in levying a road cess (i.e. high administrative costs and
disruption in traffic flow), the Government would arrange for a study to
investigate, by June 30, 1978, under terms of reference approved by the
Association, practical methods of raising revenues in the transport sector
alternative to the road cess, and implement recommendations mutually-agreed
with the Association (Sections 4.05(ii) and 4.05 (iii) of the Development
Credit Agreement).
44.       For the feeder road construction, technical assistance would be
provided by the Canadian consultants, N.D. Lea and Associates. For the
Thankot-Naubise road upgrading, the Government agrees that a consultant for
construction supervision is required and arrangements for securing financing
for the consultant are underway. For the Five-Year Road Maintenance Program,
the Department would be assisted by the CIDA-financed team (para 37).
45.       In addition to the ILO-assisted mechanics' training program (para
42), the Department would undertake training of its other staff, and the
Government would, by July 31, 1978, submit a Departmental training program
to the Association for approval (Section 3.09(ii) of the Development Credit
Agreement).

C. Project Costs and Financing
46.       The total project costs are estimated at US$20.0 M equivalent, in-
cluding about US$5.1 M equivalent in physical and price contingencies. The
proposed credit of US$17.0 M equivalent would finance about 87% of the proj-
ect costs (net of taxes), including foreign exchange costs of US$14.3 M equiv-
alent and local costs of US$2.7 M equivalent. Local cost financing is justi-
fied for the reasons discussed in para 15. Retroactive financing up to US$0.4
M is included for feeder road construction equipment. In addition, retro-
active financing up to US$0.5 M is included for expenditures already incurred
for consultants' services (paras 39 and 41). The Government's contribution
to the financing would amount to US$2.6 M equivalent (net of about US$0.4 M
equivalent in taxes and duties), or about 13% of net project cost. The cost
estimates for equipment for road construction, maintenance and workshops are
based on recent preliminary quotations by manufacturers. The cost estimates
for the feeder road contruction are based upon the consultants' detailed
engineering and the costs of recent similar works in the area. Actual costs
are included for the feeder road feasibility studies and detailed engineering,
whereas the costs for construction supervision are based on detailed time
schedules and expected foreign and local staffing rates. For the Thankot-
Naubise road upgrading, the cost estimates are based upon the Roads Depart-
ment's preliminary engineering (to be updated upon completion of the detailed
engineering) and the costs of recent similar works nearby. The cost of the
East-West Highway studies are based on costs under similar conditions else-
where in Nepal. The major elements included in the cost estimate are feeder
road construction including equipment (US$4.0 M); main road upgrading (US$1.5
M); road maintenance equipment, spare parts and workshops and tools (US$7.1 M);
consultants' services, at an average cost of US$75,000 per expatriate man-year,
including a billing rate of US$4,900 per man-month (US$1.5 M); and mechanics'
training (US$0.8 M). Physical contingencies are estimated at US$1.9 M (20%
for upgrading the Thankot-Naubise road and 10% for other civil works, road
construction and maintenance equipment and consulting services). Price con-
tingencies are estimated at US$3.2 M (12% and 8% annually, respectively, for
civil works and for road construction and maintenance equipment and consulting
services).
D. Procurement and Disbursement
47.       The road construction and maintenance equipment, spare parts, and
workshop machinery and tools would be procured under international competitive
bidding (ICB), while contracts for the construction of the workshops would be
awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB). Feeder road con-
struction would be divided into about ten contracts, ranging between US$100,000-
US$300,000 equivalent, with prequalified contractors able to bid on one con-
tract or any combination. The contracts for the Thankot-Naubise road upgrad-
ing would be divided and awarded in a similar manner. Prequalification would
be open to local and foreign contractors. All procurement would be in
accordance with the Association's "Guidelines".



- 14 -
48.       The Department's conditions of contract have been recently revised
to put contractors and construction agencies of the Government on an equitable
footing, including the introduction of procedures for arbitration and provi-
sions for inflation adjustments. Under the project, the Government would take
additional steps to assist the local contracting industry, e.g. (i) contractors
awarded contracts would receive a 15% cash advance against a suitable guarantee;
(ii) contractors would have options concerning the use of equipment, including
providing their own equipment, hiring it from the Department, or using the cash
advance to purchase equipment with import assistance from the Government; and
(iii) technical assistance in road construction techniques would be made
available to contractors by N.D. Lea and Associates' construction supervision
advisor.
49.       To take advantage of the earliest construction season and overcome
prolonged delivery schedules, bids for the feeder road construction equipment
were invited in January 1977 in accordance with IDA guidelines, and are now
being awarded for delivery from about end-1977. Bids for the feeder road
construction were called in May 1977 and are expected to be awarded shortly
after credit effectiveness in time for construction to begin at the end of the
monsoon (November 1977). Disbursements are based on a 4-1/2-year construction
period. Bids for the Thankot-Naubise road upgrading would be invited in late
1977 with a construction period of 24 months. Bids for the first of two
groups of road maintenance equipment and spare parts would be invited in
August 1977 in accordance with IDA guidelines, with delivery expected about
one year later. Bids for workshop construction would be invited about November
1977, after the layouts have been reviewed by the CIDA-financed team. The
CIDA-financed team would begin work in September 1977 for an initial period of
18 months. The team's services are expected to be extended to cover satisfac-
tory implementation of the Five-Year Road Maintenance Program. The Government
and the Association have reached an understanding on the project implementation
schedule and reporting requirements.
50.       Disbursements from the proposed credit would be made for:    (i) 100%
of the foreign expenditures for imported road construction and maintenance
equipment; (ii) 75% of the civil works for the feeder road construction (ex-
cluding the purchase of contractor rental equipment), Thankot-Naubise road
upgrading, and the road maintenance workshops; (iii) 100% of the costs for
consulting services; and (iv) 100% of the foreign expenditures for mechanics'
training.
E. Project Benefits and Risks
51.       The main purpose of the project is to assist the Government in de-
veloping the institutional capability within the Roads Department for expand-
ing and maintaining the road network so as to provide the basis for economic
development to take place. Specifically, feeder road construction and im-
provements provide the reliable access required for stimulating agricultural
production and other directly-productive activities. Main road upgrading
provides more dependable traffic flow on the only road connection between



- 15 -
Kathmandu and the Indian border, as well as the eastern and western parts of
the country. Improved road maintenance helps to preserve the substantial
investments Nepal has recently put into the network, as well as to lower user
costs. The weighted-average economic rate of return (ER) for the entire proj-
ect is estimated at 28%. Based upon experiences with IDA's Highway I project,
the risks include administrative delays in procurement and extended construc-
tion time due to inclement weather and inefficiencies caused by remoteness
of area. The possible effect of these risks on construction and maintenance
costs, as well as lower growth in traffic have been taken into account in the
preparation of this second project and are considered to be within reasonable
limits.
52.       The feeder road component will provide nearly all-weather and year-
round access to and within the Dang Valley. Wet season access (June-October)
is not possible at present because the numerous river crossings become flooded
and the soils become soft and slippery, particularly in the mountain sections.
About 85% of the benefits from the component would result from increased agri-
cultural production, while the remainder would result from lower user cost
savings. With the improved access, agricultural production is forecast to
increase due to reduced transport costs for farm inputs and the marketing of
farm products, and the availability of increased agricultural extension ser-
vices. Recently, in anticipation of the construction of the feeder road
component, the Government and USAID agreed to include the Dang Valley in the
ongoing USAID-sponsored Basic Cereals Program which promotes agricultural
research, development and extension of rice and other foodgrains. Even with
this minimum package of farm inputs and agricultural services, the ER for the
component is estimated at 30%. If construction costs (about 25% of project
cost) were to be 20% higher and benefits from agricultural production 20%
lower than assumed in these calculations, the ER would be about 24%. In
addition to the Basic Cereals Program, the Government and USAID are presently
preparing a comprehensive regional development project which would include
the Dang Valley, as well as surrounding districts. Based on these efforts,
the Government will endeavor to prepare a development program for the Dang
Valley before 1979, and begin implementation of the program before 1980 to
coincide with the completion of the project road.
53.       The main benefits from upgrading the Thankot-Naubise road would
arise from reductions in user costs and avoidance of emergency maintenance and
reconstruction costs and time losses due to landslides. With the improvement,
the average annual expenditure for emergency maintenance and reconstruction
costs is expected to be reduced from about NRs 1.2 M to about NRs 0.2 M.
Other benefits would arise from the improvement of the pavement since the
structural strength of the existing pavement is inadequate and resurfacing is
needed about every two to three years rather than the normal six-year cycle.
Assuming an annual traffic growth of 5% for the first 10 years following the
upgrading, the ER is estimated at 14%. If the construction costs (about 10%
of project cost) were to be 20% higher and the benefits 20% lower, the ER
would be about 8%.
54.       Benefits from the road maintenance component would constitute savings
from (i) deferment of future reconstruction costs; (ii) reduced future mainte-
nance costs; and (iii) lower user costs (vehicle operating and time costs).



- 16 -
Using only the savings in user costs as a convenient and conservative proxy of
the benefits, and projecting a 9% growth rate in total annual vehicle-km, the
ER over an eight-year period is estimated at 30%. Even if maintenance costs
(about 40% of project cost) were 20% higher and benefits 20% lower than assumed
in these calculations, the ER is estimated at 12%, and the component would
merit high priority.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
56.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 223 - Highway Project US$2.5 million Credit of December 21.
1970; Effective Date: February 3, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981 - Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Initially, project implementation was delayed mainly due to land
acquisition difficulties and a national shortage of cement and fuel. With
a delay of about eighteen months, the last of the five project road bridges
and the remainng two of the five porter suspension bridges were opened in
1976. All project road maintenance equipment has been received and i8 now
part of the Road Department fleet. Equipment workshop construction was
slowed due to contractural difficulties stemming from price escalation, but
the workshop construction is now almost completed. Although the total proj-
ect cost is approxiately 11% above appraisal estimate the economic rate
of return is not affected due to the effect of general inflation on the
benefits. The project is virtually complete, with remaining disbursements
to be made by the closing date.
Credit No. 291 - Tourism Project US$3.2 million Credit (Net of Cancellation
of March 22, 1972; Effective Date: November 9, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975; Revised Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Due to delays in appointing qualified architectural, engineering
and project management consultants, and repeated changes in scope proposed
by the sponsors of the sub-projects, the project is two years behind schedule.
Construction of the Yak and Yeti sub-project is underway and is expected to be
completed by July 1977. On the other hand, it was not possible to reach a
firm agreement with the sponsors on an appropriate revision of the Annapurna
sub-project, and $1.0 million of the Credit was cancelled from the original
allocation ($2.88 million) for that sub-project. The remaining $1.88 million
will meet increased costs of the Yak and Yeti sub-project and finance feasi-
bility studies for further tourism facilities outside the Kathmandu Valley.
Consultants have been engaged and the feasibility studies are under way.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken. They should
be used in this sense it the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weakness in project
execution.

Credit No. 373 - Birganj Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the project is progressing satisfactorily after
initial delays in appointing engineering consultants, in field surveys and in
procurement. About one-third of the credit amount has been disbursed. Civil
works are being completed in three irrigation blocks and contracts have been
awarded for another three (out of the original total of twelve). Construction
of tubewells is 70% completed in the groundwater areas. Due to a 50% cost
overrun, a reduction in the project area is being considered. The project
remains viable as a result of increases in agricultural product prices,
and higher-than-expected intensity of cultivation. The project should be
completed by mid-1978.
Credit No. 397 - Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior manage-
ment, and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been de'ays in the
procurement process and the project is about two years behind schedule. Good
progress is now being made with the assistance of experts and consultants pro-
vided by the United Kingdom and a new manager has been appointed. The project
is now proceeding satisfactorily and present estimates are for completion by
early 1980, six to twelve months behind schedule.
Credit No. 470 - Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$11.8 million Credit of
May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978; Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Design work is complete and most of the major contracts have now
been let. Project implementation is about one year behind schedule, because
of delays in letting the contracts. A management team of four experts pro-
vided by the United Kingdom has been assisting the Water Supply and Sewerage
Board. Work is now progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 505 - Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14, 1974;
Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing Date: July 15,
1982
Project implamentation is two years behind the original schedule
but indications are that it is being accelerated. Twenty-three winch lorries
have been procured and operators are being trained in their use. Work has
also begun on clearing the timber from projected settlement areas. However,
the project is not yet free of problems, particularly in management and plan-
ning by concerned agencies, and intensive supervision of the project is con-
tinuing. In addition, changes in the Government's land use policy have led to
requests, which are now under consideration, to restructure the project by
reducing its size possibly by at 0   4!%.

Credit No. 600 - Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project US$26.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date: May 18, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
Bids for the major civil works have been received and are being
evaluated. Bids for plant and equipment are expected to be received in July
and contracts to be awarded around the end of August 1977. Preliminary
estimates indicate that cost overruns of 60% may materialize and sources of
supplementary funds are being explored. A supervision mission visited Nepal
in March, 1977, to assist the Government in reviewing the civil works bid
evaluation report, and another is scheduled for July.
Credit No. 617 - Rural Development Project US$8.0 million Credit of
April 30, 1976; Effective Date: July 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Progress to date has been most satisfactory, with almost all planned
project actions being implemented ahead of schedule. Inter-ministerial coopera-
tion is good and at the district level, sound and practical development plans
have been produced which are fully supported and understood by project farmers.
Adequate financing to carry out project proposals has been made available in
the budget by the Government; sites and plans for most district construction
projects have been completed and construction is expected to begin in April;
the seed exchange program has begun a year early; and five water supply
schemes are expected to be completed by end-July. Shortage of middle-level
staff in the project area for construction supervision and agricultural
extension may hinder project implementation in the coming year. However,
arrangements have been made for more efficient deployment of existing staff
and for special training of agricultural assistants resident in the project
area to meet project needs. Under the associated Bank executed UNDP technical
assistance project, the assistant to the Project Coordinator, the Irrigation
Advisor, and the advisor to the Project Evaluation Unit have been appointed.
Credit No. 654 - Bhairawa - Lumbini Groundwater Project US$9.0 million
Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: November 9, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project authorities have been established, the main consulting
firm has been appointed and have recently started their work, and arrangements
for procurement have been instituted. Drilling of tubewells is being
initiated.
Credit No. 659 - Technical Assistance Project US$3.0 million Credit of
September 16, 1976; Effectrive Date: November 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
A list of ten priority projects to be financed under the Credit is
being discussed with the Government, and arrangements for initiating studies
are being made.
