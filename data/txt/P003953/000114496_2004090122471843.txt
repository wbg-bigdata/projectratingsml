                            SCHEDULE 2
                    Description of the Project
      The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower's
efforts in the irrigation subsector to provide adequate levels of
funding and to strengthen institutions and procedures, at all
levels, for operation and maintenance planning, programming,
budgeting and implementation, in order to sustain the effectiveness
of the Borrower's irrigation systems, increase beneficiary par-
ticipation and decrease dependence on government budgets for
operations and maintenance.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Page  10
Part A:
1.    Introduction and extension of the irrigation service fee (ISF)
in systems adjoining the existing ISF pilot areas and in additional
provinces covering a total of at least 700,000 ha.
2.    Extension of the program of turning over small public
irrigation schemes (covering at least 130,000 ha) to water user
associations.
3.    Strengthening the efficiency of the land and building tax in
rural areas by improving existing databases for mapping, land
classification and valuation, and tax administration.
Part B:
1.    Increase the responsibility, accountability and capability of
PRIS in the areas of planning, managing and executing operations and
maintenance related activities.
2.    Improve quality control for the Project by examining the
project construction work, reporting findings, identifying deficien-
cies, determining causes and recommending remedial measures.
3.    Improve inventory of irrigation and other water uses in a
river basin context and support water basin management, on a pilot
basis, in two basins (Opak in Yogyakarta and Cisanggarung in West
and Central Java), and strengthening PRIS to formulate organiza-
tional arrangements and specific procedures for effective allocation
and routings of basin flows to equitably and efficiently serve the
various water users.
4.    Continuing improvement of operating procedures at the scheme
level, including scheme-specific POMs and NBBs, as well as taking
into account the inter-relationships between design and operations.
5.    Integrate fully the establishment and strengthening of water
users associations in the relevant provincial agencies.
6.    Improve the management and information system at central and
provincial levels, including improving the system for programming
and monitoring, to provide orderly execution of the linked com-
ponents, and improved sequencing within each component, initially in
two provinces in Java.
7.    Improve the system of, and develop indicators for, monitoring
scheme performance by comparing planned with actual delivery of
services and other incremental benefits.
8.    Strengthening the institution building and policy activities
in Parts A and B by providing technical assistance and training
(including training in planning and programming, operations and
maintenance procedures, construction supervision and environmental
effects, training for WUAs, and overseas training related to river
basin management and operation and maintenance).
Part C:
1.    Carrying out of special maintenance works on about 750,000 ha
of surface irrigation systems and on about 45,000 ha of reclaimed
swamp land.
2.    Providing by the end of the Project efficient operation and
maintenance on about 1,700,000 ha of surface irrigation systems
(which includes areas under ISSP) and on about 170,000 ha of
reclaimed swamp land (which includes areas under ISSP).
3.    Completion of the Mesuji/Tulang Bawang (20,000 ha) scheme in
the Province of Lampung; completion of selected groundwater
development projects in the Provinces of South Sulawesi, Central
Sulawesi, East Java and West Nusatenggara (Lombok); monitoring of
five river mouths; support for water management activities in the
Page  11
Seluna river basin in the Province of Central Java; and support for
repairs in the Rentang scheme in the Province of West Java, as
agreed.
                               * * *
      The Project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1995.

2.    Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule.
3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as
the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                   Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
Page  14
                   deposits into the Special Account at such inter-
                   vals as the Bank shall specify.
            (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request,
                   the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
                   documents and other evidence required pursuant
                   to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment
                   or payments in respect of which replenishment is
                   requested. On the basis of each such request,
                   the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
                   withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into
                   the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                   shall have requested and as shall have been
                   shown by said documents and other evidence to
                   have been paid out of the Special Account for
                   eligible expenditures.
      All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; and (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to
the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:
(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or
(B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless
the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.

      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),(b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
