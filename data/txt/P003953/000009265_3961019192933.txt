IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR II (O&M) PROJECT
(Loan 3392-IND)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Irrigation Subsector II
(O&M) Project in Indonesia for which Loan 3392-IND in the amount of US$225 million was
approved on July 23, 1991 and made effective on November 4, 1991.
The loan was closed on July 31, 1995, as planned. In August 1994, US$10 million was
cancelled from the Loan. Final disbursement took place on Januaiy 17, 1996, at which time a balance
of US$11.2 million was cancelled. Co-financing (US$350,000) for the project was made available by
the Ford Foundation.
The ICR was prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programn, finalized by
Bert L. Kramer (Task Manager), and reviewed by Messrs. Aftab Raza (PMIU Chief, EA3RS),
Gershon Feder (Division Chief, EA3AG), and Richard Calkins (Project Advisor, EA3DR).
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision mission in June and July 1995. The
ICR is based on material in the project files, discussions with staff and stakeholders involved with the
project and data provided by the implementing agencies. The implementing agencies contributed to
the preparation of the ICR by providing their own Project Implementation Completion Report and
reports by consultants involved with project implementation, as well as by discussing the project with
members of the ICR mission.

IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR II (O&M) PROJECT
(Loan 3392-IND)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    Over the two decades before this project, irrigation had absorbed a major part of Bank lending
for Indonesian agriculture with loans and credits of some US$2.1 billion for 24 operations. During the
1970s, the Bank supported: (a) rehabilitation/modernization and construction of irrigation and drainage
systems, a multi-purpose dam and new development of tertiary canals; (b) institutional strengthening
and manpower development; and (c) policies to increase land tax revenues. More recently, especially in
the context of the first Irrigation Subsector Project (Loan 2880-ND) (ISSP I), Bank lending was to
improve operation and maintenance (O&M) of existing systems, assist turnover of small public
schemes to farmers' groups and introduce an irrigation service fee. These policies, which were
continued under this project, were aimed at increasing efficiency and sustainability of investments by
reducing dependence on central government budget and increasing beneficiary participation.
Project Objectives
2.    Objectives were to continue:
(a)   strengthening cost recovery, encouraging efficient use of water resources, and
supporting the tumover of small public irrigation schemes to water users' associations
(WUAs);
(b)   supporting institutional development; and
(c)    improving the physical, programming, budgeting and institutional aspects of O&M, so
that the effectiveness of existing systems could be sustained.
3.    Covenants of the loan agreement required the Government to maintain in real terms budgetary
allocations for O&M and to tumover 40 schemes larger than 150 ha to WUAs. The objectives were
reasonably clear, ambitious and important for the country, the subsector and the Banks country
assistance strategy.
4.    The project was demanding for the implementing agencies and complex, involving nine
physical components in 13 provinces and many implementing agencies with 16 consultancies. The main
ii



physical targets to support these objectives are shown in Table 5 and monitorable actions are shown in
Appendix B.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.    The project was generally smoothly and efficiently implemented. The project contributed to
strengthening cost recovery both by updating areas registered for rural land and building tax and by
increasing the area and amount of irrigation service fee (ISF) collected. Major achievements are a
general acceptance by the community in many districts that ISF should be paid and that WUAs should
be responsible for collecting and paying this fee. An ISF collection process has been established and
O&M budgets in ISF areas now include funds collected from ISF. In 1994, ISF was collected in 35
districts monitored by the project. Of these, 20 districts (57%) recorded 100% collection, a further 4
(11%) recorded over 90% and one 80%. However in the other ten districts collection rates ranged
from 65% to 13% with an average of 34%. The average amount collected was 700/o of the amount
requested, with 7% exempted and 23% not paid. Although guidelines for sanctions against non-
payment have been set out in a ministerial decree and some provinces provide for sanctions, in practice
most districts depend on social pressure and motivation efforts for recovering ISF under default. Only
35% of WUAs are active. The total ISF collected by March 1, 1995 in project areas in 1994/95 was
Rp2,673 million or 1.8% of the Rpl 50,600 million allocated by GOI for O&M of 5.73 million ha.
6.    The project contributed to the more efficient use of water resources in two river basins, in
which pilot subprojects were established. There has been significant progress on the technical aspects,
but the institutional objectives have not been fully achieved. Schemes with a total area of about
160,000 ha have been turned over to WVUAs, including more than 100 schemes larger than 150 ha.
Tuumover removes schemes from provincial irrigation O&M budgets but leaves PWRS with a liability
for any difficult or emergency repairs. The dependence on Govermment budgets for O&M has not yet
decreased; the total GOI allocation for O&M increased from Rp66,000 million in 1990/91
(Rpl2,000/ha) to Rpl60,000 million in 1994/95 (Rp27,000/ha). The project has been successful in
meeting its physical targets for SM and EOM, but important operational problems need attention.
Many water division structures are reported to be inappropriate for their purpose, leading to
hydraulically unstable systems requiring a standard of operational management difficult to sustain.
7.    During the project, GOI reformulated its administrative and management policy for Water
Resources Development, which led to the reorganization of DGWRD, institutional adjustments within
PWRS and devolution of some responsibilities, including O&M, to district level. Provinces are now
responsible for all O&M of irrigation.
8.    The total cost of the project is about US$459 million (Rp962,000 million), some 99%/o of the
SAR estimate in US$ but, due to alterations in the rate of exchange, about 113% of the SAR estimate
in rupiah. Approximately US$204 million of the Bank loan has been disbursed. US$10 million was
cancelled from the loan in August 1994 and an additional US$11.2 million was cancelled on
January 17, 1996. Co-financing of about US$0.3 million was provided by Ford Foundation. The
project has been substantially completed without any extension of loan closing date. The economic
rate of return has been re-estimated at 19%, slightly more than the 1 7/o estimated at appraisal due to
iii



higher economic price of rice and anticipated higher incremental production. The benefits from
groundwater were less than expected at appraisal due to lower value crops being grown at lower
cropping intensities. The estimated net present value calculated at a discount rate of 10% is positive
indicating also a satisfactory project.
9.    The Bank performed well in identifying the need for this and the preceding ISSP I and, in
collaboration with GOI, putting in place the new policies. The Bank maintained close liaison with the
Asian Development Bank and consistent approaches were adopted by both banks. The Borrower has
generally performed satisfactorily during project implementation. Adequate counterpart funds were
available even though the amount spent on O&M was greater than envisaged in the SAR. Reasonable
continuity of staff associated with the project was maintained until the reorganization of DGWRD in
1994, which interrupted smooth project implementation. The borrower generally complied well with
the covenants of the loan agreement. Weaknesses in project implementation included variable
construction quality, due lack of compliance with construction specifications and standards,
accountability needs to be established, which is being addressed by the Quality Assurance Office
(QAO) in DGWRD under J1WMP (Ln. 3762-IND). The outcome of the project has been rated as
satisfactory. Sustainability of ISF is likely in districts where it has been successful but great efforts are
needed to motivate Bupatis and WUAs in unsuccessful districts.
Summary of Findings, Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned
10.   Findings. The Government has demonstrated its ability to adequately finance O&M until ISF
can make a major contribution. ISF has been successfully introduced in 24 districts, covering about
11% of the gross irrigated area of Indonesia. Continued effort similar to that provided under the
project will be needed for a long time to come in order to extend ISF to the rest of the country.
11.   Future Operation will depend on adequate budget being made available. Careful monitoring
of EOM systems would be required to confirm that future funding is adequate. However, the long-term
sustainability of the SM/EOM component is uncertain, due to the need to simplify procedures, inability
to operate and control water flows in accordance with designs and structural deficiencies. General
operation plans have been outlined by DGWRD. Some aspects of O&M could be improved. To ensure
that systems entering EOM are in good working order, the amounts allocated for SM should be
sufficient to meet the actual needs. Further improvement of systems in Java and their introduction to
EOM will be supported by Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Resources Management Project
(Loan 3762-IND) (JIWMP), but there is no World Bank assistance in other islands. Provided reliable
irrigation is maintained, it is likely that ISF collections will continue at satisfactory levels in those
districts where collection is already successful. Efforts are now needed to maintain collection rates in
successful districts, improve collection rates in less successful districts, introduce ISF to new districts,
increase the amount of ISF per hectare to nearer the cost of O&M and reduce the proportion of
exemptions.
12.   Sustainability of schemes turned over to WUAs will depend on farmers paying O&M costs and
PWRS providing assistance for major or emergency repairs. Sustainability of groundwater schemes will
depend on adequate funds for O&M being collected and on the availability of spare parts. No
iv



provisions are being made by WUAs for replacements of pump engines and other items with limited
lives.
13.        Key Lessons Learned. ISF can be successfully collected when WUAs are responsible
for collecting and paying the fees, users are confident that charges are fairly detemiined in consultation
with them and are used for nmintainig a reliable irrigation supply and the Bupati is motivated to ensure
the success of ISF. The turnover of small irrigation schemes to WUAs does not remove the need for
continued PWRS involvement. Limiting the amount per hectare to be spent for SM is pointless if this
results in a scheme remaining unsuitable for the introduction of EOM. Expensive groundwater
development is unlikely to be economically viable if it is used to irrigate low value crops with low
cropping intensity. Most construction quality deficiencies are due to lack of compliance with
construction specifications and standards; there is a need to establish accountability.

IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR H (O&M) PROJECT
(Loan 3392-IND)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1.    The project was the second phase (four years) of a long-term (10 to 15 years) program aimed
at supporting the basic goals outlined in Government's 1987 Policy Statement (Appendix B) for the
irrigation subsector as well as supporting Government's policies on decentralization of activities related
to operation and maintenance (O&M). The major objectives of the project, as described in the SAR,
were to continue:
(a)   strengthening cost recovery from irrigation beneficiaries in direct support of O&M
expenditures and encouraging efficient use of water resources, and supporting the
turnover of small public irrigation schemes to water users' associations (WUAs) to
decrease the dependence on government budgets for O&M, and increase beneficiary
participation;
(b)   supporting institutional development entailing improved water resources management,
public expenditure prioritization, and decentralization effort through strengthening the
roles and responsibilities of Provincial Water Resources Services (PWRS)', hIigation
Committees and WUAs; and
(c)   improving the physical, programming, budgeting and institutional aspects of O&M, so
that the effectiveness of existing systems could be sustained.
2.    The objectives were reasonably clear, ambitious and important for the country, the subsector
and the Bank's country assistance strategy. The project was demanding for the implementing agencies
and complex, involving nine physical components in 13 provinces and many implementing agencies
with 16 consultancies. The main physical targets to support these objectives are shown in Table 5 and
monitorable actions are shown in Appendix B.
Referred to in the SAR as Provincial Irrigation Services (PRIS).
1



B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
3.    The project has been generally smoothly and efficiently implemented with only one consistent
cause for concern of supervision missions - the low proportion of people paying irrigation service fee
(ISF) in some districts. From a microeconomic perspective, the project contributed to the increase of
non-oil exports/reduction in imports by increasing agricultural production by an estimated 800,000
t/year of paddy and about 20,000 t/year of other secondaiy crops.
Cost Recovery
4.    The project contributed to strengthening cost recovery both by helping to updating the area
registered for rural land and building tax (PBB)' and by increasing the area and amount of ISF
collected. Major achievements are a general acceptance by the community in many districts that a
service fee should be paid for the provision of irrigation and that WUAs should be responsible for
collecting and paying this fee. An ISF collection process has been established and O&M budgets in ISF
areas now include funds collected from ISF. By March 1995 ISF was being collected in 37 districts,
covering a gross command area of 659,328 ha with an ISF service area of 467,308 ha (71% of the
gross area)2. In 1995/96 ISF is expected to be collected from a gross area of 879,267 ha with an ISF
service area of 714,538 ha. For the first season in 1994 (the latest season for which complete records
of collection are available to the mission) ISF was collected in 35 districts monitored by the project. Of
these, 20 districts (57%) recorded 100%/o collection of ISF, a further 4 (11 %) recorded over 90% and
one 80%/o. However in the other ten districts collection rates ranged from 65% to 13% with an average
of 34%. Similarly low collection rates are reported from areas supported by Asian Development Bank.
The finding in the final report of the consultants for ISF that only 35% of WUAs were active is a cause
for concem. The average ISF tariff in 1994/95 was nearly Rpl7,000/ha/year or 54% of the average
GOI allocation for efficient O&M (EOM) (Rp31,500/ha/year)3. The total ISF reported to have been
collected by March 1, 1995 (when collection for the 1994/95 cropping season was incomplete) in
project areas in 1994/95 was Rp2,673 million for a gross area of 659,000 ha or 1.8% of the Rpl 50,600
million allocated by GOI for O&M of 5.73 million ha.
5.    For the first season of 1994 the average amount collected was 70% of the amount of ISF
requested, with 7% exempted and 23% not paid. Although Decree No. 98 of the Ministry of Home
Affairs sets out guidelines for sanctions against non-payment and some provinces provide for sanctions,
in practice most districts depend on social pressure and motivation efforts for recovering ISF under
default. Some districts levy penal interest for delayed payment. Only exceptionally have irrigation
supplies been cut off.
' Part of PBB is allocated for O&M of irrigation.
2 Consultants' final report also refers to a gross area of 669,242 ha and a net area of 477,256 ha. This includes
two districts in Yogyakarta in which preparation for ISF is well advanced but lists of planted and harvested areas
were not made by March 1995 when data was compiled.
3 This is according to consultants' final report, Table 6.1; Annex 1 of the same report shows about Rpl4,000/ha
for two seasons (first season 1994 and 1994/95 season).
2



Efficient Use of Water Resources
6.    The project contributed to the more efficient use of water resources in two river basins. Pilot
subprojects, which were established for the Opak basin in Yogyakarta and Cisanggarung in West and
Central Java, have advanced the concepts of basin water resources management by increasing the
awareness of the need for a well-developed water allocation mechanism. There has been significant
progress on the technical aspects. However to demonstrate the effectiveness of water allocation will
require further improvements in the measuring systems, data handling and enforcement of allocation.
The institutional objectives set out for the pilot projects have not been fully achieved. The project
approach used in the absence of a long-term institutional arrangement is one of the main reasons for
this. The coordination institutions have yet to be fully developed. Ministry Decree 67/93 led to the
setting up of Provincial Water Management Committees in May 1994. The institutional arrangements
are expected to become operative under the Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Resources
Management Project (JIWMP) (Loan 3762-IND), which is also expected to address other problems
associated with this component. The pilot projects indicate that basin-level water management work
can be undertaken with a small staff provided appropriate training is given. The technology is simple
and the costs are affordable. The Opak Basin Water Operation Unit is reported to be continuing with
its primary role of bulk water allocation. The unit monitors water quality and flows.
7.    Public Expenditure Prioritization was stated in the SAR to be an objective of the project.
No provision was made in the project to achieve this.
Turnover of Schemes to Water Users' Associations
8.    Schemes with a total area of about 160,000 ha have been turned over to WUAs.1 The
necessary construction has been done for a further area of about 21,000 ha but the formal handover has
not taken place because the necessary documentation has not yet been prepared due to lack of staff.
Turnover removes schemes from provincial irrigation O&M budgets but leaves PWRS with a liability
for any difficult or emergency repairs; it is important that allowance continues to be made in the
provincial budget for this work as well as for routine irrigation extension services and counselling of
WUAs. The level of farmer equity contribution was estimated to be about 9% of the construction cost.
This contribution was mainly land and labor.
Dependence on Government Budgets for O&M
9.    The dependence on Government budgets for O&M has not yet decreased; the total GOI
allocation for O&M (both EOM and non-EOM) has increased from Rp66,000 million in 1990/91
(Rpl2,000/ha) to Rpl50,000 million (allocation) in 1994/95 (Rp27,000/ha), of which Rpl20,000
million was spent from the national development budget (APBN).
' Including more than 100 schemes with areas more than 150 ha. The SAR target was 40 schemes more than 150
ha.
3



bstitutional Development
10.   Duning the project, GOI reformulated its administrative and management policy for Water
Resources Development, which led to the reorganization of DGWRD, institutional adjustments within
PWRS and devolution of some responsibilities including O&M to district level. Provinces are now
responsible for all O&M of irrigation. Trial restructuring has been undertaken in one district in each
province in FY95/96 on a pilot basis, whereby a Public Works office is established at district level
responsible for irrigation, roads and urban development. It is Government policy that all irrigation
O&M be the responsibility of these offices. In the trial districts, the PWRS will strengthen the District
Water Resources Services (DWRS) for irrigation O&M through the transfer and reassignment of staff
and offices.
11.   Training was provided to over 8000 PWRS O&M staff in planning and programming works
for special maintenance (SM), construction supervision and in O&M. An evaluation of the training
given in 6 provinces indicated that it was good. Assignment of fill-time staff to facilitate transfer of
knowledge from consultants was not done consistently. Reorganization of DGWRD in 1994 resulted
in considerable transfer of staff between posts in Jakarta and in the provinces; for example, between
December 1993 and May 1995 every provincial project manager for ISSP II changed.
12.   Other measures related to improved institutional development which have so far had limited
impact include the pilot river basins (para 6), construction quality control (para 27) and development of
DGWRD capability for environmental impact assessments and environmental design.
Improving Operation and Maintenance
13.   The project has been successful in meeting its physical targets for SM and EOM (Tables 5 and
6) and in particular in the amounts of money allocated for O&M. Schemes under EOM have adopted
plans for operation and maintenance and use needs-based budgeting. Guidelines for simplified O&M
procedures have been prepared and are expected to be issued soon. There are, nevertheless, important
operational problems that need attention. A recent draft report on water division structures in
Indonesia states that many such structures are inappropriate for their purpose, leading to hydraulically
unstable systems. This can cause cumbersome operation, which may be beyond the available skills and
numbers of operational stafT requiring a standard of operational management difficult to sustain.
Fluctuating flows in run-of-river water sources result in high variability in daily discharges in main,
secondary and tertiary canals as well as large differences between the planned and actual discharges,
particularly in dry seasons. Where measuring structures exist they are often not calibrated. If they are
calibrated measurements are often not recorded. Water flows are based on experience, negotiations and
rights instead of water schedules derived from plant water needs on which design assumptions are
based.
Economic Re-evaluation
14.   The economic rate of return (ERR) has been re-estimated at 19%, slightly more than the 17%
estimated at appraisal. The higher ERR is mainly due to a higher economic price of rice and higher than
4



anticipated incremental production. The ERR is based on 38% of project costs and generalized
assumptions loosely derived from rather scant monitoring of benefits done by the project, augmented
where appropriate from other sources. On the basis of these assumptions, all components analysed
except groundwater showed satisfactory rates of return (see Table 9). The benefits from groundwater
were significandy less than expected at appraisal due to lower value crops being grown at lower
cropping intensities. Although the economic price of rice is now estimated to be about 400/o higher than
at appraisal, higher labor costs and lower incremental cropping intensities (other than in East Java)
have offset this.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
15.   Factors not generally subject to Government controL The forecast economic price of rice
has increased by about 400/o since appraisal. The economic cost of labor assumed in the analysis of the
project has approximately doubled in real temis since appraisal (increased by 82% in Sumatra and
163% in Java).
16.   Factors generally subject to Government control. GOI provided increased O&M budget
and promulgated many laws and regulations conceming ISF and water resources management which
enabled considerable progress to be made in achieving the project's objectives. Reorganization of
DGWRD caused disruption of project implementation, which slowed activities in 1994/95, causing
many activities to be carried over to 1995/96.
17.   Factors generally subject to Implementing Agency control. Slow award of the consultancy
contract for ISF delayed the implementation of the component.
D. PROJECT SUSTAlNABILlIY
18.   The project has shown that collection of ISF has been most successful where both the Bupati
and WUAs agree on the need for ISF. The latter requires a reliable irrigation supply to be maintained.
ISF collection records show appreciable exemptions (average 7%/o but up to 480/o in one district) from
paying ISF, which are given for reasons including not receiving adequate irrigation. ISF is intended
eventually to become the main source of EOM budget for main irrigation systems. This would require
considerable increase above present levels of the amount of ISF per hectare irrigated and reduction in
the proportion of the area exempted due to inadequate irrigation or other reasons.1 Until the time when
ISF has become the main source of EOM budget, considerable contribution will continue to be needed
from Government. While so far O&M budgets have increased significantly the heavy reliance on
public funds implies succeptability to adverse general fiscal fluctuation, hence the judgement that
sustainability of this component is uncertain.
Exemptions can also be given in the event of crop failure for other reasons or natural disaster.
5



19.   A main objective of the project was to make irrigation in Indonesia sustainable by ensuring that
irrigation systems were maintained in full operating condition. Given that the O&M budgets are
provided at the needed (NBB) levels, there is a basis for optimism that SM and EOM areas and areas
of completed ongoing projects would be fully sustainable. Now that Bank funds are no longer provided
for EOM, the intention is that funding should be from provincial budgets (APBD). Careful monitoring
of EOM systems in the future would be required to confirm that this funding is adequate. However,
despite the successful achievements of the project in the fields of SM and EOM there are problems that
still need attention to ensure efficient and sustainable operation and maintenance, making the
sustainability of this component uncertain. These problems include: the need to simplify complicated
procedures; inability to operate and control water flows in accordance with designs, causing uneven
water distribution within a system; structural deficiencies and illegal offlakes; and inadequacies in
communications and staffing at field level. Incomplete or malfunctioning terdary systems can also affect
performance. In order to ensure that systems entering EOM in the future are in good working order,
the future amounts allocated for SM should be sufficient to meet the actual needs.
20.   Sustainability of schemes turned over to WUAs would require good maintenance of the
systems by WUAs, which will depend on the ability of farmers to pay their share of O&M costs. The
self-management by WUAs and the importance of irigation to each farmer's livelihood provide reasons
to expect that most of the turned over systems would be sustainable. However, the turned over
systems are likely to require technical and financial assistance from PWRS in the event of major or
emergency repairs becoming necessary. Arrangements exist in the budgetary system to support
emergency repairs through provincial budgets. Continued technical guidance from PWRS to existing
WUAs would be needed if they are to remain effective.
21.   There is no reason to doubt that the improved collection of PBB will continue but recent
changes in the law may affect the amount collected.
22.   Sustainability of groundwater projects will depend on adequate funds for O&M being collected
by the water users' associations to cover both operating and maintenance costs and on the availability
of spare parts for pumps and engines. No provisions are being made by WUAs for eventual
replacements of engines and other items with limited lives that are difficult or expensive to replace. In
addition appropriate support systems and marketing channels must be available to convince farmers to
adopt high value crops and higher intensity of cultivation.
23.   Sustainability of swamp projects will depend on sufficient allocation of budget for EOM
including for dredging of canals. At Mesuji/Tulang Bawang measures to reduce flooding should be
investigated and, if practicable, implemented.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
24.   The Bank performed well in identifying the need for this and the preceding Irrigation Subsector
Project (ISSP I; Loan 2880-IND) and, in collaboration with GOI, putting in place the new policies for
O&M which are reflected in the policy statement (Appendix B). The project incorporated lessons
6



learned in the first phase project. These lessons include the need for correct sequencing of SM and
EOM, the need for simplified operating procedures and the need for flexible budgeting for SM.
Although the SAR included public expenditure prioritization as an objective, there was no component
to directly achieve this. The amount of foreign costs estimated in the SAR (US$150.5 million) bears no
relation to actual foreign expenditure (US$7.4 million).
25.   Between October 1991 and July 1995, the Bank fielded 8 full supervision missions, two
supplementary one-man missions and the final supervision/ICR mission. The supervision mission in
October and November 1993 carried out a mid-term review. Cooperation between the Bank and
borrower was very good. The Bank maintained close liaison with the Asian Development Bank and
consistent approaches were adopted by both banks.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
26.   Project preparation was based on work by consultants employed by the Borrower and
provided a satisfactory basis for the project. The Borrower has generally perfbrmned satisfactorily
during project implementation. Adequate funds were available and the increase in the amount spent on
O&M (para 9) is considerably greater than envisaged in the SAR. Reasonable continuity of staff
associated with the project was maintained until the reorganization of DGWRD in 1994. This
reorganization, however, caused a complete change of senior staff, which disrupted, to some extent,
smooth project implementation. The Borrower employed General Coordinating Advisors (GCA) to
coordinate and monitor progress of the project and on the Detailed Action Plan (DAP). This was of
considerable assistance to the Bank's supervision of the project. The borrower caused delay in
appointment of consultants for the ISF component. The borrower generally complied well with the
covenants of the loan agreement.
27.   Weaknesses in project implementation were variable construction quality, particularly in the
outer islands, due in part to deficiencies in construction supervision. These were identified during
project preparation and a component was included in the project to strengthen quality control. Findings
and recommendations of consultants appointed to improve the quality of construction included: most
deficiencies were due to non-compliance with existing construction specifications and standards; there
are needs to establish accountability; quality problems are more pronounced in small schemes assigned
to provinces and decentralisation may add to this; insufficient soil investigation results in earthwork
problems; swamp schemes have the biggest O&M problems, mainly due to lack of funds from the
provinces.
28.         The borrower contracted eleven (11) consultancies to assist the implementing
agencies with project implementation, institutional capacity building and policy support for
expanding ISF, PBB and the development of environmental assessment procedures. Additional
consultants were engaged for the final preparation of the follow-on Java Irrigation Improvement
and Water Resources Management (JIWMIP, Ln. 3762-IND) and Dam Safety (Ln. 3742-IND)
projects. The total cost for consulting services was about US$36.0 million or 18% over the SAR
estimate of US$30.4 million. About US$13.4 million was spent on the preparation of engineering
7



designs of the project works, carried out by national consultants. The cost overrun was mainly
due to: (i) preparation of JIWMP and Dam Safety Project; and (ii) extensions granted for the
General Coordination and Irrigation Development consultancies. Consultants employed by the
borrower have, in general, performed satisfactorily and have provided good records of project
implementation'. The General Coordination consultancy was most helpful to the Borrower and
the Bank for monitoring project implementation progress, including the Detailed Action Plan.
29.         In general, the coordination of the project between the agencies concerned
(BAPPENAS, DGWRD, DGPUOD and DGTAX) both at Central Government and Provincial
Government levels was satisfactory, building on the good experience of ISSP I, and has provided
a sound basis for implementing other similar projects.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
30.         The outcome of the project has been rated as satisfactory. The project achieved
most of its objectives. The ERR for the overall project is re-estimated at 19%, compared to 17%
at appraisal. Sustainability of ISF is likely in districts where it has been successfully introduced
but great efforts are needed to motivate Bupatis and WUAs in the so-far unsuccessful districts.
While implementation of SM, EOM, turnover, reclassification for PBB, institutional development,
monitoring of small river mouths and the completion of the swamp scheme may be considered to
have been generally satisfactory, the components for groundwater development (para 14), pilot
river basin water resources management (para 6) and program and monitoring system, which have
not yielded adequate benefits, may be considered less satisfactory. These activities represent less
than 5% of the total project cost.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
31.         Provided adequate budget continues to be made available, it is likely that future
operation will proceed satisfactorily. General operation plans have been outlined in the Project
Implementation Completion Report prepared by DGWRD. The project has drawn attention to
some aspects of O&M which could be improved including those discussed in para 19 and the need
for better communication facilities, the need for water operation centers, frequent absence of
gatekeepers and irrigation overseers, incorrect operation of sand traps, repair and rehabilitation of
measuring devices and improved O&M budget estimates. Further progress with rehabilitating and
upgrading existing systems in Java and their introduction to EOM, quality control improvements,
river basin management and the program and monitoring system will be supported by JIWMP.
However, the final reports on the Swamps and ISF project components are less than satisfactory.
8



L KEY LESSONS LEARNED
32.         ISF can be successfully collected when WUAs are responsible for collecting and
paying the fees, users are confident that charges are fairly determined in consultation with them
and are used for maintaining a reliable irrigation supply and the Bupati is motivated to ensure the
success of ISF. However good performance would be achieved more efficiently if the institutional
structure under the Bupati and the process and procedures for implementing the ISF program
were reviewed and strengthened.
33.         The turnover of small irrigation schemes to WUAs does not remove the need for
continued PWRS involvement (para 12).
34.         Limiting the amount per hectare to be spent for SM is pointless if this results in a
scheme remaining unsuitable for the introduction of EOM.
35.         Expensive groundwater development is unlikely to be economically viable if it is
used to irrigate low value crops with low cropping intensity.
36.         A major reorganization of a large establishment such as DGWRD can be expected
to cause considerable disruption to the smooth running of projects and programs under the
organization's control.
37.         Most construction quality deficiencies are due to lack of compliance with existing
construction specifications and standards; there is a need to establish accountability.
38.         Efficient water allocation to improve water resources management requires an
effective long-term institutional arrangement. This arrangement, including changes to existing
institutional setting could not be effected through the pilot project approach and will have to
await reorganization of institutions at provincial and district level, which is being planned under
Repelita VI.

(Loan 3392-IND)
Mission's Aide-Memoire
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    A mission from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) (KG. Paterson,
Irrigation Engineer, Mission Leader; R Lough, Economist, Consultant; and Ms. N. Springer,
Agricultural Economist) visited Indonesia from 25 June to 13 July 1995 to collect information for the
preparation of the project implementation report (ICR) for the project. The mission worked closely
with the World Bank final supervision mission (Bert L. Kramer and S. Kumar) as weli as with staff and
consultants of DGWRD, DGPUOD, Directorate PBB and provincial water resources services
(PWRS). The component for turning over schemes of less than 500 ha to Water Users' Associations
(WUAs) was discussed with a representative of the co-financier, Ford Foundation. The mission visited
East Java, West Nusatenggara (Lombok) and Lampung and had many discussions in Jakarta. The
mission would like to thank all those who have assisted.
2.    This draft aide-memoire, which is subject to confirmation by the World Bank, is based on the
World Bank staff appraisal report (SAR), a draft ICR prepared by DGWRD dated June 1995, reports
by consultants and implementing units and discussions with staff concerned with the project. The large
amount of information available and recommendations made in the many reports studied have been
severely condensed in this aide-memoire and recourse should be made to the original reports for the
full conclusions and recommendations. This aide-memoire reflects discussions at a wrap-up meeting at
DGWRD on 12 July 1995 to record the views of the Bank, the borrower and implementing agencies
on project implementation and operation.

B. THE PROJECT
3.    The project was the second phase (four years) of a long-term (10 to 15 years) program to
support the goals outlined in the Government's policy statement for the irnigation subsector as well as
Govemment policies on decentalisation of activities related to operation and maintenance (O&M).
The major objectives of the project were to continue:
(a)    strengthening recovely of O&M costs from beneficiaries, encouraging efficient use of
water and supporting the turnover of small public irrigation schemes to water users'
associations (WUAs) to decrease dependence on Government budgets and increase
beneflciary participation;
(b)    supporting institutional development entailing improved water resources management,
public expenditure prioritisation and decentralisation; and
(c)    improving the physical, programming, budgetting and institutional aspects of O&M.
4.    To support these objectives the project would:
(a)    support Government's policy reforms in the subsector entailing:
(i)    extension of irrigation service fee (ISF) to cover a total area of at least 700,000
ha;
(i)    expanding the program entailing the turnover of small public irrigation schemes
covering at least 130,000 ha; and
(iii)    consolidate rural PBB activities;
(b)    support institutional strengthening with measures to:
(i)   increase responsibility, accountability and capability of provincial irrigation
services (PWRS) staff,
(ii)    provide quality control on the works carried out on the project;
(iii)   support basin water management in two pilot river basins;
(iv)    develop improved operating procedures;

(v)   integrate WUA establishment and strengthening activities;
(vi)   institute improved system performance indicators and the monitoring of
benefits into the monitoring and evaluation system;
(vii)  initiate a programming and monitoring system to provide orderly execution of
linked components and improved sequencing within each component;
(c)    support physical works related to:
(i)   special maintenance (SM) for about 815,000 ha' of surface irrigation and about
45,000 ha of swamp schemes and preparation for O&M (PROM) on about
250,000 ha;
(ii)    extension of EOM so that at the end of the project 1.7 million ha of irrigated
land and 170,000 ha of swamps schemes would be under the Bank-supported
program;
(nii)   completion of monitoring of five small river mouths;
(iv)    groundwater development intended as a bridging activity until a separate
groundwater project would be effective;
(v)    completion of an ongoing swamp scheme covering 20,000 ha and, subject to
Bank approval; and
(vi)   implementation of water management activities in the Seluna river and urgent
repairs to the Rentang system.
5.    The total estimated project cost of US$463 .3 million was to be financed with the help of an
IBRD loan of US$225 million and a grant from the Ford Foundation of US$325,000. The remaining
US$238 million was to be financed by GOI. In addition to supporting the policy objectives, the project
was estinated to benefit about 2 million farm families and have an overall economic rate of return
(ERR) of 17%.
1 SAR, Annex 7 shows 803,531 ha.

in real terms based on the 1990/91 level has been increased and the average amount per hectare for all
O&M has increased substantially as shown below. The average allocation in 1994/95 for EOM areas
going out of the lBRD/APBN supported program after 5 years was Rp 31,517/ha.

However, the allocation for 1995/96 shows a decline which casts doubt on GOI's commitment to
maintain frill funding for EOM in the future.

GCC = source is General Coordination Consultancy; FR = source is Final Report of concerned consultant;
+cons. = includes cost of consultants.
9.     The total cost of the project is now estimated at about Rp794,000 million, about 8% above the
SAR base cost estimate. The increase is mainly due to increases in the amounts spent on recurrent
O&M. Approximately US$199.5 million had been disbursed from the loan to 22 June 1995 and at
least a further US$4 million is expected to be disbursed. US$10 million was cancelled from the loan in
1994.
Iriigation Service Fee
10.   The ISF component of the project achieved its main development objectives even though it fell
short of some targets. Major achievements are a general acceptance by the community that a service
fee should be paid for the provision of irrigation and that WUAs should be responsible for paying this
fee. An ISF collection process has been established and O&M budgets now include funds collected
from ISF. The ISF component was implemented in 45 districts and by March 1995 covered a gross
command area of 669,242 ha compared to the target of an expansion of at least 700,000 ha over the
ISSP I area of 48,836 ha. For the first season in 1994 (the latest season for which complete records of
collection are available to the mission) ISF was collected in 35 districts monitored by the project. Of
these, 20 districts (57%) recorded 100% collection of ISF, a further 4 (I 1%) recorded over 90% and
one 80%. However in the other ten districts collection rates ranged from 65% to 13% with an average
of 34%. This causes serious concern about the sustainability of the ISF component in these districts.
The service area on which ISF is levied is 477,256 ha. Of the 6461 WUAs established with a fee-
paying membership of 1,685,687 farmers, 77% were legalised and 58% were trained by the project.
11.   The average ISF tariff in 1994/95 was nearly Rp 17,000/ha or 43% of the average GOI
allocation for EOM (Rp3l,500/ha). The total ISF collected in 1994/95 was Rp2,600 million or 1.6% of
the Rp 160,490 million allocated by GOI for O&M of 5.73 million ha.
12.   Major weaknesses in the component are delays in critical activities at kabupaten level, the need
for improved guidance and supervision by DG PUOD and provincial level staff, and inability in many
cases to apply formal sanctions for default in ISF payment. In addition, inadequate tertiary canal
systems may affect performance.

Appendix A: Mission's Aide-Mdmoire
Turnover to Water Users' Associations
13.   The target to turn over 130,000 ha to WUAs is reported to have been exceeded and there are
further areas, including in Lampung, where the necessary construction has been done but the formal
handover has not taken place because the necessary documentation has not yet been prepared due to
lack of staff; moreover, in the period since the completion of construction two schemes have been
damaged by floods and further repairs are needed before turnover.
14.   Tumover removes schemes from provincial irrigation O&M budgets but leaves PWRS with a
liability for any difficult or emergency repairs. It is important that allowance is made in the APBD
budget for this work as well as for routine irrigation extension services and counselling of WUAs (see
page 74 of SAR).
Land and Building Tax (PBB)
15.   PBB was introduced in 1985 to replace IPEDA and to date some 1.7 million ha have been
remapped under various projects supported by the World Bank and ADB. This has generated
increased average tax levels. Under ISSP II terrestrial mapping, identification and registration was
completed for 50,500 ha of upland in Central Java and East Java. This is only 28% of the area
proposed at appraisal due to underestimation of the unit cost of mapping. Survey and mapping
equipment was provided for Directorate PBB by the project. Database maintenance proposed in the
SAR was omitted so that funds could be allocated to mapping.
Increased Provincial Responsibilities for O&M
16.   rovinces are now responsible for all O&M of irrigation, including in projects where
construction is ongoing, where previously O&M had been undertaken by the project. Trial
restructuring has been undertaken in one district in each province whereby a Public Works cabang
dinas is established at district level responsible for irrigation, roads and urban development. It is
Government policy that all O&M is to be the responsibility of cabang dinas at kabupaten level. In the
trial districts, provincial level O&M staff are transferred to kabupatens and report to the Bupati with
province level staff responsible only for planning and general supervision. Training was provided to
over 8000 PWRS O&M staff in planning and programming SM works, construction supervision and in
O&M. An evaluation of the training given in 6 provinces indicated that it was good. Assignment of
full-time staff to facilitate transfer of knowledge from consultants was not done consistently.
Reorganization of DGWRD in 1994 resulted in considerable transfer of staff between posts in Jakarta
and in the provinces; for example, between December 1993 and May 1995 every provincial project
manager for ISSP H changed.

Strengthening Quality Control
17.   Consultants were appointed, initially to improve the quality of construction for SM and EOM
works, but during implementation, the scope of their work was widened to include all DGWRlD
construction and the quality assurance office was placed under the technical supervision of the DG of
DGWRD. This input has increased awareness in DGWRD for improved quality control. The quality
assurance office examined in detail 12 projects and identified deficiencies and their causes and made
recommendations for improvement. It was agreed that a permanent DGWRD Quality Assurance Unit
would be established and supported by JIWMP. Major findings and recommendations included: most
deficiencies were due to non-compliance with existing standards, regulations and policies; there are
needs for accountability to be established and sanctions to be applied; quality problems are more
pronounced in small schemes assigned to provinces and decentralisation may add to this; insufficient
soil investigation results in earthwork problems; swamp schemes have the biggest O&M problems,
mainly due to lack of funds from the provinces. A technical audit of selected systems under the SM and
EOM program identified further areas where improvements could be made.
River Basin Water Management Pilot Subprojects
18.   Subprojects, which were established for the Opak basin in Yogyakarta and Cisanggarung in
West and Central Java, have advanced the concepts of basin water resources management by
increasing the awareness for a well-developed water allocation mechanism. There has been significant
progress on the technical aspects. However to demonstrate the effectiveness of water allocation will
require further improvements in the measuring systems, data handling and enforcement of allocation.
The institutional objectives set out for the pilot projects have not been fully achieved. The project
approach used in the absence of a long-term institutional arrangement is one of the main reasons for
this. The coordination institutions have yet to be fully developed. Ministry Decree 67/93 led to the
setting up of Provincial Water Management Committees (PWMC) in May 1994. The institutional
arrangements are expected to become operative under JIWMP, which is also expected to address other
serious problems associated with this component.
19.   The pilot projects indicate that basin-level water management work can be undertaken with a
small staff provided appropriate training is given. The technology is simple and the costs are
affordable. The Opak Basin Water Operation Unit is reported to be continuing with its primary role of
bulk water allocation. The unit monitors water quality and flows.
Improved Operating Procedures
20.   Improved procedures introduced in 23 Advanced Operating Units (AOU) included the
simplification of the reference operation model (ROM) procedures developed under ISSP I and the
preparation of guidelines for operation procedures for eight typical types of irrigation system.



INDONESIA: Inigation Subsector II (O&M) Project  APPENDIX A
Implementation Completion Repot         Page 9 of 16
Appendix A. Mission's Aide-M6moire
Maintenance procedures, including the regular completion of standard monitoring forms and the use of
needs-based budgetting, which were established under ISSP I, are, in general, adequate; PWRS are
using these procedures successfully. The concept of a multi-year budgetting program has been
introduced. Guidelines for simplified O&M procedures have been prepared and are expected to be
issued soon.
21.   espite the documentation for approved operating procedures there are many indications that
schemes are not well operated. Where measuring structures exist they are often not calibrated. If they
are calibrated measurements are often not recorded. Romijn weirs are often not operated as designed.
A recent report from an independent specialist concludes that operating procedures are too lengthy and
elaborate: design assumptions that water would be delivered in predetermined quantified flows have no
bearing on reality, where water flows are based on experience, negotiations and rights instead of water
schedules derived from plant water needs.
WUA Establishment and Strengthening
22.   Water users from nine provinces and Jatiluhur were trained by DGWRD under the O&M and
turnover component of the project but this covered only about 20% of the potential farm-level trainees.
An evaluation of the training found that WUA's understanding of organization and financial aspects
were often inadequate. Additional ISF training for farmers was given by DG PUOD. A national level
WUA guidance coordination team was set up to coordinate these activities. This team is to coordinate
working groups at provincial and kabupaten levels.
Benefit Monitoring
23.   Benefit monitoring was not directly supported under this project; some routine monitoring of
benefits by provincial monitoring units continues.
Program and Monitoring System (PMS)
24.   PMS, which is being introduced in East Java and Central Java, comprises seven modules:
inventory, assets, staff information, hydrology, operations, maintenance and budgetting. The system is
only now coming into trial operation on a very limited area and it is too early to judge whether it may
serve as a useful management tool. It is expected to continue under JIWMP.
Technical Assistance
25.   Sixteen consultancy packages, costing over Rp6O,OO0 million were provided under the Project:
(a)    General coordination advisor;

Special Maintenance and Efficient Operation and Maintenance
26.   For surface irrigation the target for SM (815,000 ha) has been exceeded (over 937,000 ha) but
the achievement for EOM fell slightly (4%) short of the target of 1,700,000 ha by the end of ISSP II
under the Bank-supported program. When account is taken of the good performance in ISSP I, when
the target was exceeded by 45%, the target for incremental EOM in ISSP 11 (712,000 ha) has been

missed by some 13% (1,634,380 ha to March 1995 minus 1,01 5,080 ha' under ISSP 1). To some
extent this could be due to the need for more thorough preparation for EOM. A standard LCB tender
document for construction has been prepared, approved and adopted.
27.   A problem experienced with SM is that, due to thresholds set for construction costs, not all
identified work is included in SM and some schemes entered EOM with outstanding maintenance
works not yet done. The tendency has been to concentrate on the easier and cheaper schemes first and
the threshold has been raised in each successive project.
Monitoring Small River Mouths
28.   Five small river mouths were improved between 1987 and 1990 under ISSP I. The purpose
was to improve access to the sea for small fishing boats by creating a self-flushing river channel and
preventing sand bars and sand spits from forming at the river mouths. Simple gabion structures were
used to build long training walls/jetties to form channels with widths between 22 m and 70 m.
Monitoring over a three year period showed that the self-flushing concept functioned weli with a stable
river bed, permitting navigation of fishing boats at all periods and with little change in upstream river
regime. There was some settlement of the structures. Wave action damaged the nose of jetty walls.
Coastline changes are taking place but in only one of the five cases is this considered to be important.
There has been a steady increase in fishing boat traffic and in fish production since construction ended.
Recommendations to increase the lives of the structures were made. DGWRD plans similar
construction at other river mouths, taking account of the lessons learned, when funds are available.
Groundwater
29.   The project continued groundwater development in Lombok, East Java, Central and South
Sulawesi. The investment and operating costs continue to be high for growing low-value crops.
Particularly in the case of Lombok, the investmene is unlikely to be economically justified.

Table 2.4 of EOM consultant's Final Report). Thus, target could be considered to be 743,706 ha and achievement
to March 31, 1995 to be 678,086 (9 1%). Also, 218,039 ha of SM in 1994/95 should have entered EOM in
1995/96, bringing the total to 120% of target.

Completion of Ongoing Swamp Scheme
30.   The project financed the successful completion of the 20,000 ha Mesuji/Tulang Bawang
swamp development. However, recent development for estate crops upstream of the scheme have
increased the nmoff from the upstream area and parts of Mesuji/Tulang Bawang are now subject to
flooding. Increased drainage capability is needed.
Seluna River Basin Water Management
31.   The work suggested in the SAR was not financed by the project.
Rentang Scheme
32.   Primary and secondary canals and structures serving 73,683 ha were repaired but this did not
result in the capacities of the two main canals being restored. Siltation of canals caused operating levels
to be increased, which affected bank stability. The project financed repairs to the automatic telemetry
and control system for headwork gates, which have been successfully completed. Training of operators
is in progress.
Dumpil Irrigation Scheme
33.   The study and detailed design of trial sections of remedial works was added to the project.
These are expected to be constructed this year under JIWMP.
D. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
34.   The project has been successful in supporting the Government's policy reforms initiated under
the first Irrigation Subsector Project. Introduction of ISF to new areas and tumover of small public
irrigation schemes to WUAs have continued and revenue perfombance of PBB has improved through
reclassification and reassessment in rural areas. However, because the amount allocated for O&M has
been increased to take account of needs, the dependence on Government budget for O&M has also
increased.
35.   The project has supported institutional development. The O&M capabilities of PWRS have
been improved in the planning field by the use of needs-based budgets and attention has been drawn to
areas that need improvement in the management and execution of O&M (including improved O&M
manuals, improved construction supervision and better transport and communication facilities).
Recommendations have been made regarding improved construction quality control (including the

Implementation Completion Report      Page 13 of 16
Appendix A. Mission'. Aide-M6moire
need for improved supervision of survey and construction, provision of drainage and improved
communications). A start has been made in two pilot yiver basins to evolve institutional arrangements
and procedures for efficient integrated water resources managernent. There has not been much
progress in improving system performance indicators and monitoring of benefits. The programming
and monitoring system started in a pilot cabang dinas in each of East and Central Java is not yet
effectively operative.
E. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
36.   Project preparation was based on work by consultants employed by the borrower. This
provided a good basis for the project. The borrower has performed well in project implementation.
Adequate funds were made available during the project and the increase in the amount spent on O&M
(para 7) is considerably greater than envisaged in the SAR Reasonable continuity of staff associated
with the project was maintained until the reorganization of DGWRD in 1994. This reorganization,
however, caused a complete change of senior staff, which disrupted, to some extent, smooth project
implementation. Consultants employed by the borrower have, in general, performed satisfactorily and
have provided good records of project implementation. The borrower caused delay in appointment of
consultants for the ISF component. The borrower generally complied weli with the covenants of the
loan agreement.
37.   General operation plans have been outlined in the draft ICR prepared by DGWRD. It was
agreed that these would be consolidated into an operational plan to be presented to the Bank by mid-
October 1995.
F. PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
38.   The World Bank performed weli in identifying the need for this and the preceding project.
Lessons learned in ISSP L including the need for correct sequencing of SM and EOM, the need for
simplified operating procedures and the need for flexible budgetting for SM, were incorporated into the
project. Although the SAR included public expenditure prioritisation as an objective, there was no
component to directly achieve this. The Bank provided regular supervision missions and cooperation
between the Bank and borrower was very good.
G. SUSTAINABILHTY
39.   The project has shown that collection of ISF can be sustainable provided both the Bupati and
WUAs agree on the need for ISF. The latter requires a reliable irrigation supply to be maintained. ISF



INDONESIA: Irigaion Subector 11 (O&M) Projec  APPENDIX A
Implemedtblmon Compledon RIepo         Page 14 of 16
Appendix A: Misione Aide*-Mdnire
collection records show appreciable exemptions from paying ISF, which are given for reasons including
not receiving adequate irrigation. ISF is eventually to become the main source of EOM budget for
main irrigation systems. This would require considerable increase above present levels of the amount of
ISF per hectare irrigated and reduction in the proportion of the area exempted due to inadequate
irrigation. Until the time when ISF has become the main source of EOM budget considerable
contribution will continue to be needed from Government. In areas relying entirely on APBD there are
indications that the amounts allocated are beginning to decline. Careful monitoring in the future of the
amounts allocated for and the performance of EOM systems is needed.
40.   Despite the successful achievements of the project in the fields of SM and EOM there are
problems that still need attention to ensure efficient and sustainable O&M procedures. These problems
include complicated procedures, inability to operate and control water flows in accordance with
designs causing uneven water distribution within a system; structural deficiencies and illegal offlakes
and inadequacies in communications and staffing at field level. Incomplete or malfunctioning tertiary
systems can also affect performance.
41.   ustainability of schemes turned over to WUAs would require good maintenance of the systems
by WUAs, which will depend on the ability of farmers to pay their share of O&M costs. The self-
management by WUAs and the importance of irrigation to each farmers livelihood provide reasons to
expect that most of the turned over systems would be sustainable. However, the turned over systems
are likely to require technical and financial assistance from PWRS in the event of major or emergency
repairs becoming necessary. Arrangements exist in the budgetary system to support emergency repairs
through provincial budgets. Continued technical guidance from PWRS to existing WUAs would be
needed if they are to remain effective.
42.   There is no reason to doubt that the improved collection of PBB will continue, but recent
changes in the law may affect the amount collected.
43.   Sustainability of groundwater projects will depend on adequate funds for O&M being collected
by the water user's associations to cover both operating and maintenance costs and on the availability
of spare parts for pumps and engines. No provisions are being made by WUAs for eventual
replacements of engines and other expensive items with limited lives.
44.   Sustainability of swamp projects will depend on sufficient allocation of budget for EOM
including for dredging of canals. At Masuji/Tulang Bawang measures to reduce flooding should be
investigated and, if practicable, implemented.
45.   Further progress with rehabilitating and upgrading existing systems in Java and their
introduction to EOM, quality control improvements, river basin management and PMS will be
supported by JIWMP.

Attachment 1
Guidance on Government's Contribution to the ICR
Govermment's own final evaluation of the project implementation is an important part of
an ICR. It is attached, unedited, to the ICR sent to the World Bank Board. It can be selective in its
coverage and should address issues and lessons learned in project implementation, from the borrower's
perspective. Topics covered can be the same as in the ICR, namely, project design, appraisal,
implementation and project results. At each stage of the project the contribution should comment on
both World Bank and the implementing agencies' performances, with the observations, where possible,
supported by evidence or reasoned argument.
For project design the contribution could address such questions as the appropriateness
of the project's objectives, the size of the project and scope of the investments proposed, aspects of
design leading to easy (or difficult) implementation and the effect on government institutions.
For project appraisal comments should concentrate on any significant changes in the
objectives, size and scope of the project and whether these were appropriate.
Project implementation experience should be divided into an assessment of World Bank
performance in supporting and supervising the project and the performance of the imnplementing
agencies.
Project results include an assessment of the direct physical benefits leading to financial
and economic benefits. Since financial and economic re-analysis of the project will be undertaken as
part of the ICR, it is suggested, if GOI so wishes, that the contribution could most usefUlly comment
on the effect of the project from the Government's perspective. Such an analysis would be a most
useful contribution to the ICR.
Based on the foregoing sections the contribution should list the main lessons leamed from
the implementation experience and arising from the above analysis.
WB suggest that if the contribution is more than ten pages it should include a summary.
The latter is recommended for all but the shortest contributions. The operation plan will be prepared
and submitted to the Bank (see para 46).
The mission will be happy to provide any further elaboration or clarification required to
assist in preparation of the contribution.

This is the summary project implementation report for the Irrigation Sub Sector II (O&M) Project
(ISSP 1I) in Indonesia prepared by the Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD),
Ministry of Public Works, Government of Indonesia (GOI). the lead implementing agency. The total
project cost at completion (31 July 1995) is estimated to be Rp . ............. billion (US$ .
million) for which an IBRD Loan of US$ 225 million was approved on 5 September 1991 along with
a grant of US$ 325,000 by Ford Foundation with the balance being funded by GOI.  Final
disbursement from the IBRD Loan is estimated to be USS ............. million while the balance of US$

2.    Introduction
Irrigation infrastructure expansion in the past three decades in Indonesia has contributed to the
achievement of self-sufficiency in rice. To support the operation and maintenance (O&M) in irrigation
sector, GOI in 1987, issued a Statement of Policies for irrigation O&M which enunciated policy on (i)
O&M funding, lii) institutional strengthening, and (iii) cost recovery. A medium term (10-15 years)
action plan was setup to implement the policies.
The ISSP II (O&M) Project constitutes the second phase of the action plan to implement the
3&M policies. The first phase (1988-9 1) costing US$ 340.8 million was supported by an IBRD US$
225.2 million loan (Loan No.2880-IND). The Bank has provided loan/credit of some US$ 2310 million
through 29 operations in the irrigation sector. During the 1970's GOI with Bank assistance focused
on expansion/ rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage system while in the 1980's, with the
achievement of self-sufficiency in rice, the increased emphasis by GOI and Bank has been on improved
O&M of existing irrigation and drainage system, turnover of small schemes to beneficiaries, and
introduction of service fee. The ISSP II Project reflects these policies.
3.    Objectives and Components
The major objectives of the Project were,
(i)    strengthening cost recovery from irrigation beneficiaries in direct support of O&M expenditures
and encouraging efficient use of water resources, supporting the turnover of small public
irrigation schemes to Water User Associations (WUAs) to decrease the dependence on
government budgets for O&M, and increase beneficiary participation;
(ii)   supporting institutional development entailing improved integrated basin water resources
management,  public  expenditure  prioritization, and  decentralization  effort through



APPENDIX C

strengthening the roles and responsibilities of Provincial Water Resources Services (PWRS),
Irrigation Committees and WUAs; and
(iii)   improving the physical, planning, programming, budgeting and institutional aspects of O&M,
so that the effectiveness of existing systems can be sustained.
The project components were; (a) Policy Components comprising of; {i) extension of Irrigation
Service Fee (ISF) in 7 provinces, (ii) expanding the program of turnover of irrigation system up to 500
ha to Water User Associations (WUAs) and MiiiU consolidation of rural land classification and tax
valuation (PBB); (b) Institutional Components comprising of ; li) strengthening operation procedures
for irrigation O&M, establishing and strengthening WUA's, improving Ministry Management
Information System (MIS) and improving project monitoring & evaluation (M&E), (ii) support Basin
Water Resources Management in two pilot basins, liii) improve Quality Assurance (QA) of projects,
(iv) training, and (v) technical assistance; Ic) Physical Components comprising of ; (i) special
maintenance (SM) for irrigation systems in lowlands and swamp schemes, (ii) extension of efficient
operation & maintenance CEOM) in 9 provinces, (iii) monitoring of 5 small river mouths, (iv)completion
of Mesuji/Tulang Bawang swamp scheme, (v) groundwater development bridging phase, and (vi)
urgent repairs to Rentang System. Table 1 presents the physical and cost status at project completion
for major components.
4.    Project Organization and Design
The project implementation involved Bappenas, four Ministries, and at least eight Directorates
at the center as well as corresponding agencies at provincial and district levels in 9 provinces. There
were 7 major components and 7 associated components included in the project.  The project
implementation was coordinated by Bappenas and implemented through DGWRD in the Ministry of
Public Works and DG PUOD in the Ministry of Home Affairs.
The project design followed primarily the approach used under the ISSP I program. A major
departure from the ISSP I program was the (i) introduction of the Water Resources Management
Component in a basin context on a pilot basis to help improve basin water allocation, and (ii)
introduction of the Quality Assurance Program. In general, roles and responsibilities were reasonably
well defined, component targets properly set with good cost estimates. However, project design did
not anticipate adequately institutional issues involved in introducing basin water resources
management, continuing support needed for irrigation system that were turned over, increases in cost
for recurrent O&M, identification of a formal sanction system for ISF defaulters, increases in unit
costs for PBB mapping and improvement to the irrigation system performance indicators and
monitoring of benefits.
The following paragraphs present a summary of the project implementation experience,
changes to objectives or scope and size, if any, and accomplihsments.
5.    Irrigation Service Fee
Under ISSP II the ISF program has been expanded from a pilot approach in ISSP I to a national
program and implemented in 45 districts (7 provinces) covering a gross area of 877,267 ha (714,484
ha irrigated area) against a target of 700,000 ha gross area. The ISF tariff varied from Rp.l 1,750/ha
to RP.26,OOO/ha with an average of nearly Rp.17,000/ha which is 43% of the average allocation for



APPENDIX C
Page 3 of 8
EOM (Rp.31,500/ha). The collection performance for FY 1993/94 was 62% while for FY 1994/95
it was 65.5 %. However, district collection results varied from a low of 13% to 100%.
There is now a general acceptance by the farmer and WUA's of the ISF program and all of the
legal instruments needed are in place. Except for two Districts in the province of Dl Yogyakarta all
other districts have implemented the ISF program. Shortfalls in ISF collection can be attributed to
delay in issuing the regulations, lack of adequate staff, delays in administrative process, the degree
of support from district authorities, weakness in guidance and supervision and inability to apply
sanction for default in ISF payment.
6.    Special Maintenance (SM) and Efficient Operation and Maintenance (EOM)
The SM/EOM component was carried out in 9 provinces. The SM works comprising of SM
design of 495,385 ha and construction of 937,331 ha (including SM completion of 118 schemes from
ISSP I covering 288,818 ha) exceeded the program target by 15%. The EOM program was
implemented in over 1,634,380 ha which is 4% short of the set target. The level of recurrent O&M
funding for 1994/95 for EOM areas going out of the APBN supported program was Rp. 31,517/ha
while nationally it was Rp. 28,000 / ha. The later reflects a 140% increase over the 1990/91 (O&M)
allocation, the agreed minimum O&M level of funding in real terms as per GOI policy, far more than
the 42% compounded inflation in the 4 years. Also implemented were a standard LCB tender for
construction, simplification of O&M procedures and its implementation through the AOU program.
Although the overall objectives of SM and EOM were met, some problems were experienced
during implementation. These related to; cost ceiling and limited budget for SM works, which resulted
either in irrigation systems entering the EOM program without full SM works implementation or
dropping of irrigation systems from SM program after designs were completed; non-inclusion of
drainage works and O&M facilities in the SM; problems related to proper functioning of measuring
structures; low level of funding for EOM in earlier years; and lack of man power to supervise both SM
and EOM work effectively.
7.    Turnover Program
The turnover program aims at reducing dependance on central budget for O&M while giving
the responsibility to the Water User Associations (WUA's). System turnover aimed initially to cover
systems less than 1 50 ha was extended to 500 ha. The program objectives exceeded in all categories
as seen from Table 1. The turnover area target exceeded by 40% while 88% of the area was actually
turned over. WUAs development and strengthening was completed in the turnover area covering
110.141 ha (60%). Some delays were experienced in completing the formal handover procedure to
WUA's.
8.    Land and Building Tax (PBB)
The property tax system (PBB), introduced in 1985, to replace land tax (IPEDA). is intended
as a revenue source for Local Government to fund O&M of irrigation. To date about 1.7 million ha has
been remapped under various programs which has promoted increased tax levels and collection.
Under the project about 50,550 ha 128% of the target) of upland area was reclassified which included
terrestrial mapping, identification and registration. This was due to underestimation of the unit cost



APPENDIX C
Page 4 of 8
for mapping. The data base maintenance work had to be dropped because of cost increase for
mapping.
9.    Quality Assurance Program
The original objective to strengthen construction quality control for SM/EOM works was
expanded to a Quality Assurance (QA) Program for DGWRD to incorporate all aspects of project
implementation. A Quality Assurance Cell and a DGWRD Quality Assurance Steering Committee was
established to setup QA  guidelines.  12 major projects were examinated to develop GA
recommendation.
The QA deficiencies  related to non-compliance of standards, inadequate geotechnical
investigation, fixing of accountability, cost over runs and inadequate O&M. The deficiencies were
more pronounced in small schemes. Technical audits of selected SM/EOM projects confirmed these
deficiencies. A major achievement is the increased QA awareness generated in DGWRD organization.
10.   Basin Water Resources Management
The concepts of integrated river basin water management were tested in two small pilot basins
(Opak and Cisanggarung basins) in Java to evolve the institutional arrangements and water allocation
procedures. Though significant achievements were made in the technical aspects of water allocation,
constraints in the hydromet network, data management, monitoring and enforcement of water
allocation limited the progress. The institutional objectives were not fully achieved in the absence of
long-term institutional arrangement for coordination and operations at the basin level, which are being
addressed by the Ministry. The pilot project experience has helped the Ministry in its work of setting
out policies and strategies for launching integrated basin water management, promoting necessary
institutional changes and a general increased awareness in water management.
11.   Institutional Strengthening and Training
Institutional strengthening in the water sector has occurred at various levels of the
Government. At the national level water resources has been elevated to a sector and a Bureau of
Water Resources and Irrigation has been created (1993) in the National Planning Board (Bappenas).
The national water agency DGWRD was reorganized in 1994 to integrate and regionalize program
implementation and setup special Directorates to guide water resources conservation and management
and technical design.  The reorganization of the provincial water resources institution is being
processed. The Provincial Government is now fully responsible for all O&M of irrigation and in
compliance with decentralization policy the O&M activity will be transferred to the District Level.
The procedures introduced under ISSP I for irrigation O&M were further improved through
simplification of reference operation model, preparation of guidelines for operation procedures,
maintenance procedures, use of needs based budget and use of multi-year budgeting program.
However, problems related to flow measurement and the limitation of the water allocation system has
been a constraint in operation.
Training was provided to 7730 PWRS O&M staff in planning and programming of SM works,
construction supervision and O&M. Training was also provided to WUAs related to turnover, O&M
and ISF. A National level WUAs Coordination Team has been established to streamline WUA's activity



APPENDIX C
Page 5 of 8
and its training. Of the estimated 80,000 WUA's required in Indonesia about 25,347 units are now
functioning.
12.   Others
Dummpil Irrigation Project   The project completed in 1 993 under a separate WB assisted
program experienced operational problems due to canal instability and water shortage. A study and
design was undertaken to repair and improve the system which is being implemented under the JIWMP
program.
Small River Mouths: Five Small River Mouths (SRM) structures implemented under ISSP I
were monitored for performance, stability and O&M needs. The self flushing concept using the tidal
prism has functioned well while the gabion type structure for SRM have proved to be adequate. This
design is proposed to be implemented in other locations.
Rentang Irrigation System: To improve the Rentang Irrigation System operation repairs were
undertaken for 43 km of primary canals, 240 km of secondary canals, 41 primary canal structures
and 227 secondary canal structures. The telemetry and control center at the Rentang Barrage was
put into operation after repairs. All of the repairs and improvement work were completed by March
1995 at a total cost of Rp. 9.47 billion.
Groundwater: The groundwater program started under ISSP I in East Java, Lombok, Central
Sulawesi and South Sulawesi was continued under this program. In all, tubewell irrigation facilities
were completed in 18 DTW's and 78 ITW's with a total command area of 1068 ha. In addition, 21
DTS's and 6 ITW's were drilled, the facilities for which will be completed under a separate program.
Swamp Scheme: The 20,000 ha Mesuji/Tulang Bawang swamp development scheme was
successfully completed. However, increased run-off from upstream due to landuse changes has
created some flooding in parts of the project area which wil require increased drainage capacity.
Programming & Monitoring System (PMSJ: To improve the orderly planning, execution and
sequencing of O&M activities seven PMS modules for inventory, assets, staff information, hydrology,
operation, maintenance and budgeting have been developed and trial operations are underway in two
pilot cabangs in Central and East Java.
Technical Assistance: In all sixteen consultancy packages costing over Rp. 60 billion were
provided under ISSP II. In general the TA program has been well implemented.
13.   Project Sustainability
Through the expansion and strengthening of SM, EOM and ISF the sustainability of irrigation
policy has been further strengthened as it relates to O&M of irrigation and recovery of O&M costs.
However, operational sustainability requires further simplification of procedures; improved water
allocation; better flow measuring techniques; a functional communication system; and improved
staffing. Sustainability of ISF is very much dependent on the initiative of the District authorities;
WUA's understanding of the system needs; adequate irrigation water supply; reduction in ISF
exemption and a mechanism for applying sanctions. Current ISF levels are still below the EOM needs.
PBB collection has improved but needs further strengthening of management of its data base.



APPENDIX C
Page 6 of 8
Sustainability in the turnover schemes has been achieved mainly through SM/EOM, formation
and strengthening of WUA's and through training of farmers. However, in the future it will depend
on the WUA's ability to collect O&M costs from farmers, farmers ability to pay, continued support
from PWRS in the technical areas and financial support through APBD to undertake emergency or
major repairs. For sustainability of groundwater projects in addition to WUA's ability to collect
adequate level of O&M funding, financial provision should be made for periodic replacement of capital
items such as pumps by the WUA's.
The on-going provincial institutional reorganization and creation of river basin institutions for
water management will be important in furthering the implementation of a viable basin water resources
management. This aspect and further measures to improve sustainability in the irrigation sector are
being addressed under the JIWMP program beginning in January 1995.
14.   Performance of Borrower and Bank
Government of Indonesia: The project preparation undertaken with the assistance of
consultants provided a satisfactory basis for project implementation. The organization for project
implementation, staffing and allocation of funds through annual budgets were as set out in the
preparation documents.  The actual GOI funding for O&M  exceeded initial estimates.  The
documentation of the project implementation related to technical and financial aspects is considered
to be adequate. The performance of the consultants appointed by GOI was satisfactory. Some delays
were experienced in consultant procurement for ISF.  Reorganization of DGWRD as well as
programming and budgeting system in 1994 resulted in implementation slow down. All of the
covenants of the Loan agreement were complied with and GOI's performance in implementation is
considered highly satisfactory.
Bank: The World Bank support to continue with a second slice of 4 years to support the GOI
irrigation policies in strengthening irrigation O&M is considered appropriate. The Bank performed well
in orchestrating simplification in the operating procedures, and sequencing of SM and EOM,
improvement to the budgeting process, promoting the institutional and technical aspects of basin
water management and providing prompt approvals for Annual Work Programs and procurement. The
Bank, through its regular supervision mission, provided timely assistance to GOI in implementing the
project. The cooperation between GOI and Bank was very good.
1 5.   Operation Plan of the Post ISSP-11 Project
The performance of post ISSP-11 operation may be observe from the achievement of their
indicators after project completion phase, for that reason monitoring and evaluation plays an important
role. Sub Directorate for Evaluation of Implementation and Program Benefit will evaluate and monitor
most of the key indicates of ISSP-11 covering the following:
15.1  Annual budgetary allocation for irrigation O&M will be prepared and planned in a coordinated
way among BAPPENAS, DGWRD, DG BANGDA and the Province concerned around October. Criteria
for evaluation as has been used and practiced in ISSP-11 will remain to be applied. The annual DIPDA
allocation for Irrigation O&M need to be monitor. Other O&M relevance indicator as described in
column 7 of Policy 1 of ISSP-Detail Action Plan remain to be monitored.
15.2  The participation of beneficiaries in financing the cost of O&M of main irrigation systems need
to be increased, developed and improved. With the present central, provincial an district regulation

the collection of irrigation service fee (ISF), by the institution concerned in the district has enough
room to increase the earning. It may be noted here that improvement and development of the
collecting-institutions in the District still require enough attention. Other relevance Beneficiaries
indicator as described in column 7 of Policy 2 of ISSP. Detail Action remain to be monitored.
15.3  The collection of Irrigation Service Fee (ISF) still to be increase and expanded, the program for
Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Resources Management Project set a target about 1,200,000
ha for JIWMP as an addition to the existing area already under ISF (about 700,000 ha area from ISSP-
11 WB and ADB). A review of condition including area inventory, tenure records, assessment of tertiary
gates, diversion structures, canal lengths between gates, number of water users per tertiary turnout,
relationship to plot owners, holding size, and WUA structure and membership should be conducted
by the relevant sectoral agency in the District. The same apply to activities related pre-implementation
activities entailing a system walk-though, plan of O&M, formulation of needs-based budget, and
service agreement and the stages of implementation covering the listings of planted area, payment
advice, list of harvested areas, final assessment bills to the WUAs and fee collection. Oversight of
ISF is provided by DG PUOD and the actual implementation will be conducted by Bupati, the District
Agricultural Service, District Water Resources Services, nominated Bureau of the District and the
Water User Association as the collector from individual farmer. The coordination of implementory
activities is very important in the District level.
15.4  The Presidential Decree No. 18/1994, Ministry of Public Works (MPW). Decree No.211 /KPTS/
1994 and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) Decree No.80/1994 are a set of regulation that will
affect operational activities of Water Resources Development.  Decentralization will have to be
consider in the development of Institutional building dealing with Water Resources Development.
Activating the PWRC (Provincial Water Resources Committee) Implementation Committee of Water
Resources in the Basin (Panitya Pelaksana Tata Pengaturan Air Wilayah Sungai / PPTPAWS); activating
and functioning the Basin Water Operation Unit or Sat Gas Pengelolaan Sumber Daya Air Wilayah
Sungai will have an attention. The same apply for Irrigation committee and Bamus. Related to the
institution, a capacity building effort will be conducted in the DGWRD with an assistance from ADB.
Key Indicators on Institutional Development such as task description, job title, job analysis, career
planning, man power planning, workplan etc. as developed in ISSP-1 need to be monitored and
reviewed.
15.5   Budgeting & Programming for O&M. Government regulation No.23/1 982 described clearly
concerning the task and distribution of responsibility related to O&M of Irrigation System; the principal
regulation vested in the regulation can be noted as follows
Chapter VIII Article 28:
clause (1) noted that O&M of irrigation system (include the complement structure up to the 50 m
tertiary canal will be the responsibility of the Provincial Government.
clause (2) noted that O&M irrigation system innlude the complement structure of a village, Subak and
the tertiary irrigation system are the responsibility of farmers community using the system.
clause (3) noted that O&M irrigation system include the complement structure owned by a legal body,
social body and individual are the responsibility of the owner.
part 2 of Chapter VIII article 31, clause (1),12),(3) and (4) regulate the responsibility of the
Sustainability of irrigation system include the complement structure.



APPENDIX C
Page 8 of 8
Chapter IX article 35 clause (1),(2),(3),(4) and (5) regulate the responsibility of financing the O&M.
The Government Policy on Irrigation O&M vested in 1987 become the interpretation of the
Government regulation No.23.1982. Further interpretation was elaborated into the Detail Action Plan,
and technically implemented into the project named ISSP-1; ISSP-11 and JIWMP, Swamp Development
11, Ground Water Development and ISDP has also a certain relation with ISSP-I and II.
Attachment 2 of this executive summary described more detail in bahasa Indonesia on how to
implement chapter 15 of this comment.
16.   Conclusion
A number of valuable lessons were learnt during project implementation. These relate to iSF,
SM/EOM, Turnover and Institutional Strengthening. In case of ISF though progress was made it is
necessary to handle the critical activities such as system walk formally through BAMUS instructions;
more frequent updating of data base; promote the motivating role of District officials; develop ISF
trainers team at district level and strengthen the ISF information campaign to cover both the providers
and beneficiaries; and institute a socially acceptable sanction scheme for defaulters. For the SM and
EOM greater attention needs to be provided in preparing system applicable O&M manuals; to further
simplify both the operating and water allocation procedure; include drainage in SM works; better
scrutiny of the needs based budget by Cabangs; include required O&M facilities and equipment in
EOM; and undertake on a priority basis continuing O&M staff training in all EOM/ISF areas. As regards
turnover program the local government role in the development of the WUA's and its guidance is very
critical. A continuing guidance program covering the technical and management aspects has to be
instituted. Institutional development and strengthening both for basin water resources management
and irrigation O&M will have to support decentralization and autonomy policies of the Government in
a more explicit way. This will have to be addressed more specifically in the follow on programs.
