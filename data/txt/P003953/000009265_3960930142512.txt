MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION }ND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDONESIA
FOR AN IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR II (O&M) PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for $225.0
million. The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance
an Irrigation Subsector II (O&M) project. The project is expected to be
cofinanced by the OECF, Japan ($45.0 million), the Governtent of Netherlands
($7.0 million), and the Ford Foundation ($0.3 million).
2.        Background.  Irrigation has absorbed a major part of Bank lending
for Indonesian agriculture over the past two decades, with loans/credits of
some $1.6 billion for 24 operations. In the early years, this contributed to
a large expansion of irrigation infrastructure which assisted Indonesia to
become self-sufficient in rice, at higher levels of per capita consumption
than in the 1950s/60s. Experience with irrigation development has
demonstrated that following the expansion phase, the subsector is facing a
number of technical, financial, institutional and human resource challenges.
These include requirements to: (a) improve quality control; (b) give more
priority for non-construction and O&M activities; (c) address institutional
and human resource constraints; (d) improve the monitoring and evaluation of
irrigation performance and the impact of irrigation on agricultural
production; (e) improve cost recovery mechanisms and provide adequate
counterpart funding; (f) increase beneficiary participation in formalized
Water User Associations (WUAs); (g) give more attention to environmental
impact; and (h) coordinate irrigation programs with agricultural services.
The Indonesian situation reflects that of the whole Bank-financed portfolio in
irrigation reported in the Annual Review of Evaluation Results for 1989 by
OED.
3.        Government has formulated a strategy to deal with the issues.
Increasing recognition of the importance of O&M, and reduced returns to new
investments due to higher costs and lower world rice prices, is leading
Government to redirect its priorities towards efficiently operating and
maintaining existing schemes, and completing irrigated agricultural
development of ongo4ng schemes, particularly those with substantial sunk
investments, in the Outer Islands. In 1987, Government established new
policies and formulated an action program on subsector-wide O&M funding,
institutional strengthening, and cost recovery, initiating a long-term (10-15
year) program of reforms which is supported by the Bank. A first-phase
Irrigation Subsector Project (ISSP, Loan 2880-IND; $234 million) became
effective in January 1988 and is being implemented over a three-year period,
with the loan scheduled to close on July 31, 1991. This project has, to date,
been successful in supporting a change in Government's priorities towards O&M,
initiating key policies related to cost recovery and the privatization of
small public irrigation schemes, and helping commence redefinition of the
roles of central and p-ovincial agencies, in the context of the O&M phase of
development.



4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank supports Government's
objectives in the agriculture sector: a sustainee growth and reduction in
rural poverty, increased productive employment opportunities in rural areas, a
more balanced regional distribution of growth, and food security. Irrigated
agriculture will continue to be important to achieve these objectives,
although the emphasis will continue to shift towards achieving growth through
greater efficiency in water use, and more diverse patterns of production. The
Bank strategy is to support Governmentsi strong focus ons (a) ensuring
efficiency of past irrigation investments, particularly in Java, where the
expansion potential is somewhat limited; (b) improving management and
allocation of water in view of competing demands on water resources, already
emerging in Java; and (c) assessing the potential for and supporting the
expansion of irrigated areas, particularly in the Outer Islands, as needed to
sustain growth in production of food grains required to meet the growing and
changing consumption demand. The Bank would focus most in areas of
institutional structure, organizational strengthening and human resource
development, particularly in the context of multipurpose management of water
on Java, and in the Outer Islands where the provincial capacities are limited.
Private sector involvement in irrigation would be fostered through
privatization of small public irrigation schemes and private development of
groundwater resources in areas with shallow aquifers. Specific, area-targeted
interventions would be supported to promote objectives of regional equity and
poverty alleviation.
5.        The proposed project would focus on sustainability and efficiency of
existing infrastructure through support for O&M, cost recovery, privatization
of small public irrigation systems and strengthening of O&M-related
institutions. It would reflect lessons learned during the first phase,
supported under Loan 2880-IND as outlined in para. 3, including the need to
simplify scheme operations; develop scheme-specific O&M plans; schedule
expenditures on the basis of needs-based budgeting; bring schemes under
efficient O&M only when design and construction deficiencies have been
corrected; and introduce a river basin approach to focus attention on the
coordination of project activities and management and allocation of water
resources. Continued Bank support in a phased manner is required given the
complex policy and institutional adjustments envisaged in the subsector
approach, and the role the Bank can play in coordinating external donor
support for the irrigation subsector. Given the far-reaching objectives
related to cost recovery, privatization, efficient water management and system
maintenance, and decentralization, the Bank needs to continue to provide
support so as to sustain Government commitment, as evidenced in the 1987
Policy Statement and the new four-year Action Plan. The Bank support would
help foster an improved and efficient ut lization and management of the
existing irrigation systems and water resources, which in turn would prevent a
long-term decline in agricultural production and save the economy enormous
rehabilitation expenses in the future.
6.        Project Objectives.  The objecti.es of the proposed project are to:
(a) strengthen cost recovery from irrigation beneficiaries in direct support
of O&M expenditures and to encourage efficient use of water resources, and
support the turnover of small public irrigation schemes to WUAs to decrease
the dependence on Government budgets for O&M, and increase beneficiary
participation; (b) support institutional development entailing improved water
resources management, public expenditure prioritization, and decentralization
effort through strengthening the roles and responsibilities of Provincial



- 3 -
Water Resource Services (PRIS), Irrigation Committees and WUAs; and
(c) improve the physical, programming, budgeting and institutional aspects of
oM  so that the effectiveness of existing systems can be sustained.  Detailed
processes and targets have been formulated for each of these goals.
7.        Project Description.  The proposed project will supports  (a) the
collection of the Irrigation Service Fee (ISF) over about 700,000 ha and
turnover of small public irrigation schemes covering about 130,000 ha to WUAs;
(b) institutional strengthening by providing project and construction quality
control, improving system design and operating procedures, establishing basin-
focused water operations on a pilot basis, supporting WUA establishment and
strengthening activities of training and community organization, instituting a
programming and monitoring (of scheme performance and of benefits) system and
improving environmental assessment capabilities; and (c) minor works on the
irrigation (about 815,000 ha) and swamps (45,000 ha) schemes where only
deferred maintenance and minor systems modification is needed; to allow
introduction of efficient and sustained levels of O&M funding, procedures and
related activities so that by the end of the project period, 1.7 million ha of
irrigated land and 170,000 ha of swamps schemes would be under the B.nk-
supported program; and completion of selected activities commenced under the
ISSP I including monitoring of small river mouths, groundwater development and
completion of one ongoing swamps scheme.
8.        The project is estimated to cost $463.3 million, including $31.5
million in taxes and duties and $3.0 million in reserve procurement of
vehicles. The proposed Bank loan of $225.0 million equivalent will finance 52
percent of financing requirements exclusive of taxes and reserve procurement
of vehicles (about 70 percent if recurrent O&M funding is excluded). A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are included in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are given in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events is shown in Schedule C, and
the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9201-IND, dated May 1,
1991, is being distributed separately.
9.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Government that- (a) the project will be implemented in accordance with the
Policy Statement, and the 4-year Action Plan reviewed and agreed with the
Bank; (b) the ISP areas will be selected by January 1 each year and submitted
to the Bank for its review, as a part of the Annual Work Program; (c) about 40
schemes larger than 150 ha, particularly those adjoining ISP areas, will be
turned over to WUAs, some farmer equity contribution will be required under
the turnover program, and any scheme (to be turned over) requiring special
maintenance funds in excess of the agreed ceiling will require the Bank's
approval; (d) all consultants will be employed under an agreed schedule; and
(e) the annual work programs will be submitted to the Bank by January 1, each
year for its review and comments.
10.       As a condition of loan disbursements against civil works categories
related to Special Maintenance and Efficient O&M, Government would make annual
budgetary allocations as required to sustain O&M and furnish evidence that the
budgeted funds were expended in the previous year for fiscal years 1991192-
1994/95.



11.       Environmental Aspects.  The project has a limited environmental
impact due to the nature of physical works proposed; the fact that there would
be no change in the functional areas$ and generally the small size of schemes
involved. This was confirmed by the environmental screening of all schemes to
be included. The project would support a case svudy of cumulative
environmental effects of various land uses within a river basin and provide
technical training on wetland ecology, to strengthen the environmental impact
assessment capabilities.
12.       Role of Women.  In most regions of Indonesia, women play a prominent
part in irrigated agriculture. Their activities range from transplanting,
weeding and hoeing of rice to marketing as well as farm management decisions.
The project would support a more active participation of women in WUAs, the
Irrigation Committees, and in the training activities.
13.       Project Benefits.  The major benefits expected includes
(a) improved funding of O&M and cost recovery; (b) improved resource
utilization leading to enhanced returns from existing facilities on a
sustained basis; (c) increased participation of the beneficiaries in owning,
managing, operating and maintaining small irrigation schemas; and
(d) strengthened institutions at central, provincial and local levels. In
general, the project will contribute to Government's long-term objectives of
food security and improved water resources management. Indirect benefits will
include favorable effects on revenue generation, human resources and regional
development and the environment. About 2.0 million farm families would
directly benefit from the project, about 15 percent of whom are likely to have
current incomes below the absolute poverty line.
14.       Risks.  The risks include possible delays and unsatisfactory quality
due to continuing need for Governmert officials and local consultants to gain
on the job experience; a possible veakening of Government's commitment to
implement difficult policy decisions; institutional weaknesses, given
requisite changes which are fundamental in nature; and unrealistic farmer
expectations regarding the improved dolivery of service in return for the
payment of a service fee. In addition, a large-scale extension of ISP
collection will be a difficult objective and will entail some risks. These
risks have been minimized through specific measures included in the project
with respect to both processes and targets, more effective use of technical
assistance and strengthened institutional arrangements, especially in the
provinces. The experience of the ISSP I and the lessons learned from it have
been useful in designing the proposed project, and thereby mitigating some of
the risks.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
