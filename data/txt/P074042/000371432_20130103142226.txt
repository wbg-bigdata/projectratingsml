Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

As stated in the PAD, the objectives of the Project were to: (i) develop and strengthen the
institutional capacity of Beka'a Hermel Water and Irrigation Authority (BHWIA), Zahleh
Water Authority (ZWA) and Chamsine Water Authority (CWA); (ii) improve the access
of customers of BHWIA to satisfactory water supply and wastewater services; (iii)
involve the private sector in the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater
facilities; and (iv) rationalize the use of water through the introduction of water meters.

1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Lebanon has long suffered from serious challenges in the provision of potable water,
including gaps in distributional equity across regions, poor water quality and intermittent
supply. Wastewater collection and treatment services have historically lagged behind
those in water; and, despite some recent improvements, the sector is characterized by old
sewerage networks and limited wastewater treatment capacity.

2. Poor water quality and intermittent supply is particularly pervasive throughout the
Beka’a Valley (the capital of which is the City of Ba’albeck), a region which suffers from
pockets of extreme poverty, economic hardship, high rates of illiteracy, limited access to
health care, and a majority of households living on incomes averaging less than 100 USD
a week.

3. In the late 1990’s, the Government of Lebanon (GoL) launched several reforms for
institutional change in the water supply and sanitation sectors. Most notably, Parliament
passed Water Law 221 designed to improve efficiency in service provision, in part
through consolidating many small utilities into four Regional Water Authorities (RWA).
The Water Law was considered to be a proactive step to address the fact that nearly half
of all water produced nationwide was unaccounted for due to leaks, theft and billing
deficiencies, while leaking or overflowing wastewater collection systems posed serious
risk to public health and the environment.

4. Under Law 221, the Beka’a Regional Water Authority (BRWA) was thus formed to
take on the role of service provision for some 572,000 people, absorbing 3 utilities plus
smaller regional water boards. 1 The newly merged BRWA inherited distribution networks
that were in poor physical condition, with very high levels of illegal connections and very
low collection rates from those who were legally connected. In 2001, responsibility for
wastewater treatment and collection was further transferred from local municipalities to
RWA’s.

5. While a major step forward, Water Law 221 did not provide the newly created
RWA’s with the needed autonomy to deliver sustainable water and sanitation services.
Regulatory arrangements for setting tariffs were further neither clear nor transparent. The
newly-created RWA’s consequently responded to financial stress from low subscription
rates and bill collection by reducing the hours of water service, minimizing infrastructure
maintenance and essentially eliminating customer service. As a result, the enforcement of
standards for drinking water and wastewater quality was also limited.

1
  Water Law 221 consolidated the Ba'albeck Hermel Water and Irrigation Authority (BHWIA), Chamsine Water
Authority (CWA) and the Zahle Water Authority (ZWA) into the Beka’a Regional Water Authority originally referred
to in the PDO and PAD.
                                                       1
6. Having worked closely with GoL on the Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction
Program (ERRP-Loan 3562), the World Bank proposed to continue its support through a
water supply and sanitation investment loan in the City of Ba’albeck and surrounding
localities within the Beka’a region. The Ba’albeck Water and Wastewater Project
(BWWP IBRD-71170) evaluated in this ICR, was thus designed to complement
institutional development efforts within the BRWA as well as address infrastructure gaps
unfilled by the ERRP and other earlier investments 2. Between 2003 and 2012, the World
Bank continued to play an active role in the development of the Lebanese water sector,
financing the 2006 West Beka’a Emergency Water Supply Project (TF058085 evaluated
in ICR Report 00002392), the Greater Beirut Water Supply Project (Loan 7967) in 2010
and most recently providing technical assistance for the development of the Ministry of
Energy and Water’s (MOEW) 2012 National Water Sector Strategy.

7. The BWWP project focused on: (i) strengthening the capacity of the BRWA (which
merged the Ba’albeck Hermel Water and Irrigation Water Authority (BHWIA), Zahleh
Water Authority (ZWA) and Chamsine Water Authority (CWA); (ii) improving access of
BHWIA customers to satisfactory water supply and wastewater services through house
connections and extension of network; and (iii) improving efficiency by involving the
private sector in operation and maintenance (O&M) through a Service Contract (SC).

1.2 Project Components

8.    The project comprised the following 5 components:
     • Component 1: Institutional Development (4.25 million USD) which comprised
        the Technical Support Unit (TSU) and a number of individual consultants to
        provide specialist assistance on utility strengthening and capacity building.
     • Component 2: Improving and Increasing Service Coverage for Water Supply
        (12.67 million USD) to include all infrastructure and ancillary equipment required
        for the provision of water supply services to the project area
     • Component 3: Improving and Increasing Service Coverage for Wastewater
        Collection (15.63 million USD) to include all infrastructure and ancillary
        equipment required for the extension of wastewater services to project area.
     • Component 4: Service Contract (7.07 million USD) for the operation and
        maintenance of project infrastructure as well as the existing wastewater treatment
        plant at Iaat and
     • Component 5: Consulting Services (3.48 million USD) to include supervision of
        works and service contracts, studies in the wastewater sector, development and
        implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and other
        consultancy services.




2
  Though the ERRP had for example financed the construction of the Iaat wastewater treatment plant, sewerage lines
from households to the treatment plant were financed by the Ba’albeck Water and Wastewater Project.
                                                        2
1.3    Main Beneficiaries

9.      The project was implemented in a region of Lebanon associated with the lowest
average income levels in the country. These levels remained true during implementation.
In 2009, a Social Impact Analysis (Report No. 48993-LB) of the water and electricity
sectors in Lebanon revealed that the share of poverty in Lebanon remained high in the
Beka’a Valley, where 10 percent of the population lived below the extreme poverty line,
in contrast to the overall national average of less than one percent in extreme poverty.

10.    The project has extended access to improved water and sanitation services to over
138,000 people. Of these, 73,000 individuals are legally subscribed to the BRWA to date.
While the project was not designed to have a direct impact on poverty, the achievements
of a number of its development objectives also have an indirect impact on the poor
through the provision of improved potable water and sewage collection services at a
lower cost than experienced at the time of appraisal.

11.    Furthermore, local farmers surrounding the Iaat WWTP (the majority of whom
are particularly poor), who had previously been irrigating local fields with untreated
sewage, were provided with access to clean wells through the project and with which
they now irrigate local fields. As a result, sewage has been successfully diverted away
from agricultural fields and towards the Iaat wastewater treatment plant, thereby
providing a significant positive public health and environmental impact.

1.4    Original Objectives and Key Indicators

12.      The project development objectives were to: (i) develop and strengthen the
institutional capacity of BHWIA, ZWA and CWA; (ii) improve the access of customers
of BHWIA to satisfactory water supply and wastewater services; (iii) involve the private
sector in the O&M of the water and wastewater facilities; and (iv) rationalize the use of
water through the introduction of water meters.

13.     Original project outcome indicators (PAD Annex 1) included: (i) improvement in
the tariff collection rate; (ii) reduction in Unaccounted for Water (UfW); (iii) population
served with water supply and sanitation; (iv) number of water meters installed; and (v)
implementation of service contracts. The ICR team took the indicators listed in Annex 14
of the PAD as intermediate indicators: (i) increase in service coverage; (ii) number of
connections made for water and wastewater; (iii) number of subscribers; (iv) length of
network constructed under this project for water and sanitation; and (v) appointment of
the technical support unit for BHWIA, ZWA, and CWA.

1.5    Revised PDO and Key Indicators

14.     The PDO was not revised. In 2009, the performance indicators were restructured
in response to a request from CDR to more effectively capture project impacts as follows:

                                            3
      •   Volume of wastewater collected and treated was added as a new indicator -- to
          measure volumes of wastewater treated at the Iaat Treatment Plant. This indicator
          was considered to be a more representative measure of the impact and efficiency
          of the Service Contract.
      •   Unaccounted for water (UfW) was dropped as an indicator due to the inability of
          BRWA to accurately measure UfW due to its inability to estimate losses due to
          billings.
      •   Water tariff established based on volumetric consumption. A tariff based on
          volumetric consumption would link payments to consumption, thus encouraging
          optimized use of water. The value of the project’s metering program was
          predicated on the tariff change, which at the time of the restructuring, was
          actively being sought by the MOEW.
      •   Key BRWA staff hired and trained was added as a project outcome indicator to
          expedite the process of hiring a professional, full-time Managing Director and
          senior staff.
      •   Increase the number of subscriptions to the water supply network shifted this
          indicator from an IO to a higher visibility PDO indicator.

15.     Project components remained the same throughout implementation. However, the
scope of the second phase of works under works contracts was redefined in April 2003,
resulting in one combined package of water and wastewater network construction for
Ba’albeck City and another for the cluster of 18 localities. 3 This new scope allowed for
one contractor per designated location to carry out both water and wastewater services
rather than have multiple contractors in one locality. The consolidation of the packages
led to changes to the pre-qualification and bidding documents, further delaying the
implementation of the second phase of works by 18 months.

1.6       Other Significant changes

16.     Extension of Loan Closing Dates: The Bank extended the project four times
primarily to assist the BRWA with increasing subscriptions. The first extension was for
nine months from December 31, 2007 to September 30, 2008; the second was for 15
months from September 30, 2008 to December 15, 2009; the third extension was for 18
months from December 15, 2009 to June 15, 2011; and the fourth extension was for 12
months from June 15, 2011 to June 15, 2012. A mix of factors, described below, led to
the loan closing extension:

         Project Effectiveness was initially delayed six months due to delayed approval
          from Parliamentary committees and was finally achieved on July 31, 2003. While
          awaiting Effectiveness, the Government requested, and the Bank agreed to, a
          restructuring of the works contracts to merge water and wastewater works instead

 Localities include: Taybe, Hammoudieh, Al Ansar, Majdaloun, Iaat, Brittel, Ham, Hezzine, Hourtaala, Haouch Tal
Safia, Tfail, Douris, Talya, Maaraboun, Nahle, Younine, Tali Abaid.
                                                        4
           of using separate contracts for each. This redefining exercise, with the subsequent
           changes in bidding and prequalification documents, contributed to the works
           contracts being issued 18 months later than projected at appraisal.

          The 2006 Lebanon War further forced a halt to investments that lasted until
           security conditions again permitted access to work sites. Works recommenced
           against a backdrop of two years of ongoing government turmoil, but the pace of
           both civil works and institutional development failed to remain on schedule.

          The BRWA did not campaign for increased subscriptions among project
           beneficiaries until the water and sanitation infrastructure works were
           approaching completion. In a region with long-standing local mistrust of
           government agencies, demonstrating the availability of improved water and
           sanitation services was particularly relevant. As such, it was only once the
           infrastructure was commissioned that the BRWA started campaigning for
           increased subscriptions to the network and even then, continued to distribute
           water in the old network thereby further reducing incentive for beneficiaries to
           subscribe to the BRWA. Accordingly, it was relatively late in project
           implementation that the BRWA recognized local communities’ lack of
           willingness to connect to the network and, in some cases, pay for water services.
           The Bank team accordingly was late in downgrading the performance of the
           project in ISR’s. The BRWA changed strategy accordingly, delivering water only
           to those households that had subscribed. This was however controversial and time
           consuming and thus led to further project delays.

17.    Revision of Legal Covenants Dates: The original project effectiveness date was
extended for six months from January 30, 2003 to June 30, 2003 due to delays within
Parliament. The project became effective on July 31, 2003.

18.    Increased scope of work and service area: At appraisal, GoL expected that
funds would support the installation of 83 km of water lines and 160 km of sewerage
network. Procurement efficiencies allowed for the rehabilitation and extension of the
water supply network to expand from 86 km to 134.5 km to cover new housing
developments and improve access in specific localities not included in the original
contracts. This was carried out through two additional works contracts at the request of
CDR in 2006. 4

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.      As noted above, the BWWP complemented the ERRP, which had earlier financed
infrastructure investments in the Ba’albeck area after the end of the civil war. Facilities
under the ERRP had however fallen short of providing the population with adequate
water or sanitation services. The BWWP was thus designed, in part, to provide
complementary infrastructure, such as wastewater collection lines to feed the Iaat WWTP
earlier financed by the ERRP.

20.     The BWWP was also closely aligned with water sector reform efforts launched by
GoL in the late 1990s. Through the project’s institutional development PDO, the project
aimed to support Water Law 221 in particular by providing targeted institutional
strengthening to the BRWA and ensuring complementarity with previous infrastructure
investment projects.

21.     Ultimately however and despite investments into the institution and significant
improvements in water and sanitation services, subscriptions to the BRWA at project
close fell significantly short of project design levels and as such, no fundamental change
has been experienced in overall utility finances. The utility remains unsustainable as a
self-standing business on both the water and wastewater sides and the project outcomes
are thus rated unsatisfactory with substantial risk to sustainability of investments made.

22.     The PAD is extremely thorough and the ICR team recognizes that a great deal of
time and resources were invested in the development of the design and preparation of the
project. In retrospect, however, the appraisal risk assessment underestimated the severity
of risks to project success. Institutional risks ultimately led to unsatisfactory project
outcomes, as described below:

      •   Slow development of the BRWA: The merging of disparate local water authorities
          to form the BRWA was a long process -- expected to be rapid under Law 221, but
          not actualized until five years later. The five-year gap led to a leadership vacuum
          in BRWA that slowed decisions on financial and procurement policies and left
          implementation bereft of clear institutional rules during the early years of the
          BWWP.

      •   Overestimation of political will: Government approval of the volumetric water
          tariff was cited in the PAD as a potentially controversial issue. At project design,
          MOEW and the Ministry of Finance were reportedly committed to passing
          structural tariff reforms and were responsible for final approval. When this did not
          happen however, key elements of project design and investment, such as the
          metering program, were rendered uneconomic, contributing directly to the
          unsatisfactory project outcome.

                                               6
       •   Misplaced assumptions involving community and service provider relations:
           The appraisal team assessed the demand for connections as a “Negligible? risk,
           failing to foresee the potential disconnect between the BRWA improving
           connection coverage and households actually subscribing to and paying for the
           new network services. Despite strong efforts by CDR and the BRWA teams, once
           extensive new network coverage began to be commissioned, connections did not
           translate into an increase in subscriptions, threatening the economic viability and
           future sustainability of the BRWA.

23.     The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) carried out a formal Quality of Supervision
                                       5
Assessment (QSA6) in October 2004 . The evaluation rated the quality at entry as
Moderately Unsatisfactory, noting that “…procurement matters and institutional and
financial decisions were not advanced enough at the time of the Board presentation.? The
ICR team supports that evaluation based on the failure of the appraisal team to mitigate
key risks to project objectives.

2.2        Monitoring and Evaluation

24.    Monitoring focused on extending services to expand population coverage and on
environmental requirements for compliance with wastewater treatment standards.
Environmental guidelines for effluent sludge were proposed in collaboration with the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and then instituted in April 2010 with the
publication of “Lebanese Guidelines for Sludge Use in Agriculture.? Additionally, an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out by the TSU.

25.     A Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) component planned at the project level was to
be implemented through a rapid social assessment early on in project implementation and
a follow up social assessment midcourse. Neither the rapid nor full social assessment was
carried out during the project lifespan.

26.     In June 2009, the World Bank conducted a Social Impact Assessment of the
Electricity and Water Sectors in Lebanon (Report No. 48993-LB). Results showed that
affordability ranked low in reasons why people did not subscribe or pay for water. The
report emphasized a primary reason raised by residents for not connecting was lack of
access to a public network in the area. Additionally, the report highlighted the critical
need for a metering system to bridge the disconnect between water supply and demand.

27.    Despite limited progress with meter reform and persistently low subscription rates,
BRWA expanded efforts to reach out to communities. In March 2012, the BRWA -- with
the support of a Private Public Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) Grant -- carried

out a customer satisfaction survey of 800 households to better identify community needs
and approaches that would increase subscription levels. 6 Survey outcomes reveal that lack
of access is still a challenge along with concerns about low water pressure, poor water
quality and intermittent supply. A combination of lack of awareness about the availability
of the network (including its benefits and steps to connect) and technical reasons related
to maintenance challenges with the infrastructure network contributes to the overall
connection challenge.

2.3        Post Completion and Next Steps:

28.     Building institutional sustainability is an ongoing process that requires time and
strong leadership. Prior to closing of the loan, The Director General of the BRWA set in
place a strategy to increase subscriptions through enhanced outreach and partnership
development. Had the Director General been appointed at an earlier stage of the BRWA
formation, the institutional process would have likely resulted in a more positive
outcome. Institutional growth is however inevitably impacted by the socio-political
context surrounding it. In a region such as the Beka’a Valley, the political nature of how
local development unfolds is complex and unpredictable, calling for project teams to be
more realistic about feasibility of objectives and timeframe.

29.    Recent data from BRWA reveal an increasing trend of revenues, due to higher
subscription and collection rates (See Table 1) resulting from a targeted outreach program
and promotional discounts. Additionally, BRWA has finalized its five-year business plan
(2012-2016) to recover late fees, optimize records and help further increase subscriptions.
GoL has further authorized the hiring of needed professional staff and has subsidized
revenue shortfalls so that minimum maintenance needs can be met.

30.     The ICR team views the BRWA’s recent measures to increase subscriptions as
promising; however, success at achieving the goal of 24,614 subscriptions will require
the utility to incentivize households with offers that address the concerns raised by
residents. A volumetric tariff would add economic value to BRWA’s metering
capabilities; however, this decision remains outside of BRWA’s control, as do tariff
levels. Until the BRWA is able to sustainably finance its operations, the risk to sustaining
project outcomes remains high even while central government funding ensures at least
minimal water service levels over the short term.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31.    There were no reported divergences or waivers from the Bank’s safeguards and
procedures during implementation. As required, CDR submitted quarterly reports to the
Bank and Bank teams supervised these aspects of project implementation.

32.     Environment: In accordance with requirements in the Environmental
Management Plan, CDR developed an implementation plan in 2007 incorporating the
following activities: (i) guidelines on sludge reuse and the types of crops that could be
irrigated with treated effluent; (ii) a number of workshops on effluent reuse, monitoring
and sampling of water and wastewater quality, along with public awareness campaigns;
and (iii) a program to monitor water supply systems, the wastewater treatment plant and
treated sludge. All activities were carried out with no reported issues.

33.   Social: A total of 106 plots were expropriated to provide land for project works.
The ICR team confirmed during their April 2012 mission that land owners were
compensated as stated by the Ministerial Decree 7848 dated April 30, 2002.

34.    Financial Management: According to official records, financial management
continued to met government and Bank standards. All audits were submitted as required
and acted on where necessary.

35.    Disbursements: Project implementation delays resulted in negligible
disbursements until 2005. The redefinition of the scope of the water and wastewater
works contracts without, initially, a corresponding change in disbursement categories
blocked the disbursement of some funds. In December 6, 2007 the Borrower requested
the creation of a new disbursement category to remedy this problem. The request was
granted and the loan agreement amended as of February 6, 2008. No other changes were
made in disbursement arrangements and Bank supervision verified that all disbursement
requests were properly documented.

36.    Procurement: The Bank agreed to a procurement plan revision which merged
water and sanitation infrastructure into combined contracts, and which initially slowed
                                           9
project implementation. Nonetheless, this merger resulted in significant cost savings
which allowed for CDR to include additional towns and villages in the Ba’albeck area to
be added to project beneficiaries.

37.     Throughout project implementation, Bank supervision teams noted weak
procurement capacity as a consistent issue, leading them to prioritize local training to
strengthen procurement capacity within BRWA and the TSU. A project coordinator
dedicated for procurement was recruited early on in the project to manage contracts and
ensure the Bank guidelines were followed. 7 In 2010, this contract was not renewed and an
understaffed CDR contracts department began to handle procurement issues directly. The
difference was notable, resulting in additional delays and deterioration in the quality of
documentation.

38. An Independent Procurement Review (IPR) carried out in March 2011 concluded
that while Bank guidelines were generally followed, weaknesses in the institutional set up
and more seriously in contract management resulted in unnecessary delays and missed
deadlines. 8.

39.    The World Bank investigated allegations that a contractor awarded an “Operation
and Maintenance contract" misrepresented its past experience in order to be qualified.
The allegations were substantiated and the Bank is in the process of exercising its
remedies.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

40.     As discussed earlier, the project was directly linked to long-term and still relevant,
reform efforts and addressed important issues highly relevant to improving water and
wastewater services. The project is referenced in the 2005 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) (Pillar 3: Resource and Environmental Management which was designed to
contribute to the CAS outcomes of improved water management, land use management
and air pollution control), the 2007 Interim Strategy Note (Pillar 3: Resource and
Environmental Management as described above), and most recently in the 2011-2016
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Tier I – Core Program in which the Ba’albeck
project was reflected as a project under implementation.

41.     Improved water and sanitation remain a high priority for GoL as witnessed by
their inclusion in the Council of Ministers’ December 2011 Economic and Social Reform

7
  By July 2004, the recruitment process at the TSU was fully underway with 7 expert consultants already recruited and
four waiting for the Bank no-objection after completing the selection process. A total of 11 experts were expected to
staff the TSU. (Ba’albeck Water and Wastewater Project Aide Memoire (June 22 – July 6, 2004).

Action Plan reform pillar on Infrastructure Rehabilitation as well as the March 2012
formal adoption of the MOEW National Water Sector Strategy which proposes a detailed
plan for improved water, sanitation and irrigation services and reforms nationwide.

42.     Nonetheless, project design shortcomings left the project particularly vulnerable
to unacknowledged risks that were well known in the sector at the time of appraisal.


3.2 Relevance of Design and Implementation
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

43.     The design and implementation of project infrastructure was within standards and
guidelines of the water and sanitation construction industry. Design and procurement
efficiencies further led to the water and sanitation network being extended to a larger
number of beneficiaries as compared to project design estimates.

44.     Implementation of the BRWA community outreach to increase subscriptions to
the network however was delayed and despite several extensions to the Loan closing date,
did not reach levels anticipated at project design, thereby posing significant risk to its
financial and operational sustainability.

3.3 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Unsatisfactory

45.     A confluence of political and organizational factors delayed the project and
prevented the delivery of three of its development objectives. The sections below
highlight in more detail the main causes of interference, followed by concrete
achievements by component that should be recognized despite the delays. Ultimately,
these successes would not have been possible without the long-term commitment shared
between GoL and Bank teams to completing the project and meeting the objectives.

46.       Contributing causes that prevented project from achieving objectives included:

      •   The absence of a permanent, full-time BRWA Managing Director until late 2009
          created a leadership vacuum that was a critical impediment to achieving progress
          in strengthening institutional capacity. Since his appointment, the Director
          General has emphasized improving the financial sustainability of the BRWA, the
          results of which can be seen in the 8% revenue increase over his first full fiscal
          year on the job (December 2010 - December 2011).

      •   In practice, the newly formed RWAs were operating as an amalgamation of
          separate entities rather than a unified administrative unit until 2005, at which time,
          Parliament passed the by-laws needed for unification. In BRWA’s case,
          difficulties remained given the leadership vacuum.

                                               11
      •   The Lebanese 2006 war was an abrupt event that caused physical damage to the
          national infrastructure – including roads, bridges, and water utilities -- across
          parts of the country and kick-started a two-year internal, political stand-off. The
          project was directly impacted as a result of physical damage to the network
          pipelines and facilities as well as indirectly by further delaying the senior-level
          management appointment at the BRWA.

      •   The appraisal team may have avoided mention of the political dynamics of the
          region for country relationship reasons. While understandable, they
          underestimated the influence that local politics might play in delaying local
          development plans and in influencing household decision-making. This became
          particularly evident in two ways: first, a standoff at the Iaat Treatment Plant as a
          result of farmers opposed to the redirecting of untreated wastewater from their
          fields to the treatment plant and second, the lag in subscriptions where households
          benefiting from the water but not paying found political protection against non-
          payment penalties.

47.       The achievement of each development objective is evaluated below.

Development Objective 1: Develop and strengthen the institutional capacity of
BHWIA, ZWA and CWA. The outcome is rated Unsatisfactory.

48.    At the time of project design, there was a great deal of momentum to implement
the Government’s recent reforms and fill infrastructure gaps not addressed by the ERRP,
primarily focusing on rehabilitation and expansion of the water and sewerage networks.

49.    Despite the Bank team’s early recognition of institutional challenges that lay
ahead for the BRWA (as stated in ISR dated July 8, 2004) and explicit emphasis in the
2006 Mid Term Review on ways to promote long-term private sector engagement,
capacity building, and improved billing and collections to promote the financial
sustainability of the BRWA, the Bank chose not to restructure the loan beyond revising
some project indicators.

50.       By loan closing however, the BRWA demonstrated almost exactly the quality of
sustainability (measured by subscriptions and collections) as it did at appraisal a decade
earlier. It remains dependent on external resources to cover basic delivery of services and
remains unable to provide daily service to subscribers. Key central government support
measures that could have helped, including tariff reform that would encourage
conservation through metering, did not take place as expected.

Development Objective 2: Improve the access of customers of BHWIA to
satisfactory water supply and wastewater services. The outcome is rated
Unsatisfactory.


                                              12
51.     The new water supply network reaches 93 percent of the total population within
the designated project localities as measured by the number of meter boxes installed
within the property line. Households are ultimately responsible for the physical
connection from the meter box to their household unit. Since a unit-by-unit census has
not been carried out to determine actual connection rates, the ICR team rates this
objective against utility records which estimates that, at loan closing, water service
reaches 53 percent of the population within the project area. The BRWA estimates that
wastewater services reach 31 percent of the population within the project area. These
compare to goals of 96 percent and 67 percent, respectively.

52.     The water and wastewater service improvements were carried out in two phases,
with the first phase including the installation of 4,060 meters by the service contractor.
These connections were not based on subscriptions and led to the bulk of the households
drawing water without paying for it. During the second phase, the BRWA requested that
service contractors place meter boxes within the household property line and separately
install meters upon a household’s subscription to the network. Since that time, 9,813 of
the 24,017 available meters have been installed, with the remainder in storage pending
subscriptions.

53.    The July 2010 BWWP Quarterly Report No. 24 confirmed that the second phase
of works was complete. By that date, all households within the project area had meter
boxes (but not necessarily meters) installed within the property line. To connect,
households must individually contract for the plumbing from the meter box to the
household. These new subscribers to the upgraded system must also pay connection fees
of 120,000 LBP (80 USD).

54.     The Bank team worked closely with the BRWA on improving its public relations
and community outreach. Earlier this year, BRWA carried out of a survey of 800
households across 5 localities with the support of a Public Private Infrastructure Advisory
Facility (PPIAF) Grant to better address community needs and increase subscription
levels. Survey outcomes confirm BRWA’s reported access numbers and also confirm
problems with security of supply – only 20 percent of subscribing households receive
water more than four days a week, largely due to the fact that the BRWA does not have
the sufficient funding to pump water on a continuous basis and therefore only provides
partial service. BRWA is wrestling with the fact that meeting service standards requires
a properly funded operation, but consumer confidence and willingness-to-pay will be
forthcoming only with higher quality service. BRWA, with GoL and Bank support, has
recently been addressing this challenge. The likely outcome, however, remains unclear.

55.    At project closing, the Iaat WWTP was receiving sufficient influent to begin
normal operations. However, the pace of wastewater connections has delayed plans and
households continue not to pay for wastewater services. Every new wastewater
connection, therefore, increases the financial stress on BRWA.



                                            13
Development Objective 3: Involve the private sector in the operation and
maintenance of the water and wastewater facilities. The outcome is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

56.     The BWWP was seen as an opportunity to introduce private sector operations and
maintenance through service contracts. This approach was seen as supporting the
efficiencies that came with the hiring flexibility enjoyed by private enterprise, as well as
the performance pressure on a private operator overseen by BRWA. In 2007, a Service
Operator was hired through a management contract to work with the BRWA as part of a
longer-term engagement that would include training and capacity building,
implementation of operational management plans, and an investment fund to support
performance improvements and professional development. Despite significant
performance challenges with the contractor and some delays experienced with the
execution and completion of works in the cluster of 18 localities, CDR and BRWA (with
support from the TSU), worked with the Service Operator to ensure efficient
management of the production wells, distribution system, and wastewater collection and
treatment systems. A Service Contract remains in operation post project closing with
funding provided by the MOEW.

Development Objective 4: Rationalize the use of water through the introduction of
water meters. The outcome is rated Unsatisfactory.

57.    During the early implementation of the project, the BRWA had a policy of
connecting all potential users and installing meters, whether or not they were subscribed
to the new service. Beneficiaries however saw little reason to subscribe if they were
already receiving the water. Thereafter, connections (all metered) were provided only to
subscribers.

58.      The metering component was in anticipation of a national shift to volumetric
tariffs that had been anticipated at the time of appraisal. GoL has not however to date
made the needed policy change and all subscribers pay a fixed annual rate regardless of
their consumption levels. BRWA does not currently read meters, as that would increase
operating costs without a benefit to either the utility or consumers.

3.4 Outputs by components

59.    Component 1: Institutional Development (Estimated Cost: $4.55 million;
actual cost: $2.46 million). This component is rated Unsatisfactory.

60.    While the component achieves two of its key goals: (i) establishment of a TSU
which effectively operated as a support system to the BRWA, working with its interim
management on mainstreaming operating procedures across the three water authorities
that merged to form BRWA, and (ii) the development of a comprehensive five-year
business plan in 2005, these achievements fell short of boosting the institutional capacity
of the BRWA given the delay in appointing permanent leadership and the weakness of
                                            14
   the enabling environment. As a result, the project was not able to meet the performance
   indicators related to this component, including increasing collection rates, and
   introduction of consumption-based metering (See Table 2 below and Annex 4 for
   additional details). 9

             *In the absence of tariff reform, consumers cannot be billed based on consumption despite
             having a meter installed.

   61.    Component 2: Improving and Increasing Service Coverage for Water Supply
   (Estimated Cost: $14.91 million; Actual Cost: $17.69 million). This component is
   rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

   62.     The construction of service networks are fully complete, allowing for the
   connections of 25,664 commercial and residential units in over 45 localities across the
   Ba’albeck - Nabi Chit districts. The project met its infrastructure target, installing 21
   additional km of water distribution lines and 113.5 km of secondary and tertiary water
   distribution lines, exceeding the 83 km target at a lower than anticipated unit cost.

   63.     Despite improvements in infrastructure, subscriber numbers are low and service
   provision is inconsistent as explained above. Yet, while efforts to improve subscription
   rates are slow, there have been gradual increases due to a coordinated commitment from
   the Client teams with support from the World Bank (See Table 3).

   64.    Component 3: Improving and Increasing Service Coverage for the

   $12.16 million). This component is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

       Reduction of UfW was dropped as a key performance indicator in 2009.
                                                               15
65.    The component had five activities: (i) construction of sewerage network; (ii)
extension of treated effluent discharge pipe; (iii) physical improvements to the
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP); (iv) preparation of storage area for the WWTP
sludge; and (v) tertiary treatment at the WWTP.

66.     The Iaat WWTP did not start operations until the sewerage network was complete
in late 2009. Operations however quickly stopped because it was only receiving influent
quantities of 300-700 m3/d – a quantity too low to meet the operational minimum of
2,000 m3/d needed by a plant designed for 12,000 m3/d. While all wastewater connections
were completed by 2010, an average of only 1,500 m3/d reached the WWTP. Farmers
continued to resist the diversion of the wastewater to the plant, as they found the
wastewater cheaper to pump than the freshwater from two alternative wells and also
appreciated the impact of wastewater nutrient loads on their local crops. Hence, regular
operations only started in 2011, after successful reconciliation efforts with the farmers on
improved irrigation practices (which the Bank team played a major role on) ended their
wastewater diversions.

67.      Influent quantities subsequently began to exceed the 2,000 m3/d operational
minimum. The ICR mission in April 2012 confirmed that the plant was by then receiving
flows averaging 8,000 m3/d, with influent quality reported to range from BOD of about
200 mg/l in wet periods to 250 mg/l in dry periods. After treatment, BOD is reported to
be below 25 mg/l. Influent and effluent testing takes place about 3 times a month, by the
American University of Beirut (AUB) and the Ministry of Agriculture. The treated
effluent is chlorinated and discharged to a river, with some flow subsequently taken up
for irrigation. This flow supports around 1,220 hectares of farmland with most farmers
mixing the treated water with well water.

68.     The sludge digester and dewatering system are operating normally. With
sufficient outdoor capacity, the dewatered sludge is stored on a drying pad within plant
boundaries. The latest analysis by the plant manager indicates that the sludge is free of
heavy metals or other toxic materials that would prevent its use on agricultural fields.
However, no plans exist for that use, nor is sludge testing routine.

69.     Component 4: Service Contracts (Estimated Cost: $7.44 million; Actual
Cost: $8.16 million). The objective of this component was to secure satisfactory
maintenance O&M of the water supply and distribution facilities and of the wastewater
collection systems in the Ba'albeck - Nabi Chit areas. This component is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

70.     The Service Operator’s contract scope included installation of meters, increasing
subscriptions, and operating the water network as a well as wastewater services at the Iaat
Wastewater Treatment Plant. As noted above, the latter did not start immediately because
of insufficient flow. Additional responsibilities included systems maintenance, repair and
replacement, provisions for needed operating costs for chemicals, as well as monitoring

                                            16
of water quality and training of BRWA staff. The contractor was also responsible for
developing a plan for future O&M programming.

71.     By 2008, two main challenges faced the Service Operator, namely: increasing
subscriptions and starting operations and maintenance of the wastewater services. The
latter was beyond operator control, as the wastewater diversion by farmers was a
government, not contractor, problem. In response, the service contract was amended to
include rehabilitation and equipping of the wells at two freshwater springs, Mazraat el
Tout and Al Basateen, so that farmers could have a safe alternative to the wastewater.
72.     As for the subscriptions, Lebanese law mandated the Service Operator to be
accompanied by a BRWA representative in approaching households to solicit both
subscription to the network as well as payment of outstanding bills. Without a Director to
oversee this activity and assign BRWA staff to work with the Operators, subscriptions
remained low until the Service Operator’s contract was amended in 2011 by the incoming
Managing Director.

73.    Component 5: Consulting Services (Estimated Cost: $3.66 million; Actual
Cost: $3.97 million). This component is rated Satisfactory.

74.    Supervision of the service contract and construction works was carried out as
planned. Government and Bank teams reviewed the work of the consultants over the
course of project implementation and found it satisfactory.

75.     This component also required the development of action steps to carry out the
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) with a plan of action for implementing
mitigation measures as well as checklists regarding public and occupational safeties. An
environmental consultant was hired as part of this component to provide services in
monitoring the implementation of all mitigation and health measures during construction
and operation and all outputs were delivered as planned.

3.5   Efficiency
Rating: Unsatisfactory

3.5.1   Net Present Value /Economic Rate of Return

76.    While the project was not designed to have a direct impact on poverty, the
achievements of its development objectives would have an indirect impact on the poor
through the provision of improved potable water and sewage collection services at a
lower cost than experienced at the time of appraisal.

Water

77.     The appraisal estimated the project’s ERR at 47 percent. While the PAD does not
state the NPV in the text, the included tables allow that to be calculated as USD 17.4
million. 10 This ICR-stage economic assessment recalculates the ERR and NPV of the
project at closing using the same methodology and baseline numbers as the appraisal-
stage analysis, which measured benefits as the value of additional water to consumers
plus the cost savings of no longer producing non-network water for domestic purposes
(See PAD Annex 4 for details).
78.     In the absence of detailed information on current non-network water production
costs, the recalculation of the economic return to the project is based on three
assumptions. First, all households already connected at the time of project inception
(termed “Group A? in the PAD) remain connected and receive the full level of benefits
assumed at appraisal. Second, all households newly connected to the system (termed
“Group B? in the PAD) receive the full level of benefits assumed for that group at
appraisal. Third, because the population survey shows that substantial non-utility water
use continues, the PAD assumption that those costs would cease with the project is not
realized -- hence the recalculation assumes that those costs did not change.

79.     The major determinant of the project’s economic returns thus becomes the
number of beneficiaries of the new service, for it is this group which enjoyed the greatest
net benefit from the expanded service. At appraisal, the economic analysis estimated that
60,570 individuals already benefited from network water, 11 albeit with the quality and
quantity limitations noted in the PAD. The incremental service number (Group B) is
therefore taken as the 13,070 individuals that can be derived from BRWA’s estimate that
73,640 individuals now receive water service. The recalculation of the ERR and NPV
(with a 10 percent discount rate) yields an ERR of less than zero and a NPV of negative
USD 7.72 million. The water supply component is thus uneconomic at project close.

80.     A successful subscription program could change this outcome through an increase
in the number of beneficiaries, with very little increase in costs. It is also important to
note that despite the economic assessment of the project as described above, efficiencies
in procurement early in the project allowed for the significant expansion of the water
network and subsequent increase in the number of project beneficiaries.




10
   The PAD main text states the ERR as “at 8 – 10%?, but that calculation includes the capital costs of the earlier ERRP
project. Annex 6 (Cost-benefit analysis summary) provides the estimated return to BWWP when ERRP is treated as a
sunk cost. There, it gives the ERR as 70%, but inspection of the tables reveals a double counting that reduces the ERR
to the 47% reported here.
11
   The PAD contains inconsistent estimates of the baseline population coverage, with Annex 4, Table A-5-2 giving the
baseline estimate of 60,570 and Annex 14 providing a baseline estimate of 78,570 people served. The Annex 14
estimate was used to evaluate PDO achievement in this ICR. For consistency with the other aspects of the economic
analysis, the recalculation of the NPV used the PAD Annex 4 baseline. If the Annex 14 baseline were used, the NPV
would be negative USD 17.7 million, representing the entire investment in the water component.
                                                          18
Wastewater

81.     The PAD estimated an ERR of 8 percent, based on 17,000 households connecting
to the wastewater collection system at project close (Table A-5-5). This represents a gain
of 14,000 households compared to appraisal. By project closing, however, the utility
reported 5,882 connected households at the end of 2011, which is a gain of approximately
20 percent of the anticipated additional number of households served. A recalculation of
the ERR using the appraisal methodology, adjusted for the beneficiary household
numbers and treated wastewater volume at project close, leads to an ERR of 2.3 percent
at project close. The NPV is negative both in the appraisal estimate and in the
recalculation. However, the ERR estimates do not take into account unquantified
environmental and health benefits (See Annex 4 for details), so likely understate actual
returns.
3.5.2 Financial Rate of Return

82.    The appraisal did not attempt to calculate a financial rate of return, recognizing
the absence of enterprise accounting and the uncertainty of government policy
outcomes. 12 Instead, it postulated four possible development scenarios, only the most
optimistic of which allowed the utility to recover both O&M and capital costs. In each
scenario, water supply operations covered O&M and wastewater did not. The appraisal
team outlined the financial goal for the utility of revenues covering water O&M by 2007,
but recognizing that wastewater would face structural deficits across the project
implementation period.

83.      The failure to increase subscription and collection rates at the pace anticipated at
appraisal, coupled with GoL not implementing the tariff reforms recommended in the
PAD, has left BRWA unable to achieve the appraisal financial goal of sustainably
financing water supply operations and maintenance. Despite investments into the
institution and in upgrading the level of water and wastewater services, no fundamental
change has been experienced in overall utility finances (See Annex 5 for details). The
utility remains unsustainable as a self-standing business on both the water and wastewater
sides.

3.6 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

84. Although clear progress has been made since the 2009 appointment of the Director
General, this progress has served to bring performance back to the baseline after a decline,
rather than make significant progress toward achievement of the PDOs. The failure of the
national government to follow through on policy reforms anticipated at appraisal,
compounded by war, and a less than satisfactory quality at entry which failed to
acknowledge key risks, created an environment where progress was difficult to achieve.

The quality of the physical investments has been good, but unfortunately not been enough
to deliver sustainable services to the expected beneficiaries.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial.

85. Institutional/Financial Risk: Sustainability of BRWA is dependent on external
resources until subscription levels increase. To date, the BRWA relies on financial
support from CDR and the MOEW to fill the financing gaps created by subscription
shortfalls and growing accounts receivable. Even with this support, network operations
and maintenance are not funded at levels that protect against renewed degradation of the
system despite the efficiencies that come with engaging private sector operators through
service and management contracts. Low collection rates continue to pose a real challenge
to economic viability of the BRWA.

86. Furthermore, BRWA continues to pump water into the old networks, creating a
dual system network, with the Bank-financed new network delivering a higher quality of
water. Only recently did BRWA begin a connection-by-connection audit of the dual
system, ensuring that subscribers were on the new network and notifying old network
households that they will no longer maintain the old network and will, at some point,
decommission it entirely.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1      Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

87.    In October 2004, the Quality Assurance Group carried out a Quality of
Supervision Assessment (QSA6) with the following specific ratings:

1. Focus on Development Effectiveness                                                3
2. Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguard Aspects                                        2
3. Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and Processes                                      3
4. Candor and Quality of Project Performance Ratings                                 4

                   Overall Assessment                                                3

(1= Highly Satisfactory, 2=Satisfactory, 3=Moderately Satisfactory, 4=Moderately Unsatisfactory, 5=Unsatisfactory,
6=Highly Unsatisfactory, NA=Not Applicable)

88.     In addition, the evaluation rated the quality at entry as Moderately Unsatisfactory,
noting that “…procurement matters and institutional and financial decisions were not
advanced enough at the time of the Board presentation.? The ICR team supports this for
the reasons noted earlier in the ICR.

                                                       20
89.     The main issues highlighted in the QSA6 were related to the technical feasibility
of achieving the project development objectives – given the slow start and the short
duration of the project. Specifically, the evaluation stressed the need for the Bank to
intensify its supervision around activities related to strengthening the institutional
capacity of the BRWA and involving the private sector. It stated that failure to achieve
this would compromise the viability of the project and prevent the Authority from
becoming financially sustainable.

90.      During the time of the evaluation, the Bank team was focusing a great deal on
facilitating procurement processes and resolving matters between CDR and the newly
established BRWA around implementation. This was essential to moving the project
forward and the evaluation group recognized it as such. Additionally, the Bank did flag
the urgency of building institutional capacity as stated in the ISRs (dated August 16,
2004) by facilitating cooperation between the BRWA and CDR as well as strengthening
the role of the TSU. However, being that the QSA6 was carried out in 2004 (only a year
after loan effectiveness), the timing of the assessment was premature for any valuable
conclusions to be drawn by the Bank team particularly given that institutional and sector
reforms require long-term attention and turn-around.

Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.    Intensive supervision throughout the project life, including four missions led by
the Sector Manager, focused on institutional issues with the end goal of increasing
subscriptions to the BRWA. Thorough and active, the Bank team’s project supervision
included (i) facilitating discussions between BRWA, CDR and MOEW on the
implementation of volumetric tariffs, (ii) mediating between the BRWA and local
farmers resisting diversions of untreated wastewater to the Iaat wastewater treatment
plant and subsequently mobilizing funding for the construction of freshwater wells to
replace and (iii) securing additional grant funds from the Public Private Infrastructure
Advisory Facility (PPIAF) to assist the BRWA in its awareness raising campaigns to
increase subscriptions.

92.     Achievement of the project results framework proved challenging as described
above, and was further exacerbated by the political and security obstacles posed by a
region where historical mistrust of government agencies was pervasive and law
enforcement extremely challenging. The 2006 mid-term review team thoroughly
documented implementation failures and the challenges with institutional capacity and
local politics. At that stage the project had been delayed 18 months due to lags in
implementation of the second phase of project works and disbursement and a Loan
restructuring should have been considered. In addition, and despite the established delays
and obstacles, the supervision team consistently rated project ISR’s as Moderately
Satisfactory or Satisfactory, leading to a net disconnect between overall project ratings
and those of this ICR. Though the more positive ISR ratings are due to the fact that the
Bank team agreed with BRWA on the need to demonstrate water availability before
                                           21
aggressively pursuing an increase in subscriptions, the Bank team should have better
assessed the local environment and prepared for an eventual lag in responsiveness as was
observed.

93.      Overall, Bank supervision performance is thus evaluated as Moderately
Satisfactory -- downgraded from Satisfactory due to the failure to intervene through a
restructuring once the mid-term review clearly documented four years of no progress on
critical institutional issues and candor in rating of project performance.

Overall Bank performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94.     The overall rating reflects the balance between entry and supervision quality and
reflects the overall project outcome.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     The performance of the implementing agencies – CDR and BRWA -- is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Despite implementation delays, CDR management worked
closely with the Bank and BRWA to resolve issues that blocked project execution,
particularly those issues related to procurement and project management that were their
direct responsibility. BRWA suffered from the multi-year leadership vacuum documented
above and their overall performance was Moderately Unsatisfactory. The TSU under
CDR supervision exerted significant effort in supporting the newly created BRWA and
the positive trend of the past two years bodes well for future performance.

Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

96.     The performance of the borrower is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The delay
until 2009 in appointing a permanent, professional Director General was a major issue
that delayed BRWA’s institutional development. While Law 221 became effective in
2001, the by-laws were passed for the RWAs only in mid-2005. Although a positive, if
belated, step, it had little immediate impact on a leaderless BRWA. Additionally,
although the government had committed to tariff reforms, none were forthcoming.
Government failed to create the enabling environment needed for successful institutional
development in BRWA.

Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

97.    In the case of this project, major delays in implementing key institutional
decisions by the government significantly affected its outcome.

6.     Lessons Learned

98.    The implementation of any water and sanitation project that has the potential of
serving a relatively large population during a time of institutional transition brings with it
its own set of challenges and opportunities for the responsible water authority. In a
country like Lebanon, the outcome is only compounded – often times adversely -- by
additional complexities brought on by weak public institutions, deeply rooted political
tensions, and, in the case of this project, unexpected war. Key lessons learned are thus as
follows:

99.     Modification of consumer behavior is a lengthy process that must be accounted
for in the design and implementation of projects: Despite the project providing target
beneficiaries with significantly improved access to municipal water and sanitation
services, subscriptions to the BRWA lagged significantly over the project period, with a
large number of residents preferring to continue to purchase the more expensive
bottled/tanker water, citing a lack of information and lack of trust in the BRWA’s
operations in the long term. The project had effectively overestimated the community’s
willingness to subscribe, rating the risk that “households might not subscribe? in the PAD
as negligible. Compounding this problem, was the fact that the BRWA continued to
pump water into the old network, thereby adding to the alternatives available to project
beneficiaries and thus further disincentivizing them from subscribing to the new network.

Once launched however, targeted efforts included household surveys, promotional offers,
public consultations, improved customer service relations, and crafted messages via
printed materials and various multi-media – and have reaped positive results. These
recent efforts by the CDR and BRWA are examples of good practice in bridging the gap
between the service provider and customer.

A key lesson learned from this project is thus that the right incentive structure needs to be
incorporated into project design and implementation. Further, greater attention to local
populations and municipal leaders in politically sensitive and fragile environments is
critical. Targeted awareness raising campaigns should thus be carried out early in project
implementation and involve target beneficiaries as early as possible in order to build trust
and reinforce accountability.

100. The implementation of political reforms is a complex process to which project
results should be cautiously linked. The successful implementation of broad-based
reforms, such as those in the Lebanese water sector on which the BWWP depended,
typically requires more time than the typical Bank-funded project life span. Where
                                             23
outcomes are dependent on both high-level and long-term political decision-making,
alternative measures to avert risks that may be out of the control of the project must be
incorporated. In the case of BWWP for example, the tariff structure reform never
materialized and to date still negatively impacts the BRWA’s sustainability. An early
restructuring of the BWWP may have helped avert financial outlays that result in
negative project economic returns.

101. Operations in conflict environments require particular additional attention to
the design of the monitoring and evaluation framework. Preparation of projects which
will be implemented in conflict or post-conflict environments require particular attention
to the monitoring and evaluation framework at the early stages of implementation. The
M&E framework is a key element of the project design which should be re-assessed
frequently during implementation.

102. Strong and sustained leadership as an essential driver for institutional
development. As noted in the West Bekaa Emergency Water Supply Project (ICR
00002392), the delayed appointment of a full-time BRWA Director General impacted its
ability to respond to the urgent need for increasing subscription and collection levels.
Once the leadership position was filled, a community response mechanism to address
these gaps was put in place, albeit late in the project lifecycle. Institutional development
thus requires an internal champion who is both empowered and competent to build
consensus around solutions that can steer the institution toward success as seen by the
promising results on the BWWP subscription program.

103. A procurement coordinator dedicated to the project is essential for processing
standard procedures and facilitating timely submissions per Bank Guidelines. The
absence of a procurement specialist at the TSU during the final two years added
considerable delays to procurement transactions with the World Bank, resulting in missed
deadlines and late payments to contractors. A dedicated specialist is critical to ensure that
Bank guidelines are followed and key project milestones are anticipated in advance to
ensure deadlines are met on time.

                                  Annex 4: Outputs by Component

Component 1: Institutional Development

While the component achieves two of its key goals: (i) the establishment of a Technical
Support Unit (TSU) which effectively operated as a support system to the BRWA,
working with its interim management on mainstreaming operating procedures across the
three Water Authorities that merged to form BRWA, and (ii) the development of a
comprehensive five-year business plan in 2005, these achievements fell short of boosting
the institutional capacity of the BRWA given the delay in appointing permanent
leadership and the weakness of the enabling environment. As a result, the project was not
able to meet the performance indicators related to this component and as stated in the
PAD:

PDO #1: Strengthen the institutional capacity of BHWIA, ZWA and CWA

The first performance indicator related to this PDO is the reduction in unaccounted for
water (UfW) from a baseline measure of 50%, to an expected 30% by loan closing. The
second indicator proposed an improvement in tariff collection from a baseline rate of
35% to an expected 60%. The latest BRWA records (2011) show that the UfW remains
high at 46% 14 and the collection rate stands at 32% -- about half of the expected
performance. The noteworthy gain in the collection rate between 2010 and 2011 reflects
the successful efforts of the new BRWA management in improving financial
performance (see Table 1).

BRWA has exerted significant effort over the last two years to improve subscriptions and
collection rates; and while it is too early to evaluate the long-term impact of the recent
outreach campaign on collections, initial results are promising. In addition to promotions
offered on initial connection (free of charge) and a reduction in annual subscription fees,
BRWA for the first time is also negotiating three-year installment plans to pay overdue
accounts, with a 90% exemption on fines. Additionally, residents are permitted to pay
annual tariffs in two installments rather than as a single lump sum. These measures to

  The ICR team acknowledges that the utility lacks the level of system metering needed to accurately measure this
indicator. However, this was equally true of the baseline indicator and the low level of system maintenance, coupled
with continued supply of water to the parallel (old) supply networks is consistent with continued high loss rates.
                                                        30
spread out the cash demands on households have proven useful in convincing people to
subscribe -- a positive step to ease the burden for many households who might not be able
to afford the initial capital costs of subscription.

However, the challenge with collections goes beyond subscriptions. In many areas,
BRWA chose to lay a new network rather than rehabilitate the old. After installing the
meter boxes within the property line, household owners become responsible for the
plumbing connection between the household unit and the meter. However, BRWA
continues to pump water into the old networks, creating a dual system network, with the
Bank-financed new network delivering a higher quality of water. Only recently did
BRWA begin a connection-by-connection audit of the dual system, ensuring that
subscribers were on the new network and notifying old network households that they will
no longer maintain the old network and will, at some point, cease to put water into it.

PDO #2: Rationalizing the use of water through the introduction of water meters

As discussed above, progress in this area depended on national government action on
tariff reform, coupled with installation of meters. The first has not happened, so the
second would be uneconomic.

Nonetheless, a number of institutional successes are worth noting:

   •   The approval of by-laws for the Regional Water Authorities and development of a
       business plan: In 2005, two milestones were achieved after in supporting the
       institutional aspects of the project: (i) GoL issued the by-laws for the RWAs with
       the intention to clarify administrative policies and improve operations, and (ii) the
       development of a business plan to improve management and financial
       performance. (See Annex 5). A follow up workshop was carried out; and while
       positive, a lack of leadership at the time was debilitating and adversely impacting
       institutional development overall.

   •   The establishment of a Technical Service Unit with the key consultants and
       provision of software packages, IT equipment, office furniture and vehicles: The
       TSU became effective in 2005, after formal and extensive discussions in 2004
       regarding its roles and responsibilities. Since then, it has been providing extensive
       support to the BRWA and assisting in a variety of roles -- ranging from
       development of TORs and mapping current staff to the organizational chart as
       specified by the by-laws to standardizing forms, procedures, systems and tariffs as
       well as more recently data management, administration, and everyday operational
       support to BRWA management.

   •   The appointment of the Director General in 2009: The recruitment of a full-time,
       permanent Director General was a major milestone that has already benefited the
       institution. As part of its institutional restructuring and to boost its human
       resources, the BRWA in April 2012 was authorized and funded to recruit and
                                            31
       train 102 permanent, official employees through the Council for Public Service,
       and has hired a service provider to make available contractors on an as-needed
       basis.

   •   Recruitment of a highly skilled, diverse staff: The 102 recruited staff members are
       in addition to the 225 staff the Authority currently maintains, of whom 57 of them
       will retire by 2015 and an additional 72 by 2022. A large number of recruited
       staff will be bill collectors (which will significantly improve the BRWA’s
       capacity to improve billings and collections) with another large number of staff
       dedicated to irrigation maintenance services, as the BRWA also provides
       irrigation services to the large Beka’a area, in addition to municipal water supply
       and sanitation services.

   •   Implementation of BRWA staff training: A variety of trainings were held to
       develop the professional capacity of BRWA management and staff. This included
       administrative trainings, which covered financial planning, leadership building,
       and human resource management, as well as the very basics in computer trainings
       in MS Windows Excel and word processing. Additionally, a financial training
       program was held in cooperation with a nonprofit financial institution under the
       direct supervision of the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

Component 2: Improving and Increasing Service Coverage for Water Supply

Phases I and II of construction of service networks are fully complete, allowing for the
connections of 25,664 commercial and residential units in over 45 localities across the
Baalbeck-Nabi Chit districts. The project met its infrastructure target, installing 21
additional km of water distribution lines and an additional 113.5 km of secondary and
tertiary water distribution lines, exceeding the 83 km target at a lower than anticipated
unit cost.

                Despite improvements in infrastructure, subscriber numbers are low, UfW is high, and
                service provision is inconsistent as explained in earlier sections. Yet while efforts to
                improve subscription rates are slow, there have been gradual increases due to a
                coordinated commitment from the Client teams, with support from the World Bank (See
                Table 3). 15

While the Iaat Wastewater Treatment Plant did not start operations until late 2009,
operations came to a halt shortly thereafter; the plant received influent quantities of only
300-700 m3/d, too low to meet the operational minimum of 2,000 m3/d needed by a plant
designed for 12,000 m3/d. While all sewer connections were completed by 2010, an
average of only 1,500 m3/d reached the WWTP. Farmers continued to resist the diversion
of the wastewater to the plant, as they found the wastewater cheaper to pump than
freshwater from two alternative wells and also appreciated the benefits of wastewater
nutrient loads on their crops. Hence, regular operations only started in 2011, after
successful reconciliation efforts with the farmers on improved irrigation practices (which
the task team played a major role in) ended their diversion of wastewater and, influent
quantities began to exceed the 2,000 m3/d operational minimum. The ICR mission in
April 2012 confirmed that the plant was by then receiving flows averaging 8,000 m3/d,
with influent quality reported to range from BOD of about 200 mg/l in wet periods to 250
mg/l in dry periods. After treatment, BOD is reported to be below 25 mg/l. Influent and
effluent testing is conducted approximately 3 times a month, by the American University
of Beirut (AUB) and the Ministry of Agriculture. The treated effluent is chlorinated and
discharged to a river, with some flow subsequently taken up for irrigation. This flow
supports around 1,220 hectares of farmland, with most farmers mixing the treated water
with well water.

The sludge digester and dewatering system are now operating normally. With sufficient
outdoor capacity, the dewatered sludge is stored on a drying pad within plant boundaries.
The latest analysis by the plant manager indicates that the sludge is free of heavy metals
or other toxic materials that would prevent its use on agricultural fields. However, no
plans exist for that use, nor is sludge testing routine.

Component 4: Service Contracts

The objective of this component was to secure satisfactory operation and maintenance of
the water supply and distribution facilities and of the wastewater collection systems in the
Ba'albeck-Nabi Chit areas.

Regarding the Service Operator, the contract scope included installation of meters,
increasing subscriptions, and operating the water network as a well as wastewater
services at the Iaat Wastewater Treatment Plant. As noted above, the latter did not start
immediately because of insufficient flow. Additional responsibilities included systems
maintenance, repair and replacement, provisions for needed operating costs for
chemicals, as well as monitoring of water quality and training of BRWA staff. The
contractor was also responsible for developing a plan for future O&M programming.

By 2008, two main challenges faced the Service Operator namely (i) increasing
subscriptions and (ii) starting operations and maintenance of the wastewater services. The
latter was beyond operator control, as the wastewater diversion by farmers was a
government, not contractor, problem. In response, the service contract was amended to
include rehabilitation and equipping of the wells at two freshwater springs, Mazraat el
Tout and Al Basateen, to allow farmers access to a safe alternative to untreated
wastewater.

Component 5: Consulting Services

Supervision of service contract and construction works was carried out as planned.
Government and Bank teams reviewed the work of the consultants over the course of
project implementation and found it Satisfactory.

This component also required the development of action steps to carry out the
Environmental Management Plan with a plan of action for implementing of mitigation
measures as well as checklists of public and occupational safeties. An environmental
consultant was hired as part of this component to provide services in monitoring the
implementation of all mitigation and health measures during construction and operation.

             Annex 5: An Overview of BRWA Consumer Survey Results

Introduction
                                       16
Since its formation in May 2000, the Beka’a Regional Water Authority (BRWA) has
suffered from a number of institutional challenges which threaten its long-term
sustainability. Significant investments in water and wastewater infrastructure in the
Ba’albeck and West Beka’a regions have noticeably improved both the quality and
quantity of supply. However, subscription and collection rates remain low, with only
9,905 household subscriptions in Ba’albeck (out of an estimated 27,614 households) and
5,332 household subscriptions in West Beka’a (out of a total of 16,000 households). The
BRWA wanted to understand why subscription rates were so low and therefore partnered
with the World Bank to determine the multiple factors contributing to residents’
unwillingness to pay. Addressing such drivers would better ensure the BRWA’s
financial and corporate sustainability.

With grant funds from the Public Private Partnership Facility (PPIAF), the MNSSD team
of the World Bank’s Sustainable Development Department for the Middle East and North
Africa Region implemented a survey to better understand customer satisfaction levels of
BRWA’s service provision, consumer perceptions of the authority, and household
decision-making patterns. The survey area encompassed the Ba’albeck and Nabi Chit
localities, with a specific focus on households benefiting from the Ba’albeck Water and
Wastewater Project (BWWP).

Methodology
                                                                17
Five localities were identified to take part in the survey. A representative sample of 800
households from Ba’albeck, Ain Borday, Amichki, Ansar and Douris were selected
through a cluster sampling methodology to provide a cost-effective and time-sensitive
quantitative approach. A survey was designed in close collaboration with BRWA, PARC,
and the PPIAF-World Bank project team. The objective of the survey was to evaluate the
community’s perception of the quality, quantity and cost of water.

Four groups of households were targeted: (i) those who benefit and subscribe, (ii) those
who benefit yet do not subscribe; (iii) those who do not benefit but subscribe, and (iv)
those who do not benefit and do not subscribe. By disaggregating the different groups,
the survey sought to gage any differences in household perceptions – in terms of quality
as well as the thought process behind using network water versus alternative sources.
Main Findings



16
   The BRWA was established after Parliament passed a new water sector law (Water Law 221) in May 2000,
consolidating twenty-two water service authorities into four Regional Water Authorities.
17
   Identification of localities to be surveyed was carried out in consultation with the BRWA.
                                                  36
Overall, the consumer survey results on the number of households benefiting from and /
or subscribing to the public network match figures provided by BRWA on subscription
and collection rates across the Ba’albeck and Nabi Chit localities. According to the utility,
roughly 35% of households are subscribers, with an additional 18% estimated by the
                                                                             18
utility to be connected but not subscribed (a total connection rate of 53%).     Similarly,
                                                                                          19
51% of households surveyed indicated that they benefited from the public water supply.
And among non-subscribers, the survey found that roughly 14% benefited from the
                                                                             20
network – once again, closely corresponding with the Authority’s estimates.

The full survey analysis was presented to the BRWA for assessment and response. For
the purpose of this summary, the analysis of survey results focuses on answering the
following questions:

     •    Why are people not subscribed or if subscribed, not paying?
     •    Among those who are subscribed, are they satisfied with the service?
     •    What are the priority areas for all BRWA beneficiaries?
     •    How do BRWA authorities want to receive information and engage with the
          Authority?

Why are people not subscribed, or if subscribed, not paying?

The survey reveals that over half of households surveyed are non-subscribers. Similar to
the results of the nationwide Social Impact Assessment carried out in 2009, when
residents were questioned about the reason for not subscribing, affordability was ranked
low. Only one percent of respondents indicated that network water was too expensive,
and 87% perceived it as a cheaper alternative to vendor water – indicating an awareness
of cost-savings associated with subscription to the public network. When households
were asked why they did not subscribe, the leading reason was attributed to a lack of
available service in their respective area.

                             Figure 1: Top Reasons for Not Subscribing


18
   It is important to draw a distinction between actual, physical connection to the network and ability to connect to the
network. 93%; it counts only those households physically connected to a meter box installed at the property line. The
survey finds that an investment to improve the distribution system has enabled 93% of project area households to make
formal connections to the network. meter boxes were installed at the property line of households; should households
desire a legal connection to the distribution system, households are required to (a) subscribe and (b) finance the
connection from the household to the meter box.
19
   The proportion of household beneficiaries rises up to 70% in Ba’albeck City, where infrastructure investments were
most concentrated given the high number of households compared to other localities.
20
   When the survey analysis was presented to the BRWA on May 3, 2012, a distinction was made between the rate of
actual household connection (53%) and the rate of ability to connect to a meter box (93%). During this meeting, it was
discovered that the rate of connection was initially measured by the Authority as meter boxes installed – regardless of
whether households were physically connected to the distribution network. Only during the development of the
Implementation and Completion Report (ICR) was the distinction clarified between installation of a meter box and
physical connection to the household.
                                                          37
There are two reasons that possibly explain the perceived lack of access in localities
where significant investments have gone into network infrastructure and delivery of
service:

     1. The first reason is related to the physical connection challenge. When the project
        was first implemented, meter boxes and meters were installed within the property
        line of all households whether or not the owners were active subscribers. BRWA
        believed that connection to the service would encourage subscription, and the
        meters facilitated that. This policy changed mid-way through the project
        implementation when BRWA realized that households were not necessarily
        subscribing after they began enjoying the new service. Therefore, moving
        forward, meter boxes were put in place as the distribution lines were laid, but
        meters were installed only after households subscribed to the service. Without a
        meter present, residents may believe that a connection to the system is not
                  21
        possible. From the utility’s perspective, illegal connections are easy to identify,
        since opening the meter box will allow immediate visual discovery of any
        connection lacking a meter. Households may also have believed that the utility
        would install the service line from the meter box to the house, while in fact that
        remains a household responsibility.          Thus, many households may have
        misunderstood what a connection entailed and therefore confused non-connection
                                            22
        with lack of service in their area.
     2. The second reason relates to the fact that even where new distribution lines have
        been laid, water supply is intermittent, typically 3-4 days of the week and for less
        than 24 hours in those days. In Douris, for example, only 11% of households were
        subscribed while 56% of those subscribed claimed they did not pay their annual


21
  In fact, connections at the meter box are equally easy with or without the meter being present.
22
  It is important to note that awareness of network water cannot necessarily be measured by subscription rate. In
Amichki, where non-subscribers are as high as 90%, the survey team reported illegal connections to the network
through water hoses. Here, households were more likely to be aware there was a network but chose to extract water
without subscribing.
                                                      38
       fees due to dissatisfaction with low water pressure and a lack of service provision.
       Hence, many residents found the intermittent supply to be a legitimate reason not
       to subscribe to the network. As a result of the survey analysis on this point, the
       Director General followed up with municipal officials of Douris to communicate
       the problem and come up with a solution.

Those who are subscribed, are they satisfied with the service?

Despite the investments and improvements in infrastructure, only half of the subscribed
households interviewed were satisfied with the service, with an additional 12% neutral.
Figure 2 shows that among those dissatisfied, the main concern is poor water pressure
followed by complaints about quality of water, quality of service and continuous water
cuts.

                   Figure 2: Reasons for Subscriber Dissatisfaction




Poor water pressure and intermittent water supply continues to be a challenge for
residents in the Ba’albeck and Nabi Chit localities. The volume of water supplied by the
rehabilitated network has increased dramatically over the past decade, delivering
consumption levels somewhere between 156 liters per capita per day (lcd) to 205 lcd per
capita where the new network is available. However, when subscribed households were
asked about their water supply, only 13% of subscribers reported that their water was
supplied 7 days a week and an additional 7% receive water 5 or 6 days a week. Only 4
percent of subscribers receive more than 18 hours a day of water.

A classic problem with intermittent supply is that when treated water is not being pumped
into the distribution lines, pressure in those lines often falls below the pressure of any
surrounding groundwater, which can then leak into the distribution pipes at breaks or
weak joints and be pushed into households once treated water pumping resumes.
Households are aware of the potential for compromised water quality in situations of

                                           39
intermittent supply. Therefore, the reported household perception that bottled and other
vendor water is of a much higher quality than network water is justifiable and helps
explain why 64% continue to use non-network water for one or more purposes, primarily
for drinking or cooking.

These issues were discussed with BRWA and institutional efforts are underway to
monitor and regulate water flow for more equitable distribution.

What are the priority areas for all of BRWA beneficiaries?

When households were questioned about the changes they would like to see take place
regarding the provision of potable water, the top two reasons expressed were continuity
of water supply and improvement in water quality. This corresponds with the
aforementioned concerns and should be the priority of the BRWA – in terms of
guaranteeing that the operational aspects of the networks are fully functioning (for
example, quality monitors are sufficient, maintenance of network is up to date, and
distribution is regulated) as well as communicating improvements to ensure communities
are aware of these improvements.

          Figure 3: Priority of Changes to be seen with the Public Network




In Ba’albeck City, 85% of those unsubscribed said that if continuous water supply and
water quality was guaranteed they would subscribe. This figure is up to 88% of residents
in Douris, where only 11% are subscribed.

How do households want to receive information and learn about BRWA developments?

The BRWA has spent the last two years reaching out to its communities to help increase
subscriptions. Yet, roughly 93% of non-subscribers reported not being aware of
promotional discounts being offered by the utility. Willingness to receive information is
very high with approximately 82% of all households surveyed interested in obtaining
information. Of this percentage, 61 percent responded they would like to receive such
information at least once a month or several times a year.
                                            40
Figure 4 demonstrates that television is rated as the favored media among households to
receive information followed by flyers, personally (e.g. visiting customer service centers),
and through mobile phones. While television costs may be prohibitive, using flyers and
leveraging the BRWA customer service centers are practical means to get the messages
across.

                   Figure 4: Favorite Mean to Receive Information




Conclusion

A combination of reasons contributed to low subscription and collection rates. A long
history of poor service provision across the Beka’a region – combined with a lack of
enforcement due to BRWA’s weak institutional capacity – created little incentive for
households to subscribe. In certain instances, people saw few reasons to move to paying
status if they already received high quality water without paying. In other cases,
households complained of no access to the public network either because of (a) lack of
awareness of the steps required to connect or (b) maintenance challenges where certain
parts of the network were still being fixed.

                                     Annex 6: Economic Analysis

At appraisal, the economic analysis projected an economic rate of return for the water
supply component of the proposed investment of “almost 70 percent? (PAD, p. 12).
Although the calculation was not presented in the PAD, the corresponding NPV is easily
shown to be USD 23.5 million. The PAD analysis contained a conceptual error (a double
counting of a project benefit in Table A-5-3, year 2006) that, once corrected, yields an
expected ERR of 47 percent and an NPV of USD 17.3 million for the USD 15 million
water investment. This very high economic rate of return was ascribed to the fact that
substantial earlier investment provided the water needed to supply a rapidly expanding
distribution system and that the Bank-financed expansion would allow consumers to
substitute lower cost utility water for higher cost alternative sources and to increase
overall water consumption.

The wastewater component was projected to have an economic rate of return of 8 percent
(PAD, p. 12), with the note that additional expected benefits from wastewater collection
and treatment could not be easily quantified, hence were not included. The recorded
economic benefits come from the availability of treated wastewater for irrigation use and
the cost savings to households from switching to wastewater collection from household
septic.

The PAD economic analysis was supported by detailed tables documenting year-by-year
comparisons of “without project? to “with project? for water and wastewater services.

This ICR-stage economic assessment recalculates the ERR and NPV of the project at
closing based on the appraisal-stage analysis methodology. However, the breadth and
quality of available information result in a recalculation that has substantial uncertainty.
For example, the utility knows that they have a large number of unregistered connections
and have estimated the number of such connections. In the project area of Ba’albeck and
Nabi Chit, 35% of households are subscribers, with an additional 18% estimated by the
utility to be connected but not subscribers - for an overall 53% connection rate. 23 A
consumer survey conducted by an independent agency across five localities in the
Ba’albeck-Nabi Chit region found that 51% of households reported that they are
benefiting from the public water supply (See Annex 5 for results of Analysis). 24
According to the same survey, the proportion of household beneficiaries rises up to 70
percent in Ba’albeck city. BRWA reports that the distribution system investment has


23
   Note that the latest information from BRWA places subscriptions at 38. 5% when measured against meter boxes
installed. For the purposes of this analysis, the ICR team assumes that the additional subscribers come from among
those connected but not yet subscribers, thus keeping the 53% connection rate unchanged.
24
   With the support of the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), a field survey of 800 households
was implemented in Ba’albeck, AimChiki, Douris, Ain Bourday, and Ansar over a two-week period in March 2012.
                                                        42
provided potential connections to 93% of the project area households, in the form of
meter boxes at the property line that need only a household investment in the connection
from the box to the household supply system to be operational. This enables the higher
connection rate identified by the survey, although in the absence of a connection-by-
connection census by the utility, the actual rate remains uncertain.

At appraisal, the economic analysis projected the water supply delivered to consumers as
5,920,000 m3 by 2010 (the final year of the PAD analysis). In 2011, the utility reported
that 5,375,720 m3 was consumed from the distribution system, almost 90% of the PAD-
projected amount. This contrasts with an estimated 2,200,000 m3 delivered in 2002. The
project has clearly succeeded in the goal of delivering substantially more water to
consumers.

Although the delivered water volume is close to appraisal estimates, the number of
beneficiaries falls far short of those estimates. On page 49 of the PAD, the appraisal
anticipated service to about 160,000 people by 2010. The utility reports that service in
2011 extended to 73,640 residents in the project area. Based on the number provided by
the utility, service coverage reaches 53 percent of beneficiaries. 25

A measure chosen at appraisal for assessing project economic success was the volume of
water supplied per capita, a volume expected to substantially increase with the project,
going from 55 lcd to 100 lcd in previously connected households and from 34 lcd to 100
lcd in newly connected households. In practice, the increase has been much larger, with
the after-project per capita consumption level somewhere between 156 lcd to 205 lcd,
depending on the actual number of beneficiaries. Therefore, for those connected, network
water consumption levels have more than met expectations.

A second aspect of trying to understand the economic impact of the project is to look at
water consumption from non-network sources. At appraisal, it was expected that such
consumption would end for households with network connections, as continuity and
quality of supply would be sufficient for households to stop using the more expensive
vendor water. At the time of the ICR, the only available evidence on water use practices
comes from the PPIAF household survey. That survey shows that among BRWA
subscribers in the Ba’albeck area, 64% continue to use non-network water for one or
more purposes, primarily for drinking or cooking. Those surveyed stated that the primary
reason for continuing use of non-network water was the perception that bottled and other
vendor water is of a much higher quality than network water.

One reason for consumer caution about network water quality is the fact that the utility
has not been able to consistently supply water, either within or across days of the week.
In the survey, only 13% of subscribers report that their water is supplied 7 days a week
and an additional 7% receive water 5 or 6 days a week. Only 4% of subscribers receive

more than 18 hours of water per day. A classic problem with intermittent supply is that
contaminated groundwater can enter the distribution system, so households may be
justified in their continued use of other water sources, particularly for drinking water, the
point of highest vulnerability for health.

The appraisal economic analysis measured the value of additional water to consumers
and added in the cost savings of no longer using non-network water for domestic
purposes. In the absence of detailed information about current non-network water costs to
households, the recalculation of the economic return to the project is based on three
simple assumptions. First, all households already connected at the time of project
inception (termed “Group A? in the PAD) remain connected and receive the full level of
benefits assumed at appraisal. Second, all households newly connected to the system
(termed “Group B? in the PAD) receive the full level of benefits assumed for that group
at appraisal. Third, because substantial non-utility water costs continue, the PAD
assumption that those costs would cease with the project is not realized, hence the
recalculation assumes that those costs continue.

With the adjustments described in the previous paragraph, the major determinant of the
project’s economic returns becomes the incremental number of beneficiaries of the new
service, for it was that group which enjoyed the greatest net benefit from the expanded
service. At appraisal, an estimated 60,570 individuals already benefited from network
water (Group A), albeit with the quality and quantity limitations noted in the PAD. 26 The
incremental service number (Group B) is therefore 13,070 individuals based on the
BRWA estimate of beneficiaries at project close. The recalculation of the ERR and NPV
(with a 10% discount rate) was run using the PAD estimates of the economic cost of
service and economic value of the water supply, with the following results:

                                      Project Economic Outcome

                   ERR(%)                                 NPV (million USD)
                   <0                                     -7.72

Benefit delay: the analysis does not take into account benefit delay, but instead assumes
that the impact of project delays was to shift all investments and benefits pari passu to a
later period. While this approximates the actual investment profile, a fuller accounting of
the investment cycle would further reduce the apparent returns.




26
  The PAD contains inconsistent estimates of the baseline population coverage, with Annex 14 providing a baseline
estimate of 78,570 people served. The Annex 14 estimate was used to evaluate PDO achievement. For consistency with
the other aspects of the economic analysis, the recalculation of the NPV used the PAD Annex 4 baseline presented in
this paragraph. If the Annex 14 baseline were used, the NPV would be negative USD 17.7 million, representing the
entire investment in the water component.


                                                       44
Wastewater

The recalculation of the ERR and NPV for wastewater is more straightforward than for
water, because connection to the new collection system is easier to control and the utility
record of connections is not challenged by other sources. The PAD did not present the
NPV estimate, but, as with water, this is easily derived from the PAD and is USD -2.21
million. The NPV is negative because the ERR is below the 10% cost of capital used in
the PAD. The PAD rightly notes that additional, non-quantified, benefits can be expected
from a built-out collection and treatment system, so the PAD appraisal estimate should be
treated as a lower bound. This reasoning holds for the recalculation, which is intended
only to compare the situation at project close with the appraisal estimate. No effort was
made at ICR to quantify benefits not quantified at appraisal, because the appraisal-stage
quantification challenges remain unchanged.

The economic benefit of the wastewater connections comes in the form of averted costs
otherwise borne by households relying on septic tanks. An additional economic benefit
derives from the availability of treated wastewater for irrigation use in a water-stressed
agricultural environment. The underlying values given to these uses were not restudied at
ICR. Rather, the appraisal values were applied, with adjustments made based on the
number of benefiting households and the volume of treated irrigation water produced.
The PAD estimated that 17,000 households would be connected to the wastewater
collection system at project close (Table A-5-5). This represents a gain of 14,000
households compared to appraisal. The utility reported 5,882 connected households at the
end of 2011, which is a gain of approximately 20% of the anticipated additional number
of households served.

The wastewater treatment plant has only very recently begun to function, as flows were
inadequate to support the treatment technology until (2011). On the ICR mission, plant
operators reported an average flow of 8,000m3/day, indicating treated wastewater
production of 90% of the volume anticipated in the PAD.

A recalculation of the ERR and NPV, adjusted for the beneficiary household numbers
and treated wastewater volume at project close, lead to a recalculated ERR of 2.3% and
NPV of USD -6.24 million. However, as noted above, these figures do not take into
account unquantified environmental and health benefits.

Benefit delay: as with the water economics analysis, the wastewater analysis does not
take into account benefit delay, but instead assumes that the impact of project delays was
to shift all investments and benefits to a later period.

                              Annex 7: Financial Analysis

The objective of the financial analysis was to determine the ability of the water and
wastewater utility (BHWIA at appraisal, BRWA after the consolidation that had been
anticipated at appraisal) to pay the operations and maintenance costs of the system. The
capital costs were assumed to continue to be fully absorbed by the national government.

The financial analysis made a number of assumptions, key among them being:

       “Water billing. Non-metered customers are charged a flat fee, while metered
       customers are charged by volume of water consumed based on a proposed tariff
       structure to be introduced within the project life. It is expected that most
       connections will be metered by the end of the project. Collection rate, presently
       35% will reach 60% once water delivery and service is improved.? (PAD, p. 58)
       and

       “It is estimated that by year 2004, 23,000 subscribers would have been connected
       to the water network and 6,000 new subscribers connected to the sewer network.?
       (PAD, p. 59).

The analysis then looked at four scenarios, with the key differences among them being in
the level of the tariff (including for wastewater) and collection rates. Based on these
assumptions, the analysis detailed potential financial outcomes for the utility. The
national government has, to date, not moved forward with volumetric tariffs, hence the
underlying assumption of the move to metered water use has not been made, nor have
base tariffs been raised. The government has also not implemented the wastewater tariffs
anticipated at appraisal. The base case scenario and the three alternatives all assume that
these tariff changes would be made and therefore none of the four scenarios can be
usefully assessed.

Two other elements of the financial analysis, those being the number of subscribers to the
service and the collection efficiency of the flat annual tariff for subscribers, can be
assessed. The PAD (p. 48) reports 10,095 subscribers in Ba’albeck in the year 2001,
while BRWA now reports that they have 9,728 subscribers in the project area. The drop
in consumer numbers is reportedly due to BRWA dropping subscriptions of households
no longer receiving water services, combined with low willingness to subscribe among
households being given upgraded services. The collection efficiency at appraisal was a
reported 35%, while the latest BRWA figures show a 32.2% collection efficiency at the
end of 2011. These two factors – subscriptions less than half the anticipated number and
no improvement in collection rates -- combine to leave BRWA with a very weak revenue
base.

Unsurprisingly, given the government’s failure to change the tariff system and the
utility’s failure to successfully enroll and collect from households as system subscribers,
                                            46
the characterization of the utility’s financial condition at the time of appraisal: “The
financial performance of the three authorities during the previous years has been
unsatisfactory? continues to define that performance. Despite investments in institution
and in upgrading the level of water and wastewater services, no fundamental change has
been experienced in utility finances. The utility lacks the resources to meet O&M needs,
as demonstrated by the fact that the unaccounted for water rates at project close were
unchanged from the 50% rate documented at appraisal.

The BRWA generated LL 8.2 billion (USD 5.4 million) in operating revenue in 2011,
against a reported LL 9.7 billion (USD 6.4 million) in operating costs. The latter do not
include the cost of the operations contractor, which totals approximately USD 2 million
from July 2011 – June 2012. In addition to their operating revenue, BRWA received a
total of LL 10.3 billion (USD 6.9 million in extraordinary transfers from the national
budget) to support future investments, leaving them with a positive cash balance at the
end of the fiscal year. BRWA maintains its records on a cash basis. The utility was not
able to share its records of accounts payable with the ICR team. At appraisal, the Bank
team noted that the utility had significant overdue payables for electricity consumed and
to the social security system.

For reasons external and internal, BRWA has been unable to achieve the financial goal
hoped for at appraisal, that of sustainably financing their maintenance O&M. The
sustainable operation of the utility and of the investments financed under the loan will
depend on continued ad hoc transfers from the national government.

         Dear Mr. Belhaj,

                     Subject: Ba 'a/beck Water and Waste Water Project- Loan# 7117-LE
                               1mplementation Completion and Results Report

         We refer to the World Bank's letter dated November 15,2012, pertaining to the Baalbeck
         Water and Sanitation Project.

         After review of the attached Draft Implementation Completion Rep01i (ICR) dated
         November 2, 2012, and prior to distribution to the World Bank's Board and public
         disclosure, we herein detail our comments on a number of components of the report for
         your review and inclusion in the final draft of the ICR.

         1- Regarding the physical works as they pertain to completing the works executed under
            the previous loan (ERPP- no.3582), they were completed in accordance with most of
            the original project requirements. The water networks and house connections, as well
            as the waste water networks needed to feed the Baalbeck WWTP with the required
            flow, were completed successfully as the loan was extended.

         2- The delays in the execution of the physical works were due to the 2006 war and to
            bureaucratic obstacles that have already been detailed in the ICR. Please note that the
            geographical scope of the waste water networks was increased as five towns were
            added to the project to maximize the needed flow for the WWTP.

         3- The major factor in the delay of the project, as well as the less than optimal results,
            was the lack of success in the institutional reform component of the project. This was
            due to the following factors:

              a. The staffing required under the implementation Decrees of the Law 221, was not
                 implemented by the Government due to the internal political situation since 2005
                 and after the 2006 war. While the merging of the Water Authorities was delayed
                 by 5 years, the BWE was without a General Manager for most of the loan period,
                 which meant that the BWE was unable to process and implement most of the
                 institutional capacity activities funded under the project.

              b. The absence of the needed qualified staff at BWE led in tum to the dissipation
                 over time of the activities of the TSU as its efforts were not institutionalized into
                 the BWE's corporate culture.



                                                                                                   ./..

            c. Mol'eo ver. as the DWE wns institutio nally ineffectual, the work under1aken to
               execute the house-connections in order to improve revenues, lost momentum and
               thus the billing and tarin collection did not show improvement till the ltiSt 2 years
               of the loan period.

            d. The institutional absence of BWE meam that the service conlroct funded under
               the loan to provide adequate O&M of the executed works could not be taken over
               by the l3WE and sustojn its operations. This has forced the Government to secure
               funds for O&M services for 2 years post the World Bank loan closing date.

        Plea:Jse note tbnt marked improvements in the r:.erfonn:mce of Ute 13\VE have been
        witnessed in the htst 2 years after the appOintment of the current General Manager, and
