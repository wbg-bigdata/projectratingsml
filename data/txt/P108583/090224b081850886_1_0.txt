                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR of phase II-B of the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety and Security (WCAATSSP) project. It is based on the preliminary life-cycle assessment of the
                         performance of the Senegal and Benin components of the WCAATSSP.

                         A. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes


                                                                                                                                                                                                              Page 1 of 8
                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                        Report No: ISR9160



                         Overall implementation progress is rated moderately unsatisfactory. That's because both in Senegal and Benin, the IP rating has been considered "moderately unsatisfactory", as a
                         result of the low pace of implementation in the case of Benin on one hand and on another hand the temporally cancellation of the videosurveillance (CCTV).
                         The following factors affected both Senegal and Benin components of WCAATSSP: (i) initial difficulties in the preparation of terms of references and technical specifications of key
                         project activities; (ii) significant delays beyond the control of the implementation units (ANAC in Benin and ANACIM in Senegal) in the approval processes to ratify revised Civil

                         Aviation codes and in the approval of key decrees such as the establishment of an Accident Investigation Unit in Senegal. This in turn had serious repercussions on the pace of
                         implementation of the project since the start of key activities, namely the procurement of equipment, was linked to the approval of said documents; (iii) the limited window of
                         opportunity to have an ICAO audit to confirm the compliance rates derived by self-evaluation; and (iv) the costs of the project were overestimated (about 20 to 30% in the case of
                         Benin). The lower than expected costs in procuring most activities both in Benin and Senegal equally contributed significantly to costs savings which depressed disbursement but
                         allowed some additional activities to be implemented.

                         What follows is a summary of key factors that have affected the implementation of each national component:

                         (a) Senegal component: Effectiveness of the credit agreement was delayed by more than seven months. This resulted in significant delays in the implementation of key project
                         activities, and created a disbursement lag of about 8 months which was never re-absorbed throughout the life of the project. Furthermore, a major issue that impacted the
                         implementation of the Senegal component was the decision in mid-2011 by the Government to cancel the procurement of the video surveillance equipment for the Leopold Sédar
                         Senghor Airport (LSS), which at that time was ready to disburse about 20% of the credit amount. This decision was overturned a year later by the new Government that took office.
                         Project implementation was equally affected by the fact that the Government took a long time to finalize the arrangements in terms of management of the aeronautic medical center,
                         and to finalize the funding and the procurement of works to rehabilitate the buildings that would house the Aeronautic medical center and the Search and rescue center.
                         Consequently, procurement of equipment to be purchased by the project for the two centers was delayed.

                         (b) Benin component: The component was declared effective in August 2009 before the end of the initial effectiveness deadline. Initially implementation and disbursements were
                         satisfactory. However, by mid-2010, the Benin component was negatively impacted by the slow national procurement processes which resulted in significant delays in the
                         implementation of key project activities such as the implementation of the training plan and the preparation of the airport crisis simulation exercise. Furthermore, implementation
                         progress of the Benin component was affected by the two complaints registered in the procurement process of key equipment to be purchased under the project and which were
                         essential to the attainment of PDOs.

                         B. Achievement of PDOs and overall outcome of the project
                         Achievement of PDOs is based on the combined assessment of key outcome indicators of the Senegal and Benin components. It is given a preliminary overall rating of “Moderately
                         Unsatisfactory? (MS for Senegal and MU for Benin) based on the fact that actual level of KPIs in terms of safety and security are short of end of project targets as per ICAO
                         standards. However, with regards to baseline thresholds, most KPIs have su bstantially improved especially in the case for Senegal as elaborated below.

                         In both Senegal and Benin, the extensive training program for civil aviation staff in Safety and Security yielded positive results and has drastically improved the compliance rate with
                         respect to ICAO standards in terms of percentage of staff trained (as detailed below). It is expected that this momentum generated in building staff capacity will be sustained after
                         project closing since civil aviation authorities in both countries have registered significant increases of their financial resources dedicated to Safety and Security.

                         (a) Senegal: With regards to aviation security, all three outcome indicators have been met or exceeded. Indeed, the security compliance rate has improved from 28% in 2008 to
                         81.6% as per the September 2012 WAEMU audit. Furthermore, all security inspectors have been trained within the last three years compared to only 45% in 2008. The National
                         Airport security plan was approved by ICAO. Finally, the third outcome indicator which is the share of the budget of the civil aviation authority earmarked for security stands at
                         CFAF3.4 billion compared to an end of project target of CFAF3.3 billion.

                         With regards to safety, although the outcome indicators have improved compared to baseline figures, they remain short of the end of project targets. Safety compliance rate as
                         verified by a July 2012 independent audit stands at 67% compared to a baseline of 58% and a target of 85%. Furthermore, safety compliance rate of technical staff is rated at 70%
                         compared to a target of 85%. The overall budget of the civil aviation agency has increased to CFAF5.05 billion compared to a target of CFAF4.76 billion and a baseline of CFAF3.4
                         billion.

                         (b) Benin: With regards to security, a follow-up audit must be conducted by project closing. The audit is necessary in order to document the expected improvements in security

                         compliance resulting from the implementation of the action plan of the 2011 ICAO audit. In the meantime compliance rate is kept at 32%, the same as the baseline situation. 65% of
                         security inspectors have been trained within the last three years compared to a baseline of 20% as against a target of 50%. Furthermore, the National Airport security plan was
                         approved by ICAO and the share of the budget of the civil aviation authority earmarked for security exceeds end of project target by 500% (CFAF1.89 billion as against a target of
                         CFAF0.38.billion).

                         With regards to safety, key outcome indicators are only partially achieved. In fact, safety compliance rate as verified by an independent audit stands at 43% compared to a baseline of
                         20% and a target of 60%. Furthermore, safety compliance rate of technical staff is rated at 11% compared to a target of 50%. On a more positive note, overall budget of the civil
                         aviation agency largely exceeded target value of CFAF1.40 billion. Indeed, the current budget is CFAF2.98 billion compared to a baseline value of CFAF1.18 billion.

                         C. Assessment of Borrower performance
                         Combined preliminary rating of Borrower performance is “Moderately Unsatisfactory? for the following reasons:

                         (a) Senegal: In Senegal, the performance of the project implementing unit (PIU) was satisfactory: initial difficulties in terms of procurement were rapidly resolved; Financial
                         management was satisfactory and all audits to date are unqualified. However, overall borrower performance was negatively impacted by the decision of the Government relative to
                         the video surveillance equipment and the delays in approval of the civil aviation code and other decrees. Such issues were beyond the control of the PIU. Furthermore, the steering
                         committee of the project did not provide enough support to the project at critical times, in particular regarding the video surveillance equipment and the approval process for the civil
                         aviation code and the Accident Investigation Unit.

                         (b) Benin: Overall Borrower performance is unsatisfactory: (a) The performance of the PIU was moderately unsatisfactory mainly due to the slow pace of project implementation and
                         lack of proactivity in addressing procurement delays; (b) The performance of the Government was unsatisfactory mainly because of the structural procurement issues in the country
                         which resulted in procurement delays as long as 10 months. However, Financial management was overall satisfactory.

                         D. Relevance: The project design was relevant to the country’s development priorities and the needs in the Air Transport Safety and Security. The project objectives were clear,
                         relevant and important to improve sector policy and strengthening institutional management. The project components had a good linkage with the project objectives. The project also
                         contributed to improving the compliance rate with respect to ICAO standards as per the audit report at project start. The project objectives were also in line with the West and Central
                         Africa Air Transport Safety and Security priorities, which targeted the (i) improvement of national Civil Aviation Authorities' (CAAs') compliance with International Civil Aviation
                         Organization's (ICAO's) safety standards, (ii) increase of national CAA's compliance with ICAO's security standards, and (iii) enhancement of the main international airports'
                         compliance with ICAO's security standards.

                         E. Lessons learned: what follows are preliminary lessons drawn from the implementation of the project. They will be refined in the implementation completion and results report (ICR)
                         of the project.
                         (a) The Mainstreaming of the project implementation units within the National Civil Aviation Agencies was beneficial in terms of capacity building. However, it has slowed the
                         implementation of the project because the Agencies had very little knowledge if any of Bank procedures. The learning process was especially long in the case of the Benin
                         component.

                         (b) For this type of specific technical assistance project, training programs must be carefully designed during project preparation to ensure alignment with PDO and to avoid programs
                         that are too generic.

                         (c) The specificity of the aviation sub-sector in terms of procurement of equipment was such that the countries of the second phase of the program were able to buy at lower prices
                         than the first phase. That’s because, by the time the second phase was launched, vendors had a better idea of the demand.

                         (d) In light of limited competition for the supply of goods for civil aviation, project preparation should consider customizing procurement arrangements in line with Bank procurement
                         guidelines.

                         (e) Partial closure/extensions of components of regional projects must be considered in order to provide more flexibility in implementation, especially for countries that are good
                         performers.
