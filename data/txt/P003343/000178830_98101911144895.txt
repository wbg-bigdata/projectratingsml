CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
Since January 1975, the Burmese Kyat has been officially valued
at 7.743 to the IMF Special Drawing Right (SDR) and consequently its value
floats relative to other currencies. Recently, the US Dollar was valued
at 1.20 to the SDR. The following exchange rate between Kyats and Dollars
is used throughout this report, except where stated otherwise:
US$1.00      =  Kyat (K) 6.5

BURMA
APPRAISAL OF THE
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The agricultural crop sector accounts for 27% of Burma's GDP and
60% of its export, and supports a large share of its domestic manufacturing,
transportation and commerce. During the last decade, as a result of the low
priority placed on public resource allocation, low price incentives, limited
input supplies and inadequate supporting services, agricultural production
stagnated. Paddy production increased by 0.2% per year, while population grew
by 2.2% per year. Abandoned paddyland now stands at about one million ac in
Lower Burma. Rice export has dwindled from 1.3 million tons in 1965 to less
than 200,000 tons in 1975.
ii.       The Government has recently changed its policy by giving priority
to increasing agricultural production--for expanding export (rice and jute)
and substituting import (cotton). This project would be the fourth Bank agri-
cultural project in Burma, but the first in a proposed series of improving
the existing cultivated land and reclaiming abandoned paddyland in Lower
Burma.
iii.      The project would:  construct minor flood embankments, drains and
sluices for 11 islands to protect 120,000 ac of existing farm land from
floods and salt water intrusion; reclaim 65,000 ac of abandoned paddyland;
provide equipment for construction, maintenance, land reclamation, farming and
lift irrigation; construct fertilizer godowns and farm machinery workshops;
strengthen agricultural extension and other supporting services; conduct
hydrological investigations to identify a series of future paddyland develop-
ment projects; and prepare a feasibility report for grain storage and handling.
The estimated cost of the project is US$54 million equivalent, of which US$25
million or about 46% would be foreign exchange. Except for small off-the-
shelf items all contracts for equipment would be awarded after international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group Procurement Guidelines.
The civil works, being mainly earthwork, scattered over 11 islands, spanning
over 1,200 mi, and subject to seasonal weather interruption, would be
constructed by Government force account. Project implementation would take
six years.
iv.       The primary benefit from the project would be an increase in the
production of rice and jute for export with some miscellaneous food crops
for improving domestic supplies. About 12,800 existing farm families, and
5,500 landless families who are to be allotted plots of the reclaimed land
would benefit directly from the project. Production would increase from the
present 68,000 tons of paddy, 2,000 tons of jute and 4,300 tons of miscella-
neous crops to 227,000 tons of paddy, 8,000 tons of jute and 27,000 tons of
miscellaneous crops at a full development in 1988. Without the project, the
corresponding production would be 76,000 tons, 2,500 tons and 4,400 tons,
respectively.



- ii -
v.        The net foreign exchange earnings from the incremental rice and
jute production would be around US$28 million per year. The economic rate of
return of the project would be about 30%. The project is simple in design and
construction, quick yielding and low in cost (about US$280 per ac land devel-
oped). It can be easily replicated elsewhere in Lower Burma.
vi.       The project would substantially improve the conditions of low income
farmers. Some 80% of the existing landless families in the polders would
obtain their own land to operate on. The project would increase farm incomes
two to three times. In addition, through the increase in farm labor require-
ments, the project would more than double employment opportunities, primarily
for the remaining landless families, and consequently would directly improve
the earning capacities of more than 75% of all project households. Increased
use of farm machinery is planned by the project.
vii.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$30 million, which
represents the foreign exchange component and about 17% of the local component
of project costs. The credit would contribute 56% of the total cost. The
Borrower would be the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma.



BURMA
APPRAISAL OF THE
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPtENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma
(GOB) has requested IDA assistance in financing the first in a series of
paddyland development projects. The project would protect 185,000 ac of
arable land in the Irrawaddy Delta of the Lower Burma from flooding and
salt water intrusion, reclaim abandoned paddyland, strengthen extension
and other agricultural supporting services, expand dry season irrigation,
construct fertilizer godowns and field machine workshops, provide con-
struction and farm equipment and small low-lift pumps, and finance hydro-
logical investigations and a paddy storage study for planning future projects.
1.02      Following the dialogue between GOB and the 1973 Appraisal Mission
for the Irrigation I Project (Credit No. 483-Ba) and the recommendation of
the IDA 1974 Economic Mission, this project was identified and prepared
by a Government Project Preparation Committee with assistance from two IDA
Bank Missions in February 1/ and July 2/, 1975, respectively. This report
is based on the findings of an Appraisal Mission which visited Burma in
October/November, 1975 comprising Messrs. H.T. Chang, E. Hunting (Bank Group),
R. Shukle and R. Auscher (Consultants), and a rural credit study by Mr. K.C.
Cheriyan (FAO/IBRD/CP) in February, 1976.
II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      The Union of Burma, with an area of some 260,000 sq mi, borders
India to the north, Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal to the west, China and
Laos to the east and Thailand and Andaman Sea to the south.  It has four
distinot climatic and topographical regions:  the Western and Northern Hills,
the Shan Plateau, the Central Region, and the Arakan and Tenasserim Coastal
regions. The Central Region is the most densely settled and comprises a
fertile lower wet zone, a central dry zone and a northern wet zone. About
27% of the country or 45 million ac, is considered arable, but onily soi'fe
20 million ac are presently under cultivation. Another 5 million ac are
fallow while the remaining 20 million ac are classified as cultivable waste-
land, most of which is unsuitable for rice, the staple crop. Forests cover
about half of the country and contain many species of valuable timber, par-
ticularly teak. Administratively, Burma is divided into seven States and
seven Divisions. Each Division and State is subdivided into Townships.

The Economy
2.02      Burma is one of the 25 least-developed countries.  Fortunately, it
is endowed with very rich natural resources yet to be developed, and its
population density is still low (115/mi2 compared to 485/m2 of India).
Population, estimated around 30 M in 1975, of which 85% is rural, is grow-
ing at an annual rate of about 2.2%. National income growth in real terms
during the last decade averaged only 2.3% i.e., barely keeping pace with the
population growth. As a result, per capita income is static at about US$80
per year. Diminishing rice exports have resulted in a growing scarcity of
foreign exchange, a marked contraction of imports, and a relative stagnation
of industrial production. To increase revenue earnings, GOB recently has
given new emphasis to agriculture, forestry and mining development, aimed
primarily at meeting pressing short-term needs through quick yielding in-
vestment projects in the three sectors. The GOB has already initiated im-
provements in its agricultural pricing policies which now incorporate ade-
quate producer incentives for achieving such investment objectives in agri-
culture.
The Agricultural Sector
2.03      The agricultural crop sector accounts for 27% of the national
product,60% of total exports and 67% of the population's employment. Over the
last decade, growth in agricultural output averaged a disappointing 1.7%
annually. This low rate has been due mainly to: (a) insufficient invest-
ments (the whole agricultural sector received only 7% of total public expendi-
tures during the 1971-75 period); (b) low price incentives to farmers until
two years ago; (c) shortage of input supplies; and (d) limited public sup-
porting services.
2.04      With paddy production stagnant at 7 to 8 M tons and a 2.2% annual
population growth over the last decade, rice exports declined steadily from
the pre-war level of three million tons annually to 1.3 M tons in 1965 and to
less than 200,000 tons in 1975. In the last three years, rice exports have
fluctuated around this level. Unless this trend can be reversed, Burma will
cease to be a rice exporting country in the foreseeable future.
2.05      The total cropped area in 1974 was 22.8 M ac which on a net culti-
vated land area of 19.9 M ac gives a cropping intensity of 115%. Of the
cropped area, rice accounts for 55%, oilseeds 19%, pulses 7%, other cereals
5%, fiber crops 2% and other crops 12%. Irrigated land covers only 12% of the
net cultivated area, and only 14% of the irrigated area is double cropped, as
the present irrigation is mainly from run-of-the-river diversion systems.
2.06      About 8.9 M ac of rice land is located in Lower Burma which vith
fertile soils and abundant rainfall, has been the main surplus rice producing
area in Burma. On the other hand, Upper Burma with 2.8 M ac and hilL regions
with 0.9 M ac are rice deficit areas. Compared to the pre-war period, there
has been an increase of about 300,000 ac of rice area in Upper Burma due to
expansion into marginal land. At the same time, however, there has been a



- 3 -
loss of about one million acres of good rice land in Lower Burma due to
flooding and salt water intrusion through totally or partially eroded protec-
tion embankments (Annex 1).
2.07      The lax in maintenance of the old embankments and abandonment of
paddyland began during the World War II when rice export stopped. After
independence and land nationalization, the traditional local maintenance
force was weakened by the departure from the scene of the former big land-
lords, and the imported seasonal laborers. A special rice project of the
Government managed to restore about 1.2 M ac (out of 1.7 M ac at the peak)
of the abandoned land by 1963/64. However, inadequate budget appropriation
and limited manpower made available have not been able to meet the rehab-
ilitation and proper annual maintenance works needed. As a result, the
area of abandoned paddyland in Lower Burma again increased to about one
million acres by 1973/74.
Project Formulation
2.08      The quickest and most inexpensive way of increasing rice production
in Burma is to protect farm land from flooding and salt water intrusion and
reclaim the abandoned paddyland in Lower Burma by construction of low embank-
ments around islands with drains and sluice gates. The proposed project is
the first in a series of paddyland development projects submitted to IDA for
financial support. The islands included under this project were selected by
GOB and verified by the IDA Identification/ Preparation Missions on the basis
of availability of adequate hydrological record for designing the project.
The project would also include a delta-wide hydrological investigation to
provide information for preparation of similar projects in the future, and a
feasibility study for improving paddy storage and handling by both the Govern-
ment agency and farmers.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The project area consists of 11 islands located in the southern
part of the Irrawaddy Delta; one, Shwelaung (Wakema Township), is located in
the middle delta, about 85 mi from the sea, and the other ten--Zinbaung,
Letpanbin, Kyet-Pha-Hmwe-Zaung, Myogon, Daw Nyein, Dedalu, Bantbwezu (all
in Pyapon Township), Betut (Laputta Township), Alegyun (Ngapudaw Township)
and Dauntgyi (Bogale Township), are located in the lower delta, situated
less than 50 mi from the sea (Map 11836R). The project would develop a
total of 185,000 ac, including 120,000 ac of cultivated land, 62,000 ac of
abandoned land and 3,000 ac of cultivable wasteland (Annex 1).
Climate
3.02      The Irrawaddy Delta has a tropical and monsoon climate with
three distinct seasons: a rainy season from mid-May to mid-October, a dry
cool season from mid-October to mid-February, and a hot humid season from



- 4 -
mid-February to mid-May. Rainfall averages about 100 inches per annum,
Xitch a peak from June through August. Temperatures do not vary much during
the year. Mean monthly temperatures range from 75°F in January to about 86°F
in April, but minimum temperatures may occasionally drop to 600F in December/
January (Annex 1).
Topography, Soils and Floods
3.03      Shwelaung, the middle delta island, is surrounded by fresh water
rivers with a small tidal range but is subject to monsoon high flood
levels. During periods of high flooding, river levels are higher than the
ground elevation of the island. Deposits from recurrent floods have made
the island slightly saucer shaped, higher at the edge and sloping towards
the center.
3.04      The other ten islands in the lower delta are surrounded by
creeks intermittently saline from semi diurnal tidal intrusion with tidal
range of 10-15 ft. Because of this saline water, dry season irrigation
and cropping in the coastal area has not been possible.
3.05      In these islands, flood and salt water intrusion through old
and almost totally damaged embankments, have caused about 65,000 ac of
cultivable land to be completely abandoned, giving way to tall grasses or
naagrove trees.  Paddy yields on 120,000 ac presently under cultivation have
likewise been depressed.
3.06      The project area has three main soil types (Annex 1).  The meadow
gleyey clay soils are formed on higher land which is presently under cultiva-
tiUI. The meadow swampy soils with high organic matter content and acidity
are formed on level low land deeply flooded, (up to 5 ft) during the wet
season. Such soils are presently under medium to tall grasses, but can be
highly productive when drained and reclaimed. Saline gleyey clay soils,
presently under mangroves, are formed on low lying land regularly flooded by
tidal salt water. Fortunately, the soluble salts are mainly chlorides and can
easily be leached out by monsoon rain. No acid sulfate soils or alkaline soils
have been reported.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
3.07      The total population in the project area is about 119,000, aggre-
gated in about 25,000 families. All land belongs to the State, but far-
mers are given rights to cultivate, which can generally be passed on with-
in the family. Of the 25,000 families in the project area, 51% have land,
27% are landless farm families which form the main source of the hired farm
labor, and 22% are non-farm families (Annex 1, Table 4). An average family
has about five members, with an equivalent of three adult workers of which
two attend to farming. Overall, farm labor supply meets demand in the project
areas at present.

3.08      The land nationalization program broke up the extremely large land
holdings that existed before independence, but considerable variation exists
in "areas farmed" among families. In the project area, the area varies from
less than two acres to more than ten acres. In the middle delta island, the
average is 6.5 ac, with 42% falling between five to ten acres. In the ten
lower delta islands, the average is about 12 ac, with 61% owning ten acres or
more. The average of the project is 10 ac (Annex 1, Table 5).
Agriculture
3.09      Rainfed rice is grown on the existing cultivated land throughout the
project area during the wet season. Because of flooding (middle delta) and
salt water intrusion (lower delta), yields are low, averaging 1,200 to 1,300
lb paddy per ac. Rice is the only crop grown in the lower delta islands. Small
acreages of jute, groundnuts, and pulses are grown in the middle delta island
during the dry season. Vegetables and fruits are grown around the villages.
About one-third of the cultivable land in the project area comprised of low
depressions, is abandoned/wasteland. Farm work is mainly done by animal
and manual labor. In Shwelaung, farmers are using tractors for land prepara-
tion and low-lift pumps for irrigation -- mainly for jute cultivation.
3.10      Present agricultural production from the existing cultivated
land in the project area is summarized below (Annex 2).

3.11      Agricultural supporting services including research, extension
and provision of seed, fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs are provided
by the Agricultural Corporation (AC). These services are of limited scope
and generally inadequate (para. 5.02). Fertilizers are presently allocated
only to HYV rice, cotton, jute, tobacco and sugarcane in the country. Farmers



do not own sprayers. In serious pest outbreaks, AC Township Pest Control
squads spray for farmers free of charge. The Agricultural Mechanization
Department (AMD) has a tractor station in Wakema Township which provides, at
subsidized rates, custom tractor service to farmers and maintenance service
to tractors and pumps owned by farmer groups in the Shwelaung area
(Map 11836R). It has, at present, no service facilities in the ten lower
delta islands (para 5.02). Since 1973/74, rural credit to farmers has been
provided mainly by advanced purchase schemes (APS): for paddy, by the Trade
Corporation One (TC-1); for jute, by the Agricultural Corporation (AC); and
other minor crops by Cooperatives. The repayment record is unsatisfactory.
In late 1975, GOB decided to form the Burma Agricultural Bank (BAB) and to
revive providing rural credit to farmers through Village Banks as was the
case prior to 1973/ 1974 (para. 5.03). The new bank was formally established
April 1, 1976. Detailed plans for coordinating the responsibilities of BAB-VB,
TC-1, AC and the Cooperatives under the new rural credit system, as well as
new terms and conditions of loans are now being formulated. Until GOB has
been able to work out the details of its new rural credit program and staff
pattern, it is not possible for IDA to assess its potential effectiveness.
A number of proposals which have been discussed between GOB and IDA are
detailed in Annex 10.
Transportation
3.12      The Irrawaddy Delta has an intricate system of rivers, creeks
and tidal inlets which are used for navigation. Government godowns, depots
and most rice mills are located at small towns along the banks of these
waterways. Large public river crafts (Government owned and operated) provide
regular service between Rangoon and all important towns, while small river
crafts (mostly privately owned) operate local service between the towns and
villages. Every family has a small boat. Due to lack of roads inside the
islands, transport of farm produce is generally done by shoulder carrying or
by oxcart during the dry season, to the nearest waterways for loading onto
boats. Farm inputs are similarly handled.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Description
4.01      The proposed project would protect the 11 selected islands (para
3.01) from flood and tidal instrusions by building or rebuilding embank-
ments, excavating drains and constructing sluice gates, developing a total
of 185,000 ac of farm land, including the reclamation of 65,000 ac of aban-
doned and cultivable wasteland, provide equipment for construction, mainte-
nance, reclamation, farming and lift irrigation, and provide funds for
strengthening extension and other agricultural supporting services. It would
also carry out a delta-wide hydrological investigation for planning future
projects, and a feasibility study for improving paddy storage and handling.

Project Works
4.02      Works to be carried out on the 11 islands are described in detail
in Annexes 3 to 7 and summarized below:
(a) Construction of Flood Control and Drainage Facilities (Annex 3).
(i)  about 410 mi of earth embankments 1/ involving about
11.4 M cu yd of earthwork;
(ii) about 770 mi of interior drainage channel 1/ enlarge-
ment and new excavation, totalling about 11.6 M cu yd of
earthwork;

(v)  about ten masonry and reinforced concrete regulators
in Shwelaung Island for drainage and conservation of
water for dry season lift irrigation; and
(vi) buildings for offices, staff quarters and stores
for construction and maintenance forces.
(b) Reclamation of 65,000 ac of Abandoned Paddyland 2/
(i)  procurement of land clearing equipment including about
24 farm tractors, disk plows and harrows to be operated
by AMD tractor station at Shwelaung for initial plowing
and harrowing of the reclaimed land, about 400 chain
saws to be rented by AID to land allottees in ten lower
delta islands for clearing mangroves and assorted tools
for land clearing;
(ii) land clearing on each island;
(iii)  cadastral survey and mapping of 65,000 ac of land
to be reclaimed and about 11,000 ac to be occupied
by embankments and drains, and staking those to be
reclaimed into 10 ac plots for allotment; and
1/   Sample layouts based on three surveyed islands are given in
Maps 12016 and 12017.
2/   Locations in three sample polders are shown in Maps 12016 and 12017.



- 8 -
(iv) allotting reclaimed land to about 6,500 families of
displaced farmers (about 1,000) and landless people
(about 5,500) who would be entitled to receive the
tractor and chain saw rental services on medium-term
rural credit.
(c) Agricultural Extension Service. The project would establish
intensified agricultural services throughout the entire
five Townships within which the project areas are located
(Annex 5 and Map 11836R). It would provide for:
(i) increasing the existing AC field staff in five townships
to a total of 134 Village Extension Managers (VEMs),
22 Village Tract Extension Managers (VTEMs), five
Township Extension Deputy Managers (TEDMs), five
Township Extension Managers (TEMs), six Subject
Matter Specialists (SMSs) and one Project Extension
Manager (PEM), to serve about 900,000 ac of cultivated
land; each VEM would supervise about 800 families.
Recruitment of new officers is not expected to pose
any problem.
(ii) carrying out an extension system involving inter alia
selection of contact farmers; identification of impact
points, scheduled visits of contact farmers by VEMI, and
scheduled training on impact points according to the
cropping calendar (Annex 5);
(iii) procurement of equipment and boats for extension and
research;
(iv) operation cost during the six year project imple-
mentation period, including funds for conducting
field trials, demonstrations, field days, training,
printing of extension material, and housing and
travel allowances for extension officers; and
(v) fellowships for short-term training of extension
officers in neighboring countries.
(d) Strengthening of Input Supply and Agricultural Mechanization
Services (Annex 6). The project would provide for:
(i) procurement of low-lift pumps (5 hp), power tillers
(7-8 hp) and farm tractors (50 hp), disc plows, disc
harrows and rotary cultivators. Some of the pumps would
be sold to farmer groups for cash. The remaining pumps
and all of the tractors, power tillers and their
implements would be sold to farmers' groups on long-
term 1/ or medium-term 2/ rural credit (para 5.03 (a)).
TV   Five years or longer.
2/   One to four years.



(ii) construction of tour additional fertilizer godowns
and seven ANI trield workshops and provision of work-
shop equipment and tools, for servicing the farming
and land reclamation equipment (Map 11836R).
(e) Studies for FuturL. Projects (Annex 7). The project would
provide:
(i)  About 60 man months of consultant services to assist
GOB in hydrologicil investigation, establish hydro-
logical gauging st:ations throughout the delta, and
conduct a reconnai'sance survey to identify future
projects and draw-up a program for further investiga-
tions and studies required for staged development
plan of the delta;
(ii)  About 35 man monthls of consultants service to assist
GOB in preparing feasibility study of a project for
improving paddy storage and handling by the Govern-
ment as well as by farmers;
(iii) Equipment and boats for hydrological recording and
investigations.
Engineering
4.03      The feasibility stage designs of flood embankments, drains, sluice
gates and other hydraulic structures in three sample areas of Shwelaung
(middle delta) and Zinbaung and Letpanbin (lower delta) were prepared by
the ID. These designs and related cost estimates reflect sound engineering.
The ID has had extensive experience in the planning, design and construction
of these kinds of work for many decades. Prior to implementation, ID would,
however, conduct further surveys and prepare final and detailed designs for
the work in each polder. Hydrological data available for these designs
include 30 years of daily river level record at Shwelaung and long-term tidal
records at Elephant Point. These are considered adequate for the design of
works on the 11 islands included in the proposed project.
Water Supply, Quality and Demand
4.04      From, mid-!l.ay to iid-October, rrin :suppLies water to the ontfre pro-
ject area.  During the middle pailt of rainy season iu August and Septomb;r,
high river levels make drainage from the islands dtfficult, alLhough with the
embankments and sluices, drainage would improve.  The Shwelniing Islanid is
surrounded by rivers with fr<-s,i water all year round.  During the dry sea.vn,
sluice gates would be operated at daily high tide hours for replenishment ot
water stored in drains which woJl d be used for pump irrigation.  In the iuw,r
delta polders, sluice gates would be closed at the end of tle monsoon se son
to retain freslh water a,d r  ex lude salt-water intruso! during the dry
seal cii.



- 10 -
4.05      The project would expand pump irrigation in Shwelaung Island to
7,000 ac of dry season HYV and 15,000 ac of jute-Hnanga 1/ rotation. The maxi-
mum water demand, 17,900 ac-ft would occur in April. A total of 1,300 pumps
of 0.7 cusec would supply the requisite 870 cusec total requirement (Annex 8).
This amount would be an insignificant withdrawal from the 62,000 cusec dry
season flow in the Irrawaddy River. No pump irrigation is planned for the
lower delta polder because the conserved water in the drains cannot be re-
plenished, but timely closing of sluice gates would retain fresh water in
the drains and keep off the salt water intrusion. The prolonged residual soil
moisture would allow the growing of dry season rainfed pulses over about 30%
of the cultivated areas.
Implementation Schedule
4.06      The civil works construction is presented in Annex 3, Figure 1.  The

Cost Estimates
4.07       Total project cost is estimated at US$54 million equivalent (K 352
million equivalenit) of which US$25 million or 46% would be foreign exchange.
The cost estimates for imported equipment, vehicles, and foreign consultants
and training are based on international prices. Costs of civil works, includ-
ing flood control and drainage facilities, land clearing, workshops and
buildings, are based on recent costs in Burma for similar works. All costs
are adjusted to mid-!976 price levels. The taxes and duties (estimated at
about K 25 million) o01 items to be procured under the project would be waived
by GOB and are excluded from the estimates. Physical contingencies amounting
to 7.5% of total basic project costs, including 15% for civil works, 2% for
equipment, and 5% for other basic cost items are added. Contingencies added
for subsequent price escalations for equipment and consultants fall from 9% in
the first year to 7% in the sixth year, and for civil works and land clearing
from 13% in the first year to 10% in the sixth year (Annex 9, Table 3). De-
tailed project cost estimates are given in Annex 9, Table I and are summarized
below.

Financing
4.08      The proposed IDA credit of US$30 million (covering 56% of the total
project cost exclusive of customs duties and taxes) would finance the full
foreign exchange costs and about 17% of the local costs. The GOB would
finance the balance of the project cost, or US$24 million equivalent
(K 156 million equivalent) through annual budget appropriations.
Procurement
4.09      All equipment, spares, and materials, totalling an estimated
US$18 million including contingencies, would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the cif price or the prevailing
custom duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in
the evaluation of bids. Small off-the-shelf items costing less than US$20,000
each, which are not suitable for international tendering, would be purchased
through normal Government procurement procedures, on the basis of comparing
prices from no less than three suppliers. Such purchases would be limited
to a total of US$200,000.
4.10      The civil works would be scattered over 11 islands spanning a dis-
tance of 1,200 mi and would comprise mainly earthwork (embankments and
drains). The drainage sluices and project buildings would be small, simple
structures. All these works would be subject to seasonal weather interrup-
tion (with 80 inches of rain during rainy season) and would have to be phased
so as to cause minimal interruption to cultivation. Under these circums-
tances they would not be suitable for international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines. The ID would carry them out by
force account. For several decades, the ID has had extensive experience in
designing and constructing similar facilities.
Disbursements
4.11      Disbursements from the proposed IDA credit would cover:
(a)  100% of the foreign expenditures for directly imported equip-
ment, spare parts and construction materials;
(b)  100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for locally
manufactured equipment, spare parts and construction
materials procured under ICB;
(c)  70% of total expenditures for other equipment, spare parts
and construction materials procured locally without ICB
(off-the-shelf);
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for consultants' services and
overseas training; and
(e)  50% of local expenditures for civil works excluding
construction materials, equipment and spare parts.



- 14 -
Disbursements for civil works which will be carried out by force account
would be made against statements of expenditure, the documentation for which
would be retained by the ID for review by Supervision Missions. All other
disbursements would be made against full documentation. Any saving under the
project would be used at the discretion of the Association for other expendi-
tures under the project. The estimated schedules of expenditures and dis-
bursements are given in Annex 9 (Tables 2 and 5).
Accounts and Audits
4.12      All participating Government agencies maintain accounts according to
procedures and forms laid down by the Ministry for Planning and Finance (MPF).
The auditing of the accounts of Government agencies is the responsibility of
the Central Audit and Inspection Office, acting on behalf of the Central
Council of People's Inspectors. Agreement has been reached with GOB that:
(a) separate accounts for each project component would be
maintained by the respective implementing agencies, and
collated by the Project Implementation Committee (PIC)
(para 5.04 and Annex 12);
(b) these accounts would be audited annually by an independent
auditor and in accordance with procedures satisfactory to
IDA; and
(c) PIC would send to IDA copies of the summary of an unaudited
annual project account within four months of the end of the
fiscal year, to be followed by copies of the audited account
and auditor's report within nine months of the end of each
fiscal year.
Environmental Effects
4.13      There is no schistosomiasis in Burma.  Malaria has been virtually
eradicated in Lower Burma. The project works are not expected to have any
adverse effect on these two maladies. Reduced flooding, improved drainage,
clearing of tall grasses and mangroves would improve environmental and public
health conditions in the project area. An intensified extension program would
include proper application of pesticides. The effect of enclosure of islands
by embankments on the fishery life is not expected to be serious as the main
fishing grounds are in the rivers surrounding the islands. The effect, how-
ever, would be evaluated by a short-term consultant attached to the hydro-
logical investigation.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Agency Responsibilities
5.01      The Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF) would be responsible
for the project. Overall organization of this ministry is presented in
Annex 11, Figure 1. The ministry is currently implementing the Irrigation



- 15 -
I Project (Cr. 483-BA) which is proceeding satisfactorily. A total of 11
agencies, seven under MAF and four under other Ministries, would be involved
in project implementation.
5.02      The seven agencies under the MAF and their responsibilities are:
(a) Irrigation Department (ID) would be responsible for the
planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance
(O & M) of all flood control and drainage facilities,
and the procurement of construction and 0 & M equipment.
It would also be responsible for conducting the delta-
wide hydrological investigations for future projects
with assistance from consultants (para. 4.02(e)(i)).
ID would organize five units for executing the project
civil works: two units for construction; and one each
for planning, mechanical engineering, and operation
and maintenance (O & M) (Annex 11, Fig. 3), each under
an ID Executive Engineer, and all under direct super-
vision of the Project Director (Annex 11, para 11).
(b) Settlement and Land Records Department (SLRD), assisted by
(c) Survey Department (SD) would survey farms to be displaced by
embankment and drains, survey and demarcate land to be re-
claimed, and prepare related land records and maps
(para 4.02 b).
(d) Central Land Committee (CLC), through Village Land Committees
would allot land to displaced farmers and landless farmers
in the Townships (para. 4.02 b).
(e) Working People's Settlement Department (WPSD) would organize
force account land clearing to supplement family labor of
land allottees, and settle some retired servicemens' families
in Dauntgyi polder, where the population is sparse (para 4.02 b).
Agreement has been obtained from GOB that in land allotment
operations, farmers displaced by embankments and drain con-
struction would have the first priority; local landless families
and families with insufficient land, second priority; and families
of the retired servicemen who have participated in the force
account land clearing work of the project, third priority.
(f) Agricultural Corporation (AC) would provide research support,
implement the intensified extension program, supply seeds,
fertilizers and other input to project farmers, and construct
four additional fertilizer godowns in the project area
(para 4.02 c & d). Extension work under the project would
be coordinated by a Project Extension Manager (PEM) who would
report to the AC Irrawaddy Division Manager. Each township
would have a Township Extension Manager (TEM) and a Township



- 16 -
Extension Deputy Manager (TEDM) who would supervise the
work of two to six Village Tract Extension Managers (VTEMs)
each in charge of six Village Extension Managers (VEM). Each
VEM would be responsible for about 800 farm families. The PEM
would be assisted by three Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs)
for plant protection, farm machinery and extension training;
they would be stationed in the Pyapon Township. At the
township level, there would be three SMSs, two for paddy
cultivation, stationed one each at Pyapon and Laputta and one
for both paddy and jute cultivation in Shwelaung (Annex 11,
Fig. 5 and also Annex 5).
(g) Agricultural Mechanization Department (AMD) would: (i)
procure and sell to farmer groups or cooperatives, pumps,
power tillers and tractors to be provided by the project;
(ii) provide tractor service to farmers and rent power chain
saws to land allottees for mangrove clearing; (iii) provide
maintenance service for farm machinery and pumps, and (iv)
construct, equip and staff seven field workshops in the
project area (para 4.02 d).
(h) Present levels of supporting services throughout Burma would
be inadequate for intensive agricultural development and GOB
would initiate improved services and adequate inputs supplies
in areas under such development beginning with this project.
Agreement has been obtained from GOB (para 8.01) that:
(i) extension officers would be appointed as specified in
para. 4.02 c (i) and these officers would work full
time on activities directly related to agricultural
extension work prescribed by the project;
(ii) Fertilizers would be supplied for all rice varieties and
all crops in the project area at rates to be recommended
each year by the extension service;
(iii) each AC Township Pest Control Squad (para 3.11) would
stock sufficient pesticides in the project area, on the
basis of estimates to be made annually by the extension
service. The AC would prepare a plan to charge farmers an
increasing portion of the cost of pesticides until
the full cost would be recovered, and through PIC would
submit the plan to IDA for review within two years
after the credit effectiveness.
(iv) in providing tractor and maintenance services to
farmers, AMD would charge rates that would cover the
O & M, and depreciation costs of the machinery and
workshops. The AMD, through PIC, would submit to



- 17 -
IDA within six month from the credit effective date a
report on proposed charges and the basis of such
charges; and
(v) GOB would supply sufficient quantities of fuel and oil
for operating construction, maintenance, and farm
equipment as required.
5.03      The four agencies not under the MAF and their responsibilities would
be:
(a) Burma Agricultural Bank (BAB), under the Ministry for Planning and
Finance (MPF) would provide long-term, medium-term and short-term
credit to existing farmers and new land allottees through the
village banks (Annex 10). Agreement has been obtained from
GOB that procurement of farm machinery for sale to farmer
groups on credit would not be made until IDA had agreed to
GOB's proposals for a rural credit program in the project
area, covering: (1) the terms and conditions for providing
long-term, medium-term and short-term credit to farmers, parti-
cularly that for buying tractors and power tillers, to be
provided by the project; (2) procedures of application,
approval, supervision and collection of repayment of loans;
and (3) roles to be played by BAB, TC-1, AC, AMD and coopera-
tives in the new rural credit scheme. Sales of these items
should not be required until about 15 months after the project
gets underway, by which time IDA should be able to assess the
effectiveness of GOB's rural credit program (para 3.11).
Agreement has also been obtained from GOB that (1) before the
long- and medium-term rural credit program starts to operate
in the project area, a special account would be established by
BAB for the credit to be provided to project farmer groups
for purchasing farm machinery and pumps, and (2) repayments
made by farmer groups to the account would be used for
activities directly related to agricultural development in
the delta area.
(b) The Cooperative Department (CD) under the Ministry of
Cooperatives would stock and sell land reclamation hand
tools or animal drawn implements to land allottees.
(c) MPF would make annual budget appropriation to ID for
operation and maintenance of the project flood control
and drainage facilities.
(d)  Trade Corporation Number One (TC-V) wiLich handles paddy
procurement and domestic supply under the Ministry of
Trade (Annex 11), would conduct the feasilibity sttidy
for the paddy storage and handling project in cooporati'rn
with AC.



- 18 -
Project Management
5.04      To coordinate the work of the 11 agencies, a Project Imple-
mentation Committee (PIC) would be formed in MAF. The committee would be
chaired by the Deputy Minister of MAF and would comprise the heads or senior
representatives of all 11 participating agencies as members (Annex 11, Fig. 2).
The committee would be responsible for inter-ministerial and inter-agency
coordination on policy and important administrative matters. Under the
committee, a Project Unit (PU), comprised of senior technical officers of the
seven participating MAF agencies as members, would be established. A senior
ID officer would be appointed the Project Director of PU, and would serve
concurrently as a member secretary of PIC. With adequate supporting staff, he
would be responsible for coordinating technical planning and field execution
of the various agencies components. Each PU member would be responsible for
implementing the project work related to his agency.
5.05      In each of the project townships, a Township Project Committee
(TPC) would be formed to coordinate the project works.  The committee would
comprise Township level officers of the participating agencies as members, an ID
engineer as the Chairman and the AC Township Manager as member secretary. After
the completion of project construction, the AC Township Manager would serve as
the chairman and one other member of the committee as the secretary. The TPC
chairman and secretary would be appointed by the PIC chairman. Establishment
of PIC and PU would be a condition for credit effectiveness. The TPCs would
be established only when construction and land reclamation are ready to begin
in the respective townships.
Operation and Maintenance
5.06      For 0 & M of project flood control and drainage facilities, ID
would establish six 0 & M units; one for Shwelaung and five for the ten lower
delta polders, each under supervision of an ID Assistant Engineer or Sub-
Assistance Engineer with adequate supporting staff and labor. All six units
would be supervised by one Executive Engineer, who in turn, would report to
the Project Director (Annex 11, Fig. 4 and Annex 12). The labor crew would
be organized in groups of five workmen in the dry season and eight workmen
in the wet season. Each group would be responsible for the continuous
maintenance of five miles of embankment. The maintenance of the drains
would be by earthwork equipment. Construction equipment would be maintained
and repaired by ID workshops which have well equipped facilities and
qualified mechanics.
5.07      Owners or users of the pumps, power tillers, farm tractors,etc.
would cover their own 0 & M costs. With the seven new field workshops and
workshop equipment and tools provided by the project, AMD engineers and
technicians would be well equipped to service farm equipment at reasonable
costs to the owners.



- 19 -
5.08      The quarters and workshop buildings for ID construction and main-
tenance units would be maintained by ID, the fertilizer godowns by AC, and
the farm equipment workshops by AMD. The 0 & M costs during the six year
implementation period have been included as a GOB contribution to the project
cost. Agreement has been obtained from GOB that AC would thereafter conti-
nue to appropriate adequate funds from its budget for proper 0 & M of these
godowns (para 8.01 (k)) and AMD would maintain its workshops with proceeds
from its services to farmers (para 5.02 (i) (iv)).
Project Monitoring
5.09      Project implementation would involve 11 agencies.  Close synchroni-
zation of field operations and coordination among agencies would accordingly
be crucial to achieving project targets and keeping work progress on schedule.
The monitoring system for the project would be built into the regular monthly
progress reports by the Township Project Committees to the Project Unit, as
well as those by township level officers to their respective headquarters in
Rangoon. To avoid burdening the field staff unnecessarily, the monitoring
would be concentrated on key indicators of project progress. The Project Unit
would collate the township reports into a monthly project progress report to
be reviewed by the Project Implementation Committee. PIC would consolidate
the monthly reports into quarterly reports for submission to IDA. Work items
to be monitored and the format of the quarterly reports would be agreed
between GOB and IDA at the beginning of project implementation.
Consulting Services
5.10      Agreement has been reached with GOB that consultants to assist
the Government in conducting the delta-wide hydrological investigation and
the paddy storage and handling improvement feasibility study (para 4.02 e)
would be appointed on terms and conditions satisfactory to GOB and IDA
(para 8.01).

VI. FUTURE PRODUCTION, INPUT AND LABOR REQUIREMENTS
Production
6.01       The projected production at full development (FY 1988) is given in
detail in Annex 2 and is summarized as follows:
Shwelaung         Ten Islands               Total

Cropping Intensity         174%                   130%                 134%
6.02       Production increase from the project area would come from:
(i) expansion of net cultivated area from 127,900 ac to
185,000 ac, a gain of 57,200 ac, or about 45%;
(ii)  expansion of total cropped area from 135,000 ac to
256,700 ac through increases in both the net cultivated
area and double cropping, a gain of 121,700 ac, or about 90%;
(iii)  expansion of HYV rice area from near zero at present
to about 39% of the paddy area; and
(iv)  crop yield increases through reduction in damages caused by
flooding and salt water intrusion, increased irrigated
area from 8,000 ac to 220,000 ac, and above all, through
strengthening of the extension service and increased
use of fertilizers and other inputs.
6.03       Detailed phasing of area expansion, yield and production changes
for each polder is presented in Annex 2, Tables 9, 10 and 11. Estimated
production levels achievable with and without the project are detailed in
Annex 2, Table 14 and summarized below:

Input Requirement
6.04      Fertilizer consumption in the project area is projected to increase
from about 1,000 tons at present to 13,500 tons at full development in FY1988.
Detailed phased requirements by crops are presented in Annex 2, Table 13. The
projection assumes a slow increase before completion of project construction
and land reclamation, but more rapid increase thereafter.
6.05      Quantity-wise no problem is anticipated in seed supply for all crops
by AC. The extension program would include also advising farmers on how to keep
their own seeds pure and viable, particularly peanuts, until such time that a
national seed program becomes effective. Use of pesticides is expected to
increase with the expansion of HYV rice and jute in the project area.
Ilarket Prospects
6.06      Rice and jute, the major crops in the Irrawaddy Delta, are interna-
tionally traded. The Burmese rice has long established overseas markets,
particularly in Asia. With increased production, prospects for recapturing a
part of its lost market appear good, even as world market prices have de-
clined from recent shortage-related highs. Production increases for the
other crops would be small relative to present volumes and would have a ready
domestic market. Analyses of future markets and prices are given in Annex 13.
6.07      Prior to World War II, Burma was the world's leading rice exporter.
In addition, rice milling remains one of Burma's major industries. About
50 mills located in nearby towns now serve the area. Milling equipment has
deteriorated due to lack of renewal and spare parts. Assisted by Asian Dev-
elopment Bank financing, 135 rice mills will be renovated in the country,
and three new mills, 35 new warehouses and one silo complex (for grains other
than rice) will be constructed. The constructions and renovations will be
country-wide, and concentrated in Lower Burma, but none of these works, how-
ever, will take place in the 11 islands covered by this project, except pos-
sibly for one rice mill at the edge of Shwelaung. The capacity of milling
facilities in the country is expected to be adequate for the increased pro-
duction from the project area. Existing jute baling capacity located in major
towns in producing areas (primarily the middle delta), amounts to about
118,000 tons per year. By 1985, a capacity of about 150,000 tons per year
would be needed to handle thle anticipated 6,000 ton increase from the project
area and about 44,000 ton increase in other areas. With funds provided under



- 22 -
IDA Credit No. 394-BA, AC plans to construct four additional plants which will
provide adequate capacity in the middle delta up through the early 1980s. The
public and privately owned boats and the existing paddy storage facilities,
however, are run-down and would prove insufficient for anticipated future
volumes. Paddy handling on farms as well as at TC-1 buying depots is labor-
intensive and conducive to losses. The project, therefore, includes funds for
a paddy storage and handling project feasibility study to be carried out by
GOB with assistance from a foreign consulting firm (para 4.02(e)).
6.08      Since World War II, GOB has controlled export of paddy, rice and
rice products. Up to 1964, procurement and processing of paddy for export
and internal distribution were left to private enterprise, with exports con-
trolled by Government. In 1964, GOB took measures to procure, process, and
distribute paddy for domestic consumption. It no longer permitted private
millers to procure paddy. It licensed one category to custom mill for farmers
and a second category to mill on contract for Government, both at charges
fixed by Government. The GOB permitted farmers to trade rice, but not paddy,
freely within their own townships but required that any other rice trading be
done only through the State Agricultural Marketing Board (SAMB) and to TC-1,
its successor in 1964. However, since November 1973, GOB has enforced a paddy
procurement program throughout the country under a compulsory quota system.
Procurement quotas, which must be sold to TC-1 at controlled prices, are
scaled to farmers' sown acreages and assessed yields, and range from 7% of
farm production for a two acre farm (yield of 30 baskets per ac) to about 65%
for a ten acre farm (yield of 70 baskets per ac) (Annex 13 and 15, Table 3).
6.09      Jute is a relatively new crop in Burma, introduced in the mid-1950s
by the former Agriculture and Rural Development Corporation. The Corporation
undertook to purchase jute at guaranteed prices. The AC, its successor, is
in charge of jute development and continues to procure all jute at controlled
prices.
Prices
6.10      A substantial rice market exists outside of the procurement system
in the form of legal trade within the township as well as reported illicit
rice trade across township boundaries and out of the country. Over the years,
the relative levels of GOB controlled prices and free market paddy prices have
been an important factor influencing the volumes of TC-1 procurement and market
trade. Until recently, with low official price levels, TC-1 procurement
proved increasingly insufficient to meet domestic requirements among urban,
landless, and deficit farm families. As a result, free market prices were
forced up relative to TC-1 procurement prices, which further reduced the
effectiveness of the procurement program and caused the volume of free market
trade to grow (Annex 13, Table 3).
6.11      The GOB in recent years has increased its procurement prices, in
1973 by 40% and again in July, 1974 by 50%. These prices now cover the
farmers' costs of production and leave them modest margins on the portions of
production taken by the quota (Annex 13, Table 3). Under the new prices, TC-1
procured about 90% of its 1975 target, nearly double the procurement levels in



- 23 -
the previous two years. Margins from selling the remaining portions of their
marketable surplus (net of home consumption) on the free market, at prices
about 50% above procurement prices, provide incentive for farmers to increase
production through adoption of high yielding varieties and increased use of
inputs. To ensure that farmer incentive would not be eroded in the future,
agreements has been obtained from GOB that periodically it would review and
revise, if necessary, the paddy procurement price and would undertake to keep
IDA informed in this respect (para. 8.01 (f)).
6.12      Prices used for the economic analysis reflect the opportunities
for potential export earnings and import savings which could be realized
at projected world market prices. For rice, jute, and fertilizers, which
Burma trades on the world market, future price trends are based on the Bank's
1985 world market projections (Annex 13, Table 1). For other crops, future
prices are based on present levels and trends of local prices. All are
expressed in terms of constant currency, using July 1976 prices as the base
(Annex 13, Table 2).
6.13      The official foreign exchange price (US$1 = K 6.5) does not re-
flect the prevailing supply of and demand for foreign exchange in Burma, since
it is maintained by stringent exchange and trade restictions. On the black
market, currency is presently traded at rates of K 18 to 20 per US dollar,
which, however, partly reflects the higher risk levels associated with such
illegal transactions. Because of the non-availability of some data and the
poor quality of the available data, the shadow price of foreign exchange could
not be calculated using normal World Bank methods. Instead, an alternative
procedure was used by adjusting the value of imports to take into account
the under recording of imports and by estimating the tariff equivalent of
non-tariff restrictions on imports and exports. It was found that in the
context of the prevailing tariff structure, including the complete ban on
certain imports and the monopoly of certain exports, the lower rate of US$1 =
K 13 more realistically reflects the opportunity cost of foreign exchange to
the Burmese economy (Annex 13). This rate is used in converting world market
prices for the economic analysis.
Labor Supply and Demand
6.14      Estimated on the basis of a 2% annual increase in labor availabi-
lity, compared to a projected population increase of 2.2% through 1988 (full
development), total available labor in the project area would increase from
the present about 1.9 million man-days to about 2.6 million man-days per month,
or by 37% (Annex 14, Table 1). Without the project, unemployment or underem-
ployment is likely to mount, as the labor demand and supply ratio deteriorates.
By increasing the net cultivated land area by about one-third, cropped area
by 90%, and granting land to about 80% of the existing landless families, the
project would forestall such a trend (Annex 14, Table 2).
6.15      The marginal economic farm wage level under without project con-
ditions is estimated to fluctuate from K 0.5 per man-day in the slack season
to a maximum of K 6.0 at the peak season; with the project, the range would
be from K 0.7 to almost K 9.0. The implicit average economic wage used for
economic analysis is estiamted to be K 4.6 per man-day (Annex 14, Table 3).



- 24 -
Farm Incomes (Annex 15)
6.16      Most farms in the project area are subsistence oriented, consuming
most of their own grain, pulse and vegetable produce, and marketing for
cash some jute, groundnuts, pulses and/or surplus paddy (partly to fulfill
the TC-1 quota). Present average net farming income is about K 200 per ac
in the lower delta and about K 300 per ac in the middle delta (Annex 15,
Table 4).
6.17      Farming incomes vary primarily according to the cropping patterns
dictated by farm land elevations relative to annual flood levels. The pro-
ject would benefit high and medium elevation farms to a greater extent than
low land farms which would continue to be constrained by heavier soils and
accumulated rain water at planting or harvesting seasons, though to a much
lesser extent than before. Some high elevation middle delta farms, where the
present per acre return (from jute-Hnanga or paddy-groundnut rotations) is
among the highest, also would benefit to a somewhat lesser extent. For a
typical example of 10 ac 1/ farms in the middle and lower delta areas, annual
net farm incomes, including the value of produce consumed on the farm, would
increase as follows:

6.18      Thus, in real terms net farming incomes would increase roughly two
to three times.  Weighted average net incomes would increase to K 750 per ac
in the middle delta and to K 650 per ac in the lower delta at full development.
1/   The official basis of land allotment is one tatontum per family,
which is a unit of land workable by a plow drawn by a pair of bullocks,
about 10 ac to 15 ac (Annex 1, para 16).

Recovery of Costs (Annex 15)
6.19      Under the project, the 0 & M costs of flood control and drainage
facilities would require an annual expenditure of about K 3.1 million, or
about K 17 per acre (Annex 12, Tables 2 and 3). At present, GOB appropriates
within its budget about K 5 per ac for the 0 & M of flood protection works,
an amount insufficient for satisfactory upkeep of project works. The capital
costs of the project investments, excluding the costs of farm machinery to be
recovered through the agricultural credit system, amount to about K 1,200 per
ac. Recovery of this investment over a 30-year period would be represented
by annual costs amounting to K 7.4 million (K 40 per ac) with no cost of
capital or to K 23.5 million (K 125 per ac) with cost of capital at 10% per
year.
6.20      Under the existing compulsory paddy procurement system, GOB would
automatically capture from project farmers a large portion of the incre-
mental benefits derived from the project. The compulsory sale to TC-1 of
a portion of their paddy production at low prices relative to the free and
export markets, is an implicit taxation on the paddy farmers in the area.
From revenues generated from exportation of the incremental production,
due to the project, the Government could allocate funds for full O&M as
well as capital cost recovery. The compulsory quotas under the procurement
system are assessed on the basis of sown acreage and yields obtained
(Annex 15). This system would result automatically in the procurement by
Government of the major portion (in most cases 80%) of the incremental pro-
duction due to the project and nearly all possible profit from this portion
of future production.
6.21      In its present form, the compulsory procurement system more than
meets the cost recovery objectives of the Bank Group water charges policy.
The method of taxation is progressive and the tax on incremental income
varies in proportion to the farmer's benefit from the project and his ability
to pay (Annex 15, para 5). From farmers owning 10 ac under average project
conditions, the system would capture 30% to 70% of the "project rent"
(Annex 15, Table 5). This represents implicit taxation with a marginal rate
of about 45% and average tax rate of about 20%. The GOB rice export of the
incremental paddy production under the project would provide additional
revenue which after full development would amount to US$23.7 million per year
(K 154 million per year at the official exchange rate US$1 = K 6.5 or K 308
million per year at the rate US$1 = K 13.0). After deducting procurement and
handling costs, this would leave an amount more than adequate to cover the
full costs of 0 & M and capital recovery (para 6.19 and Annex 15, Table 6).
6.22      With this level of cost recovery and implicit taxation, the residual
income of the typical farmer with 10 ac would still increase substantially
under the project thereby providing incentives for technical efficiency and
on-farm improvements (Annex 15, Table 4). However, any further increase in
taxation of the farmers implicit or explicit, would adversely affect incen-
tives to the project farmers. Agreement (para. 8.01 (g)) has been obtained
from GOB that:



- 26 -
(a)  The Government would ensure that farmers in the project
area are left with adequate financial incentives to make
necessary investments to increase production, taking into
account paddy procurement quotas and prices.
(b)  To make project farmers aware that they are paying for the
project cost recovery and to prepare for the eventuality
that the paddy procurement quota system may someday be
abolished, the quota assessed for each farmer would indicate
as percentages of the total quota:
(i)   payment for O&M;
(ii)   annual payment for capital cost recovery; and
(iii)   regular sale to TC-1.
(c)  The Government would appropriate adequate funds from its annual
budget for the Irrigation Department to satisfactorily cover
the proper O&M of the project (presently estimated at K 17/ac).
(d)  Amounts designated as O&M and capital cost recovery would be
reviewed at least annually with IDA; and
(e)  If the compulsory procurement were modified or abolished,
an alternative system of cost recovery would be formulated
and agreed with IDA.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Anticipated Overall Effect
7.01      The project would increase production of existing farms about
three times, expand the number of farms by about 30%, and more than
double employment opportunities. About 80% of the landless families in
the area would obtain their own land.
Value of Crop Production Increase
7.02      Incremental rice and jute production due to the project would
represent the following gross annual foreign exchange earnings (in con-
stant US$, July 1976):
Net Incremental                          Foreign Exchange
Production       Rangoon Port Price        Earnings
(1,000 lg tons)       (US$/lg ton)       (US$ million)
Milled Rice                  98.1                  260                 25.5
Baled Jute                    5.5                  425                  2.3
Total                                                       27.8



- 27 -
Net annual foreign exchange earnings, after deducting the recurrent import
costs of fertilizers, pesticides, and equipment spares, would amount to about
US$26 million. Taking also into account the local value of production of
pulses, groundnuts and other cr-ps, less the costs of production inputs, the
total value added to the Burmese economy would amount to about K 295 million
per year (Annex 16).
Employment Opportunities
7.03      Under the project, farm labor requirements would more than double.
This would mean an increase from 30% at present to about 60% of expected
labor availability in the area (Annex 14). Without the project, the level
of farm employment would remain about the same but, because of the population
growth, the overall employment would fall gradually to less than 25% of ex-
pected availability. Consequently, the project would more than double farm
employment opportunities, of which landless families would be the prime
beneficiaries. Furthermore, the production increases under the project
would stimulate additional off-farm wage-earning opportunities in the
local processing industries and market centers.
Household Income Effects
7.04      At present, many project farm incomes are close to the low national
average.  After full development, their income levels would substantially
exceed the average assuming parallel growth in the agriculture sector at
about 5% per year over the project development period. The proportion of
farms producing below subsistence levels (roughly 50% of national average
per capita income) would decline from 25% at present to less than 10%.
The number of farm workers per net cultivated land area, due to population
growth would remain about the same at full development despite the settlement
of new farm land. Taking into account the increase in farm wage opportunities,
the project would directly improve the earning capacities of more than 75% of
all households.
Economic Rate of Return
7.05      The project's economic rate of return is about 30% (Annex 16) based
on a 30-year period of analysis and the following major assumptions:
(a) an overall construction period of six years;
(b) full agricultural develoment for each farm reached within
five years after land clearing, completion of embankment
construction and provision of drainage and for the pro-
ject as a whole within 11 years after completion of all
construction;
(c) exclusion of the cost of equipment and facilities for
preparation of further projects;



- 28 -
(d) all farm labor valued at a seasonally adjusted opportunity
cost of K 4.6 per man/woman day (roughly two-thirds the
average wage for hired labor), (Annex 14);
(e) foreign exchange valued at an economic opportunity rate
of US$1 = K 13.0 (Annex 13); and
(f) construction costs, including allowance for physical
contingencies, and net crop values expressed in terms
of constant currency excluding price increases due
to inflation.
7.06      Separate rate of return estimates for the lower and middle delta
areas under the base assumptions given above indicate the viability of
individual polders. The sensitivity of the estimates to construction and
cultivation risks and to changes in prices and other assumptions is as
follows:
Lower Delta    Middle Delta    Project Whole
Base Analysis                       33%              24%              30%
Variations
Construction Costs 25% over
estimates:                     29%              21%              26%
Yields or prices 15%
less than projected:           29%              21%              26%
Net Benefits 25% below
estimates:                     28%              20%              25%
Construction delayed and
benefits slipped 2 years:    26%                20%              23%
Foreign exchange valued
at US$1 = K 10.0:              31%              22%              28%
Farm labor valued at K 6
per man-day:                   32%              23%              29%
7.07      Consequently, in the unlikely combination of events including
construction cost overrun of 25%, slippage of two years, and achievement of
only 75% of projected net benefits, the project would still be viable.
Project Replicability
7.08      The total project cost (US$52.4 million) including physical and
price contingencies, but excluding cost of conducting studies for future
projects, averages only about US$ 280 per ac of land developed. Such low
cost development is eminently replicable over a large part of an estimated
total of three million acres in the Lower Burma, including about one
million acres of abandoned paddyland.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Agreements on the following major points have been reached
with GOB:
(a) GOB would appoint extension officers as specified in para 4.02 c(i)
to the project townships and ensure that they would work full
time on activities directly related to agricultural extension
work prescribed by the project (para 5.02 h(i));
(b) fertilizers would be supplied for cultivation of all rice
varieties and all crops in the project area at rates
to be recommended each year by the extension service (para.
5.02 h(ii));
(c) each AC Township Pest Control Squad would stock sufficient
pesticides in the project area, based on estimates to be
made annually by the extension service. The AC, through PIC,
would prepare a plan to charge farmers an increasing
portion of the cost of pesticides until the full cost
would be recovered, and submit the plan to IDA within two
years after the credit effectiveness (para 5.02 h(iii));
(d) in providing tractor and maintenance services to farmers,
AMD would charge rates that would cover the operation,
maintenance, and depreciation costs of the machinery and
workshops. The AMD, through PIC, would submit to IDA
within six months from credit effectiveness a report
on proposed charges and the basis of the proposed charges
(para 5.02 h(iv));
(e) procurement of farm machinery and pumps for sale to farmer
groups on credit would not be made until IDA had agreed to
GOB's proposals covering (para 5.03(a)):
(1) the terms and conditions for providing long-term,
medium-term and short-term credit to farmers,
particularly that for   purchase of tractors and
power tillers provided under the project;
(2) procedures of application, approval, supervision and
collection of repayment of loans; and
(3) roles to be played by TC-1, AC, AMD and cooperatives
in the new rural credit scheme (para 5.03 (a)).



- 30 -
(f)  periodically GOB would review and revise, if necessary,
the paddy procurement price to maintain adequate
incentives to the farmers and would undertake to keep IDA
informed in this respect (para 6.11);
(g) regarding the project cost recovery (para 6.22):
(i) GOB would ensure that farmers in the project area
are left with adequate financial incentive to make
necessary investments to increase production, taking
into account paddy procurement quotas and prices.
(ii) to make project farmers aware that they are paying
for the project cost recovery, the assessed quota
for each farmer would indicate as percentages
of the total quota:
(a) payment for 0 & M;
(b) annual payment for capital cost recovery;
(c) regular sale to TC-1.
(iii) the Government would appropriate adequate funds from its
annual budget for the Irrigation Department to satisfactorily
cover the proper 0 & M of the project, presently estimated
at K 17 per ac;
(iv) Amounts designated as 0 & M and capital cost recovery
would be reviewed at least annually with IDA, and
(v) if the compulsory paddy procurement system were modified
or abolished an alternative system of cost recovery would
be formulated and agreed with IDA.
8.02      A condition for credit effectiveness would be the establishment of
the Project Implementation Committee and Project Unit (para 5.05).
8.03      With the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable for an
IDA credit of US$30 million equivalent on standard IDA terms. The Borrower
would be the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma.

BURMA
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Area Resources
Location
1.        The Union of Burma, 1,200 mi long and 575 mi wide, has an area of
some 260,000 sq mi. It borders India to the north, Bangladesh and the Bay
of Bengal to the west, China and Laos to the east and Thailand and the Bay
of Bengal to the south. It has four distinct climatic and topographical
regions: the western and northern hills, the Shan Plateau, the central
region, and Arakan and Tenesserim coastal regions. The central region which
is partly intersected by a mountain range from north to south is the most
densely settled and comprises a fertile lower wet zone, a central dry zone
and a north wet zone. The Irrawaddy River, navigable for 900 mi, runs in a
well-defined north-south course, in the valley of the central region, down to
the town of Myanaung at the apex of the great Irrawaddy Delta 150 mi from
the sea. South of a line drawn from Rangoon in the east to Bassein in the
west, about 80 mi from the sea, the delta forms a typical alluvian fan with
rivers reaching the sea through several courses. The project area lies within
this southernmost tip of the Irrawaddy Delta (Map 11836R).
2.        The rivers are subject to tidal action at least 80 mi inland
and to salt water intrusion in the dry season up to about 50 mi from the
sea. The project would develop one polder in the middle delta (affected
by both flood and tide) and ten in the lower delta (affected by tide only).
Physiography
3.        The Irrawaddy Delta including the project area is criss-crossed
by an interconnecting network of navigable small rivers and streams which
divide the land into innumerable larger or smaller islands. Among other
works, the project would construct flood embankments around selected islands
for reclamation and development.
4.        The islands in the middle delta region are surrounded by fresh
water creeks and rivers which have a small tidal range. They are much
affected by the monsoon floods; both depth of water and incoming flood flow
velocities damage the immature paddy crop. During periods of high flooding,
water levels in the surrounding rivers are higher than water levels inside
some embanked islands. Deposits from the recurrent floods have formed low
natural river levees on surrounding edges of the islands, thus making them
slightly saucer-shaped, higher at the edge and sloping towards the center.
31



ANNEX I
Page 2
5.        In the lower delta coastal region, the islands are almost level
and surrounded by creeks and rivers which are little affected by monsoon
flood stages, but are made, intermittently saline from coastal water intru-
sion. The semi-diurnal tides have a range of 10 to 15 ft. Islands not
protected by embankments are regularly flooded. At the end of the monsoon,
with the decrease in river discharge, salt water moves further north into
river surrounding islands in the coastal areas. Higher residual salt content
in the soil and high spring tidal inundation preclude dry season cropping at
present.
6.        Although the topography is generally flat, there are localized
depressions in most islands. Because of the flood (middle delta) and salt
water intrusion (lower delta) through the old and mostly damaged embankments,
about 0.41 million ac of such low land in the Irrawaddy Division may be
waterlogged seven to nine months, and have been abandoned, giving way to
tall grasses or mangrove trees. Lower Burma as a whole has nearly one million
acres of abandoned paddy land (Table 1).
Climate
7.        The lower Irrawaddy Delta has a humid, tropical climate dominated by
the southwest monsoon. There are three distinct seasons: a rainy season from
mid-May to mid-October, a dry, cool season from mid-October to mid-February,
and hot, dry season from mid-February to mid-May (Table 2). The three
months of June through August have from 60% to 65% of the annual rainfall
and 23 to 26 rainy days each month. Mean monthly temperatures range from,
about 75°F in January to about 86°F in April, but minimum temperature may
drop to 60OF in December and January. The rainfall pattern determines the
prevailing rice planting season in June/July and harvesting in November/
December. Rice sowing in June coincides with frequent rainy days (Table 2)
in June through September. Rain water sufficiently leaches salts left
behind by tidal salt water intrusion to permit monsoon rice cultivation on
drainable higher lands. Yield, however, is depressed by the building up
of a salinity beginning in the latter part of October, and severely in years
with sub-normal October rainfall.
Soils
8.        The dominant soil covering most of the existing cultivated land
in both the middle and lower delta project areas is the meadow gleyey clay
soil, developed on level land which is: homogenous, clayey; structure less
down to 60 inches depth; poorly drained and waterlogged during the rainy
seasons; and hard surfaced and cracked during the dry season. Soluble salts,
mainly chlorides, and some sulfates, are sufficiently diluted during the wet
season, and do not prevent the growth of paddy in the lower delta.
9.        Meadow swampy soils have developed on level lowlying land, flooded
5 to 10 ft deep during the wet season. Groundwater is near the surface even
during the dry season. These lands are uncultivated, except small areas of
32



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Mayin rice (dry season rice) sown along the edge with receeding floods.
Typically these soils have thick decaying organic matter on the surface,
2% to 5% humus content, a lighter structure than the meadow gleyey clay soils,
and a strong acidity (pH 4.4-4.7). Under the project, these lands will be
drained and reclaimed. With decomposition of organic matter, improved soil
oxidation, and lowered acidity these better structured soils can be highly
productive.
10.       Land of the lower delta close to the sea and salt water carrying
rivers develops the saline gleyey soils of mangrove forests. It is level,
poorly drained and has a heavy texture. Groundwater is near the surface
most of the year. They are reached daily by high tide, and are always saline
during the dry season. The upper soil is clayey while the lower soil is
loamy clay. They have a leaf liter up to two inches thick and the present
pH ranges from 5.6 to 6.3. Under the project, such land would be protected
from salt water intrusion, and drained. Standing mangroves would be cleared.
The soil would be boggy for about two years, but the land can be plan-ed to
paddy by broadcasting. The extent of the abandoned and wasteland reclaimed in
different project polders is given in Table 3.
Rural Structure
11.       Villages and towns are all built along the edge of the islands;
boats are Lhe means of transportation for travelling or for hauling. There
are no roads inside the islands, except footpaths between paddies; and
along embankments. Farmers build field huts near their farms for monsoon
occupation until harvesting and threshing are completed. Hauling between home-
stead and field huts requires oxen carts, shoulder carrying and small boat
transport along the small creeks and rivers. Fishing the internal creeks but
mainly in the surrounding rivers is also an important part of the rural life
for men, women, and children. Fish, together with rice, forms the standard
rural diet.
12.       Townships connected by creeks and rivers are the center of the
following: economic activities for consumer goods; selling produce; taking
delivery of inputs; fuel; obtaining rural credit; and delivering paddy or jute
to Government buying centers, etc. Schools and clinics are available in
village tract small towns.
Present Land Use and Development Potential
13.       The gross area of the 11 project islands is about 247,000 ac of
which 205,000 ac is agricultural land including 128,000 ac cultivated,
65,500 ac abandoned and 11,500 cultivable wasteland. Of this, about 185,000
ac, including 120,000 ac of existing cultivated land, 62,000 ac of abandoned
land, and 3,000 ac of cultivable wasteland, would be improved and developed
as follows:

Population and Farm Labor Supply
14.       The rural population of the project area is about 119,000 persons.
Land holding families comprise about half the total and landless families
about a quarter of the total. However, in five areas in the lower delta
(Letpanbin, Myogon, Daw Nyein, Dedalu, and Bantbwezu) records show that the
number of landless exceed the number of farm families. Average family size
and numbers of working family members in the project areas are given in
Table 4 and summarized below:

Farm Size and Land Tenure
15.       Before independence in 1948, tenants of large land holdings
farmed the majority of cultivated land using hired labor. After independ-
dence, GOB enacted land reform laws which provided for land nationalization,
elimination of tenancy, distribution of land to tenants and hired workers,
and changes in land taxation. It established Village Land Committee (VLC)
to assign cultivation rights and organize the collection of land revenue.
Appeals against VLC decisions are made upwards to townships, Land Commit-
tees and to the Central Land Committee. Individual land ownership is not
permitted except for plantation land growing tree crops. Land rents and
absentee ownership are illegal, nor can land be mortaged or taken in lieu
of loan repayment.
16.       Land allotment is made on the basis of one tatontum per family.
(Initially, priority was given to farmers then occupying the expropriated
lands). The tatontum is a unit of land workable by a bullock-drawn plow
which varies from place to place according to the type of soil, the crops
grown and population pressure. It is currently about 12.5 ac in the coastal
region and 10 ac in the middle delta (Table 5). Each VLC establishes the
size of a tatontum. Land use rights cannot be inherited but VLCs customarily
assign rights of deceased cultivators to sons or other members of their
families. If land is left idle or abandoned, village committees can assign
land use rights to farmers willing to cultivate it.
17.       As a result of land reform measures and absence of extremely large
land holdings, the size of distribution of holdings in the delta areas which
was severely skewed before independence has been somewhat evened. Data
supplied by GOB show the following farm size distribution in the project
areas:
Size of      No. of                   Average

18.       Landholders may be categorized roughly into three groups:
(1) farmers below the subsistence level who must supplement farming income;
(2) farmers whose land provides family requirements plus a small surplus,
and (3) farmers with larger holdings who generally employ some hired labor,
in many cases some full time employees. The lower delta farmers can only
grow one crop. The middle group is comprised of farmers holding about 10 to
12 ac; in the middle delta where soil moisture and lack of salt water intru-
sion hazard permits more intensive cultivation, this group is comprised of
farmers holding 6 to 8 ac. On the basis of the GOB figures on population
and distribution of holdings given above, about 40% of the rural population
in the project area are farm workers earning all or the bulk of their in-
come as wages paid by others, primarily by large landholders comprising less
than 15% of the population.
Cadastral Records and Maps
19.       Burma is outstanding among the South Asian countries in its effort
for keeping up-to-date the cadastral records and maps done initially by the
Burma Survey during the pre-independence years. The mapping unit is a kwin,
an area of some 400 to 500 ac. Kwin maps give the boundary of every existing
land holding and even parcels within the holding. Each kwin is under the
charge of a Village Revenue Officer, who is the front-line officer of the
Settlement and Land Records Department of MAF. The kwin maps and corresponding
records are being used for assessing paddy yields and determining the compulsory
paddy procurement quota of each and every paddy cultivator, as well as for
collecting land revenue. Under the project, new kwin maps and records would
be prepared for the reclaimed land.

BURMA
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Present and Future Agricultural Production
General
1.        The total cropped area in Burma was 22.8 m ac in 1974, which on a
net cultivated land area of 19.9 m ac gives a cropping intensity of 115%.
Rice accounts for 55%, oilseeds, 19%, pulses 7%, other cereals 5%, fiber
crops 2% and the remaining crops 12% of the total cropped area (Table 1).
Irrigated land covers only 12% of the net cultivated area, and only 14% of
the irrigated area is double cropped, as the present irrigation is mainly
diversion (run-of-the river) systems. About 8.9 M ac of rice land is
located in Lower Burma which with fertile soils and dependable rainfall,
has been the main surplus rice producing area in Burma, while Upper Burma
with 2.8 M ac and hill regions with 0.9 M ac are rice deficit areas. Com-
pared to the pre-war period, there has been an increase of about 300,000 ac
of rice area in Upper Burma due to expansion into marginal land, while there
has been a loss of about one million acres of good rice land in Lower Burma
due to flooding and salt water intrusion through totally or partially eroded
protection embankments. During the last decade, even with extension of HYV
to about 1.0 M ac, the rice production increased only 0.2%. The 1973 to
1975 average paddy production was about eight million tons.
2.        The Irrawaddy Division has the bulk of the delta and about a quarter
of the rice area in Burma. Some 40% of the paddyland lost in Lower Burma
occured in this division and was due to disrepair of embankments, flooding
and salt water intrusion (Annex 1, Table 1). Its present total cropped
area is 4.1 M ac, net cultivated area, 3.75 M ac, and cropping intensity,
109%. Rice accounts for 86% of the cropped area, jute 5%, pulses 5%, ground-
nuts 3%, other 8% (Table 2). Paddy is the only field crop cultivated in the
lower Irrawaddy Delta where ten out of 11 project islands will be located, and
it is grown only during the wet season. In the middle delta where the project
has one island, monsoon rice is still dominant, but the pre-monsoon jute crop
with pump irrigation has achieved significance. Some rainfed pulses and
groundnuts are grown after rice harvest, as well as some fruits and vegetables
on high lands near villages.
Rice
3.        There is a main wet season crop and a small winter dry season crop
called mayin. The wet season crop includes:
(i) Kankyin with a growing period of 140-150 days
and harvesting in October;
42



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(ii)  Kauklat with a growing period of 150-170 days and
harvesting in November; and
(iii)  Kaukkyi with a growing period of 170-200 days and
harvesting in December/January.
The mayin crop has a growing period of 140 to 150 days.  It is sown around
perennial rivers and harvested in March/April. In the Irrawaddy Division,
the wet season crop accounts for 99% and dry season crop only 1% of the
total rice crop as in the rest of the country (Table 2).
4.        Local varieties are of the indica type.  There are over one thousand
named varieties and many vernacular names may apply to the same variety grown
in different localities. These varieties, which attract varying market
prices, are classified into five main types based on physical characteristics
of the grain.  Only three are important in the Irrawaddy Division:
(i) Ngasein - The grains are short, broad, fairly
translucent, often with a white belly. This group
is the most common and comprises the largest number
of varieties, mills fairly well and is the most
widely grown type in Lower Burma. It accounts
for 50% of the rice crop in the Irrawaddy Division.
It also constitutes most exports.
(ii)  Medon - This type is next most common.  The grain
is softer and more chalky than Ngasein, but because
of its short, plump, round shape, it mills well.
It is popular for home consumption in Lower Burma
as well as for export to South East Asia and the
Far East. It has a higher domestic price than
Ngasein. The highest priced Medon variety is
called Ngakywe.
(iii)   Emata - The grains are long and slender and there-
fore break easily in milling. However, it is also
hard and translucent so that a more attractice rice
emerges after high polishing, and this was exported
as Super Sughandi in the pre-war period. Zeeya and
Hnanga varieties also belong to this group.
5.        The HYV are presently grown on only 5% of the rice cultivated area
in the whole country and 4% in the Irrawaddy Division (Tables 3 and 4). Be-
cause of poor eating quality, expansion of IR-8 was discouraged by GOB and
the area under IR-8 was only 18,000 ac in 1974. On the other hand, the area
under IR-5 has expanded from 12,000 ac in 1970 to over 600,000 ac in 1975
and C-63 from 62,000 ac in 1972 to nearly 190,000 ac in 1975 (Table 5).
Characteristics of major traditional and HYV varieties in Lower Burma are
given in Table 6. The most popular HYV for Lower Burma at present is IR-5,
but due to lack of water control less than 1,000 ac of IR-5 out of a total
of 600,000 ac grown in the country, are found in the project area.             43

6.        Paddy is reportedly 60% transplanted and 40% broadcast in Lower
Burma. The ratio, however, varies greatly between divisions. In the two
largest divisions, Irrawaddy and Pegu, about three-fourths are reportedly
transplanted (Table 7). But in the lower delta project area, rice is mostly
broadcast. All paddy farm work in Lower Burma particularly the lower delta,
are done by animal and hand tools. Tractor land preparation and low-lift
pump irrigation introduced and used for jute cultivation in the middle delta
have recently spread to small areas of dry season irrigated HYV paddy.
7.        Jute.  Jute has recently become an important crop in Burma.  It is
grown mainly as a pre-monsoon crop with small pump irrigation in the Irrawaddy
Delta along the banks of river channels. Land preparation is done after irri-
gation in January or February with drafts animals or with tractors rented from
the Agricultural Mechanication Department (AMD) or cooperatives. Jute is
generally sown in March and harvested in July/August. It is usually followed by
Hnanga rice which is transplanted in September as far as water depth permits
and harvested in January/February. Early jute sometimes is followed by Ngasein
which is harvested in November/December.
Production Constraints
8.        Crop Failures:  Crop failure is the biggest constraint in Lower
Burma. The ten year data from 1963/64 to 1972/73 shows that on average for
the country as a whole, about 9% of the total sown acreage of all crops are
destroyed totally and 11% have to be sown more than once (Table 8). About
20% of the sown acreage are damaged yearly, and about half of this has to be
salvaged by re-seeding.   Geographical and crop-wise breakdowns are not avail-
able, but since rice forms 55% of the total cropped area of Burma (in Lower
Burma 86%) it can be reasonably assumed that it has its proportionate share
of the damaged area. In the middle delta, flooding due to rapidly rising
rivers wash away or submerge rice seedlings. The jute crop suffers from
drought if planted without adequate irrigation and from flood damage at harvest
time, losing 25% to 30% of the yield; the average fiber yield per sown acre is
only 600 lbs as against 800 lbs per matured acre. In the lower delta, the
damage to paddy is caused by daily tidal innundation by sea water. While
monsoon rain flushes out salt from drainable land during low tide, salts
accumulate in depressions, causing increasing abandonment of paddy cultivation
and encroachment of salt tolerant mangroves or grasses.
9.        Use of Over-aged Seedlings.  Because of the depth of water, the
delta farmers generally transplant ten inch to one-foot-tall HYV seedlings
and one and quarter foot to one and one half foot tall seedlings of local
varieties. Use of over-aged seedlings reduces the number of effective tillers.
Moreover seedlings growing tall in nurseries have long basal internodes causing
lodging after bearing. Both factors cause lowering of yields.
10.       Soil Salinity.  Standing rice plants in the lower delta generally
show premature yellowing and drying up of lower leaves, with apparent in-
crease in severity with rising soil salinity in October when monsoon rain
tapers off. The loss of viable leaves depresses yield. Ngasein is most
44



ANNEX 2
Page 4
tolerant among local varieties. The HYVs are mostly non-tolerant. Soil
salinity and lack of moisture during the dry season causes a total fallow of
the land; not even pulses can be grown at present.
11.       Low Farm Input Use.  Official statistics 1/ show that 43,965 tons
of urea were programmed for 1.14 M ac of paddy in the 1972-1973 crop year. It
means that less than 10% of the 12 M ac of paddy in Burma in that year applied
urea at an average rate of 40 lb N per ac. This included perhaps all of the
HYV rice and only nursery applications on some native varieties. Urea pro-
grammed for the 1973-1974 paddy crop was at about the same level. The per-
centage of total paddy area applied with phosphate and potash fertilizers
and rates of application are equally low. Also delta farmers do not carefully
conserve cattle manure and apply it regularly on paddy fields. Growing green
manure following paddy harvest in the lower delta is precluded by low soil
moisture and high salinity in the dry season. Hispa a leaf-cutting caterpillar
and case worms usually appear early in the rice growing season, while stem
borers and ear-cutting caterpillars, appear late in the season. Farmers general-
ly own no sprayers or dusters. In severe out-breaks, the Pest Control Squads of
the Agricultural Corporation Township Manager's office spray free of charge for
farmers. The coverage is usually too small to be effective. Young quasi-sea
crabs migrate from the sea into coastal islands at about the end of August, and
adult crabs move out to sea by the following July. The latter do considerable
damage to young rice plants when they migrate through the field.
12.       Fertilizer Shortage.  At present, the lack of water control, the
salinity problem and the use of over-aged seedlings suppress rice yield
response to fertilizers. The correction of adversities by the project would
greatly increase rice yield response to fertilizers. Burma uses locally
produced urea. It exports some urea and uses the foreign exchange received
for importing the needed phosphate and potash fertilizers. Fertilizers are
allocated only to HYV rice, cotton, jute, tobacco and sugarcane. As long as
GOB is actually short of foreign exchange, the expected increased demand of
fertilizers by the project can only be met by cutting down export or reducing
allocations to other regions. Both would be undesirable. If projects similar
to this one are to be repeated in the delta area, the fertilizer shortage
would become a major bottleneck to development.
13.       Low Yields of Groundnuts.  Groundnuts are harvested in April in
Shwelaung. Seeds stored by farmers through the monsoon months (83% - 89%
relative humidity June through October) until the planting season in
November generally have very low germination of 30% or less. Very poor
stand preconditions a very low yield. The hardness of the soil surface
during the dry season is also suspected to contribute to the low yield, as
it would prevent the flower branches to penetrate the soil to form the
groundnut pods. Low yield and high seed price discourages farmers from
growing this crop which is much in demand for edible oil and as supple-
mentary food.

14.       Labor and Farm Power.  The average size of farm in the middle delta
island is 6.5 ac and in the 10 lower delta islands is 12 ac, which is large by
Asian standards. An average farm family has five members with three adult
workers, an equivalent of two attend to farm works. With animal and manpower,
most families need to hire labor during the peak seasons of land preparation
transplanting, harvesting and post-harvesting handling (Annex 14). Hired
labor comes from landless families in the villages and other families. When
the project increases cultivated area by one-third through land reclamation
and allotment to landless families, it is expected that population increase
would maintain labor demand and supply at an adequate level. But animal power
will become a constraint, unless adequately supplemented by additional tractors
and power tillers.
Present Cropping Patterns and Producion
15.       The present cropped area for the whole project is about 135,100 ac
which on a net cultivated area of 127,800 ac gives a cropping intensity of
106%. This is lower than the average of 109% for the Irrawaddy Division
and 115% for the whole country. Rice, almost entirely rainfed, accounts for
90%, jute 6% and others including fruits and vegetables, groundnuts and pulses
the remaining 4% of the cropped area. The cropping calendar is shown in
Figure 1.
16.       Lower Delta.  The present cropped area for the ten islands of the
lower delta project area totals 95,300 ac which, on a net cultivated area of
about 95,300 ac, gives a cropping intensity of about 100%. The only crop
grown is rainfed rice which comprises about 60% Ngasein and 40% Ngakywe and
other Medon varieties. The crop is mostly broadcast, but in areas well pro-
tected from sea water intrusion by embankments it may be transplanted. The
yield is generally very low ranging from about 900 lbs to 1,500 lbs per ac.
The present cropped area and production are given in Tables 9 and 10 and the
summarized extracts are below:

17.       Middle Delta.  The total cropped area in the Shwelaung Island in
the middle delta is 39,800 ac which on a net cultivated area of 32,500 ac
gives a cropping intensity of 122%. Rice accounts for 69%, jute 20%, fruits
and vegetables 9%, and groundnuts and pulses 2%. The rice crop is generally
transplanted, but flooding frequently delays transplanting and even makes
replanting necessary. Yield is generally low (1,000 to 1,500 per ac). The
46



ANNEX 2
Page 6
rice crops include Ngasein, Ngakywe (Medon) and Hnanga (Emata) varieties.
Ngasein and Ngakywe are generally transplanted in July/August and harvested
in December. Hnanga is generally transplanted in September as a second crop
after jute, harvested in January/February, and needs supplementary irriga-
tion. Jute is sown with pump irrigation in March and harvested in August.
Some groundnuts and pulses are cultivated with residual soil moisture after
harvest of the wet season rice crop.

Phasing of Development
18.       With the intensified extension service to begin as soon as the
project begins (Annex 5), full projected crop acreage and yield levels are
expected to be reached on the existing cultivated land in five years after
the completion of project construction. In the ten lower delta polders,
applying intensive cultural practices on the reclaimed land would take a
couple of years longer because the boggy soil needs time to firm.   However
reaching full development on such soils can still be achieved five years after
project construction. Full development is projected to reach different polders
as follows:

Future Cropping Patterns and Production
20.       Lower Delta.  On completion of the project, the total net cul-
tivable area in the lower delta project area would increase from 95,300
to 147,000 ac entirely cultivated with rice in the wet season. With pro-
tection from salt water intrusion and drainage, HYV would cover about 40%
of the area, replacing the low yielding Ngasein variety. It is estimated that
the rice crop would comprise about 40% Medon (Ngakywe), 40% HYV and only 20%
Ngasein. With the gradual elimination of salinity and retention of fresh
water in the drains, it is also expected that it would be possible to grow
pulses with residual soil moisture on about 30% of the area during the dry
season. Future cropped area and production are summarized below:

21.       Middle Delta.  On completion of the project, the net cultivated
area would increase from the present 32,500 ac to about 38,000 ac, the total
cropped area, from 39,800 ac to 66,000 ac and cropping intensity, from 122%
to 174%. Even after the project construction is completed, the sluice gates
of the Shwelaung polder must be kept closed throughout the month of August
and September, as water level in surrounding rivers during the period would
be higher than inside of the polder. Controlled drainage would resume again
in October when rivers rapidly fall. Land use planning in Shwelaung, there-
fore, takes into consideration the water depth inside of the polder, shown
in the following table.

22.       Excluding areas occupied by embankments, towns and villages, total
crop area in the wet season totals 37,950 ac. All HYV fruits and vegetables
would be on land flood free during August/September. About 60% of the jute-
Hnanga rotation would be on land submerged up to six inches while 40%
would be submerged up to 1 ft. Some 85% of Medon would be submerged up
to 1 ft; the balance, up to 1.5 ft. All Ngasein would be submerged up to
1.5 ft during the two months in which the sluice gates are closed. Land
lower than 4 ft elevation would be left undeveloped and unused.
23.       The wet season HYV, Medon and Ngasein generally have nurseries in
June and are transplanted in July. Since HYV would be grown on flood free
land, bunding and water management would be emphasized by the extension
service. If necessary, supplementary irrigation may be supplied by pumping.
Planting of Medon and Ngasein would be moved forward somewhat to
enable transplanting younger seedlings and allow sufficient plant growth
before water depth starts to build up by rain inside of the polder after
the sluice gates are closed in August. The present area of Hnanga rice
is less than half of that of jute at present, due mainly to the depth of
water after the harvest of jute in August or September.   Under the project,
water in the streams and drains inside of the polder would be regulated.
With additional tractors and pumps, planting of jute could be moved forward
somewhat, so that younger Hnanga seedlings can be used on 60% of its projected
acreage which is expected to be submerged up to six inches during August/
September. On the remaining 40%, taller seedlings will have to be used, but
even those would be younger than at present (1 ft, 3 inches). Such changes
in rice and jute calendars and the use of younger seedlings would be stressed
by the extension service.
24.       Groundnuts and pulses would follow Ngasein and Medon.  Extension
would emphasize proper storage of groundnut seeds.  Vegetables would be
benefitted by improved water supply from the peripheral drain formed by
the burrow pits for embankment construction, and the use of fertilizers.
It is believed that with irrigation, more than one crop of vegetables can
be grown in succession or by relay interplanting on the same land during the
dry season. The projected yield increase for fruits/vegetables is expected
to come mainly from vegetables. Groundnut and pulse acreage and yield would
benefit from improved residual soil moisture due to maintaining water in
the drains during the dry season.

Future Crop Yields
26.       With flood control and drainage, improved water management and
cultural practices, adequate supply of inputs, expanded use of HYV seeds and
an intensified extension service throughout the project area, crop yields
are projected to increase gradually during the construction period and
rapidly after the completion of construction and reclamation. The pro-
jected increase is summarized below:

Detailed phasing of paddy yield, by varieties is given in Table 12.
Increased Supply of Fertilizers
27.       To sustain the projected yield level and production, adequate
supply of fertilizers would be made to the project farmers not only for HYV
rice and jute, but also for local rice varieties, groundnuts, pulses and
vegetables. At full development, a total of 13,500 tons of fertilizers
would be required, as compared to about 1,000 tons at present. The demand
would, however, increase gradually from FY 1977 to FY 1988, as shown in
Table 13.
Summary
28.       At full development, paddy production is expected to increase
from about 68,000 tons per year at present to about 225,000 tons, jute from
about 2,000 to 8,000 tons, groundnuts from 300 to 2,700 tons, fruits/vegetables
from 4,000 to 5,700 tons, and cropping intensity from 106% to about 134%.
Without the project, the expected production is: paddy about 76,000; jute,
2,500; pulses, nil; and fruits/vegetables, 4,000 tons (Table 14).

LOWER BURM4A PA- A`END DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Civil Works
General
1.        The Irrigation Department (ID), which would have overall project
responsibility (Annex 12), would construct one polder in the middle delta
and ten separate polders in the lower delta (Maps 12016 and 12017). The
civil works would include approximately the following:
(a)  410 mi of earth embankments involving 11.4 M cu yds of
earthwork;
(b)  770 mi of interior drainage channel enlargement and
new excavation, totalling 11.6 M cu yds of earthwork;
(c)  90 concrete pipe drainage culverts (4 ft diameter), each
with one flap gate;
(d)  45 reinforced concrete drainage sluice structures
varying in width from 15 ft to 150 ft, each with a
number of standard-sized openings with flap gates fitted
on the river side and slide gates on the inland side;
(e)  20 timber bridges for bullock carts and 180 ft crossings
on interior channels;
(f)   ten masonry and reinforced concrete channel regulators
in Shwelaung Island to control water levels for lift
irrigation;
(g)  buildings for the offices, staff quarters, and stores for
construction operation and maintenance forces;
2.        In addition, the Agricultural Corporation (AC) and the Agriculture
Mechanization Department (AMD) would construct the following agricultural
support facilities (Annex 6):
(i) four fertilizer storage godowns;
(ii) one middle delta tractor workshop and six lower
delta power tiller workshops.                                 71



ANNEX 3

3.        These works are described below and the estimated quantities for
each potder are given in TabLe 1.
Status of Engineering
4.         The II) civil works designs and estimates for this Appraisal Report
ire based on one inch to one mile maps, existing aerial photographs and sample
surveys in Shwelaung middle delta island and the lower delta islands of
Zinbaung atnd Letpanbin (Maps 12016 and 12017). The lower delta islands are
,nost closely represented by Letpanbin conditions. In the design of embankment
crest heights and drainage sluices for Shwelaung Island, ID used flood levels
based on analysis of 30 years daily stage records at one gauge and hourly
records from July through October 1975 at eight gauge points around the
island. The II) based flood levels for lower delta polder designs on analysis
of long-term coastal tide records and hourly records during the 1975 flood
period at seven gauge points in the vicinity.
5.         The ID Planning and Design Division would complete surveys and
copographic mapping for all 11 polders and planning for eight lower delta
polders. It would prepare final designs and cost estimates prior to con-
struction in each polder. The ID would continue to take river stage records
year rouLnd for Shwelaung Island during construction for use in the final
sLaice designs and for preparing drainage and irrigation operating require-
;nents at each location.  Two ID project construction divisions would prepare
the construction programs and set embankment and drain alignments (Annex 12).
Embankments
6.         Earth embankments would be constructed and existing embankments
rebuilt to provide 3 ft freeboard over river flood levels based on a one-in-
ten years frequency for the middle delta polder and the Highest High Water
Level (HHWI) for the lowtr delta polders. Embankment crest heights would
range from 5 to 10 ft, averaging about 8 ft on Shwelaung and about 6 ft in
the lower delta. All embankments would have 6 ft wide crests, 10 ft wide
access roadways and 2.5 to 1 side slopes.  The roadways would run about 3 ft
below and on the inland side of the crest to provide the most efficient
and stable embankment section. Earth fill would be excavated at a minimum
of 40 ft from the inland embankment toe and in most places the borrow pits
would be used as perimeter drainage channels.  Embankments and perimeter
drains would range from 120 to 150 ft wide and overall, would occupy 6,000
to 7,000 ac or about 4% of the culturable land.
7.        Apart from the embankment fronting Shwelaung town, river banks in
the middle and lower delta appear comparatively stable. Because the existing
embankment at Shwelaung town would require about 3.4 mi of special revetLient
works with which there has been little successful experience in Burma, tne
project would construct a new embankment located on the inland side of to;.i.

Drainage Channels
8.        Existing interior channels would be enlarged, realigned and, when
necessary, new drainage channels excavated so as to lower interior water
levels below the fields within 72 hours following a three day rainstorm of
six inches (50% frequency) when river tidal levels at sluice outlets permit
discharge at least 50% of the time. This corresponds to a channel design
capacity based on about 53 cfs per sq mi of drainage area. Channel depths
and dimensions would vary depending on the relative river tidal levels and
land elevations as well as on drainage catchment areas. In Shwelaung polder,
the river tidal levels would govern the extent to which interior depressed
areas could be drained. Excavation, averaging about 15,000 cu yd per channel
mi, would include deepening and widening existing channels as well as cutting
new channels. Additional land rights of way would amount to less than 2% of
the cultivable area.
Drainage Control Structures
9         Outlet control culverts and sluices would be provide where the
polder embankments cross key drain outlets. Single 4 ft diameter concrete
pipe culverts fitted with a steel flap gate on the river side would be pro-
vided at small channels. Reinforced concrete sluice structures with vary-
ing numbers of standard-sized gated openings would be provided across large
channels. Gate openings would be 4 ft by 7 ft for Shwelaung sluices and
4 ft by 5 ft for lower delta sluices. Each would be fitted with a steel
flap gate on the river side and a steel slide gate on the inland side for
both drainage and irrigation supply. The structures would include concrete
and masonry wing walls, stone-pitched aprons, and where necessary, upstream
and downstreams sheetpiling.
10.       Channel Regulators.  On Shwelaung Island, to regulate the impounded
water levels in the interior channels and thus to provide a reservoir for dry
season small-pump irrigation supply, check structures would be provided at
appropriate watershed points. These would be masonry and reinforced con-
crete structures fitted with slide gates which would be left open during
the monsoon season.
11.       Channel Crossings.  Crossings for bullock carts and individuals
would be provided where required over the perimeter and main drainage
channels. Cart crossing would consist of timber bridges arched to permit
channel boat traffic. Foot path crossings would consist of small pipe
culverts at some drainage channels and high bamboo bridges where boat
traffic would pass. The estimated numbers of crossings are based on an
average of one bridge per 10,000 ac and one foot crossing per 1,000 ac.

Buildings
12.       The project would provide housing and stores for operation and
maintenance staff, additional AMD repair workshops, and additional facili-
ties for AC fertilizer distribution points. The 0 & M buildings would
be at five locations (Letpanbin, Dedalu, Alegyun, Dauntgyi and Shwelaung)
and would include at each location quarters for officers, staff, and wage
labor, an office and a storehouse. These would serve all the polders ex-
cept Bantbwezu where an 0 & M unit exists. The proposed buildings are de-
scribed in Annex 12, Table 4. The additional AMD and AC facilities are
described in Annex 6, Tables 1 and 5.
Construction
13.       The civil works would be scattered over 11 islands spanning over
a distance of 1,200 mi and would be comprised mainly of earthwork (embank-
ments and drains). The drainage sluices and project buildings would be
small and simple structures. All these works would be subject to seasonal
weather interruption (with 80 inches of rain during rainy season) and would
have to be phased so as to cause the least interruption to cultivation.
Under these circumstances they would not be suitable for international
competitive bidding. The ID would carry them out by force account as they
traditionally do, as there is no appropriate contracting industry in Burma.
These works are not new to ID; they have had extensive experience in de-
signing and constructing them for several decades.
14.       The ID Mechanical Division of about 100 men and operators would
use heavy equipment, to be provided by the project for the embankment con-
struction (primarily the draglines and scrapers) and the channel excavation
(draglines and existing dredges). The ID would carry out the work each year
over the 7 to 8 month dry period from November to June, operating the equip-
ment about 16 hours per day. Two ID project construction divisions of
120 men each, including 15 headquarters staff, 75 field staff, and 30
maintenance staff, would coordinate the construcion program and complete
the structures and 0 & M buildings (Annex 12).
15.       Construction of the flood control and drainage facilities for
the 11 islands would span over six years, with three islands completed
in Year Two, three in Year Three, one in Year Four, and four in Year Six,
as detailed in Fig. 1.

LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Land Reclamation and Settlement of Landless Families
General
1.        The project would develop a total of 185,000 ac of land, comprising
120,000 ac presently cultivated and reclamation of 64,900 ac of abandoned
land. These abandoned lands are now under various types of vegetation
(Table 1). In the middle delta Shwelaung, land clearing of standing vege-
tation would be followed by an initial tractor plowing/harrowing. In the
lower delta polders, the soils after land clearing are too soft and boggy
for use of tractors. For two years, farmers would broadcast paddy between
tree stumps without land preparation.
2.        The lands were abandoned initially during the Second World War,
and subsequently due to change in land tenancy system and local insurgencies.
The physical cause was mainly the breakdown of the old embankments. Pre-
cisely how much abandoned land can be put back into production before and
how much (the low lands) can return to production only after the project
embankment construction is completed and the depression drained can be
ascertained only after surveys are made. For planning purposes, it has
been assumed that about 50% of the abandoned land can be reclaimed before
completion of project construction, and the allottees could sow paddy
immediately after the land is cleared. On the other 50%, farmers would not
be able to grow crops before the project construction is completed, even if
the land is cleared, because the deep flood (Shwelaung) or the salinity
(lower delta) would still prohibit crop growth.
Land Clearing and Reclamation
3.        Grass --  Some abandoned land in Shwelaung has only common short
grasses (Table 1). The grass would be burned, and the land plowed up and
harrowed by 50 hp tractors. Tall Kaing grass (Saccharum arundinaceum and/or
S. spontaneum) also occurs only in Shwelaung. Ten man-days per acre are
estimated to be required for clearing the land. The traditional way is
for an average family of five (two farm workers) to cut the Kaing, with
long blade knives, dip up stump by picks, plow and plant one acre of paddy
per year. In the meantime, the family workers seek outside work and fish
to sustain the family until enough land is developed. Under the project,
each family would be allotted 10 ac. Family labor would be used to clear
5 ac each year for two years, while the initial uprooting, disc plowing
and harrowing would be done by tractors provided by the project. This would
enable the family to grow 5 ac of land in the first year and have enough time
to earn some income from outside work until the first harvest.

ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        Kyu/Kyaya -- are stiff bamboo-like plants which occur in both the
middle and lower deltas. Some 18 man-days per ac are required to clear them.
In Shwelaung, the land would be plowed and harrowed by tractors after land
clearing by hand tools. In lower delta polders, the farmers would be able
to broadcast directly on the soft land.
5.        Mangrove (Heritiara, fomes, Cariops, roxburgluaira, Avicenning
Officinalis, Kandelia, rheedii, etc.) -- occurs in all lower delta polders.
Light mangrove has trees of 4 inches to 6 inches in diameter; 20 man-days per
ac are required to clear them. Medium mangrove has trees of up to six inches
to 12 inches in diameter; 24 man-days are required to clear the land, and
power chain saws would be needed to cut down the bigger trees. Heavy man-
grove has trees over 1 ft in diameter; 32 man-days are required to clear the
land. The tree stumps would be left in the ground. The soil would be boggy.
Farmers would broadcast paddy between the stumps. In about two years, the
roots/stumps would be totally rotten, the soil would firm-up, and regular
improved farming practice could then begin.
Phasing of Land Reclamation
6.        Land reclamation and land allotment to displaced and landless
families would be phased (Table 2) according to the construction schedule of
the flood control structures (embankment, drains and sluice gates) for each
project polder:
a.   Each family would be allotted a 10 ac tract of land,
on an average basis of five members in a family,
including two adult farm workers.
b.   Sufficient families would move onto 50% of the land
to be reclaimed one year before or in the first year
of project construction. They would be allotted as
far as possible land easiest to clear, and would
clear the land mainly by family labor, over two or
three years.
c.   Another group of families would be allotted on the
remaining 50% of the land in the year immediately
following the completion of project construction.
They would finish clearing 10 ac of land in one year,
using family labor as much as possible, but would be
supplemented by project hired labor and chain saws
for felling large mangrove trees. The force-account
labor operation would be used.
d.   In Shwelaung, initial plowing and harrowing would be
done by tractor service to be provided by A1D. In all
lower delta polders, farmers would broadcast paddy
directly on the cleared land between stumps.                     78



ANNEX 4

Tool and Equipment Requirement
7.        Based on the different types of vegetation to be cleared, quanti-
ties of different tools and equipment needed for land reclamation are
estimated for each polder and phased over the development period. Table 3
summarizes the requirements and costs for the project as a whole.
Land Allotment
8.        Categories of Settlers.  Each township has already a name list of
"landless families and families with insufficient land." But because the
lack of protection against flood and of other forms of support, the land
allotment and reclamation has been on a piecemeal basis and gone at a slow
pace. Under the project, the work could be speeded up. There would be three
main categories of allottees in descending order of allotment priority:
a.   Farmers whose land would be occupied by project construc-
tion, i.e., the embankments and drain widening, would be
given first priority in allotment of the reclaimed land.
Exact numbers of families included in this category
cannot be estimated until the Irrigation Department has
finalized the embankment alignment for each polder. A
farmer with most of his land affected should have no
choice but to move, while another with only a small
portion of his land affected may select to stay.
b.   Families with no land or insufficient land whose names
are on the township list would have the second priority.
c.   Retired soldiers form a small third category.  When all
categories of allottees are allotted land the remaining
land would be allotted to families of retired soldiers.
Applicants would be selected from those who participated
in the force account mangroves clearing in the project.
9.        Procedure of Land Allotment and Settlement.  Some nine agencies
would participate in this operation as follows:
a.   The Irrigation Department would complete its engineering
survey and design, and determine the embankments and
drainage canal alignments in the field, one year prior
to the start of construction.
b.   Settlement and Land Records Department (SLRD) would
conduct a field survey to determine exactly on the kwin
(cadastral) maps the plots which would be affected by the
construction alignments. Affected farmers would be in-
formed one crop season before construction and evacuation
would take place in the dry season after harvest to avoid
loss of the standing crop.  Farmers would be given an             79



ANNEX 4
Page 4
option on whether to move, because land next to embankment
may be the most valuable. In Shwelaung, for example, such
land could grow two crops of HYV with pump irrigation or
jute followed by Hnanga rice. A list of evacuees would be
finalized by SLRD after consultation with all affected
farmers.
c.   SLRD, assisted by the Survey Department and using the kwin
maps would: (1) survey the abandoned and wasteland and de-
marcate lands which could be reclaimed and cultivated before
and after the project construction is completed; (2) prepare
a field alignment map of 10 ac plots showing also the
drainage channels and necessary farm roads; (3) stake out
the plot boundaries in the field; and (4) when all lands
are allocated, prepare new cadastral records and kwin maps.
d.   The Agricultural Machinery Department would place orders
for imported equipment (tractors and chain saws) for arrival
at project sites before the commencement of the dry season
(Table 2). The Cooperative Department would place orders
from local manufacturers for hand tools for arrival
in their local Village Tract Stores before the dry season.
e.   The Village Land Committee, would finalize a list of land
allotment, based on: (1) area of land and ntmber of plots
available for settlement as determined by SLRD and the Survey
Department, and (2) the list of displaced families mentioned
in b. above and its own list of landless families and families
having insufficient land.
The committee would call meetings of the settlers to
inform them of the following:
(i) the plot number allotted to each of them;
(2) the availability of tools and selling prices at
the local Village Tract Cooperative Stores;
(3) the availability of chain saws for rental from
the AMD Tractor Station or workshop and the
rental charge and service arrangment (Annex 6);
(4) the availability of tractor service from the
Shwelaung AMD Tractor Station for initial
plowing and harrowing of the reclaimed land
and service charge (Aknex 6);
80



ANNEX 4
Page 5
(5) the availability and terms and conditions of
medium-term credit from the local village banks
for the settlers to buy the hand tools, draft
animals, and to pay the chain saw rental and
tractor service charges as well as to buy material
for building field huts (Annex 10);
(6) the availability and terms and conditions of
short-term seasonal production credit at the
local village banks (Annex 10);
(7) the availability and selling price of paddy
seeds at the local Agricultural Corporation
Village Tract Stores for those who need them
(Annex 6).
f.   The Burma Agricultural Bank would have medium- and short-term
credit available at the local village banks for the settlers
(Annex 10).
g.   The Extension Service of the Agricultural Corporation would
prepare and promote a special extension information package
for advising settlers on farming the newly reclaimed land
(Annex 5).
h.   The People's Settlement Department would organize the force
account land clearing operations in other polders (para 6 c)
in coordination with ID and AMD. It would also administer
the settlement of families of retired soldier in the
Dauntgyi polder.
i.   The various activities mentioned in a-g would be coordinated
by the Project Unit at the Central level and by a Township
Project Committee at the Township level (Annex 11). Each
township committee member would conduct his own activities
and meet farmers' requests for services, supplies, equipment
and credit according to guidelines laid down by the Project
Unit, but report to the committee for coordination.
Compensation and Rural Infrastructure
10.       Since the land belongs to the State, no land compensation would
be paid to those farmers who would be obliged to evacuate from their present
land for the construction of embankments and drainage channels. Nor
would there be compensation for the standing crops, because as mentioned
in para 9 b evacuation would be made after the rice harvest.
81



ANNEX 4
Page 6
11.       Geographically and administratively the abandoned lands form parts
of the different surrounding villages and village tracts. The great majority
of the residential village houses are built around the edge of the islands,
and mostly of woven unplastered bamboo panels hitched to wooden posts, thatched
roofs and bamboo-mat floor. Better houses would have metal sheet roofing, and
flooring of loose put-on wood boards. Farms are in the polder. During the
rainy season, the men would live in simple field houses built on their farms.
The displaced farmers and landless families, already have their residential
houses in the villages. When allotted land, they do not need to move their
houses. They only need to build a field house by themselves (as they always
do) with locally available material. Neither would new rural infrastructure
be involved, because their children would be attending the same schools and
family members would be going to the same clinics in the village tracts where
they belong. In the few cases where the farmers must move their house, i.e.
because of the embankment construction, they would simply dismantle the houses
and rebuild them on land nearby. For the above reasons, no special rural
infrastructure constructions are provided under the project.
12.       Allottees, however, would be provided with medium-term credit for
purchasing tools and rubber boots needed for land clearing, material for build-
ing a field hut, and for paying chain saw rentals and tractor service charges
(para 9e).
Cost Estimates for Land Reclamation
13.       The total cost of land reclamation is estimated to be K 6.8
million (Table 4).

BURMA
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Intensified Extension Program
General
1.        The present low average crop yields in the project area (lower than
the national and District average) are due mainly to the tncontrollable
flood depth and salt water intrusion. Removal of adversities by the project
construction would be accompanied by introduction of improved cultural
practices, HYV and increased double cropping, through an intensified exten-
sion program. The 11 project islands are located in five townships, one
each in Wakema (middle delta); Laputta, Ngapudaw and Bogale (lower delta);
and seven in Pyapon (lower Delta). The GOB has agreed that the new extension
system to be adopted under this project would cover not only the project
polders but the entire five townships totalling 862,500 cultivated acres
and 105,000 farm families (Table 1).
Present Organization
2.        Agricultural Extension in Burma headed by a General Maoiager (GM)
Extension, is presently one of the functions of the Agricultural Corpora-
tion (AC) headed by a Managing Director (MD). The corporation is also in
charge of research, land use planning, seed supply, jute and cocton pro-
curement and supply of inputs. The MD for extension has under him five
divisions: Extension; Cereal, Oil and Other Crops; Industrial Crops; and
State Farms.
3.        The AC staff patterns (at different levels of administration)
call for:
a.   Division  --  A Division Manager with two deputies one
for procurement 1/ and one for extension,
b.   Township  --  A Township Manager with two deputies (same
as a).  There is a central farm at each town-
ship also under his charge.
C.   Village   --  A dual purpose manager.
1/   Officers for "procurement" are in charge of all busines~s activities,
including buying jute fiber and paddy seeds, managing J'ie lute buying
depot, fertilizer/pesticides godowns, supplying input v . -
87



ANNEX 5
Page 2
The positions are not always filled, particularly at the village tract
and village levels. More often than not one manager has to look after
more than one village tract or village. Moreover, AC apparently places
more emphasis on procurement of crops, supply of inputs and store keeping
and administration; the "extension" Deputy Managers often also spend much
time on these duties.
4.        A village manager is a high school graduate with ten-months pre-
service training at the Township Central Farm. He lives in the village.
Since he works for more than one villages and has no transportation, he spends
considerable time travelling between villages on foot or by boat. Before rice
planting season (March/May), most of his time is devoted to distributing inputs
and making advance payments. During the paddy growing season, he joins the
Village Revenue Officer three times in making field assessments of farmers'
paddy yield for determining each farmer's quota for paddy procurement by the
Trade Corporation-1. On the average, he spends about two days a week on
statistical reporting and accounting duties. He also attends various local
committee meetings: Village Council, Peasant's Council, Land Committee; and
he may be asked to serve the Peasant Committee Secretary. In short, he has
little time for disseminating the technical advice to farmers in the field.
He addresses general assembly meetings of the Village Council which all
farmers are required to attend; Village Council members are supposed to
further disseminate information to their neighbors.
5.        In Shwelaung, each VM supervises on an average some 900 farm
families and 4,800 ac of cultivated area. In all lower delta townships each
VM has to deal with from 600 to over 1,100 families and from 7,000 to
10,000 ac of cultivated area as shown below:

Other AC Services in Support of Extension
6.        Research -- The Research Division is headed by a separate General
Manager of AC. The Agricultural Research Institute (ARI) which conducts
basic research, has recently been moved to Yezin, approximately 200 mi
north of Rangoon. The Institute is currently assisted by a UNDP project 88



ANNEX 5
Page 3
on rice, cotton, pulses, and soil research and training. Sixteen Central
Experimental stations (Central Farms) roughly one to each Division/State,
conduct applied adaption research. The Irrawaddy Division Station, which
serves the entire project area, is located at Myaungmya in the middle
delta, about 35 mi west of the town of Wakema. At present, it has 86 ac
of research farm, only one research officer (a paddy specialist) and two
technicians.
Extension officers of the township are trained at the Central
Farm. There are no Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) at the Central Farm,
the AC division or Township Manager's offices.  Research support to
extension service in the project area is weak.
7.        Seed Supply  --  There are two AC Seed Farms in the Division:
one at Auk Kwin Gyi in Pyapon Township with about 180 ac of farm and the
other at Pan Tha Put in Mabin Township, with about 100 ac of farm. They are
operated under the supervision of AC Deputy Township Managers and assisted
by the local AC Village Tract Managers. The HYV seeds produced by the AC
seed farms are distributed to selected farmer seed growers and seeds pro-
duced therefrom are bought back by AC at farm gate prices both at 10% mini-
mum over the TC-1 paddy procurement price. The procurement and distribution
of seeds are done by AC extension staff at different levels. The quantity
sold to AC as seeds is allowed to off-set farmers' sales quota to TC-1.
The seed growers also save on transportation and handling costs which they
would otherwise incur in delivering quota paddy to TC-1 buying centers at
the Township. The procured seeds are then sold by AC to needy farmers at
cost, limited to 150% of TC-1 paddy procurement price for the same variety.
The seed program, though deficient in quality control, covers its own cost
and can expand quantitatively to meet the project's future seed requirement.
8.        Input Supply -- handled also by AC, has been discussed in Annex 13.
The shortage of fertilizers is a constraint to intensified agriculture.
The requirement for this project can be met by adjustments to be made in
the country, but the shortage will become more acute with growing future
projects.
Proposed Agriculturel Extension Program
9.        Line of Command and Staffing  --  The new system would start in
the entire area of the five project townships: Wakena, Pyapon, Laputta,
Ngapudaw and Bogale. Agricultural extension activities in these five town-
ships would be clearly separated from other activities 1/. All extension
officers would spend full time on project extension activities.  The
existing Special Projects Unit and its staff would be incorporated into the
new extension program.
I/   The GOB is considering a plan to separate the research, extension               89
and land use planning functions from AC and form a separate department.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
10.       Extension work under the project would be coordinated by a Project
Extension Manager (PEM) who would report to the AC Irrawaddy Division Manager.
Each township would have a Township Extension Manager (TEM) and a Township
Extension Deputy Manager (TEDM) who would supervise the work of two to six
Village Tract Extension Managers (VTEMs), each in charge of six Village
Extension Managers (VEMs). Each VEM would be responsible for about 800 farm
families (Table 2, and Annex 12 Figure 5).
11.       The PEM would be assisted by three SMSs for plant protection,
farm machinery and training; they would be stationed in the Pyapon Town-
ship. At the township level, there would be three SMSs, one each for paddy
cultivation at Pyapon and Laputta and one for both paddy and jute cultivation
in Shwelaung. All extension managers and SMSs would be selected on proven
professional merit within the existing AC extension and research staff. Early
recruits would be posted in project areas, additional ones ones would serve
areas outside of the project until all five Townships would be covered.
12.       Training  --  All VEMs and VTEMs would be trained once every two
weeks on a fixed day. These one-day sessions would be held at one or two
convenient locations in each township in groups of at least 15 persons.
The TEM would organize the training sessions with the help of the SMS for
training. The paddy, plant protection and farm machinery SMS would be
responsible for preparing the technical material to be used for each
session. In addition, once a month when VEMs come to the Township Office
to draw their salaries, they would participate in a joint training session
of all VEMs in the township.
13.       Training would adopt a "concentration of efforts" approach.  Each
session would be strictly limited to a few important recommended practices
(the impact points) relevant to the following week's activities according
to the crop season. Lectures would be limited to one-third of the total
scheduled time to allow time for full small group discussions, demonstra-
tions with staff of other agencies on topics current to the impact points
taken up at the session, i.e., supply of inputs and credit, marketing,
irrigation, flood control, etc.
14.       All SMSs would be annually trained at the Central Experiment
Station. Before each crop season, all extension staff would attend a
training-cum-discussion session for a few days in which they would discuss
and receive general guidelines for the coming crop season.
15.       Extension personnel, based on work performance would be selected
and sent abroad for training and studying at on-going extension projects
in neighboring countries.
Impact Points
16.       Key deficiencies in present farming methods causing low crop
yields would be carefully identified. Improvement techniques would be
worked out by SMSs and senior extension officers in consultation with          90
research experts. These "impact points" would be emphasized at the



ANNEX 5
Page 5
fortnightly VEM/VTEM training sessions. The full range of impact points
would be prepared before the project begins. Written hand-outs on such
points would be distributed to VEM/VTEM during the training sessions. The
overall shortage of fertilizers, pesticides, sprayers, dusters, draft
animals, farm power etc. has been discussed in Annex 2. The new extension
program would have to face the circumstances and advise farmers on the best
use of available resources.
Visits
17.       The village would be the basic extension unit for planning of
work. Each VEM would work with eight groups of about 100 farm families
each. The actual number of families in a group, however, may vary with
the village size and accessibility, and would be held flexible so as not
to break the village as a working unit.
18.       Under the guidance of his superior officers and in consultation
with the local Peasant's Council, the VEM would select seven to ten contact
farmers from each group. They would be selected from all levels of
the village society and for their technical influence on other farmers.
Farmers who are active members of the local Peasant Council would be given
preference. Contact farmers would be rotated among villagers.
19.       The VEM would visit each group of farm families on a fixed day
once every two weeks. He would visit the contact farmers in the field
during the morning hours as delta farmers generally leave their farm in
the early afternoon to avoid the intense heat. Afternoons would be devoted
to discussions with the entire group.
20.       A VEM would thus devote four days per week for visiting farm
groups, completing the eight groups under his charge in two weeks. One
day a week, he would attend the training session. Another day would
be spent in conducting field demonstrations, answering urgent calls and
attending to necessary office work.
21.       Each VTEM would supervise about six VEMs and visit each VEM once
a week when the latter is visiting farmer groups. He would schedule his
visits so as to be able to cover all farmer groups over a period of time.
He would check that the VEMs visit schedule was being kept, check the field
demonstrations, and assist VEMs and farmers in technical matters. The VEMs
would keep a current list of problems that need the VTEM's help.
22.       The SMSs would also schedule field visits according to anticipated
crop seasonal needs and would keep VTEM's and VEM's informed of their visit
schedules in the area.
91



ANNEX 5
Page 6
Transportation
23.       The VEMs would reside in a centrally located village.  Each VEM
would be provided with a small country boat; all VEMs in a township would
collectively share two small motorized country boats. Each VTEM would be
provided with a small motorized country boat. Each VTEM would have a medium-
sized motorized boat which they would share with the township SMSs. The
Project Extension Manager (PEM) and his assisting SMSs would share one large
and one medium-sized motorized boat. Operation and maintenance costs of the
boats and the pick-up during the project implementation period would be
included as project costs. A four-wheel drive pick-up would be placed at the
disposal of the Project Extension Director for transportation and light
hauling.
Paper Work
24.       All project extension staff's paper work would be kept to a minimum.
The VEMs, particularly, would handle only two kinds of paper work. Written
material would be strictly limited to extension material (concerning impact
points) received during the fortnightly training sessions. A daily work diary
would be kept for records of contact farmers and villages visited and problems
observed in the field and raised by farmers. The VTEMs would inspect VEMs
diaries. The VTEM, TEM and PEM's report forms would be designed and kept as
simple as possible.
Research Support
25.       The crop research for the country as a whole is being strengthened
by a UNDP Project.  The Agricultural Corporation is undertaking to provide
a plant protection specialist and a water management agronomist to the Myaungmya
Experiment Station for strengthening its present research staff which consists of
a paddy specialist.  These research officers, together with the six SMSs (para.
11) are expected to significantly improve the flow of available research inform-
ation to project farmers.

Other Agricultural Supporting Services
1.        Besides agricultural extension and applied research, training and
seed supply (Annex 5), other important agricultural supporting services in-
clude the supply of farm inputs, agricultural machinery services and rural
credit. This Annex discusses the services to be provided by the Agricultural
Corporation (AC) and the Agricultural Mechanization Department to project
farmers. Rural Credit is discussed in Annex 10.
Present System of Farm Inputs Supply
2.        The main agency for supplying farm inputs in Burma is the AC of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF) under the supervision of a General
Manager for Procurement, Planning and Statistics. Under the General Manager,
there are three divisions: Supply and Distribution; Statistics and Plans;
and Procurement and Processing. The AC has jute buying depots in townships
where jute is produced under the charge of AC Township Managers and Deputy
Managers for procurement. The AC has now 12 small fertilizer godowns in the
project area: five in Pyapon, three in Laputta and two each in the other
three project townships which are adequate for handling the present amount
(Map 11836 R).
3.        Under GOB's Four-Year Plan (1974/5-1977/8), targets for crop
acreage, production and major input supply are set through a process whereby
the targets were initially suggested by villages, compiled and sent up through
village tracts, and townships, but modified and finalized by the Ministry
of Finance and Planning in consultation with the MAF and supply agencies.
The finalized township targets are broken down into village tracts and village
targets by the township and Village Tract People's Councils. The planned
quantities of farm inputs are procured by AC and distributed according to
plan targets to AC township godowns. Quantities of various farm inputs
programmed for 1975/76 for the five townships of which the project polders
form a part, are as follows:

4.        The above allocation indicates a fair amount for Wakema
(i.e. 38 lbs) of urea per ac of existing cultivated land) owing to the
higher fertilizer consumption rate for jute and HYV rice. The lower delta
townships average only 8 lbs of urea per ac of existing cultivated land for
Pyapon and 5 lb per ac for the other three townships. With such low input
availability, there has not been any problem in disposal of all supplies
shipped to the townships. With a limited supply, GOB allocates fertilizers
in the country officially only to HYV paddy, jute, cotton, sugarcane and
tobacco; in the project townships only to HYV paddy and jute. Actually
when farmers get fertilizers they apply some on nurseries of local paddy
varieties and on vegetables. Since the project area has very little HYV
at present, and very little jute in the ten lower delta polders, the pre-
sent allocation, for which no data is available, is probably negligible.
Construction of New AC Fertilizer Godowns
5.        Under the project, the fertilizer requirement is expected to
increase slowly during the construction period but sharply after the con-
struction and land reclamation are completed. The estimated fertilizer
requirement of the project (13,500 ton at full development) is given in
Annex 2. The sum of the requirements for Ngasein, Medon and wet season
HYV, about 9,000 Ig tons is used for estimating the additional storage
capacity needed. Fertilizers for other rice varieties and other crops can be
stored in the same godowns in different months (Table 2). Tne AC would need
to construct four new fertilizer godowns over the development period in the
project (Map 11836 R).  Capital cost is estimated at K 1.87 ri and the 0 & M
costs at K 63,000 per godown per year (Tables I and 2).
6.        Pesticides, gunny sacks and seeds could be stored in the same
godowns. Shipping schedules of different inputs and management of godowns
would be improved by AC to achieve rapid turnover of the input godown space,
so that the existing and the four new godowns at 1,200 ton capacity each would
be able to handle about 9,000 tons of fertilizers during the peak requirement
season.

AMD Tractor Stations
7.        The Agricultural Mechanization Department (AMD)  of MAF has four
tractor stations in or near the project area as follows (Map 11836 R).

8.        The present distribution of low-lift pumps, tractors, and power
tillers in the above townships are as follows:

Total                     60                   59        28        2,091
The number of various equipment items in the project polders, however, is
not known except for the pumps, of which there are 270.  Only the Wakema
Tractor Station has some workshop equipment and a full staff. Those in
the lower delta have only hand tools to service the few tractors, power
tillers and the pumps belonging to cooperatives and farmer groups.
Sales of Farm Machinery
9.        The present procedure of distribution and sales of farm machinery
by AMD is as follows:
a.   Based on the Four Year Plan, the Central Committee of the
Agricultural Sector of MAF decides allocation of the machinery
to States/Divisions. The AMD informs the States/Division of
their quotas for the year; the States/ Divisions People's
Councils of their quotas for the year. The Councils discuss
and allocate quotas to townships and inform the AND head
office. The AMD then sends the machinery accordingly to
its Tractor Stations of the townships.
99



ANNEX 6
Page 4
b.   Farmers, farmer groups or cooperatives who desire to
purchase machinery would apply to the Township People's
Council through the Village Tract People's Councils.
The Economic Affairs Sub-Committee of the Township
Council would discuss and decide to which applicants
machinery would be sold. Based on the decision, the AMD
Tractor Station would sell to the chosen applications.
The Township Coucil and the Tractor Station would keep
a register of buyers.
C.   For buying the tractors, the buyers pay a 10% down payment
to AMD, followed by four annual installments of 20% each
and a final payment of 10%. For power tillers and low-
lift pumps, the downpayment is 50%, and the remainder must
be paid in 12 months.
Tractor Service
10.       While the AMD Tractor Stations sell other machinery some also
have their own tractors. In the project townships, only the Wakema Tractor
Station owns 60 tractors, all the Czech "Zwe" model of around 50 hp range.
It uses these tractors to provide custom tractor service to farmers at
K 18 per ac for plowing and K 12 per ac for one cross-wise harrowing (if
the farmer wants a second harrowing, he pays another K 12). These rates
are subsidized and are compared to AMD direct operating costs of K 28 and
K 17 per ac, respectively, for plowing and harrowing. One reason for AMDs
high operation costs is the large number of field staff at the Tractor
Stations.
11.       One station with 50 tractors, would have 104 men, including:
I Officer in charge
1 Deputy for field work
1 Deputy for the workshop
10 Mechanics
5 Workshop tradesman
75 Tractor operators
5 Head tractor operators
1 Field supervisor
5 Other staff
The 80 tractor operators (for 50 tractors) are employed the year round,
while tractors work hardly 90 days in a year at Wakema. The cooperatives
have a lower operating cost because of a much lower overhead. Government
policy now is to maintain AMD tractor strength in the country at 4,000
(with annual replacement of 300) and to sell all additional tractors to
cooperative or farmer group applicants.

Project Supplied Machinery
12.       Under the project, the following numbers of types of machinery
would be procured by AMD:
a.   1,000   4 inch low-lift pumps with 5 hp diesel engine
(together with existing pumps) for irrigating
7,000 ac dry season HYV rice and 15,000 ac of
jute-Hnanga rice rotation in the Shwelaung
polder.
b.     500   7 to 8 hp power tillers for supplying farm
power to 50% of the reclaimed land in ten
lower delta polders, totalling 30,800 ac.
c.      57   50 hp wheel tractors for Shwelaung polder,
24 of which would be kept by the AMD Wakema
Tractor Station to provide initial land
preparation service to reclaimed land,
and later for replacing the existing old
tractors at the station. The remaining
33 tractors would be sold to cooperatives or
farmer groups in the Shwelaung polder.
d.      33   disc plows for 33 tractors (another 24 disc
plows are listed under land reclamation
equipment, Annex 4).
e.      17   disc harrows (for dry land preparation) and
16 rotary cultivators -- for paddy land preparation
-- for 33 tractors (another 24 harrows listed
in Annex 4).
f.     500   quarter ton trailers, one for each power tiller.
g.     400   chain saws for cutting mangrove trees in the
lower delta polders.
13.       The basis of estimating the quantity is given in Table 3.  This
machinery is estimated to cost a total of K 17 million before taxes, duties,
transportation from port to project area and contingencies. The basis of
the cost estimates is given in Table 4.
Maintenance Facilities
14.       A maintenance workshop would be built in Shwelaung for servicing
tractors and low-lift pumps provided by the project (Map 11836 R). Work-
shop equipment would be provided (Annex 9, Table 6H). Six simple service
shops would be built in the lower delta for servicing power tillers and 101



ANNEX 6
Page 6
and chain saws to be used in two polders. Dauntgyi, Alegyun and Betut, being
isolated and belonging to different townships would have their own workshops.
The other seven polders, all belonging to Pyapon District would share three
workshops centrally located (Map 11836 R). The construction of these seven
workshops is estimated to cost about K 1 million. The workshop equipment and
tools would cost another K 1 million and miscellaneous items, about K 100,000
(Table 5).
Operation and Maintenance Charges
15.       The AMD would charge the services for tractor land preparation,
chain saw renting, repair and maintenance of all equipment at rates suffi-
cient to cover the full depreciation and cost of operating and maintaining
its department-owned tractors, chain saws and workshops (Main Report para 5.02
G (iv)).

BURMA
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Studies for Future Projects
Introduction
1.        This Annex discusses two studies to be conducted by GOB with
assistance from foreign consultants for planning and formulating future
projects. One is an Irrawaddy Delta-wide hydrological investigation for
establishing a series of projects like this project for further develop-
ment and reclamation of paddyland elsewhere in Lower Burma. The other is
to prepare a feasibility study for a first stage project for improving paddy
storage and handling (which can also be replicated), aimed at reducing post-
harvest loss of paddy both in Government depots/godowns as well as in farmers'
storages.
I. Delta-Wide Hydrological Study
Background
2.        There is a total of one million acres of abandoned paddyland in
Lower Burma (Annex 1, Table 1). In the Irrigation I Project (Credit 483-BA)
the minor flood embankments would protect 23,000 ac of farm lands from floods.
In the current project, the construction of flood control and drainage facil-
ities would reclaim about 65,000 ac of abandoned/wasteland and protect 120,000
ac of existing cultivated land from flood and salt water intrusion, which are
major constraints of Burma's paddy production, If this land ratio holds true,
reclaiming one million acres of abandoned/wasteland would benefit about two
million acres of existing paddyland as well (out of a total of about 9 M ac in
Lower Burma).
3.        Discussion between GOB and IDA have led to the following
conclusions:
a.   It is highly desirable to repeat this project elsewhere
in Lower Burma and to develop a series of similar projects
for future financing. The project components would by
and large be the same for all future projects. Con-
struction would be done mainly by machine. The survey,
design and construction techniques are simple and well
within the capability of the Irrigation Department. A
new project can be started without waiting for the com-
pletion of the previous one; in fact, the benefit from
109



ANNEX 7
Page 2
each polder would begin as soon as the construction in
that polder is completed.
b.   Based on a six year construction period for each project
(as in this project) and the staggering of successive project
implementation periods, an increased number of engineers,
surveyors, technicians and machine operators would be re-
quired. However, because sufficient numbers of engineers
and technicians are presently unemployed and available in
Burma, and the numbers required would not increase all at
once, but would be recruited, trained and absorbed into the
work force of the Irrigation Department (ID) over four or
five years, this would not pose insurmountable difficulties.
The management capability of the Department would also
increase with time and should not be a problem.
c.   The concern is the effect of building more and more
polders, and thus constricting river channels during
floods, on the river flow, the tidal movement and the
consequent changes in overall hydrology and hydraulics
in the delta and along the river mouths. A delta-wide
hydrological study is deemed necessary for safe planning
of the later projects in the series. However, the
selection of polders for a second project does not need
to wait for the completion of the study. Instead, if
the current project begins in FY 1977, the second project
can be prepared and appraised in FY 1978 and work can
begin in FY 1979.
Outline Plan of Study
4.        Hiring of Consultants:  A foreign consulting firm or a group of
qualified and competent individual consultants would be engaged under the
project to assist GOB in conducting the study.
5.        Hydrologists -- Two hydrologists would be engaged by the firm as
soon as the credit becomes effective.
Duration:
1 hydrologist                    26 months
1 hydrometrist                   19 months
Other experts                     3 months
Sub-total                 48 man-months
These experts would advise and assist ID in procuring and installing
hydrological network equipment; establishing a laboratory for water
110



ANNEX 7
Page 3
quality analysis; establishing procedures and training ID staff in the
0 & M of the network and analyzing and interpreting data collected. They
would also advise ID in systematic gathering and compiling of all available
information, data and maps necessary for delta development planning.
6.        Training of Burmese Hydrologists  -- In the first year of pro-
ject implementation, two ID engineers and two technicians would be selected
for receiving training abroad on hydrology and hydrometrics, each for one
year. Their training curriculum would be arranged by the selected consulting
firm in such a way that the training received would be pertinent to specific
works to be done in the Irrawaddy Delta development planning. They would
return to Burma in the second year.
7.        Delta Development Reconnaissance Team  -- A team of experts in
fields of delta development engineering, river engineering, land reclamation
and soils, irrigation/drainage engineering an land/water use agriculturist
(the exact composition of the team would be decided jointly by ID, the con-
sultants and IDA) would visit the delta in the latter part of the study when
the hydrologist and hydrometrist are still in the field. By reviewing avail-
able hydrological and other pertinent data and maps compiled by ID with
assistance from the two hydrologist consultants and field reconnaissance,
the team would:
a.   Help to establish priorities of islands to be safely
included in the third, fourth and fifth projects of about
the same size as this project. These five projects would
cover a total gross area of about one million ac, including
roughly 300,000 to 350,000 ac of abandoned land, or about
one-third of the potential area to be developed.
b.   Recommend further investigation required for planning
further development beyond the fifth project, which will
require increasingly sophisticated judgement in all
respects. Their recommendations would pinpoint technical
problems which will have to be resolved, an estimate of
the time and costs required to carry out the necessary
surveys and type of equipment needed.
8.        The team will spend about six weeks in the field and about three
months in report writing. Based on the team's recommendations, GOB could
then decide whether it would want to tackle the task of overall delta develo-
pment beyond the series of five projects. If it wishes to do so, the further
investigations required could be attached to the third or fourth project of
this series.
111



ANNEX 7
Page 4
9.        Cost Estimate  --  It is estimated that a total of about 60 man-
months of consultant service would be required for conducting this first
stage study, including the hydrologist, the hydrometrist, the reconnaissance
team, and short-term supporting experts of other fields. Equipment for
establishing the hydrological network, the chemical laboratory, surveying,
data processing, vehicles and boats and overseas training of local engineers
and technicians would cost about US$600,000. Detailed consultant man-months
and equipment lists would be prepared by an IDA consultant who has had wide
experience in delta hydrology as well as knowledge of the Irrawaddy Delta.
II. Paddy Storage and Handling Feasibility Study
Background
10.       Lower Burma produced about 8.5 M tons of paddy in 1975, from which
the Government bought 2.8 M tons to supply deficit areas in the country and
to use for export (Annex 13, Table 3). The remainder, or about 6 M tons,
remained in the delta, mostly in farmers' home storages and used by farmers
for family subsistence, and for selling milled rice to small urban consumers.
11.       The GOB paddy procurement program, handled by the Trade Corporation
No. One (TC-1), is discussed in Annex 13. In the delta, TC-1 owns paddy buy-
ing depots in township headquarters and larger towns along the rivers. It may
also set up temporary paddy buying stations inside the rice producing islands.
The permanent depots have weighing platforms and godowns built mostly of
plastered bamboo walls holding about 1,000 tons each, but some smaller ones
have corrugated metal sheeting walls and asbestos roofings.
12.       At the buying depot, except for the weighing scale and a moisture
meter, all other work is done manually. a maximum moisture content of 14%
is allowed, but the depots do accept paddy with moisture up to 16% by dis-
counting prices and sun drying the paddy on cement drying ground adjacent to
the depot. Transportation has been a constraint; when the depots run out of
godown space, paddy is seen piled in open air waiting for shipping.
13.       The paddy retained by farmers for home consumption is stored in
their houses, in containers made of large bamboo baskets plastered with a
mixture of clay and cow dung. For larger farmers, paddy is stored in a
partitioned corner of the house built in the same manner. Fortunately, the
main rice crop is harvested in late November and December when the dry
season has begun. So far the delta farmers have had no paddy drying problems,
therefore, they have generally possessed no drying facilities. The stored
paddy, however, is subject to rodents and insects, and the top layer is sub-
ject to hot and humid air from June through October. With the extension of
the dry season HYV (7,000 ac in Shwelaung), which will be harvested and
processed in May, farmers will begin to have problems in drying and storing
112



ANNEX 7
Page 5
paddy when storage would begin in the months with highest humidity. Any
insufficiency in drying may cause greater loss in storage which the delta
farmers have not experienced so far.
14.       The proposed study would aim at:
a.   improving paddy handling:  on-farm, from farms to TC-1
paddy buying depots, at depots, and from depots to mills
in Rangoon or other large consumer centers;
b.   improving paddy drying and storage;  on the farms and at
the TC-1 depots; and
c.   reducing quantitative and qualitative losses of paddy both
on farms and in Government godowns.
15.       The study would lead to the formulation of a first phase project.
In order that the project could be replicated elsewhere in the country,
it is essential that the proposed working facilities and the structure of
storage are commensurate with Burma's economical and financial resources.
The essence is not necessarily to build all mechanized modern paddy/rice
processing/storage complexes in Burma, but rather to introduce sound paddy/
rice handling and storage principles and practices into the traditional
systems. In principle, locally available material should be used for con-
struction, so that the models successfully demonstrated in the first project
could be replicated, with a modest foreign exchange component reserved for
equipment and apparatus which must be imported. Proposed practices and
facilities for improving paddy handling and storage by farmers would be such
that they can be promoted through the extension service and covered by rural
credit.
Outline Plan of Study
16.       A team of consultants or selected individual specialists would
be engaged to assist TC-1 and AC in conducting the study. The team would
consist of a team leader (a paddy industry management specialist), and
team members who have practical experience and knowledge in:
a.   paddy drying equipment and storage structure;
b.   paddy quality and rice milling;
c.   traditional post-harvest paddy handling and storage
problems in monsoon Asian countries;
d.   economic and financial analyses.
17.       The team leader would make a reconnaissance visit to Burma first
to understand the problems, discuss with TC-1 and AC, formulate a detailed work
plan and select team members.  The team would spend four months (December  113



ANNEX 7
Page 6
through March) in Burma and two months at their headquarters for report
preparation. They would concentrate their field study in the delta area,
particularly the five townships of this project. For improving on-farm paddy
handling and storage, the team would include in its recommendations a detailed
step-by-step direction for conducting field tests on the recommended practices
and facilities for improving on farm paddy handling and storage, so that it
can be tested by local experimental stations or seed farms before introduction
to farmers. Some 35 man months of consultant service are estimated to be
required.
Cost Estimate
18.       The cost of hiring 35 man months of consultants is estimated to
be US$280,000. An additional US$20,000 would be provided for purchase of
necessary instruments and carrying out local tests and trials as may be
necessary for conducting the study.

BURMA
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Water Supply, Quality and Demand
Drainage and Flood Protection
1.        The high river levels, which occur between May and October during
the southwest monsoon rainy season, impede drainage from the island interiors
causing considerable accumulation of rainfall runoff and overbank flood spills
until the river levels recede near the end of the monsoon season. Rapid and,
on occasion, unexpectedly high river rises washing away or submerging rice seed-
lings is the main cause of crop failure in the middle delta. In the lower
delta, daily tidal inundation by sea water causes recurring low yields.
Although monsoon rains flush away salts in the topsoil, saline water accumu-
lates in the interior-depressed areas, restricting paddy cultivation to
the high ground, limiting fresh water storage, and promoting gradual encroach-
ment of salt-tolerant mangroves and grasses.  Provision of embankments and
drains under the project would protect existing crop land and enable the
reclamation of the island interiors.
2.        In the middle delta, usually during August and September, river
levels around Shwelaung Island are so high as to block drainage channels
entirely. By mid-October, the polder could then again be drained to field
levels. Based on river hydrographs, topographic surveys, and rainfall and
evaporation data, the estimated land areas under various maximum flood depths
after construction of the Shwelaung polder are given in Annex 2, paragraph 21.
About 18,000 ac of the lowest land in Shwelaung will remain undeveloped
because of water depth during August -and September. In the lower delta,
river flood levels are lower and tidal variations are large enough to permit
drainage throughout the monsoon season. Available data indicates that after
project construction is completed, the accumulation of rainfall runoff in any
of these polders would not be so great as to prevent rice cultivation anywhere
or the adoption of HYV on higher land in the monsoon season, and about 30% of
the area could be sown to pulses.
Water Supply and Quality
3.        Rainfall and water lifted from rivers and streams are the main
sources of crop water supply for the middle and lower delta islands. Mean
annual rainfall is about 96 inches, of which 80% occurs during the south-
west monsoon period form mid-May to mid-October, which overlaps the time
of annual flood levels in the Irrawaddy Delta.                              115



ANNEX 8
Page 2
4.        The dry season flow in the Irrawaddy (at Prome) is about 62,000
cusecs. Water elevations around project islands are governed by tidal
levels and in the dry season some interior drainage channels receive river
water during high tides. 1/ These channels and depressed areas provide
potential storage where fresh water is available for dry season lift irriga-
tion. Channel improvements and provision of sluices under the project would
enhance the useful storage capacity. Around Shwelaung Island where the
surrounding river water is fresh throughout the dry season, carefully
scheduled operation of sluice gates would permit daily replenishment of
depleted storage at high tides. The future cropping pattern of this is-
land, is therefore planned on the basis of a continuous supply of fresh
water being available for dry season irrigation of the projected jute and
rice areas.
5.        In the lower delta, saline sea water generally is found in the
tidal channels in concentrations which gradually decrease with distance away
from the coast. The limit of river water unsuited for irrigation moves
further inland during the dry season as river levels recede. The interior
drainage allows monsoon rains to flush out salts brought by tidal innundation.
During the dry season, however, all river channels are at times saline and
farmers must block outlets temporarily to prevent saline water entering the
interior channels. The use of pump irrigation in the lower delta is negligible
at present, and available data is not sufficient to estimate the extent of
reliable supplies for pumping. Dry season lift irrigation is therefore not
planned for the ten lower delta islands. Provision of sluices under the
project would improve channel regulation to prevent saline intrusion and to
facilitate interior storage of late monsoon rain and flood water. Year-round
studies of water quality in the lower delta would be continued and significant-
ly strengthened by the proposed delta-wide hydrological investigation to be
conducted under the project to determine the possible extent of limited dry
season lift irrigation in the lower delta islands in the future projects.
Water Demand
6.        Present irrigation is mainly along the banks of fresh water
rivers and along the larger interior channels in the middle delta islands.
This project would expand pump irrigation in Shwelaung Island to about
22,000 ac having a projected cropping pattern as follows:
HYV                           7,000 ac
Jute followed by Hnanga    15,000 ac
1/ Tidal action affects river levels as far inland as 80 mi.
116



ANNEX 8
Page 3
7.        Crop water requirements based on this pattern have been determined
using the Blaney Criddle formula (Table 1). Project requirements, including
appropriate field preparation water requirements are estimated using an
overall irrigation efficiency of 75%. Overall losses would be small due
to the small pump service areas, conveyance over short distances mostly by
pipe, and the fact that a large part of field losses would pass to other
fields or return to the system. Maximum water demand, for the 22,000 ac,
would be an estimated 17,900 ac-ft in April. Based on peak pump operation
for ten hours per day, 250 hours per month, a total of 1,300 pump units of
0.7 cusecs each would supply the requisite 870 cusec total capacity. This
would include about 550 units for the 7,000 ac of HYV and 750 units for the
15,000 ac of Jute-Hnanga. The 870 cusec maximum project demand would be
insignificant compared to the total 62,000 cusec dry season flow in the
Irrawaddy River.
8.        About 1,000 units including about 200 spares would be supplied
under the project. At present, farmers operate 270 pumps in the Shwelaung
area, irrigating about 6,000 ac of jute, of which about 2,500 ac are followed
by Hnanga paddy. 1/ About 300 additional pumps will be sold in the area
under Credit 483-BA. Assuming 15% replacement, about 500 units would be
operating prior to project implementation and about 800 additional units
would become operative under the project.
May 1976
1/   An estimated three-quarters of the present total jute acreage is
irrigated. The present average pump command area is relatively high
because irrigation is used mainly for initial land preparation and
less than adequate supplies are provided later in the growing period.

BURMA
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rural Credit
General
1.        This Annex discusses the present situation of Agricultural Credit
in the project area, and presents a set of specific recommendations on rural
credit arrangements made by an FAO/IBRD/CP Mission. These recommendations as
detailed in paras 8 through 25 are being considered by the Government.
Present Situation
2.        The Union of Burma Bank (UBB) and the village banks were financing
farmers, until about 1972/73, in the five townships (Pyapon, Laputta, Nyapudow,
Bogale and Wakema) in which the project area is situated. No financing was
done by UBB and the village banks after the 1972 monsoon season in Pyapon,
Laputta, Ngapudow and Bogale townships, and after the 1973 monsoon season in
Wakema township. The reasons for this withdrawal from the financing activity
was the entry of cooperatives initially, and the Trade Corporation No. 1
(TC-1) from 1974/75, in the financing of paddy farmers under the "advance
purchase system" (APS) introduced by the Government in 1973/1974. The TC-1
is now making cash advances at the rate o K 35 per ac at sowing and K 15 per
ac at harvest to paddy farmers.
3.        Jute farmers in the area were being financed by the Agricultural
Corporation (AC) which provided inputs (seed, fertilizers and pesticides)
on credit. From 1974/75, AC was limiting its credit activity to advances
under APS (K 75 at harvest time) and jute farmers have now to buy inputs by
paying cash.
4.        The cooperatives are now advancing, under APS, to farmers
growing a series of crops other than paddy and jute, 70% of the estimated
value of production, 55% after the crops have been sown and 15% at harvest.
However, the total area under these crops in the project area is small.
5.        The record of UBB and the village banks in financing farmers in
the five townships has been poor. As on 31.3.75, UBB and the village banks
had a total amount of K 15.8 million outstanding and overdue from the farmers
in the five townships, as shown below; the corresponding amount overdue
from farmers in the project area was reported to be K 3.1 million.

wal of UBB and village banks from the field of financing. The amounts advanced
and received in the five townships during the period 1970/1971 to 1973/1974
and the amounts outstanding and overdue at the end of each year are as follows:

Setting Up of a New Agricultural Bank
7.        Under the Banking Law of the Socialist Republic of Burma, 1975
which was passed on 12 November 1975, a new bank called the Myanma (Burma)
Agricultural Bank (BAB) was to be set up to take over the functions at pre-
sent carried out by the Agricultural Finance Division of UBB. The new
bank was scheduled to begin in the spring of 1976. The bank's equity capital
was to be of the order of K 40 million and it was to have reserves amounting
to K 20 million. It was also to hold deposits of village banks amounting
to K 104 million, formerly held in UBB. Whether the new bank will also
take over all the outstanding loans of the Agricultural Finance Division is
not yet clear. If it does, it will, in its balance sheet, show a borrowing
of K 287.5 M from UBB and a loan outstanding (including interest) of K 344.6 M.
As a good part of these loans may prove to be unrealizable, the resulting
loss will wipe out the bank's equity capital and reserves. The Vice-Chairman
of the UBB has stated that the amount due to UBB will be treated as an interest-
free working capital contribution against which future losses on lendings
prior to formation of the BAB could be set off.
8.        The Board of UBB has already recommended that the Government should
permit BAB to charge village banks 6% interest on short-term loans, as against
the 3% interest which UBB was charging. This would mean that the rate of
140



ANNEX 10
Page 3
interest payable by the farmer would be 12%, the village banks' margin being
retained at 6%. The interest margin of the BAB would be 6% less the rate
payable on future borrowings from UBB, which is yet to be determined.
Credit Arrangements Under the Project
9.        It is the Government's intention that BAB and the village banks
function as the sole agency to provide credit to farmers in Burma. In the
project area this becomes all the more necessary as, in addition to short-term
production credit, the farmers have to be advanced medium-and long-term 1/
credit for purchase of draft animals, tractors, or power tillers, and farmer
who are to reclaim abandoned wasteland may require such credit for hiring
tractor service, renting chain saws or buying hand tools. In order to enable
BAB and village banks to carry out this function, IDA has suggested to GOB
that the the following steps to reorganize the activities of the various
agencies providing agricultural services would appear advisable:
(1) TC-1, AC and the Cooperatives are making advances
to farmers under APS. Such advances should be made
only at pre-harvest time and should be limited to cover
the expenses the farmer has to incur for harvesting,
storage and transport to the buying centers of these
marketing agencies.
(2) BAB and village banks would provide short-term credit
to the farmers to meet all cultivation costs up to harvest-
ing stage. Such credit would be made in kind for material
inputs purchasable by the farmer from the Agricultural
Corporation (AC). The BAB and the village banks would also
provide the medium-long-term credit required by the farmer,
the necessary farm equipment (draft cattle, tractors/power
tiller and pump where required) being supplied by the AC.
(3)  The marketing agencies (TC-1 for paddy, AC for jute
and the Cooperatives for other crops) would agree to deduct
from the sale proceeds of the farmer the amounts due to be
paid to the credit agency (both on the short-term loan account
and the annual installments of medium-long-term loans) in
addition to the pre-harvest advances made by them, and pay
the credit agency the amount due to it.
1/   A medium-term loan in Burma is a loan with period of maturity ranging
from one to four years; long-term loan stands for loans with a period
of maturity five years and above.
141



ANNEX 10
Page 4
(4) Several of the 12,800 farmers in the project area are already
indebted to the village banks on account of loans availed
of in earlier years and which have now become overdue. The
amount under default is reported to be about K 3.1 M. The
BAB and village banks should be permitted to reschedule such
outstanding amounts.
(5) UBB and the village banks are unable to proceed against
defaulting members of village banks, for recovery of loans
overdue, under the Lower Burma Land Revenue if the Town-
ship People's Council objects to such action. In future
financing, except where such defaults occur due to drought,
floods or other natural calamities and where the Township
People's Council object to action under the Lower Burma
Land Revenue Act, the Council should agree to guarantee
,their assistance in recovering the amount within six months.
10. In regard to (1) and (3) above, discussions with TC-1 showed that it was
agreeable to the change of procedure suggested above. This would involve a
modification of the contract now entered into by TC-1 with the farmer. As
regards AC, BAB and the village banks were agreeable to taking over the entire
financing of jute farmers as it provides the only marketing outlet for raw
jute. The need for production credit for other minor crops may not arise as
the main income of the farmer would be from paddy and jute. The operations of
the Cooperatives may not thus affect those of the credit agencies but if
similar coordination could be effected in this case also, it would be bene-
ficial.
11.       As regards (2), the procedure to be followed would be for the
Village Tract and Village Managers (procurement) of AC to prepare a farm
plan for each farmer with the assistance of the Field Supervisors of BAB.
The latter would then assist the farmer in preparing his loan applications
for the short-term loan for each season and a loan application for the medium-
term loan. The proforma for the farm plan would be devised by the Project
Unit in consultation with AC; the proforma for the loan applications would be
drawn up by BAB.
12.       The UBB's Agricultural Finance Division is prepared to adopt the
procedure suggested in (4) above in regard to old loans.
13.       In regard to (1), (3) and (5), as action involves more than one
Ministry, Cabinet approval for the procedure recommended would be necessary.
Lending Procedure
14.       The UBB is agreeable to the following loan procedure being followed
in the project area. Once a loan application is prepared, it would be sent to
the village bank which would forward it to the Village Land Committee for
certification of the area under cultivation by each farmer. Thereafter the
Village Bank Committee would recommend   the loan and forward the loan applica-
tions to the Township Branch Office of BAB for sanction.  After sanction,  142



ANNEX 10
Page 5
loan accounts for each farmer would be opened in the books of the village
banks. The farmer would obtain his supply of inputs from AC and on pre-
sentation of receipts by the farmer, AC would be paid directly by the financing
bank and the farmer's loan account debited. Cash loans for payment of wages
to hired labor would be disbursed by the village bank directly to the farmer.
After harvest,the field staff of the financing bank and/or the paid Secretary
of the village bank would assist the farmer in transporting his produce to
the buying depot of the marketing agency and would be present at the time
of sale. The marketing agency concerned (TC-1 and AC) would make a payment of
the amount due to the village bank, by check drawn on the financing bank.
15.       The UBB has laid down the conditions relating to security against
which loans would be advanced to farmers by village banks. The security
for short-term loans would be personal guarantees by two other cultivators;
for medium-and long-term loans additional security in the form of hypotheca-
tion of asset purchased would be taken. Loans by BAB to village banks would
be guaranteed by the Village Bank Committee.
16.       The loans advanced to a farmer would be such that his annual re-
payment due on all loans would not exceed 60% of the value of his gross
produce.
17.       The rate of interest payable by the farmer on short-term loans
is presently 9% but UBB has recommended that this should be raised to 12%.
The GOB has also to decide the interest to be charged on medium-and long-term
loans.
18.       The UBB is prepared to adopt the scales of finance recommended by
the project Implementation Committee, for each crop in the project area. This
would be considerably higher than present scales of finance.
19.       As the loan procedure in the project area would be different from
what is now practiced elsewhere in the country and would involve coordination
with the input supply and marketing agencies, IDA has suggested that UBB under-
take to draft detailed loaning procedures for adoption in the project area.
Staff Requirements
20.       The Township Offices of UBB are inadequately staffed and no convey-
ance is provided to staff members to visit farmers. The IDA has suggested to
UBB that creation of a field staff unit at each Township Office would be
essential for supervision of credit operations. The village banks have at
present no staff, and village bank accounts are frequently being maintained at
the Township Offices of UBB. A paid Secretary would be appointed in each
village bank.
21.       There are 70 village bank servicing the 11 islands in the project.
At the rate of one Field Supervisor (FS) for ten village banks, a total
of seven FSs would have to be appointed, the salary and allowances payable per
FS being on the order of K 3,000 per annum. Each FS will be on field visits
for about 20 days each month and would, on completion of his field trip,
submit a report on his findings to the Manager of the Township Office of 143



ANNEX 10
Page 6
the bank. Transport in the project area is both by boat and by cycles.
A total of seven bicycles and five boats powered by outboard motors are
required. The Township Offices of BAB have at present no equipment for
maintenance of accounts. Two hand-operated calculators to each BAB Town-
ship Office would be needed to maintain accounts up-to-date.
22.       The 70 village banks would require 70 paid secretaries at a cost
of K 2,500 per annum per secretary.
23.       The cost of staff and equipment needed is as follows:
Total Cost   Foreign Exchange
(K)              (US$)
Capital Costs
7  bicycles at K 1,200 per bicycle /a            9,100           1,400
5  boats at K 11,000 per boat /b                55,000           5,000

Total                              70,125           7,324
Annual Costs
Staff Salary
7  field supervisors at K 3,000 per FS        21,000
70 village bank secretaries at
K 2,500 per secretary                   175,000

Operating Costs
Boat operating costs at K 600 per boat           3,000
208,000
24.       At the rate of K 200 per ac short-term loan, each village bank
will have a gross annual turnover of about K 0.5 M which would yield a net
income from interest margin of K 25,000 assuming that the loan is out-
standing for nine months. The secretary's cost could thus be easily met
from this income. The Township Offices will have gross annual turnover,
on the average, of about K 7 M and at interest margin of 3% will have a net
income of K 0.14 M. The additional staff proposed could thus be supported
from income earnings.
144



ANNEX 10
Page 7
25.       However, the BAB and village banks will not initially be earning
sufficient profits to pay for the staff or purchase the equipment/vehicles
needed. It is therefore necessary for the project to meet the capital
costs (vehicles and equipment) and the annual costs for a three year period.
The actual amount required to be disbursed annually will depend on the
phasing proposed and the number of polders brought under the project each
year.
26.       The amounts to be provided in the project are as follows:
Local Cost    Foreign Exchange
(K)               (US$)
Capital Costs                  22,400             7,324

LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Organization and Management
Background
1.        According to the Burmese Ccnstitution (January 1974 National
Referendum), the Pyithu Hluttaw (Pa-rl-csn-e1nt) is vested with the supreme
executive, legislative and judicial authority, and the Burmese Socialist
Program Party is the only authorized political party. Cabinet decisions
are subject to approval by the Central People's Council or even the
Party Central Executive Committee unless on matters for which the Cabinet
has been delegated power to make final decision. Members of the Central
People's Council are elected by Parliament from among candidates nominated
by the Party.
2.        There is a People's Council at each Division/State (14), Township
(314), Village Tract and Village/Ward. At each level, the Party has three
committees: the Peasant Council, the Workers Council and the Youth
Organization.
3.        The Township People's Council is the key of local administration.
It has under it three committee: Executive, Judicial and Inspectors. The
Executive Committee has an Economic Affairs Sub-Committee, the current major
function of which is to implement the Four Year Plan. The Council and its
committees have their respective secretariats headed by Ministry officers.
The Department, and Corporation officers who would participate in imple-
menting the Lower Burma Paddyland Development Project are members of sub-
committees or sub-sub-committees of the Executive Committee of the Township
People's Council, and work within the framework of the Council and Committees.
4.        Below the Township level, officers of some Departments are still
present, such as the AC village trac-s  ---llage managers, the SLRD village
revenue officers, the Village Tract Cooperative Store manager, etc., but other
Departments may or may not have any officer at these levels. Likewise, the
Village Tract and Village People's Councils, their committees, and the Party
committees at these levels have much fewer occasions to make decisions. They
generally carry out instructions received from the Township Councils.
5.        The Land Committee is unique In that the Central Land Committee
resides within the MAF and is chaired by its Deputy Minister. The other
members include representatives from the Central Peasant's Council, Central
Labor Council, Cooperative Department, Central Law Office, etc. There are
Land Committees in each Division, Township. Village Tract and Village.
These committees settle disputes relating to land rights.
'4~6



ANNEX 11
Page 2
6.        The Party committees at all levels are advisory to the People's
Councils and provide a forum for peasants, workers and youth. The Depart-
ment and Corporation officers also attend meetings when required.
Agency Responsibilities
7.        The National People's Council has authorized the Cabinet to pre-
pare and proceed with Bank financed projects. The overall implementation
responsibility for this project would rest with the MAF (MAF Organization
Chart, Figure 1).
8.        A total of 11 agencies, seven under MAF and four under other
ministries, would be involved in project implementation. The seven agencies
under the MAF and their responsibilities would be as follows:
a.   Irrigation Department (ID) would be responsible for the
planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance
(O&M) of all flood control and drainage facilities, and
the procurement of construction and 0 & M equipment. It
would also be responsible for conducting the delta-wide
hydrological study for planning future projects with
assistance from consultants (Annex 3).
b.   Settlement and Land Records Department (SLRD) and Survey
Department (SD) would survey farms to be displaced by
embankment and drains, survey and demarcate land to be
reclaimed, and prepare related cadastral records and
maps (Annex 4).
Central Land Committee (CLC), through Village Land
Committees would allot land to displaced farmers and
landless farmers in the Townships (Annex 4). Working
People's Settlement Department (WPSD) would organize
force account land clearing to supplement family labor
of land allottees, and settle some retired servicemens'
families in Dauntgyi polder, where the population is
sparce (Annex 4).
c.   Agricultural Corporation (AC) would provide research
support, implement the intensified extension program,
supply seeds, fertilizers and other inputs to project
farmers, and construct four additional fertilizer
godowns in the project area (Annexes 5 and 6).
Agricultural Mechanization Department (AMD) would
procure and sell to farmer groups or cooperatives
the pumps, power tillers and tractors to be provided
by the project, provide tractor service to farmers,
rent power chain saws to land allottees for mangrove
clearing, provide maintenance service for farm
machine and pumps and construct, equip and staff seven
field workshops in the project area (Annex 6).                        147

d.   Four agencies not belonging to MAF would also be
involved: the new Burma Agricultural Bank (BAB),
under the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF),
would provide long- medium-and short-term credit to
existing farmers and new land allottees through the village
banks (Annex 10). The Cooperative Department (CD) under
the Ministry of Cooperatives would stock and sell land
reclamation and/or animal drawn tools to land allottees
(Annex 10). The MPF would make annual budgetary appro-
priation to ID for 0 & M of the project flood control
and drainage facilities, and determine the recovery
of project capital cost.
Trade Corporation Number One (TC-1) which handles paddy
procurement and domestic supply under the Ministry of
Trade, would conduct in coordination with AC the feasi-
bility study for the paddy storage and handling project
with assistance from consultants (Annex 11).
9.        Project implementation would involve:
(a) construction of flood control structures and establish-
ment of an effective 0 & M system for such structures;
(b) reclamation of abandoned/wasteland and allotting
to qualified families;
(c) strengthening various agricultural supporting
services for realizing the projected changes in
cropping pattern and yield increases; and
(d) deciding and implementing a system for assessing
and appropriating 0 & M costs and recovery of
capital cost of the project.
10.       Of the above tasks, (a) can be decided and implemented by ID alone,
(b) and (c) would involve a number of agencies and the phasing of each agency's
work would be conditioned by the project construction schedule. A great deal
of frequent interagency coordination will be needed. Item (d) would require
agreement and close coordination between MAF and MPF. From time to time, the
Project Implementation Committee (PIC) would need to seek endorsements from
the Minister, the Cabinet or even the National People's Council. A longer
lead time would be allowed for planning all steps to be taken. Oince the
project and the various measures for implementation ara endorsed by the
National People's Council, the Division, the Township, Village Tract and
Village People's Councils would follow the decisions made.
Project Management
11.       To coordinate the work of the 11 agencies, a Project Implementa-
tion Committee (PIC) would be formed in MAF.  This committee would be               148



ANNEX 11
Page 4
chaired by the Deputy Minister of MAF and would comprise the road or senior
representatives of all 11 participating agencies and the Director General of
the Planning and Statistics Department of MAF as members (Fig. 2). The
committee would be responsible for inter-ministerial and inter-agency coor-
dination and for securing necessary endorsement of project matters by the
Minister, the Cabinet, the Central People's Council and other Authorities.
Under the Committee, a Project Unit (PU) would be established, and comprised
of senior technical officers of the seven MAF participating agencies as
members. A senior ID officer would be appointed the Project Director of
PU, who would serve concurrently as the member secretary of PIC. With adequate
supporting staff, he would be responsible for coordinating technical plan-
ning and field operation of the various agencies components. Each PU member
would be responsible for implementing the project work related to his agency.
12.       In each of the five project townships, a Township Project
Committee (TPC) would be formed to coordinate the project works. The Com-
mittee would comprise township level officers of the participating agencies as
members. The ID engineer would serve as the chairman and the AC Township
Manager as member secretary during the construction period. After the completion
of construction, the AC Township Manager would be the chairman, and another
member officer will serve as the secretary.
Civil Works Construction Organization
13.       The flood control works construction organization of the
Irrigation Department is shown in Figure 3.
14.       The construction of fertilizer godowns would be handled by the
AC under the supervision of its General Manager for Administration. The
construction of field workshops and tractor stations would be handled by
the Agricultural Mechanization Department under the supervision of its
Director for Equipment Utilization.
15.       Actual maintenance work to be done has been discussed in
Annex 12. Based on that, the project would have one maintenance laborer
per mile of embankment in the dry season and two laborers per mile during
the monsoon months. The work crew would be organized in groups of five
men, responsible for 5 mi of embankment during the dry season. In the wet
season, when daily work is to be done, nine men would work as a team. Under
an Executive Engineer, six maintenance units would organized, one for Shwelaung
and five for the ten coastal polders. Tentatively, the staff of the six units
would be grouped as follows:
Unit No.                  Polder
1                Shwelaung
2                 Zinbaung, Letpanbin, Kyet-Pha-Hmwe-Zaung
3                Myogon, Daw Nyein, Dedalu
4                 Bantbwezu
5                 Betut, Algyun
6                 Dauntgyi                               149



ANNEX 11
Page 5
Unit No. 4 would be the existing O&M headquarters at Pyapon; the other five
would be established as soon as the construction of polders was completed.
The laborers and sluice operators would be stationed in the polders.
16.       The staffing pattern of the maintenance units for Shwelaung,
Zinbaung and Letpanbin polders for which the project designs are completed
are given in Figure 4 as examples.
17.       Owners or users of the pumps, power tillers, farm tractors etc.
would meet their own O&M costs. With the seven new field workshops and
workshop equipment and tools provided by the project, AMD engineers and
techncians would be well equipped to service the equipment at reasonable
costs to the owners.
18.       The quarters and workshop buildings for ID construction and
maintenance units would be maintained by ID, the fertilizer godowns by AC,
and the farm equipment workshops by AMD. Operation and maintenance costs
have been provided for the six year project implementation period.
Extension Service Organization
19.       The extension service organization is discussed in Annex 5.
The organization chart of the proposed system is shown in Figure 5 of
this Annex.

LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Operation and Maintenance
Existing Works
1.        Embankments.  Prior to World War II, the large land owners built
and maintained the minor embankments. After the war and the nationalization
of land, the many small farmers had neither the skill, resources nor the
cohesion without strong local leadership to maintain these works communally,
apart from simple flood defenses bordering individual fields. Consequently,
embankment deterioration resulted in large scale paddyland abandonment.
2.        In 1957, GOB commenced construction of minor river and tidal flood
protection embankments and since 1970 vested the maintenance responsibility
in the Irrigation Department (ID) whose annual O&M budget allocation (K 5
per ac of land protected) is, however, inadequate to fully maintain these
works, which are also deteriorating.
3.        Drainage Channels.  The pre-war land owners built and maintained
simple drainage networks and sluice gates, which deteriorated in the post-
war period. At present, there are few formal drainage schemes and mainte-
nance in the project area is largely restricted to the GOB-built projects
at Laputta and Zinbaung. No separate budgetary allocation is made for
drainage, the costs of which are met from within the K 5/ac allocation for

4.        Small irrigation pump O&M is with the farmer owners.  Under
Credit 483-BA, a small repair center is to be set up at Wakema which will
service pumps in the Schwelaung polder. The O&M costs based on current
AMD information are set out in Table 1.

5.        Recurrent Costs.  Adequate maintenance would require that,
during each dry season, work crews make routine inspections and repairs
to restore the embankment side slopes and crest elevations 1/ after
periodic settling and damage from cattle, rain w^sh, and rodent and pest
1/   Crest settlement and erosion amounts to about three inches per year.

burrows; and that they free channels of weeds and siltation and repair
sluice gates and structures. They also would complete major repairs
occassioned by flood damage. During the monsoon season, they would make
frequent embankment inspections and carry out emergency earthwork repairs
to provide continuous protection for monsoon season crops. Work crews,
which would carry out a large part of the work by manual labor, would comprise
a team of five men during the dry season and nine men during the flood season.
Such a crew would be responsible for about 5 mi of embankment.
6.        Key large sluices would require operators in residence.  At
Shwelaung where the normal drain flow would reverse at times to provide
river water for irrigation, special operating instructions would be worked
out for each sluice and set out in an operators' manual.
7.        Six O&M units comprising housing and office buildings for the
engineer, crews and operators serving the project area would be located
as follows:

8.        The O&M cost estimates for the project embankments, drainage
channels, and control structures for the middle and lower delta polders
are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The ID plans to refine the
estimates after the construction is complete and periodically thereafter
as a basis for the requisite budget allocations which GOB has agreed to
make.
9.        Maintenance activity would begin the first season after con-
struction of each polder section is completed. In addition to providing
requisite repairs and protection, the initial maintenance periods would
provide training for personnel. The project capital costs include the
cost of O&M during the project implementation.

which the project would provide, is shown in Table 4. Equipment require-
ments are given in Annex 9.

BURMA
LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Market Prospects, Prices, Processing, and Storage
General
1.        Rice and jute, the major crops in the Irrawaddy Delta, are inter-
nationally traded. Burmese rice has long established markets, particularly
in Asia and the quality of Burmese jute production ranks relatively high.
Export prospects for additional rice and jute production, therefore, is good
even as world market prices have declined from their present shortage-
related highs. Production increases for the other crops would be small
relative to present volumes and would have a ready domestic market.
2.        Future price estimates for rice, jute, and other internationally
traded commodities and fertilizers are based on Bank projections (dated
March 1976) of world market price trends through 1985 (Table 1), and for
other crops and input commodities are based on present levels and historic
trends of local prices. All are expressed in terms of constant currency,
using July 1976 prices as the base. The economic and financial analyses
use both present and future prices to reflect anticipated changes in long
term supply and demand relationships for each commodity. Farm gate price
estimates for the financial farm budget analyses take into account prevail-
ing taxes, subsidies, and other Government controls. The estimates for
the economic analysis, to reflect the opportunity values of potential ex-
ports or import savings, are derived from world market prices using an
exchange rate of US$1 = K 13.0 which reflects the opportunity value of
foreign exchange in the economy. The estimates for each commodity (Table 2)
are discussed below.
3.        The official foreign exchange price US$1 = K 6.5  does not re-
flect the prevailing supply of and demand for foreign exchange in Burma since
it is maintained by very stringent exchange and trade restrictions. On the
black market, foreign currency is traded at rates between 18 to 20 Kyats per
US Dollar, partly reflecting the risk premium associated with such illegal
transactions. Because of the non-availability of disaggregated data and the
poor quality of the available aggregative data, the World Bank procedures for
calculating the shadow prices of foreign exchange could not be followed. More
particularly, the non-availability of such data as input coefficients and dis-
aggregated data on traded and non-traded inputs, precluded the estimation
of usual conversion factors. Instead, an alternative procedure was used.
This procedure involved the estimation of exports and imports that were
likely to prevail if trade restrictions were removed. Exports and imports
were disaggregated by commodity and free trade flows estimated by using
163



ANNEX 13
Page 2
relevant price elasticities and the tariff equivalent of trade restrictions.
Assuming that Burma has no monopoly power in foreign trade and that the
exchange rate that prevails in free trade would reflect the opportunity
cost of a marginal unit of foreign exchange, a shadow price of foreign
exchange was calculated. The rate of K 13.00 = US$1.00 thus calculated is
used to convert world prices into prices for economic analyses of the
project.
Rice
4.        Market Prospects.  Prior to World War II, Burma was the world's
leading rice exporter, producing around five million tons of rice annually
and exporting 3 to 3.5 million tons of rice and rice products including rice
brokens and rice bran. Production did not regain pre-war levels until
1964 when 4.8 million tons were produced from 12.6 M. Over the last decade,
production and sown area remained static, except in 1966 and 1972 when poor
monsoons were experienced. Meanwhile, domestic consumption rose steadily
at about 3.1% per annum, faster than the population increase, with the
result that exportable surpluses have been sharply reduced to only less than
half a million tons, a margin vulnerable to climatic adversities. Without
significant gains in yields or cropped areas, Burma would cease to have a
rice surplus by 1980.
5.        Future implementation of a vigorous agricultural development pro-
gram (involving mainly expansion of the irrigated area and increased use
of high yielding varieties and fertilizers) could increase production some-
what faster than population about at a rate likely to be below 3% per
annum. With future reduction in Government subsidies of consumer prices, per
capita rice consumption is likely to level off at the present relatively high
levels. Under this assumption, the project production increase would result
in a gain in exportable surplus. Consequently, an export situation
is used in estimating the opportunity price for the economic analysis.
6.        World production is expected to increase at about the same rate
as world demand. International trade, which represents only a small propor-
tion of the total production, is expected to decline somewhat, assuming
moderate gains towards foodgrain self-sufficiency in developing countries
and an overall decline in coarse grain imports by developed countries for
remilling.
7.        The values of Burma rice exports, which were sold mostly under
Government-to-Government contracts, until recently were well below world
market levels as shown in the following table:
164



ANNEX 13

1975 (Jan-Aug.)                    275                 277
In 1974 and 1975, the unit prices of Burma exports corresponded roughly to
the fob prices for Thai rice of 35-42% brokens quality, about 70% below the
price for Thai 5% brokens. This relationship is used in estimating export
prices for the economic analysis.
8.        Government Market Controls.  Since 1946, GOB has controlled to
varying degrees paddy prices and rice exports in official channels.  Prior
to the 1960s, however, private domestic markets were not controlled. Over
the next decade to 1973, the distribution of rice was a state monopoly.
Farmers were not allowed to trade paddy freely within their townships, but
otherwise surpluses had to be sold to the State Agricultural Marketing Board
(SAMB) and to Trade Corporation No. 1 (TC-1), its successor in 1964. The
TC-1 purchased paddy directly and through cooperatives, milled it and dis-
tributed it throughout the country and to the Myanma Export-Import Corporation
(MEIC) for export. Between 1964 and 1973, the share of total marketed paddy
bought by State agencies fell from 80% to 30%. in 1973, the cooperatives were
given sole responsibility for the domestic rice trade, except for shipments to
the rice deficit hill areas of Upper Burma and the military. Procurement
for these areas and for export remains the responsibility of TC-1.
9.        The TC-1 operates between 700 and 900 buying depots throughout the
country, including one for every 10 to 15 villages in the project areas.
Farmers now must sell to TC-1 a share of their harvest (paddy) which is based
on TC-1 and LRSD assessments of paddy acreage, land productivity, and yields.
The TC-1 owns or controls the rice mills, and GOB prohibits farmers from
selling paddy except to TC-1, at controlled prices, or within the townships of
origin.
10.       An Advance Purchase System (APS) is closely linked with the com-
pulsory paddy procurement program. If farmers lack cash for consumption
needs, for hiring labor, or for purchasing crop inputs and cannot get credit
or better terms elsewhere, they may enter into contracts with TC-1 for future
delivery of paddy. Under the APS, T Q1 currently advances K 50 per ac, of
which K 35 is advanced at time of land preparation and the balance of K 15
at harvest time. Farmers not able to fulfill such contracts, due to un-
usually poor harvest, are permitted to meet their obligations the following
year. Advances then become interest free loans. The TC-1 presently claims
about 85% recovery rate on their loans.
165



ANNEX 13

11.       Free Market.  A large rice market now exists outside of Govern-
mental restrictions. The relative levels of GOB controlled prices and free
market paddy prices have been an important factor influencing the volume of
sales under Government procurement and in the markets. As shown in Table 3,
after 1963 when the two price levels were about the same, the ratio of GOB
to free market prices declined to as low as 28% and GOB procurement also
declined from about half the paddy crop to less than 20%. Information on
the volume of trade in free market channels is not available. However,
Government supplies from procurement over this period proved less and less
sufficient to meet demand among urban and landless rural families and persons in
deficit areas. As a result, free market prices were forced up, which reduced
the effectiveness of the TC-1 procurement program and caused the volume of free
market trade to grow.
12.       Procurement and Free Market Prices.  For the 1974 crop, GOB
increased the procurement price by nearly 40% to K 293 per ton and, for the
1975 crop gain by 50% to K 438 per ton. In 1974 and 1975, TC-1 maintained
a two-tiered price system: a low price for amounts within the assessed
quota and a high price for amounts over the quota. As a result, in 1975
TC-1 achieved 90% of its procurement target, about 20% at over quota prices.
Procurement prices and free market prices between 1964 and 1975 are shown in
Table 3. At appraisal in November 1975, the free market prices had declined
to about K 660 per lg ton, about 50% above the procurement price, as the
result of falling export prices, increased domestic production, and more
effective procurement and domestic distribution by TC-1.
13.       Milling.  Rice milling is one of Burma's major industries.  There
are presently 800 mills in the country of which 12 belong to cooperatives,
35 to TC-1 and the rest to private owners, although mill operation and
charges are controlled by GOB. Total national milling capacity of some
4 to 7 million tons of rice annually, concentrated mostly in Irrawaddy and
Pegu Divisions (including Rangoon), is only about half utilized due to in-
adequate paddy deliveries. However, because of the poor physical condition
of many mills, the rated capacity may somewhat overstate actual capacity.
Only 26 mills can produce superfine quality (5% to 10% broken) rice, about
100 can produce medium quality (15% to 25% broken) rice while the remainder
can only produce low quality (35% to 42% broken) rice, with considerable
losses. Although GOB continues to build new mills, the low-controlled mill-
ing charges (K 13 per lg ton for Government-owned paddy and K 26 per lg ton
for privately owned paddy) cover only operating costs and leave nothing for
maintenance or rehabilitation. Storage facilities for about 2 M tons of
paddy annually, about 60% owned by TC-1 and 40% by the private sector, demand
are in many cases falling into disrepair. The TC would like to rehabilitate
the industry and provide modern storage, drying and milling equipment.
14.       Paddy from the project areas is milled mainly at Laputta, Pyapon
Ngaputaw and Wakema where at present there are 51 mills have a combined
rated capacity of 640 lg tons per 24 hours (20 owned by TC-1 and 31 owned
privately). Some paddy from project areas is also milled at Bagale and
Bassein. Most of these mills produce low quality and some produce medium
166

quality rice.  Milling output at these qualities inclucles 64% tu 66% rice
(whole grain and large brokens), 3% to 4% residual brokens, and 4% to 5%
bran (Table 2). A mill ratio of 0.65 has been used in estimating farm gat
prices. Some of these facilities will be renovated and new facilities -
structed in these areas with Asian Development Bank assistance, and mill1ir
and storage facilities for production increases under the project therefo:'
would be adequate.
15.       Storage.  Up to 1964, procurement and processing of paddy for
export and internal distribution were left to private enterprise. Mills
located in the rural areas were collection centers and acted as transfer
storage facilities for on-shipment of milled rice to the major exporters
in Rangoon. After 1964, private millers were no longer permitted to procure
paddy. The GOB controlled milling charges and nationalized some existing
mills and also constructed new milling facilities. As the export volume
subsequently declined, private capital formation from the export trade eva-
porated, and mill receipts under controlled charges no longer covered the
full costs of operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of facilities.
Consequently, storage and milling facilities have fallen into disrepair. At
present, within the Irrawaddy and Pegu Divisions, roughly 4,000 warehouse
units with an estimated 2 M tons of annual storage capacity exist, about
60% of which are owned by TC-1 and the remainder by the private sector.
This capacity is barely adequate for the present relatively low volumes of
trade currently handled by TC-1. Under a program to expand paddy production
throughout the delta, the suitability of present off-farm storage must be
reappraised.
16.       A sizable portion of annual production remains on the farm for
home consumption and seed. Large farmers are often able to construct Within
their homes reasonably secure bin-type structures to hold the annual stock
of paddy. Small farmers, however, retain their family supply in suboptimal
containers woven from local materials and lined with a clay-cow dung mixture.
Under traditional cultivation patters, paddy is harvested in the dry season,
mainly in November-February. However, stored quantities whether in homes
or in warehouses, are still exposed to high humidity levels for approximately
six months after the initiation of the monsoons in May-June. Losses during
this time are particularly costly for the subsistence farmer with no feasible
loss margins in his stocks.
Jute
17.       Market Prospects.  From 1962 to 1973, jute production expanded from
less than 5,000 tons to 90,000 tons. By 1973, exports had reached 50,000
tons. Production dropped to 39,000 tons in 1975 in response to insufficient
supplies of seeds due to flood damage to seed supplies in 1974, inadequate
fuel supplies because of transport problems, and preference of growing paddy
after paddy procurement prices were increased.
167



ANNEX 13
Page 6
18.       World market prospects for jute are poor.  Synthetic substitutes
have continued to take over more and more of the major end-uses of jute
in the industrialized West. Thus, the fall in demand in the developed
countries since the late 1960s is expected to continue. Demand in the
centrally-planned countries has been increasing quite rapidly but, excepting
China, this is expected to slow down with the switch to synthetics, the full
impact of which will be felt in the 1980s with the completion of large
increases in production capacity for synthetic resins in Eastern Europe and
the USSR. In the developing countries, particularly the producing countries
themselves, demand is expected to grow more rapidly to handle growing agri-
cultural output. Growth in total world demand is estimated to be positive
but small, lower than the estimated growth in production. However, although
Burma exports raw jute, it imports at least 30% of its jute bag require-
ments, the rest being domestically produced. At present, an acute shortage
of jute bags exists. With projected increase of rice export, the incre-
mental jute production from the project would have a ready market.
19.       Government Market Control.  The AC, which is in charge of jute
development, procures all jute production. It provides seeds, fertilizers
and K 100 per ac (as of 1974) in cash, interest free, and buys back raw
jute at rural collection centers. The Government has recently announced
a 50% increase in the 1976 procurement price (to K 1,500 per lg ton) to
generate increased jute production. Similarly, release of a new variety
capable of increasing yields by about 20% and maturing in 120 days instead
of 150 could make jute production more attractive. Procurement prices (1975)
varied by grade: from K 1,026 per lg ton for first quality (mostly C, D, &
E grades) to K 777 per lg ton for second quality (E2 and rejections) to K 311
per lg ton for cuttings. Although in recent years, 90% of all jute bought
from farmers has been graded first quality, it is frequently downgraded when
exported. So exported prices for the economic analysis are derived from
projected prices for D grade quality.
20.       Baling -- Burma presently has 13 baling presses in Rangoon and
other major towns throughout the production areas with total annual capacity
of 118,000 lg tons. Production in 1975 was estimated at about 100,000 tons.
With incremental production from the project areas of 5,700 lg tons and an
assumed increase of 44,000 lg tons from outside the project areas, baling
capacity would have to increase to about 150,000 lg tons by 1985. The
Irrigation I project (IDA Credit No. 394-BA) includes funds for constructing
four additional jute baling plants with an annual capacity of 7,000 tons
each at sites determined by AC, which will provide adequate capacity up
through the early 1980s.
Groundnuts
21.       Marketing  --  Burma is short of vegetable oils, and traditionally
has imported large quantities for edible purposes. Post-war imports averaged
about K 30 million annually, rose to K 163 million in 1965, and dropped
rapidly to almost zero in 1971 because of foreign exchange restrictions.
Groundnuts and sesamum are the main oilseeds produced domestically, and in
168



ANNEX 13
Page 7
terms of area sown nationally are next to paddy in importance. Until 1966,
production was stagnant, hovering around 300,000 tons of unshelled nuts and
60,000 tons of sesamum. To encourage increased production, the Government
limited imports, and favorably controlled oilseed marketing thus maintaining
relatively attractive prices. Produce prices for groundnuts as well as for
sesamum were decontrolled in 1967. As a result, output increased 50% for
groundnuts and 100% for sesamum by 1971 -- a good example of price response.
Groundnut production fell again below 400,000 tons in 1973 because of the
1972 drought, but rose to 461,000 tons during the 1975 season. Acreage
of groundnuts increased by 200,000 during 1965-1975 mainly through utilization
of the crop to follow paddy in more intensive rotational patterns. Farmers
can obtain advanced purchase system (APS) of up to 70% of the contract
value for produce marketed through cooperatives.
22.       Prices  --  Producer prices for unshelled nuts have fluctuated
between K 900 and K 1,450 per ton for the last six years and for oil, the
wholesale price has fluctuated between K 3,000 and K 6,500 per ton. For
comparison, in Thailand, producer prices have been around US$100 to US$120
per ton for unshelled nuts and US$300 to US$450 per ton for exported oil,
which are in the same range as the Burmese prices converted at the shadow
exchange rate. Farm gate prices for the financial and economic analyses are
shown in Table 2.
Pulses and Vegetables
23.       Vegetables and pulses are sold freely by farmers.  Most pulses
marketed through cooperatives are eventually exported. Producers are
eligible for APS amounting to 70% of the contract value of pulses to be
delivered to TC-1 as cooperatives. Representative producer prices over
the last few years have been K 1,820 per ton for pulses and K 2,300 per ton
for vegetables.
Fertilizers
24.       About three quarters of the fertilizer used in 1972/73, about
86,000 tons, was urea manufactured in Burma in two plants each with a capa-
city of 60,000 tons per year. Phosphate fertilizer (TSP) and other chemical
inputs (M of P and pesticides) are imported by Trade Corporation No. 22
through MEIC. Fertilizer consumption increased from about 25,000 tons
annually in the early 1960s to about 100,000 tons in 1972 and has remained
relatively stable since then. however, high prices on the black market
suggest the demand substantially exceeds supplies.

LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Farm Labor Supply and Demand
Area Occupations
1.        About 50% of project area families are farmers and nearly 30% in
addition are landless families who rely on farm wage earnings for most of
their annual incomes. About 20% of the families are primarily involved
in other occupations such as fishing, transport, and village commerce
(including, in the lower delta, some producers of salt from sea water).
2.        The employment impact of this project on landless workers and
small farmers who rely on wage earnings can be only roughly assessed. Most
project farms are within close proximity to one of the many river transport
routes cutting the area. Trade related to agriculture and fishing provide
off-farm employment for landless and small farmers during slack periods.
Employment levels and participation rates have not been surveyed, but are
assumed to be small in view of the relatively low level of such activity
and the members of families involved fully in these activities.
Agricultural Labor Supply
3.        Project Area Population.  Data presented here was obtained from
the Settlement and Land Records Department, from field interviews, and
from the Central Statistics and Economics Department. The 1975 rural
population and farm and landless labor supplies in the project area village
tracts are summarized below:

4.        The population growth rate in 1975 was an estimated 2.2% per year
based on the national average. Such a rate is expected to continue over the
next 10 to 15 years. Because of low levels of economic activity, urban areas
have not grown significantly faster than rural areas in the past decade.
Rural population and labor force growth in the delta, therefore, is projected
at 2.0% for this analysis.
5.        Labor Force.  Married and single women generally participate in
all farm field activities except very heavy work. The project area farm labor
force is estimated to be about 40,000 adults, or equivalent, and the landless
labor force about 21,000. Allowing time for fishing and cooking and home
chores for women and children, the estimated number of full farm working days
per family ranges from about 60 adult-days per month during most of the year
to about 75 adult days per month for one or two months of peak agricultural
activity.
6.        Monthly Labor Supplies.  Present and projected labor supplies,
based on the asusmptions above, are given in Table 1. During months of peak
farm activity, some local residents classified as non-farmers also work in
the fields. For the analysis, at such times farm and landless labor supplies
are supplemented by up to 50% of the availability of other labor. On this
basis, project labor supplies would be as follows:

7.        Field Requirements.  Peak field activity occurs at present in
June, July and December. This peak field activity would occur at the same
times, and also in November under the project. In all months, except June,
requirements would increase from two to ten times and over the year would more
than double (240%). Estimated average mothly requirements over the project are
given in Table 2 based on the per acre crop labor requirements given in Annex
15.
Marginal Economic Cost of Project Field Labor
8.        Most of the farm labor, particularly in the slack seasons, is
supplied without wages by family members. In most months, field requirements
are not sufficient to fully occupy the labor force. Although some farm work
other than cultivation is required in addition, the average opportunity cost
of labor is less than the prevailing wage of K 6 per man-day paid to hired
labor during times of heavy activity. On the other hand, because of the
availability of some off-farm employment, the average opportunity cost
exceeds the marginal subsistence value.
9.        The project economic cost of crop production labor is taken as the
sum of labor costs at varying wage levels between these extremes as deter-
mined month by month according to the seasonal level of demand. The scarcity
of data on alternative employment opportunities and wage levels makes the
evaluation of economic farm wage rates extremely subjective. The marginal
labor cost for this analysis is estimated on the basis of the hypothetical
labor demand curve (Figure 1). The curve is a plot of the estimated marginal
economic wage as a function of the labor demand supply ratio reflecting the
variation in wage levels discussed above:
(a) At minimum employment levels, the marginal economic wage
would be K 0.5 per man-day about 15% of the market rate,
exceeding by 50% the value of additional consumption
needed for a family member without alternative
employment to undertake field work;
(b) At a monthly employment level equivalent to the present
maximum slack season employment level (60% of the slack
175



ANNEX 14
Page 4
field labor supply), the marginal wage would be K 6 per
man-day which is the average market rate taking into consideration
available non-farm wages.
(c) At a monthly employment level corresponding to the present
peak employment level (78% of the peak field labor supply),
the marginal wage would be K 8 per man-day.
10.       Based on monthly demand estimates, marginal wage levels from
Figures 1 are shown in Table 2. The annual labor cost is the sum of monthly
labor costs at various wage levels up to the marginal wage. The incremental
labor cost due to the project, accordingly, amounts to K 33 million, which
implies an overall shadow wage rate for additional project field labor of
K 4.6 per man-day.

Net Farm Incomes
Crop Inputs Requirements
1.        Crop input levels for use in the farm budget analyses are based
on information provided by AC, members of the project preparation unit and
farmer interviews in the project areas. Per acre yields, inputs require-
ments, crop values and inputs costs are shown in Table 1. Estimated net
crop values are based on the following assumptions:
(a) Fertilizers and Pesticides. Demand for fertilizers presently
exceeds the supply (fertilizers purchased at current sub-
sidized prices are often resold at much higher prices).
With the increased support in the area under the project
extension service, fertilizer demand, and consequent crop
yields, are expected to increase further (Table 1). Use
of pesticides also would increase. Supply and distribution
in the project area is expected to improve markedly over the
development period sufficient to meet the growth in project
requirements. The costs of these requirements have been
included at subsidized prices.
(b) Seed. Average annual cultivation requirements are given in
Table 1. Farm owners generally use their harvest for seed
and purchase only when necessary. The average annual seed
cost, however, has been included as a proportion of the
annual value of crop production.
(c)  Power.  The requirements for power used in field preparati-on,
harvesting, threshing, subsequent operations and carting in
this analysis are in terms of bullock-pair days (Table 1).
Most farmers own or share ownership of a pair of bullocks.
Others hirethem at a rate of about K 6 per day. This rate
roughly covers the average cost of upkeep, feed, and depre-
ciation for one pair, assuming a purchase price of 6,000 to
7,000 Kyat per pair and a useful working life of eight years.
(Feed costs are negligible in the delta where marginal grass
land is sufficient for year round feed requirements.) Some
farmers may use farm machinery for some operations but the
cost per acre is not expected to differ by more than 15%.
181



ANNEX 15
Page 2
(d) Irrigation. Pump operating costs for dry season HYV, Jute
and Hnanga are based on the irrigation pumping requirements
computed in Annex 8, Table 1. Average operating costs,
including HSD fuel, oil, grease, maintenance and parts
are estimated at K 2.1 per ac-inch (K 1.7 per hour). Per
acre crop irrigation costs on this basis are as follows:
(K/ac)
Jute                          53
Hnanga                        43
HYV                           92
(e) Labor. Per acre cultivation labor requirements by crop
and by month are given in Table 2. These cover the require-
ments for harvesting, threshing, and subsequent operations
and include the requirements for bullock drivers.
Net Farm Incomes
2.        The GOB requires that farmers sell a portion of their paddy harvest
to TC-1 at fixed prices (para 4). Farm incomes are computed using two paddy
prices: the fixed procurement price applied to the compulsory quota (computed
using Table 3) and a free market price applied to the remaining production.
Other crops are valued at controlled prices where applicable (Annex 13).
3.        Net farm incomes for typical farms (Table 4) are estimated using
the net crop values given in Table 1 and the assumptions discussed below:
(a) Models. The average farm size in the project area is 10 ac:
in the ten lower delta islands 12 ac, and in the middle delta
island 6 ac (Annex 1). The model farms at different land
elevations in the lower and middle deltas reflect the varia-
tion in cropping patterns dictated by annual flood levels.
The current official basis for land allotments is one tatontum
per family, a unit of land workable by one pair of bullocks,
of about 10 ac. This size is used in the models.
(b) Farm Working Population. The average size family in the
middle and lower delta is about five persons (Annex 1).
(c) Family Labor Supply. Allowing time for cooking and home
chores for women and children and fishing, the average number
of family workers is equivalent to about three persons. This
includes persons between ages 10 and 60, with persons under
age 15 counted only as two-thirds. The estimated number of
equivalent full farm working days per family on this basis
would range from about 60 days per month during most of the
year and 75 days per month for one or two months of peak
agricultural activity.                                           182



Pajg 3
(d) Hired Labor Requirements. Labor is hired at times of peak
activity to supplement family labor for land preparation,
transplanting, harvesting, jute retting and post-harvest
handling. Due to variations in planting time occasioned by
different land elevations relative to flood depths, farmers
generally are able to fill part of their outside requirements
on an exchange basis. The per acre requirements shown in
Table 2 take this into account. Hired labor requirements are
estimated month by month in relation to total monthly require-
ments and family labor availability. The net cost is estimated
using the market wage of K 6 per man-day.
(e) Irrigation Capital Costs. The capital cost of the 0.7 cusec
pumps amortized at 10% over a six year service life is
estimated at Kyat 200 per year. Assuming average pump
command areas of about 13 ac for HYV and 20 ac for jute/Hnanga
(Annex 8), average capital recovery costs would amount to
between K 10 and 15 per ac per year.
(f) Land Clearing. Initial costs of clearing new farms is treated
separately as part of the project investment costs.
(g) Taxes. The Consolidated Land Revenue Tax is K 2 per ac.
Compulsory Procurement
4.        Paddy.  Since November 1973, GOB has enforced a paddy procurement
program throughout the country. By law, farmers are compelled to sell at
TC-1 buying depots a minimum part of their harvest (a quota) at relatively
low prices (Annex 13). The compulsory quotas are scaled in each case to the
farmers sown paddy acreage and assessed yield. A committee of local offi-
cials from SLRD, AC, etc., around planting time, visit villages and fields and
review with village leaders each farmer's cultivation plans and yield prospects.
On their first visit, they agree on tentative paddy quotas with each farmer.
Again before the harvest, they visit the area and agree on firm quotas for the
season.
5.        Based on assessed acreage and yield, the farm quota is determined
by published schedule (Table 3). In all cases, it leaves sufficient allow-
ance for home consumption. As shown below, the schedule is progressive,
taking an increasing proportion of the harvest:

6.        Jute. The Agriculture Corporation procures virtually all jute pro-
duction at controlled prices below equivalent world market prices. Although
it sets no farm quotas, it regulates the procurement price in relation to
paddy prices so as to control overall production levels.
Project Cost Recovery
7.        Under the project, the 0 & M costs of flood control and drainage
facilities would require an annual expenditure of about K 3.1 million, or about
K 17 per acre (Annex 12, Tables 2 and 3). At present, GOB appropriates within
its budget about K 5 per ac for the 0 & M of flood protection works, an amount
insufficient for satisfactory upkeep of project works. The capital costs of
the project investments, excluding the costs of farm machinery to be recovered
through the agricultural credit systema, amounts to about K 1,200 per acre.
Recovery of this investment over a 30-year period would be represented by annual
costs amounting to K 7.4 million (K 40 per ac) with no cost of capital or to
K 23.5 million (K 125 per ac) with cost of capital at 10% per year.
Repayment Capacity
8.        A farmer's ability to pay such charges in general would be
determined by his production increases due to the project, the prevailing
farm gate commodity prices and adequate increases in net farm income as  1

incentives to increase production. A measure of this, the project rent,
is the portion of his increase in net farm income due to the project which
would be available after taking into account suitable rewards for family
labor and management and a margin for cultivation risks. Suitable rewards
for family labor and management should include adequate farm production
incentives. Such incentives are speculative and in practice would vary
depending on local alternative income opportunities.  In this report,
family labor is valued at K 6 per man-day, the market opportunity cost
for wage labor, and rewards for management are 10% of the residual farm
income.  In the absence of studies of the variance in crop yields and mar-
ket price projections, a margin for cultivation risks is taken as 10% of the
gross crop income. Table 5 gives the project rent estimates for the farm
models.
9.        Through price regulation, GOB holds down prices of the major farm
products, rice and jute, as a means to lower consumer prices primarily for
landless wage earners and urban residents. In relation to market prices and
to prices which would prevail if GOB were to impose no import or export
restrictions, this price regulation comprises an implicit tax on farmers
who must sell at least a part of their production to GOB. 1/ As a result
of the paddy quota procurement, which would take roughly 80% of the farmers'
incremental production, farmers are subject to a marginal tax rate on value
of production of about 45% (in relation to the market price 50% over the
procurement price). The effect in terms of the model farm budgets is shown
in Table 5. Under the quota system, GOB would capture 30% to 70% of the
project rent depending on the farmer's crop mix.
10.       Farmers' abilities to pay would reach such levels only after full
development should they achieve the anticipated increases in yields and
cropped areas. During the interim, project farm incomes would increase
gradually, more rapidly for some farmers than for others. Actual capabili-
ties to pay water charges, therefore, should be based on field recorded
increases in farm water supplies and production and increases in farm in-
comes evaluated using prevailing actual farm gate prices. Benchmark assess-
ments of farm production and incomes would be required before construction
completion. Subsequently, new assessments would be required periodically
to adjust for actual increases and changes in price levels.
11.       Amounts which farmers could pay would depend on the relative levels
of procurement and open market (or export price equivalent) prices and on
which agricultural pricing policy GOB would follow in the future. The ana-
lysis for this report is based on a market price 50% above the procurement
price, the relationship which prevailed at the time of appraisal. The market
price at that time was close to the export price equivalent. The relative
price levels should be reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary.
1/   In addition, farmers must sell their remaining surplus. production
in markets where prices, although usually higher than procurement
prices, still are controlled indirectly through price restrictions
on end products.                                                       185

12.       In its present form, the compulsory procurement system more than
meets the cost recovery objectives of the Bank Group water charges policy.
The method of taxation is progressive and the tax on incremental income
varies in proportion to the farmer's benefit from the project and his ability
to pay (Annex 15, para 5). From farmers owning 10 ac under average project
conditions, the system would capture 30% to 70% of the "project rent"
(Table 5). This represents implicit taxation with a marginal rate of about
45% and an average tax rate of about 20%. The GOB rice export of the incremental
paddy production under the project would provide additional revenue which
after full development would amount to US$23.7 million per year (K 154 million
per year at the official exchange rate, US$1 = K 6.5 or K 308 million per
year at the rate US$1 = K 13.0). After deducting procurement and handling
costs, this would leave an amount more than adequate to cover the full
costs of 0 & M capital recovery (Table 6).

ANNEX 16

LOWER BURMA PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        The project economic benefits and costs are compared in the rate
of return analysis incorporating the following assumptions:
(a) Agricultural Benefits. This analysis includes the primary
benefits from incremental crop production due to the project
(the difference between projected levels "with" and "without"
the proposed facilities and services). Secondary benefits
from additional trade and transport in rural areas are
not included. The future cropped areas and yields are
discussed in Annex 2 and per acre crop input requirements
are given in Annex 15. The net production values (Table 1)
are determined using prices which reflect opportunities for
potential export earnings at projected world market prices
(Annex 13).
(b) Investment Costs include the costs of embankments, drainage
channels, structures, buildings, land clearing and farm
machinery and pumps net of taxes, duties and allowances for
future price escalation. The expenditure schedules (Table 2)
are based on the construction schedule given in Annex 3,
Figure 1. The costs for preparation of future projects is
not included.
(c) Exchange Rate. The foreign components of the investment and
operating costs and the international prices used in making
the farm gate price estimates are valued in domestic currency
at a shadow exchange rate of US$1 = K 13.00. As discussed in
Annex 13, this reflects more realistically than the official
rate, the scarcity of foreign exchange for domestic investments.
(d) Pricing of Labor. Farm family and hired labor are evaluated
at a seasonally adjusted opportunity cost. Over a full year,
this cost averages an estimated K 4 per man-day, about two-
thirds of the peak market wage. Unskilled construction labor
is valued at market wages.
196



ANNEX 16
Page 2
(e) Production Development Phasing. Full agricultural develop-
ment for each farm is expected to be reached five years after
completion of the, drainage works (including embankments,
sluices, and channels) and land clearing in each area.
Phasing of development over the 11 polders follows the con-
struction and land clearing implementation schedule given in
Annex 9, Figure 1. Full development would occur gradually
over a period of 11 years after construction has commenced.
(f) Land Acquisition. Agricultural land to be taken for project
works has been valued at its opportunity cost based on the
resulting loss of crop production. The value of the loss is
reflected in the difference in future net production values
"with" and "without" the project.
Economic Rate of Return
2.        Based on the foregoing assumptions and a 30-year period of
analysis, the economic rates of return for the project areas are as
follows:
Lower Delta        Middle Delta        Project Whole
33%                24%                  30%
3.        The sensitivity of these estimates to alternative assumptions
is given in Table 3.
