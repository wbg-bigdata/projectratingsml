REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A
PADDYLAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Union of Burma for the equivalent of US$30 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for land reclamation, water
control, and bolstering agricultural input supply and supportive services.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report entitled "Current Situation and Pros-
pects of the Socialist Republic of Burma" (565a-BA) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on January 15, 1975. Another economic report is under
preparation and will be circulated shortly. Country data are provided in
Annex I.
3.        Burma, the largest country in the southeast Asian mainland, is rich
in natural resources, much of which have yet to be developed. Even though
the population is relatively small at about 30 million, per capita income
of Burma is still well below US$100. Burma came out of the Second World War
and the struggle for independence in 1948 economically devastated and poli-
tically divided. The fifties were a period of turbulence, both political
and economic. When the present Government came to power in 1962, its major
objectives were to unify the country and complete the social transformation
of the economy which had begun in the forties.
4.        After 11 years of government by the Revolutionary Council, a Con-
stitution was adopted in a nationwide referendum in December 1973. Parliament
is vested with supreme executive, legislative and judicial authority. The
People's Councils, which extend down to village tracts, are the primary
means of governing the nation. During the recess of Parliament, the Council
of State exercises power on its behalf. On the whole, there has been little
change in government personnel. The Burma Socialist Program Party is the
only authorized political, party.
5.        By and large, the Government has made notable progress in the attain-
ment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still a problem,
particularly in the hills and border areas, but there is probably greater
stability now than at any time since independence. Nationalization of all
major sectors, with the exception of agriculture, has been accomplished.
Agrarian reform nationalized land ownership, gave peasants cultivation
rights to land, and eliminated major inequalities in land holdings. Efforts
were also made to reduce inequalities in the distribution of income and
widen the scope of education and health services.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

6.        However, efforts in social fields have been constrained by slow
economic growth. Over the last ten years, real GDP grew at an average annual
rate of 2.3%, i.e., hardly above population growth which was 2.2%. Output
of productive sectors increased even more slowly. Quasi-stagnation of agri-
cultural production, combined with the growth of population, led to steady
dwindling of the export surplus. Specifically, rice, the dominant crop,
displayed zero growth between 1963-75 which in turn resulted in a steady
decline in rice exports from 1.6 million in 1963 to less than 0.2 million tons
in 1975, an average annual decline of 19%. Terms of trade however improved
considerably after 1972, and in terms of purchasing power, export earnings in
1975 were only slightly less than half those of 1965. The stagnation of
agricultural output directly affected the industrial sector which is largely
agro-based. Similarly, due to the decline in exports, this sector was de-
prived of much of its basic import requirements. Over the last decade,
industrial production increased by only 1.4% a year.
7.        Slow economic growth has been largely due to the neglect of agricul-
ture, forestry, mining, and transport. Agriculture, which accounts for 36% of
GDP, received on average only 7% of public investment during the last five
years, equivalent to 2% of its value added. Inadequate public investments in
agriculture were not offset by private investments. As a means of ensuring
the desired pattern of income distribution, prices for compulsory delivery to
the Government of many agricultural commodities were set at a low level.
Farmers, especially paddy farmers, were left with few incentives to produce
marketable surpluses and with inadequate savings for maintenance and invest-
ments.
8.        Traditionally, the government budget derived a large part of its
revenues from its rice exports. The diminishing rice export surplus had an
adverse impact on government income. The related scarcity of foreign exchange
necessitated a marked contraction of imports (reducing custom revenues) and
led to very slow growth of industrial production (and related revenues from
commercial taxes). Nationalization of large-scale private firms drastically
reduced direct taxation of private income. This was not replaced by a commen-
surate increase in government revenue from taxes and surpluses transferred by
government enterprises.
9.        The current revenue/GDP ratio declined from 16.5% in 1963, to 14%
in 1973 and below 10% in 1975. The index of current revenue (in real terms)
fell from 100 in 1970 to 68 in 1975. Despite substantial cuts in maintenance
and capital expenditures (in real terms), the budget deficit, almost entirely
financed through bank borrowing, increased so much that the money supply
doubled between 1972 and 1975. The deterioration of the budget was primarily
responsible for the sharp inflation which has been running at a yearly rate of
30% but which is now declining.
10.       Pricing, resource mobilization and resource allocation are the three
basic economic policy issues facing the Government. It has already introduced
some meaningful changes in its pricing policy. Procurement prices for agri-
cultural commodities were raised very substantially. For instance, the pro-
curement price for paddy was raised by 150% between 1972 and 1975. At present,



-3-
procurement prices for several farm products seem adequate and this saould
help revitalize private investment ip agriculture. A major reorganization of
the State Economic Enterprises is now underway. If successfully implemented
and accompanied by adequate costing practices, this should improve their
overall financial and production performance, thus increasing their surpluses
for transfer to the Government. With the 1977 budget, the Government has
embarked on a meaningful change in indirect taxation. As a result, the Gov-
ernment expects to increase its revenue by as much as 50%. If this increase
materializes, it would help control inflation because of lesser recourse to
deficit financing as well as raise public investments. As far as resource
allocation is concerned, it is Government's declared policy to give agricul-
ture, forestry, mining, and transport greater priority, and a growing share of
public investment is now allocated to these sectors.
11.       Substantial foreign transfers of resources into Burma are required
in order to accelerate economic development. Given Burma's low income level
and the scarcity of foreign exchange, these transfers should be on conces-
sionary terms and should in addition help finance part of local cost require-
ments, which cannot at present be covered adequately by domestic savings alone;
local cost financing is particularly-needed for the development of the agricul-
tural sector where most investments have a relatively low foreign exchange
component. During the last five years, aid commitments averaged US$60 million
a year mostly on soft terms. Total external debt as of March 1975 was US$537
million, including an undisbursed balance of about US$217 million. Despite
this low indebtedness (equivalent to 1% of Burma's GDP), the debt service
ratio is about 20% as a result of the low level of exports, and is expected to
remain below 20% in the next five years. Burma's gross foreign exchange
reserves were estimated at US$144 million in September 1975, equivalent to
twelve months' imports, based on the exceptionally low level of 1974/75
imports.
12.       Burma's development potential is considerable.   The Burmese popula-
tion is well educated. Production potential in agriculture is excellent,
especially for paddy. Exploitation of forest wealth is under way and could
be expanded further. Mineral resources are not yet identified sufficiently,
but they are likely to be substantial. Off-shore crude oil exploration
has recently been stepped up with bilateral assistance. The Bank Group, in
close cooperation with the IMF, is pursuing discussions with the Government
regarding further improvement in economic policies which would help develop
Burma's promising potential for economic development. The Burmese Government
is now preparing an investment project document providing a list of pros-
pective projects suitable for external financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, of IFC in 1956, and of
IDA in 1962. Between 1956 and 1961 the Bank made three loans totalling
US$33.1 million, all for transportation projects. A loan for the Port of
Rangoon helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and storage facil-
ities, and the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment. Two loans



- 4 -
helped finance the postwar reconstruction and dieselization of the railways.
All three projects were satisfactorily completed and the loans fully dis-
bursed by FY68. No lending was requested or made between 1962 and 1973.
Since 1973 IDA has made six credits totalling US$102.5 million. IFC has made
no investments in Burma, nor are any planned. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1976, and notes on
the execution of on-going projects; implementation of these projects is
proceeding without major difficulties. In addition, the Bank is Executing
Agency for a UNDP-financed multisectoral preinvestment and technical assist-
ance project aimed at the development of a pipeline of priority projects
suitable for external assistance.
14.       The proposed Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most imme-
diate constraints to growth and particularly at increasing and diversifying
production for export in order to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange.
To achieve this, the Bank Group is placing primary emphasis on the develop-
ment of the agriculture, forestry and mining. The Bank Group is also finan-
cing infrastructure improvements such as transportation and telecommunications,
mainly to rehabilitate facilities whose inadequacy has been increasingly
impeding economic development.
15.       A mining project was appraised in March 1976.   This project would
comprise rehabilitation and expansion of small scale tin mining. Other
prospective projects that are under active preparation include an irrig-
ation project in Upper Burma, a port channel rehabilitation project, a
cereal seeds project, and a fertilizer project.
16.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 15% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 5% of debt service. In five years, the
Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to about
20% and its share in the debt service to fall to about 2-3%.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
17.       The agricultural sector dominates the economy of Burma.    Agricul-
ture, including livestock, fisheries, and forestry, provides about 36% of GDP
(1975), 69% of employment (1974), and 80% of total export earnings (1975). In
addition, much of manufacturing, transportation, and trade involves the
processing, handling, and distribution of agricultural commodities. In seeking
to shift the economy to an industrial base, Government policy in the past has
tended to relegate agriculture to a subsidiary role as a supplier of cheap
basic foodstuffs and raw materials. Agriculture's share of total public in-
vestment diminished from 16% in 1963 to an average of 7% during the 1971-75
period; correspondingly, the portion going to the industrial sector rose from
3% in 1963 to an average of 30% in 1971-75. The growth of agricultural produc-
tion was limited to an average of 1.7% over the last decade, which was lower
than the rate of population growth. The stagnation within the agricultural
sector led to a reorientation of priorities in 1972; long- and short-term goals
were redesigned to give first priority to the expansion of production in the
agricultural, livestock, and forestry sectors in an effort to stimulate exports



- 5 -
and substitute domestic production for imports. Although the incremental
change seems modest, the allocation of public investment to the agricultural
sector was revised to 10% in 1976. Specific objectives for agriculture
include increased production of rice and jute for export, cotton to supply raw
materials for the domestic textile industry, and other cash crops both for
domestic consumption and export.
18.       Once the largest rice exporter in the world, Burma suffered consider-
able devastation to embankment structures during World War II and subsequently
from recurrent social disturbances. Land abandonment and deterioration was
further aggravated by the stoppage of rice exports during the war period,
changes in land tenancy, erosion of protective embankments, and general lack
of maintenance. A special reclamation program of the Government managed to
boost sown area by 1963-64 to its pre-war level of 12.4 million acres primarily
through the restoration of approximately 71% of the 1.7 million abandoned acres
in Lower Burma. However, due to insecurity, inadequate embankment maintenance,
and a generally low level of commercial and economic activity over the last
decade, the total abandoned area of Lower Burma increased once again to about
1.0 million acres by 1973-74. Over the last ten years, there has been no
significant increase in the total sown area nationwide as increases in acreage
in Upper Burma merely compensated for the losses in Lower Burma. At the same
time there has been no growth in per acre yields, and annual production of
paddy has fluctuated around its pre-war level of about 8 million tons.
19.       About 70% of the area under paddy is concentrated in Lower Burma,
mainly in the Irrawaddy Delta. Mostly local varieties are sown. Adoption of
high-yielding varieties has been constrained in the past mainly by inadequate
water control but also by the lack of material inputs, especially fertilizers,
and by draft power shortages during peak demand periods. In Upper Burma lack
of water is the major constraint to increased production and adoption of
HYV.
20.       Government control of rice marketing and pricing policy has had
a substantial constraining effect upon productivity. The Government maintained
low procurement prices for paddy during the 1960s and early 1970s in an
effort to keep food costs for urban residents low and to make sizable profits
from export sales. The results of such a policy were to (a) stimulate
domestic consumption through artificially low retail prices, (b) generate an
active black market for food commodities to satisfy excess demand at Govern-
ment-established prices, (c) eliminate incentives for private investment in
agriculture, (d) reduce procured volumes and induce covert diversion of paddy
into free market channels, and (e) limit exportable volumes. The impact of
low procurement prices was particularly severe on paddy farmers in Lower
Burma who have virtually no alternative to paddy production in the wet season.
Farmers, therefore, attempted to circumvent the compulsory quotas and to sell
as large a portion as possible of marketable surpluses onto the free market.
21.       The low procurement price policy was eventually reversed in 1972
and over the subsequent three-year period, procurement prices of paddy in-
creased by 150%. Although private paddy transactions are still strictly
regulated, state controls on the sale, purchase, and transport of rice within
townships were abolished in May 1973 thereby legitimatizing limited local



- 6 -
free market transactions of milled rice.    Preliminary analysis of the cur-
rent paddy situation suggests that (a) prices paid by farmers for most inputs,
tractor and other farm machinery services have not increased as much as crop
prices in recent years; (b) adjustments in procurement prices for paddy have
provided sufficient incentive to farmers to increase the area devoted to paddy
cultivation and to invest in yield-augmenting material inputs, e.g., fertil-
izers, pesticides, improved seeds; (c) because of acreage expansion, more
intensive cultivation, and favorable monsoonal conditions, paddy production is
expected to reach a record high of 9 million tons in 1976, an increase of 6.5%
over 1975; (d) procurement should total at least 3.1 million tons of paddy
during the 1976 season; (e) because of expanded production, free market
farmgate prices for paddy have fallen but remain approximately 50% above
Government procurement prices.
22.       Other important crops include jute, cotton, oilseeds (groundnuts
and sesamum), pulses, and sugarcane. Jute acreage and production declined
over the 1974-75 period by 43 and 50% respectively, predominantly in response
to shortages of seeds and relative profitability of paddy over jute; a 23%
increase in procurement pricei announced for 1976 could stimulate production
of this important export commodity. Production of cotton rose 18% while area
sown increased by only 3% between 1974 and 1975. Groundnut production and area
increased during 1974-75 by 13 and 15% respectively. Adopted in recent years
as a follow-up crop to paddy, production of groundnuts has been constrained by
drought and shortage of viable seed. Pulse area and production rose over the
1974-75 period by 6 and 18% respectively. Pulses are grown on dryland areas
of Upper Burma and on paddyland as a follow-up crop in the Middle Delta of
Lower Burma; further boosts in production will require water control measures
and extension efforts to popularize improved varieties.
23.       Burma has considerable potential for increases in agricultural
productivity in the future, especially in paddy development. In Lower Burma
the key factor for development would be the protection of paddyland from
flooding (Middle Delta) and salt water intrusion (Lower Delta). Although the
price of paddy has been increased substantially over the last several years
in an effort to re-establish significant exportable surpluses, periodic review
of pricing and market policies for paddy as well as for other crops will be
required to induce greater intensity of land use and greater crop diversi-
fication. Producers appear quite price responsive. Other important comple-
mentary measures for increased productivity within the sector include (a) the
adoption of known high yielding varieties, (b) increased supply, distributional
efficiency and use of material inputs, particularly of fertilizers, (c) addi-
tional investment in irrigation, (d) reclamation of abandoned arable land,
(e) adequate provision of suitable extension services, (f) appropriate supply
of equipment and equipment services to overcome draft power shortages in peak
demand periods, (g) development of an agricultural credit system to provide
not only short-term crop loans but also medium- and long-term financing of
draft animal, water pump, power tiller, or tractor acquisition as well as for
land rehabilitation, and (h) provision of a satisfactory supply of consumer
goods for the agricultural producer market.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The project was identified and prepared with the assistance of Bcnr
missions in February and July 1975 respectively. It was appraised in October/
November 1975. A report entitled "Burma-Appraisal of the Lower Burma Paddy
Land Development Project" (No. 1129-BA) dated May 25, 1976, is being circu-
lated separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project summary
is attached in Annex III.
25.       At negotiations held in Washington in May 1976, the Government was
represented by a delegation led by Dr. Bo Lay, Deputy Minister of Agriculture
and Forests.
Project Description
26.       The proposed project, the fourth Bank agricultural project in Burma,
would be the first in a proposed series to protect existing cultivated area
and reclaim abandoned paddyland in Lower Burma. The project would raise
agricultural production by increasing acreage under cultivation, enabling
higher land-use intensity, and boosting yields through protection of 120,000
ac of existing farm land from flood inundation and salt water intrusion;
reclamation of 65,000 ac of abandoned paddyland; provision of efficient agri-
cultural extension services; and improvement in farm equipment supply and
services. The design of the project is simple. With necessary hydrological
analyses, the project could easily be replicated in other Lower Burma delta
areas. Incremental production at full development (1988) is estimated to
total 159,000 tons of paddy, 5,900 tons of jute, and 23,000 tons of miscel-
laneous crops. At full development, the project is projected to yield
foreign exchange earnings of US$28 million per annum from increased agri-
cultural exports. The project would in addition provide for two project
preparatory studies: (i) a hydrological investigation and formulation of
future projects for the entire delta region, and (ii) a feasibility study of a
paddy storage and handling improvement project aimed at increasing efficiency
and curbing losses in Government as well as on-farm stocks. Investments under
the project would be made with the objectives of recovering abandoned land,
protecting reclaimed and presently cultivated land from flooding and salt
water intrusion facilitating dry season cultivation, strengthening of ex-
tension services to area farmers, alleviating periodic shortages of animal
dVaft power, planning for extending land development to other delta areas,
and improvement in grain storage and handling at all stages of the marketing
process. The specific components include:
(a) Construction of approximately 410 miles of earth embankments
involving 11.4 M cu yards of earthwork;
(b) Enlargement and new excavation of 770 miles of drainage
channels totalling 11.6 M cu yards of earthwork, complete
with drainage culverts, sluice structures, channel regulators
in Shwelaung Island, and supporting staff and storage
buildings;



- 8 -
(c) Reclamation of 65,000 acres of abandoned land on 11 polders
through grass and mangrove clearance and mechanical plowing
and harrowing;
(d) Cadastral survey and mapping of reclaimed area and eventual
allocation of 10 ac plots to each of about 6,500 displaced
farmers and landless area residents;
(e) Strengthening of agricultural extension service in the
five project townships covering 900,000 ac of cultivated
land;
(f) Fellowships for short-term extension training courses;
(g)  Procurement of 1,000 low lift pumps, 500 power tillers,
33 farm tractors, 33 disc plows, 16 disc harrows and 17 rotary
cultivators to be sold to farmers' groups;
(h) Construction of fertilizer godowns and field workshops,
and provision of workshop equipment and tools for servicing
the farming and land reclamation equipment;
(i) About 60 man-months of consultant service to assist GOB in
hydrological investigation and formulation of a program of
phased development of the delta, as well as four man-years
of training of Burmese engineers overseas in hydrology and
hydrometrics;
(j) About 35 man-months of consultant service to assist GOB in
determining specific measures in which paddy storage and
handling might be improved by Government as well as by
farmers.
Project Execution
27.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF) would be responsible
for the implementation of the project. A total of eleven agencies, seven under
MAE and four in other ministries, would be involved in project implementation
(paras. 28-29). Suitable coordination mechanisms were agreed upon during
negotiations (paras. 30-32).
28.       The seven agencies under the MAF and their respective responsibili-
ties under the project are:
(a) Irrigation Department (ID) would be responsible for the planning,
design, construction, operation and maintenance (O&M) of all
flood control and drainage facilities, and the procurement of
construction and 0 & M equipment. It would also be responsible
for conducting the delta-wide hydrological investigations for
planning future projects with assistance from consultants.
(b) Survey Department (SD) would survey farms to be displaced by
embankments and drains, survey and demarcate land to be
reclaimed.



- 9 -
(c) Settlement and Land Records Department (SLRD) would adjust land
records and revise maps in accordance with SD data.
(d) Central Land Committee (CLC), through Village Land Committees
would allot land to displaced farmers and landless farmers in
each of the five project townships.
(e) Working People's Settlement Department (WPSD) would organize
force account land clearing to supplement the family labor of
land allottees, and settle families in Dauntgyi polder where
the local population is presently sparse.
(f) Agriculture Corporation (AC) would (i) provide research support,
(ii) implement the intensified extension program, (iii) supply seeds,
fertilizers and other input to project farmers, as well as (iv)
construct four additional fertilizer godowns in the project
area.
(g) Agricultural Mechanization Department (AMD) would (i) procure
and sell through the Agricultural Bank to farmer groups or
cooperatives pumps, power tillers, tractors, and implements
covered under project, (ii) provide tractor service to farmers,
(iii) rent,power chain saws to land allottees for mangrove clearing,
(iv) provide maintenance service for farm machinery and pumps
and (v) construct, equip,, and staff seven field workshops in
the project area.
29.       The four non-MAF and their respective project-related responsibili-
ties are:
(a) Burma (Myanma) Agricultural Bank (BAB), under the Ministrwy for
Planning and Finance (MPF) would provide long-term, medium-term
and short-term credit to farmers, including financing for the
purchase of farm machinery procured through the project
(para. (g) above).
(b) The Cooperative Department (CD) under the Ministry of
Cooperatives would stock and sell hand or animal drawn
tools to land allottees for land reclamation activities.
(c) Ministry of Planning and Finance (MFP) would make annual
budgetary appropriation for ID to cover 0 & M costs of
the project flood control and drainage facilities.
(d) Trade Corporation No. 1 (TC-1) which handles paddy
procurement and domestic supply under the Ministry of
Trade, would conduct the feasibility study for the paddy
storage and handling study in cooperation with AC.
30.       To coordinate the work of the eleven agencies, a Project Implement-
ation Committee (PIC) would be formed within MAF. The Committee would be
chaired by the Deputy Minister of MAF and would comprise the head or a senior



- 10 -
representative of each of the eleven participating agencies. The Committee
would be responsible for inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination of
policy and important administrative matters. Under the Committee, a Project
Unit (PU) comprising senior technical officers of the seven participating
MAF agencies would be established. A senior ID officer would be appointed
Project Director of PU who would serve concurrently as a member secretary of
PIC. With adequate supporting staff, he would be responsible for coordinating
technical planning and field execution of project components. Each PU member
would be responsible for implementing the project work related to his respec-
tive agency (Section 3.03 of the Credit Agreement). It is estimated that the
project would be implemented in six years.
31.       In each of the Project Townships, a Township Project Committee (TPC)
would be formed to coordinate the project works. The Committee membership
would include the Township level officers of each agency participating in
project implementation.    The TPC would be chaired by the ID engineer during
the construction phase of irrigation works and by the AC Township Manager
after completion of construction. Establishment of PIC and PU would be a
condition for credit effectiveness (Section 5.01 of the Credit Agreement).
TPCs would be established when construction and land reclamation operations
are ready to begin in the respective townships.
32.       Extension work under the project would be coordinated by a Project
Extension Manager (PEM) who would report to the AC Irrawaddy Division Manager.
The PEM would be assisted by three Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) for plant
protection, mechanization, and extension training; these would be stationed
in the Pyapon Township. At the township level, there would be three SMSs,
two for paddy cultivation stationed at Pyapon and Laputta, and one for both
paddy and jute cultivation in Shwelaung Township. Each township would have
an Extension Manager and a Deputy Manager who would supervise the work of
two to six Village Tract Extension Managers each in charge of six Village
Extension Managers (VEM). Each VEM would in turn be responsible for about
800 farm families.
33.       For operating and maintaining the flood control and drainage
facilities constructed under the project, ID would establish six 0 & M units.
In addition to engineering staff, each unit would have a labor crew organized
into groups of five workmen during the dry season and eight workmen in the
wet season. Each group would be responsible for the continuous maintenance
of five miles of embankment.
34.       Close synchronization of field operations and coordination among
agencies would be crucial to achieving project targets and keeping work pro-
gress on schedule. Day-to-day monitoring of the execution and coordination
of the various subcomponents of the project would be performed by the re-
sponsible members of the TPC. Evaluation of implementation progress would
form the content of the regular periodic reports prepared by the Township
Project Committees and sent to the Project Unit, as well as those by township-
level officers to their respective headquarters in Rangoon. The Project Unit



- 11 -
would collate the township reports into a monthly project progress summary
to be reviewed by the Project Implementation Committee. PIC would consolidate
the monthly summaries into quarterly reports for submission to IDA.
35.       Consultants would be recruited to assist the Government in the
conduct of delta-wide hydrological investigation and establishment of a
phased delta development: plan, as well as in preparation of a paddy storage
and handling improvement: project (Section 3.02 of the Credit Agreement).
Costs and Financing
36.       Total project cost is estimated at US$54.0 million (exclusive of
customs duties and taxes) of which US$25.0 million or 46% would be foreign
exchange.  The proposed IDA credit of US$30.0 million (covering 56% of the
total project cost exclusive of taxes and duties) would finance the full
foreign exchange cost component and about US$5.0 million equivalent of the
local costs.  GOB would finance the balance of the project cost, or US$24.0
million equivalent (K 156 million equivalent) through annual budget appro-
priations.  The need for some IDA financing of local costs is noted in
para. 11.
37.       IDA funds would be channeled to participating ministries through
a project account within the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF). The AMD
would procure and sell to farmer groups or cooperatives project-related pumps,
power tillers, and tractors for which the Burma (Myanma) Agricultural Bank
(BAB) would provide appropriate financing through the Village Banks. Because
the institutional credit system in Burma is presently being restruc-tured and
since BAB only began operations on April 1, 1976, details concerning terms and
conditions within the new rural credit scheme have yet to be finalized. Prior
to procurement of farm equipment (total of $3 million) for sale to farmer
groups on credit GOB and IDA will agree on the final terms, conditions and
procedures for providing medium-term and long-term credit to farmers, parti-
cularly those for the purchase of tractors, power tillers, implements, low
lift pumps and spare parts supplied under the project (Section 3.12 and
Schedule 3, B.2 of the Credit Agreement). Moreover, a special account would
be set up by BAB for credit to farmer groups covering the purchase of project-
provided farm machinery and pumps. Repayment to this account would be used
for activities directly related to agricultural development (Section 3.13
of the Credit Agreement).
Recovery of Costs
38.       Under the project, the O&M costs of flood control and drainage
facilities would require an annual expenditure of about K 17 per ac. Similar-
ly annual charges to recover the capital costs-of the project investment would
amount to K 40 per ac without interest or K 125 per ac at 10% interest (30
year project life). Under the existing system of compulsory paddy procure-
ment, GOB would automatically capture from the project farmers a large portion
of incremental production at prices that are below those in the free and
export markets, representing an implicit tax on farmers. Procurement quotas



- 12 -
are assessed on the basis of sown acreage as well as yields obtained and are
structured to be progressive in nature. At present procurement prices and
estimated international prices, GOB profits from exportation of the incremental
paddy procured in the project area would exceed the full costs for O&M and the
annual provisions for capital recovery (at 10% interest) as set out above. At
the same time farm income levels of project farmers would increase substantial-
ly and provide sufficient incentives for producer investments, increased
seasonal outlays for crop inputs, and improvement in productive efficiency.
Procurement prices and amounts allocated by GOB for O&M project costs would be
periodically reviewed and, if necessary, revised. If at a future date the
compulsory paddy procurement system were modified or abolished, an alternative
system of cost recovery, providing for recovery of O&M costs and investment,
would be formulated and agreed upon with IDA. (Sections 4.04 and 4.05 of the
Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       All equipment, spares, and materials, estimated at US$18 million
including contingencies, would be procured under international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference of 15%
of cif price or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower, would be
extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Small off-the-shelf
items not suitable for international tendering, costing less than US$20,000
each, would be purchased through normal Government procurement procedures, on
the basis of price comparisons among no less than three suppliers. Such pur-
chases would be limited to a total of US$200,000. The civil works would be
scattered over 11 islands spanning a distance of 1,200 miles and would com-
prise mainly earthworks (embankments, drains and drainage sluices) subject
to seasonal weather interruption (with 80 inches of rain during the rainy
season). These would have to be phased so as to cause the least disruption
of cultivation. Under these circumstances they would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding. The ID would, therefore, carry them out
by force account. The ID has had extensive experience in designing and
constructing such works.
40.       Disbursement from the proposed credit would be made at the rate
of (a) 100% against the cif cost of directly imported equipment, spare parts
and materials, and the ex-factory price of equipment, spares, and accesso-
ries manufactured locally and procured under international competitive bid-
ding, (b) 70% of expenditures for other equipment, spare parts and construc-
tion materials procured locally, and (c) 50% of expenditures for civil works
excluding construction material, equipment, and spare parts. For consultant's
services and training of local staff abroad, disbursement would cover the
actual foreign exchange costs.
Benefits and Justification
41.       The primary benefit from the project would be the increase in crop
production within the project area. Not only would crop damage be reduced
because of greater protection from flooding and salt water intrusion but



- 13 -
increased land-use intensity would become feasible with provision of low-lift
pumps and reduced risks of crops loss. Annual production in the project area
would increase from the present 68,000 tons of paddy, 2,000 tons of jute, and
4,300 tons of miscellaneous crops to 227,000 tons of paddy, 8,000 tons of
jute, and 27,000 tons of miscellaneous crops at full production in 1988.
Without the project, the corresponding production is estimated to rise to
76,000, 2,500, and 4,400 tons respectively.
42.       About 18,300 farm families would benefit directly from the project--
12,800 existing farm families benefiting from protection against flood and
salt water damage on presently cultivated land and 5,500 presently landless
resident families receiving plot allotments from the 65,000 acres of reclaimed
paddyland. The project would substantially improve the earning capacity for
low income farmers in the project polders. The project would increase farm
income two to three times from present average net income of about K 200 and
K 300 per ac to K 650 and K 750 in the Lower and Middle Deltas respectively.
43.       The incremental rice and jute production would generate about US$28
million per year in foreign exchange earnings. By way of comparison, annual
incremental rice production derived from the project areas would represent
approximately 51% of total 1975 rice export volume from Burma and about 48% of
foreign exchange earnings from rice exportation in 1975. Total incremental
export earnings per annum from paddy and jute resulting from the project would
represent roughly 20% of total 1975 earnings from major export commodities.
Taking into account the local value of production of pulses, groundnuts and
other crops, the total value added to the Burmese economy from incremental
agricultural output would amount to about K 295 million (US$44 million) per
annum.
44.       The economy is expected to realize an estimated 30% rate of return
from total project investments, inclusive of physical contingencies. Capital
investment costs per ac in the Lower Delta polders would be approximately
half those incurred in the Middle Delta while incremental net benefits would
be about 70% of those in the Middle Delta. As a result, Lower Delta polders
would yield a 33% rate of return versus 24% for the Middle Delta polder. Sen-
sitivity analyses involving increases in construction costs by 25% over original
estimates, per ac yields 15% less than projected, net benefits lowered by 25%,
and implementation delays and slippage of benefits two years, each generated
rates of return 20% or higher for each delta project area.
45.       The total project cost (US$51.5 million), including physical and
price contingencies but excluding costs of future developmental studies,
averages only about US$280 per ac of land developed. Such low-cost develop-
ment could successfully be replicated over a large part of the estimated total
three million ac in Lower Burma, including about one million ac of abandoned
paddyland.

C.   Projects in Execution I/
Cr. No. 413    Inland Water Transport Project, US$16.3 Million Credit
of July 2, 1973; Effective Date: September 17, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Procurement was slow in the beginning because the Inland Water
Transport Corporation's management was not familiar with IDA procedures.
However, procurement has picked up in recent months. The implementation
of the project is being affected by increases in unit prices of commodities
procured under the project, particularly relating to engines and spare parts.
As a result, the number of equipment items financed under the project has
been reduced. About $6.0 million was committed as of January 1976.
Cr. No. 414    Third Railways Project; US$16.7 Million Credit of July 2, 1973;
Effective Date: September 17, 1973; Closing Date: Decem-
ber 31, 1976
Despite problems, such as theft of spare parts, which is adversely
affecting the Railways' operations, procurement and implementation of the
project are proceeding at a reasonable speed. The Government recently took
steps to reduce the security problem as regards the theft of parts and allowed
substantial increases in freight and passenger tariffs. The total commitment
made as of March 1976 was about $14.7 million.
Cr. No. 483    Lift Irrigation Project, US$17.0 Million Credit of June 21,
1974; Effective Date: August 6, 1974; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1978
The project has made a very good start. Within three months of
the signing of the Credit Agreement, the Project Committee was established
and functioning effectively; procurement actions were initiated for $12.6
million of equipment and spare parts. The contract for procurement of
10,000 pumps was awarded in January 1975. About 1,500 pumps had been dis-
tributed to farmers by January 1976.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Effective Date: February 27, 1975; Closing Date: March 31,
1981
The four spec:ialists appointed to assist in project implementation
assumed their posts in March 1976. Bid invitations for most of the equipment
were issued last June/July and the first awards were made last November.
There have been some delays in procurement procedures. Orders for the first
batch of extraction equipment on nine ICB tenders valued at about US$5 mil-
lion were placed in February 1976. However, recruitment of executive and high
level technical staff still remains to be completed.
Cr. No. 551    Telecommunications Project; US$21.0 Million Credit of May 30,
1975; Effective Date: July 23, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The Project has had a good start. The Post and Telecommunication
Corporation has prepared the specifications for all equipment to be procured
under the credit. Most bid invitations were issued by January 1976.
Cr. No. 597    Livestock Project; US$7.5 Million Credit of December 30, 1975;
Effective Date: March 26, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The Project Policy Committee has been established, and the Project
Coordinator appointed. The project has just become effective (March 26, 1976).

be procured under international competitive bidding
procedures (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group Guide-
lines. A preference of 15% of cif price or the pre-
vailing customs duty, whichever is lower, would be ex-
tended to local manufacturers, in the evaluation of bids.
(b)  Small off-the-shelf items not suitable for ICB costing
less than US$20,000 each would be purchased through
normal GOB procurement procedures on the basis of a
comparison of prices from not less than three suppliers.
Such purchases would be limited to a total of US$200,000.
(c)  The drainage services and project buildings would be
small, simple structures the construction of which
would be subject to seasonal weather interruption
and to phasing for compatibility with cultivation
patterns. Such construction, unsuitable for ICB,
would be carried out under force account by the Irri-
gation Department.
Technical
Assistance: A total of 95 man-months of foreign consultant staff would be
engaged to assist the Government in (i) the conduct of delta-
wide hydrological investigation and establishment of a
phased delta development plan (60 man-months); and (ii) the
development of a paddy storage and handling improvement
program (35 man-months).
