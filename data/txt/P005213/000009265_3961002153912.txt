IEKORANDIU AND RECONNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRCTION AND DEVELOPMEt
TO THE MEXCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSg} LOAN
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
FOR THE SISTAN RIM  FLOOD WORKS REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following aemorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Islamic Republic of Iran, for US$57 million
equivalent to help finance the Sistan River Flood Works Rohabilitation
Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with
a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.    hgkgIgw4.  Iran is a lower middle-income country with a 1990
population close to 57 million people, growing at over 3 percent per year, and
a GNP per capita income estimated at US$2,450 (1990). Iran's principal
natural assets are its petroleum and gas deposits, other valuable minerals
(e.g., chromite, copper, zinc, gemstones), and substantial agricultural and
water resources. Agriculture accounts for around 20 percent of GDP; industry,
including oil and gas production, for another 20 percent; and services, for
the remaining 60 percent of GDP. Nearly 30 percent of Iran's labor force of
around 15 million is engaged in agriculture; 25 percent, in industry; and 45
porcent, iu services.
3.   Iran's merchandise exports, averaging US$10-14 billion per year, are
dominated by oil and gas, which constitute 90 percent of total exports.  Non-
oil exports include carpets, fresh and dried fruit and nuts, and a variety of
manufactured goods (e.g., canned foods, electrical goods, glassware,
rndustrial equipment, leather goods, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and
textiles). Merchandise imports to Iran, averaging US$10-15 billion per year,
comprlse minly intermediate goods (58 percent of total). Capftal goods
constitute 24 percent, and food and other consumer goods the remaining 18
percent of total imports of goods.
4.    Iran's economic policies and performance in the last decade were
influenced by the change of regime in 1979 and the war with Iraq from 1980 to
1988. During the war years, the economy was subject to controls and
administrative interventions in the determination of the prices of various
goods and services, domestic and external trading, imnestment decisions, and
the ownership of firms and enterprises. The country also faced trade and
financial embargoes and, in 1986, experienced a virtual collapse of oil
income.
5.   Economic performance was mixed. An 8 percent per year rate of GDP
growth in 1980-85 was followed by a slowdown to 3 percent per year in 1985-88.
Inflation averaged 20 percent per year in 1985-88 due to excess money supply
created to meet public deficits (averaging 8 percent of GDP during 1985-88).
Iran formulated its post-war reconstruction policies and priorities in the
country's First Five-Year Plan (FFYP) spanning 1989/90-1993/94.
6.    The Government's major policy objectives in its FFYM  include the
progrossive elimination of financial imbalances, the decentralization of
economic decision-making and the privatization of state enterprises. To
eliminate budgetary libalances, the FPYP proposed raising revenues and
containig expenditures, whereas, to eliminate imbalances in the external
accounts, it proposed rationalization of the exchange rate and the trade and



-2-
payments systems. The decentralization policy proposed devolving local
taxation and expenditure authority to provincial and town councils and
promotion of urban and industrial centers outside existing conglomerates. The
privatization policy required the state sector to sell off shares in various
enterprises.
7.    Plan implementation has proceeded smoothly, wi-h economic management
Improving markedly over the past three years. The most recent reforms have
included: the reduction of multiple exchange rates from seven to three, these
now being: the official rate (rials 70/US$), the competitive rate (rials
600/US$) and the floating rate (rials 1400/US$); a large effective
depreciation of the rial for non-oil exporters; the removal of non-tariff
barriers on imports at the floating rate; the decontrol of most domestic
prices; the dissolution of price enforcement courts; completion of draft
legislation to revamp the tax system; increases in public utility rates; the
abolition of credit ceilings; the expansion of the Tebran Stock Exchange; and
Cabinet approval to fully divest 250 public enterprises.
8.   The economy has been recovering steadily.  GDP grew 4 percent in 1989
and 10 percent in 1990; it is estimated to have grown by 4 percent in 1991.
The government (i.e., central and provincial governments) deficit came down
from 9 percent of GDP in 1988 to 2 percent in 1990. In 1991, despite lower
oil revenues, the government contained the budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP
for the fiscal year which ended in March 1992.
9.    The growth of net credit to the Government and that of broad money
declined between 1988 and 1990, helping to lower inflation, from 29 percent in
1988 to around 10 percent in 1990. However, a large depreciation of the rial
in January 1991, with price liberalization, pushed inflation to 18 percent
during the year. Iran's external accounts also improved in recent years such
that overall balances were about US$2 billion each in 1989 and 1990. In 1991,
the balance of payments turned unfavorable as oil prices fell, underscoring
the importance of export diversification for Iran to reduce its vulnerability
to oil price fluctuations.
10.  Over the medium term, there is considerable potential for growth in the
economy. The shift in relative prices towards tradeables would sustaLn
agricultural and industrial growth. The large gas reserves in Iran should
contribute to electricity generation, petro-chemical and metallurgical
industries. Real GDP growth in 1992-96 is expected to average 4 percent per
year.
11.   Medium-term export earnings are projected to grow steadily, due to
increased oil and gas export volumes, and the reform-induced increases in non-
oil exports. But import needs are expected to be high to enable Iran to
liberalize lts economy and to undertake reconstruction and growth-related
investments. The country can be expected to finance up to 80 percent of
1uvestaents with national savings; the balance would need to be mobilized from
external sources.
12.   Iran's terms of trade are projected tu decline in the medium term
averaging US$3 billion (3 percent of GDP) each year from 1992 to 1996.



-34.
Consequently, the external current account deficit could increase to US$6
billion (8 percent of GDP) in 1993 but i8 projected to declfne to 5 percent of
GDP by 1996 and turn into s surplus two years thereafter.
13.   Iran', medium- and long-term debt at the end of its fiscal year 1990/91
was estimated at about US$1.8 billion (1.5 percent of GDP).  There were, in
addition, short-term debts and trade-related credits of between US$2 billion
(Central Bank estimate) and US$7 billion (OBCD estimate). Using the hlgher
estimate of short-term debt, the total debt stock at the end of 1990/91 was
around US$9 billion (close to 8 percent of GDP); the debt service ratio in
1990/91 was about 3.5 percent. While the stock of its external debt will rise
as Iran undertakes reconstruction and other investments, it is expected that
the debt service ratio will remaln manageable, provided it borrows for viable
projects, as well as manages its mix of financing for the public and private
sectors. Such a strategy will be important to sustain the country's future
creditworthiness. Based on its current low indebtedness, its export potential
and its exemplary payments records, Iran is considered creditworthy for IBRD
and other external borrowlng.
14. Bank Countrv Strategv. Iran has been an IBRD member in good standing
since December 1945. The Bank began lending to Iran in 1957 and stopped in
1974 when the country's financial resources increased due to the 1973 oil
price increase. Between 1957 and 1974, Iran received 33 loans for projects in
agriculture, infrastructure, population and education. The Bank disbursed
US$1,023 million, virtually all now repaid, with US$32.24 million of the
disbursed amount outstanding at the end of March 1992. Iran Joined the IFC on
December 28, 1956. Through the mid-1970s, seven Iranian companies obtained
cumulative gross commitments of US$42.5 millicn.  All past investments of the
IFC in Iran have been repaid.
15.  Two years ago, Iran approached the Bank Group for assistance in
rebuilding the country's economy damaged during 1978-88 by the war with Iraq.
As the IBRD and IFC had been inactive in Iran for 17 years, the Bank agreed
with the Government to assess Iran's economic policies and conditions; its
expenditure and external capital requirements; and its financial and economic
prospects, including its creditworthiness for Bank Group and other external
borrowing.
16.  While the economlc assessment was in progress, a severe earthquake hit
northern Iran in June 1990. At special government request, the Bank approved,
on March 14, 1991, a US$250 million loan to Iran as an emergency operation,
whilch became effective July 3, 1991. Soon after, macroeconomic and key sector
reviews, and an assessment of financial prospects, were completed and
presented in the economlc report (9027-IRN) of July 30, 1991.
17. The Government's ongoing economic reform program is constrained by the
financing required to undertake the large backlog of reconstruction and
development expenditures.   Its access to international capital markets
contlnues to be limited even though during the last decade Iran kept the stock
of its external debt within manageable limlts and did not incur any major
payments arrears.



-4-
18.   The major objectives of Bank assistance strategy in Iran are to: (a)
assist the Government to implement a sound economic reform program;
(b) support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Iranian economy and
human resources development; and (c) strengthen Iran's international trade
relations and access to capital markets. The assistance program would
involve: (i) investment lending for reconstruction and the rehabilitation of
physical infrastructure and human resources development; (ii) economic and
sector work to support economic and sector policy dialogue, and provide the
basis for lending operations; and (iii) the mobilization of international
financial resources including the co-financing of Batk operations.
19.   The Proiect Area.  The proposed project is located in the Sistan River
floodplain, an environmentally sensitive area in the Sistan Baluchistan
province, in the south-east region of Iran. The floodplain is located
entirely in Iran and forms the western delta of the Hirmand River, which
originates in Afghanistan and terminates in Iran near the border at Lake
Hirmand (Hamun). The benefited population of about 331,000 reside mostly in
about 846 villages ranging in size from 200 to 10,000 inhabitants. Zabol, the
only urban center, has a population of about 76,000. Most of the inhabitants
are Sistanis and Baluchis, minority groups, who have inhabited the a.ea on
both sides of the Afghan-Iranian border for centuries. The area of the
floodplain is about 250,000 ha, of which about 160,000 ha is arable. The main
crops consist of wheat, barley, fodder, sorghum, cotton, fruits and
vegetables. Farming and livestock breeding are the main economic activities,
complemented by rural industries such as rug and carpet weaving. Secondary
industries include food products, handmade textiles and basket weaving located
mostly in Zabol. The 1990 per capita incomel" from farming averaged about
Rls 15,360 (about US$50) and that from services and industry averaged about
Rls 130,372 (US$425), which are substantially lower than the national average
of Rls 752,150 (US$2,450).
20.   The international nature of the Hirmand River does not present any
technical or legal issues that would require notifying the holder of upstream
riparian rights (Afghanistan) about the project. The project consists of
rehabilitating existing flood control works, which are located in Iran very
distant from the border, and the existing treaty, signed by both parties in
March 1973, does not provide for advance notification by Iran for works
undertaken downstream of the border line.
21.  The flooding of the Sistan River floodplain is caused by the Sistan
River and wind-induced surge from Lake Hirmand; often these events occur
concurrently (e.g., the 1991 flood). Floods in 1991 exceeded the capacity of
the dike system, flooding about 90 percent of the project area and causing
major damage to houses, infrastructure, agriculture and the loss of livestock.
Furthermore, after this event, most of the land remained inaccessible for more
than six months due to stagnant flood waters, and many families remained
homeless during that time.
22.   Prolect Obiectives.  The key project objectives are to: (a) reduce the
risks to human life and prevent damage to public and private property and
1/   Based on a trade-weighted exchange rate of Rls 307/US$.

Infrastructure due to major floods; (b) minimize disruptions to the local
economy; (c) provide protection against uajor floods for habitats and cultural
property; and (d) mitigate environmental degradation and health hazards caused
by floods and by ad hoc development in the project area.
23.   Project Description.  The proposed project consists of:
(i) rehabilitating and upgrading about 100 km of dikes along the southern
shore of Lake Hirmand; (ii) rehabilitating and upgrading about 130 km of dikes
along both sides of the Sistan River, including river training works, the
provision of a bridge across the river and miscellaneous works; (iii)
upgrading abo,a 30 km of dikes along the Niatak floodway, including the
provision of six bridges and intake structures; (iv) remodelling the feeder
canal to three existing storage reservoirs (at Chahnime depression); (v)
developing a rock quarry for rip-rap material; (vi) strengthening project
management and support, including the maintenance unit; (vii) undertaking
physical and mathematical modelling works for river training and operation a-ad
maintenance; (viii) providing maintenance equipment and vehicles, a
maintenance workshop and laboratory for testing materials; (ix) providing a
program for flood warning and emergency response and for resource management
to address environmental, cultural property ano social concerns in the project
area; and (x) acquiring land for reconstruction of dikes.
24.   Project Cost and Financing.  The pxoject has been estimated to cost
about US$100 million equivalent, of which about US$57.0 millicn equivalent or
about 57 percent, correspond to the foreign cost. Project financing will
consist of a Government contribution of US$43.0 million equivalent for the
local cost plus a Bank loan in the amount of US$57.0 million for the foreign
cost (Schedule A). Procurement and disbursement arrangements are provided in
Schedule B.
25. Project Management and ImnIementation. The Government of Iran (GOI),
represented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (MEF), will be the
borrower, and the Ninistry of Energy (MOE) and its autonomous organization the
Sistan Baluchistan Regional Water Board (SBRWB) will be the beneficiaries.
The SBRWB will be the implementing agency. SBRWB is responsible for water
resources management and development in the Sistan Baluchistan Province. In
the Sistan area, SBRWB is responsible for the supply of potable water,
irrigation and drainage, and the provision and maintenance of flood control
works. Project management will be coordinated by the MEF at the central level
but carried out by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the SBRWB located
in Zahedan at headquarters supported by field staff in the project area.
Provisions have been made for technical assistance under the project to
strengthen the capacity of the PIU to ensure timely project implementation.
The PIU will also coordinate the project components which will be implemented
with the collaboration of the Department of Environment, the Cultural Heritage
Organization and the Sistan Development Organization. Project preparation is
well advanced and the first group of tenders will be announced in July 1992.
The project will be implemented over a period of six years. The timetable of
key processing events is given in Schedule C and the statu3 of Bank Group
operations in Iran is given in Schedule D. Maps (IBRD 23589 and 23590) and
tlhe Staff Appraisal Report No. 10467-IRN dated May 5, 1992, are also attached.

26.  Proi6gt Sustainaility. The project has been designed to withstand
floods with 1:100 years frequency, a condition which exceeds the highest
recorded flood event. However, to protect the lives of people in the flood-
prone area against unpredictable flood events, the project includes a flood
warning and emergency response program. Also, to safeguard the project area
against further environmental degradation caused by ad hoc development, a
resources management program will identify mitigative measures for
implementation during project execution and under future development programs
for the area.
27.  Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Government of Iran (GOI) is
undertaking a major economic restructuring and reconstruction program in an
effort to correct economic distortions and to restore and upgrade the
infrastructure neglected during the eight-year war with Iraq (paras. 4 and 7),
which were further aggravated by natural disasters (earthquakes and floods).
In addition to foreign currency shortages to cover the financial needs of this
ambitious program (para. 17), there is also an urgent need to introduce sound
technical, economic and environmental criteria in the planning, analysis,
design and implementation of projects for which the GOI has sought Bank
assistance. Bank experience in reconstruction projects after major natural
disasters is also expected to be beneficial to Iran. Finally, the magnitude
of investments in the reconstruction program will require the opening of doors
to the international construction industry, for which Bank experience in
international procurement would be of paramount importance. The GOI has,
therefore, requested Bank assistance for this project as a part of its FFYP
and has expressed particular interest in the Bank's experience in sactoral
approaches to development planning and in the management of risks posed by
natural hazards. Given the long hiatus in lending to Iran (para. 15), and
considering the emergency nature of the proposed project, it will give the
Bank an opportunity to be responsive to government needs while simultaneously
undertaking sector work to develop a lending strategy that will emphasize
issues related to policy, institutional and human resources development,
environmental plamning and management, as well as remove infrastructure
constraints to sustainable economic development in an economically depressed
area of the country (para. 18).
28.  Agreed Actions. Agreement was reached on required technical assistance
and training to strengthen the absorptive capacity of the implementing agency
for planning and design, construction management and maintenance, as well as
the technical assistance needed to help develop and implement a flood warning
and emergency response program to ensure the safety of people in the project
area. Agreement was also reached on a resources management program for
strengthening both a newly established agency for development planning and
resource management and the local offices of the Department of Environment and
the Cultural Heritage Organization.
29.   Envronmental and Social Asgects. On the expectation that negative
environmental impacts from the project would be limited in extent and amenable
to mitigation, the proposed project was classified under environmental
Category B at the Initial Executive Project Summary (IEPS) stage. An
environmental analysis carried out by consultants and rt tewed by the Bank
concluded that the proposed project will have a positive impact on both the
natural environment and the cultural heritage in the p  l!t area by offering



-7-
protection from widespread flood damage. This artalysis also identified
environmental degradation already taking place in the project area due to ad
hoc development not related to the proposed project. To address these
concerns, the project will provide mitigative measures under a Resources
Management Program (RMP). This program will address increasing water logging,
soil salinity and alkalinity, water pollution in ths vicinity of larger towns,
and the weed infestation of irrigation and drainage canals. The RMP has been
agreed to by the GOI. The project will require the relocation of about 15
families in 5 different areas; these families will be moved to plazes in the
same project area which already have adequate infrastructure. The GOI will
compensate affected families based on legislation which provides for purchase
at market value and additional compensation in kind for hardship. These
arrangements are satisfactory to the Bank. The project will complement the
001 program to improve the quality of life of the local population, about 90
percent of whom live below the poverty threshold.
30.   Benefits.  The project will yield economic and social benefits
associated with the avoidance of flood damage. It will contribute to poverty
alleviation of minority groups (para. 19). The economic rate of return (ERR)
of the project based on the economy-wide shadow exchange rate (Rls 920 per US
Dollar), has been estimated at about 15 percent, excluding such benefits as
reducing the risk to human life, improving the health of the population,
protecting atchaeological sites, and preserving wetlands and land-based
habitats, which cannot be quantified. Tangible economic benefits are those
related to averting losses of economic assets such as infrastructure, public
and private property, and agricultural products and livestock. Due to the
harsh natural and environmental conditions in the project area, such as the
high evaporation rate (2,000 mm/year), strong sustained winds up to 70 mph
(120 days winds) and fine grain soil (clay, silt and loam) deposited over the
plain by sediment-laden flood waters, not implementing the project could
rapidly turn the Sistan area into a desert.
31. Risks. Two types of project risks are foreseen: first, those associated
with the limited experience of SBRWB with project management and its lack of
knowledge of Bank guidelines and regulations, particularly those related to
procurement; and, second, risks associated with the normal construction of
works of this nature, particularly regarding construction taking place during
the flood season. To address the first concern, provisions have been made to
provide expatriate consultants familiar with Bank guidelines, and measures
*       will be taken to provide Bank seminars on procurement, disbursements and modus
operandi; close Bank supervision will also be provided during implementation.
To address the second concern, measures have been taken to ensure a sound
project design and construction methods that will protect the safety of
workers, equipment, structures and work in progress at all times. Risks
associated with floods which could exceed the design capacity are being
addressed through a flood warning and emergency response program.
