ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
SISTAN RIVER FLOOD WORKS REHABILITATION
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Generail
1.01        The Islamic Republic of Iran has an area of 1.6 million square
kilometers (ki2). Administratively, the country is divided into 24 provinces.
Iran's population is about 57 million and growing at an annual rate of 3.2
percent. It is a middle-income oil exporting country with an estimated Gross
National Product (GNP) per capita equivalent to US$2,450 (1990).Y
1.02        Iran's economic performance during the last decade was mixed, with
growth at around 8 percent per annum in the first half of the decade followed
by a distinct slowdown .1s a result of the virtual collapse of oil prices, and
severe damage to oil production and export facilities during the war with
Iraq. Before the decade closed, Iran began liberalizing the economy, thus
laying the basis for an impressive economic recovery now taking place.
1.03        Since 1988/89, GDP growth has picked up and has been strong: 4
percent in 1989 and an estimated 10 percent in 1990. At the same time the
economy has stabilized considerably, helped in 1990 partly by the fortuitous
increase in oil prices. The government deficit came down from about 9 percent
of GDP in 1988, to 4 percent in 1989, and an estimated 2 percent in 1990. As
a result of lower deficits, the growth of net credit to Government and,
correspondingly, that of broad money declined between 1988 and 1990, helping
to lower inflation from 29 percent in 1988, to 17 percent in 1989, and around
10 percent in 1990.
1.04        The project area is located in the Sistan River floodplain, in the
Sistan Baluchistan province on the south-eastern side of the country, which is
a part of the Hirmand River delta system covering the low land drainage area
straddling the border with Afghanistan (See Map 23590). The benefitted
population of about 331,000 reside mostly in villages. Zabol, the only '.rban
center, has a population of about 76,000 (para. 2.13). Host of the
inhabitants are Sistanis and Baluchis, minority groups who have inhabited the
area on both sides of the Afghan-Iranian border for centuries. The main crops
consist of wheat, barley, fodder, sorghum, cotton, fruits and vegetables.
Farming and livestock breeding are the main economic activities, complemetnted
by rural industries such as rug and carpet weaving. Secondary industries
include food products, handmade textiles and basket weaving located mostly in
Zabol. Per capita income (1990)1' from farming averaged about Rls 15,360
(about US$50) and that from services and industry averaged about Rls 130,372
(US$425), which are substantially lower than the national average (para.
1.01).
Rural Flood Damage Mitigation
1.05        The Ministry of Energy (MOE), through its Regional Water Boards
(RWBs), is responsible for the provision of flood protection works nationwide.
The RWBs are also responsible for the provision of all primary and secondary
L/    Based on a trade-weighted exchange rate of Rls 307/US$.



-2-
irrigation and d-ainage systems, except for services at the farm level, which
are the responsibility of the Mini cry of Agriculture (MOA). Generally,
engineering design and ca.s- uction supervision are carried out by consultants
retained by the RWBs, etad tth,ir work is supervisad by a consulting engineering
firm affiliated with the MOE.  The Water Research Certer (WRC), a semi-
autonomous enterprise also cfiliated with the MOE, provides technical support
through task-specific contra,_s for studies and research in the fields of
hydro'.ogy, hydraulics and sedimentation.
1.06        In the Sistan-Hirmand river delta area, flood protection is
managed by a subregional organizatior. called "Amur-e-Ab", based at Zabol, the
district center. This district organization is under the jurisdiction of the
"Sirtan-Baluchistan Regional Water Board (SBRWB)," which has its headquarters
in ..ahedan, the provincial capital.
Goe.   c Strategy
1.07        The Sistan re-ion is characterized by a very fragile environment
and lww agricultu.iral nroductivity; it is inhabited by minority groups living
below the pover_y thi shold.  Since the revolution, one of the fundamental
policies of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (GOI) has been to
provide assistarce to underprivileged populations throughout the country. As
part of this policy, 't-. GOI provides basic infrastructure and development
support in the economi ally depressed areas of the country to ensure long-term
economic gains for susLainable development, and to raise the levels of income
of the people living in these areas above the poverty threshold.
1.08        To this effect, the GOI has undertaken a development program in
the Sistan region over the last 15 years, consisting of basic infrastructure
(roads, communications, schools, an agricultural college, hospitals,
irrigation and drainage systems), agricultural extension services, and flood
damage mitigation facilities (dikes and ancillary structures). However, the
flood protection facilities have proven to bo of inadequate capacity because
the designs were based on limited hydrological and hydraulic data, and
barrages built restricted the hydraulic capacity of the river system. The
GOI, in view of the disastrous flood events that occurred in the first quarter
of 1991, has broadened its strategy to ensure the long-term development of the
area. The sl:rategy .s being implemented in two stages: first, undertaking
eme-gency rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure for the protection of the
af   ted population prior to the 1992 flood season; and second, undertaking a
program of major rehabilitation and upgrading of flood works designed to
ensure protection against the highest recorded flood event in recent history.
To coordinate implementation of the long-term strategy, an inter-sectoral
coordinating agency, the Sistan Development Organization, was recently
established to coordinate, to the extent possible, the development plans and
activities of the various ministries active in the area.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.09        The GOI is undertaking a major economic restructuring and
reconstruction program in an effort to correct economic distortions and to
restore and upgrade the infrastructure neglected during the eight-year war
with Iraq and further aggravated by natural disasters (earthquakes and



- 3-
floods). In addition to the foreign currency requirements of this ambitiou.s
program, there is also an urgent need to introduce sound technical, economic
and environmental criteria in the planning, analysis, design and
implementation of projects. Finally, the magnitude of investments in the
reconstruction program will require the opening of doors to the international
construction industry.
1.10        The GOI has given the proposed project a high priority because it
will protect the lives and property of the population, and will permit
undertaking economic development programs to improve the quality of life of
one of the poorest regions in the country. The proposed project is included
in the First Five-Year Plan (FFYP: 1989/90-1993/94).   The GOI, in addition to
seeking Bank financial assistance for this project, has expressed particular
interest in the Bank's experience in a sectoral approach to development
planning, in the management of risk mitigation posed by natural hazards and in
the ma,iagement of poverty reduction.
1.11        Bank experience in providing member countries assistance in the
reconstruction ok fundamental infrastructure seriously affected by natural
disasters, particularly those that have caused significant disruptions to a
region's economy, in development planning and implementation, and in
international procurement will be beneficial to Iran. Bank experience in
economic recovery operations will be used in this particular project to
introduce economic, social and environmental criteria as a fundamental tool to
determine the optimal size and mitigative measures of proposed investments,
and to introduce preventive measures through proper planning and through
effective emergency response. The proposed project will provide for a flood
warning and emergency response program, a project implementation and
environmental quality monitoring program and a resource management program to
ensure the safety of people and the sustainable economic development of the
Sistan region. Given the long hiatus in lending to Iran, and considering the
emergency nature of the proposed project and its almost issues-free condition,
the proposed operation will give the Bank an opportunity to be responsive to
government needs while simultaneously deepening its knowledge through sector
work. The Bank lending strategy will address issues related to development
policy, institutional and human resources development, environmental planning
and management, as well as reduce infrastructure constraints to sustainable
economic development in an economically depressed area of the country. The
proposed project will contribute to the reduction of poverty in the project
area.

II. THE PRQJECT ARE
General
2.01        The Sistan plain comprises an area of some 250,000 hectares (ha),
of which about 160,000 ha is arable. Range lands in and around the project
area amount to about 525,000 ha, out of which about 95,000 ha are located
along the fringes of the Hamuns lakes during the dry season (para 2.04). The
Sistan Plain is bounded on the east by the Common Parian River, which forms a
long section of the border between Iran and Afghanistan; in the north and the
west by the Sistan Sink, which includes the Puzak, the Saburi and the Hirmand
Hamuns an-i in the south, by high terraces and the Chahnime depressions.
Zabol, the only urban center, is about 205 km frcn Zahedan (the provincial
capital) and 600 km from the Gulf of Oman. It is connected by a two-lane
asphalt road to Zahedan, Chabahar and Bandar-e-Abbas ports in th- south and to
Mashhad in the north.
Physical Setting
2.02        Hydrographic Features. Floods in the Sistan delta and around the
sink are caused by the Hirmand River (called Helmand in Afghanistan). The
Hirmand begins in the recesses of the Hindu-Kush mountains near Kabul and
extends about 1,000 km in Afghanistan. It collects the waters from a vast
basin with a surface area estimated at about 275,000 km2- Most of the
drainage area lies in Afghanistan, and a small part in Pakistan. The Sistan
sink, however, also receives waters collected from a watershed of about 36,000
km; in Iran.
2.03        The Hirmand branches into the Sistan and Parian rivers at the
international border (Hirmand fork). The former runs westward across Iranian
territory for 60 km until it flows into the Hamun-e-Hirmand (Lake Hirmand).
The latter flows northward and empties into the Hamun-e-Puzak which straddles
across the iranian-Afghan border. The changes in the course of the delta
rivers are cunfirmed by abandoned channels such as the Taheri and Shahr which
once formed arms of the Sistan Ri'   system.  Similarly, the Niatak and the
Maleki rivers once branched out *  a the Parian River and traversed the
eastern part of the delta.
2.04        In flood years, the water spills from one hamun to the others,
turning a series of hamuns or swamps into one colossal lake with a maximum
water surface area of about 5,000 km2 at an average water elevation of about
477 meters (m) above mean sea level (a.m.s.l). This area is reduced to about
600 km2 in the low-water period when the lake splits into several parts,
leaving large stretches of natural pasture (para. 2.01). The lake waters are
quite shallow, the average depth being 2 m to 3 m, reaching 5 m in deeper
areas during the flood season. The importance of the Hamun-e-Hirmand lies in
the fact that it is the only perennial fresh water lake in the region. The
lake's inflow is mainly comprised of the waters from the Hirmand River and
minor contributions from streams on the northern side of the lake in Afghan
torritory, as well as those reaching the lake from the west in Iran.



-5-
2.05        There is no outflow from the lake in normal flood years because of
the lack of a natural outlet and the impermeable nature of its bed. The only
significant loss is through evaporation. In ex^eptionally high flood years,
the water spills from the south into the Shile emissary, which carries
overflow water into the saline swamps of the Goud-e-Zirre depreslion in
Afghanistan near the Iranian border. The Shile River is about 100 km long,
with slightly more than half its length. located in Iranian ter-ttory. For
most of the course, the dry river bed is sunk well below grouno levei, with an
average depth of 8 m to 9 m and a width of 200 m.
2.06        The hydrographic system of the project area .,-- des the three
interconnected water storage reservoirs formed by utilizing th  natural
Chahnime depressions, with a combined surface area of about 36 kr2, at a
maximum water elevation of 492 meters a.m.s.l. The combined total and
effective capacity of the three reservoirs is estimated at about 700 million
cubic meters (MCM). These reservoirs are supplied by a feeder canal with a
capacity of 160 m3/sec located about 0.5 km downstream from the beginning of
the Sistan River (Hirmand Fork) at the border with Afghanistan. The
reservoirs supply water to the irrigation system to their north.
2.07          ysiogxapby.  The Sistan delta uplands are oriented to tbe
southeast and vary in elevation from 500 to 480 meters a.m.s.l. The slope of
the plain is somaewhat steeper near the apex of the delta and tends to become
gentler towards the lake. The average gradient is about 40 centimeters/km.
The plain is cut through in many places by what are evidently old river beds.
In some cases, human activity in the form of canals and embankments (some
later destroyed) have created numerous irregularities in ti surface of the
plain. The lowest lying areas are found at Chahnime (469 mbters a.m.s.l.) and
at nearby points, down to a minimum of 459 meters a.m.s.l.
2.08        Climat.  The project area has a continental arid type of climate
with a hot summer and a fairly cold winter.  The mean monthly temperature
ranges between 310C in summer to 10°C in winter, with maximum temperatures
reaching as high as 47°C and minin m temperatures going as low as -6°C.
Average annual rainfall and pan evaporation amount to about 52 and 4,800
-millimeters, respectively. The relative humidity is rather low. The most
unfavorable climatic factor specific to the area is the wind, which is
intermittent in winter and -ost constant in summer.  The hot blustery winds
called "120 days winds" fr - the north or northwest blow from April to August
at velocities of 10 to 20 m/sec.
2.09        Sistgn River.  The economy of the project area depends primarily
on the utilization of the water resources of the Sistan River. The area
crossed by the river is the most populated farming area of the delta region.
In order to maintain the present level of economic activity and to preserve
the environment of the area, protection from the flood hazard inherent in the
river flow regime is essential. The main characteristic of the regime is the
large annual deviation of the runoff pattern--i.e., 77 percent of annual total
runoff flows dur'.ng the flood season from February to June, and on'y 23
percent flows during summer to autumn, or the dry season. There is also a
remarkable difference in the annual total runoff from year to year, with a
maximum of 8,300 MCM and a minimum of 980 MCM.  It should be pointed out,



-6
however, that the low flows are greatly determined by water storage reservoirs
in Afghanistan, which capture a sizable portion of the fiow for irrigation.
2.10        The total length of the Sistan River is about 60 km, over which
its altituds drops from around 490 meters a.m.s.l. at the mouth to
approximately 474 meters a.m.s.l. at the Hamun. The river passes through the
terrace portion of the plain ln the upper reaches in a relatively well-defined
channe; with n average slope of 1:2,500. In the middle reaches of the course
it meanders, due to a lesser slope of about i:5,000. The width of the river
ranges from 70 to 400 m. Towards the mouth, the river splits into the
Afzalabad and Adimi branches, flowing, respectively, westward and northward
around Lorghbagh Island near the river mouth at the Hamun-e-Hirmand.
2.11        The 001 has constructed three barrages on the Sistan River to
develop irrigated agriculture. The first, the Kohak barrage, Ls situated
about 2 km below the border; the second, the Zahak barrage is 15 km downstream
from the first; and the third, the Sistan barrage is 17 km further downstream
from the second.  Ti-e Kohak barrage is currently being reconstructed because
the river bypassed the structure during the 1991 flood by breaching its east
flank.
2.12        IXrigation Systeo.  The irrigation system in the project area
consists of two groups, namely, the Shib Ab and Posht Ab districts. They are
supplied with irrigation water from the Sistan River through main canals,
located on both banks branching off in front of the Zahak and Sistan barrages.
The present irrigable land in the two districts is about 123,400 ha, and
planning is underway to increase it by 10,000 ha.
Social and Environmental Aspects
2.13        The total flood plain area has a population estimD -ed at about
331,000 in 1990, increasing at an estimated annual rate of aboAt 3.8 percent.
About 77 percent of the population is rural, living in 846 villages ranging in
size from 200 to 10,000 inhabitants; the remaining 23 percent, about 76,000
people, live in Zabol, which is the administrative and commercial center of
the area. Houses in the villages are typically built of clay and are
generally owner-built and occupied. These types of houses are particularly
vulnerable to floods, and the resulting damage is often irreparable.
2.14        Farming and stock-rearing are the principal economic activities.
Stock-rearing constitutes the traditional pursuit of nomad families, although
many of these have become partially sedentary and practice irrigated
agriculture along with livestock breeding. The average size of holding per
agricultural family is about 4.1 ha. Irrigated agriculture has expanded since
1954 due to the initiative of the GOI in providing the necessary irrigation
infrastructure. Nevertheless, the living standard of farmers is very low due
to a combination of adverse physical conditions (including poor soil
conditions, winds, low rainfall and a high rate of evapotranspiration) and to
the poor management of water and soil resources. The full GOI development
program for the region includes improved farming and land management
techniques, as well as the irrigation schemes described above (para. 2.12) and
the flood control works to be provided under the project (para. 3.04).



. 7 -
2.15        There are 526 small industries, which employ about 2,200 persons.
Rug and carpet-making is the principal rural industry, employing about 2,000
persons; other secondary rural industries include food products, handmade
textiles and basket weaving.
2.16        Zabol and about 76 percent of the villages are provided with piped
watez from rivers and canals; the remaining villages rely on shallow wells.
Water quality, however, is below World Health Organization standards. Public
sanitation is nonexistent, and only about 2 percent of the villages are
provided with public baths.
2.17        The region's ecology is characterized by a very harsh and fragile
environment with flora conslsting predominantly of xerophyte (adaptable to dry
and hot climate) end halophyte (adaptable to saline soils) vegetation. There
are about 14 plant types with many introduced weeds and crops. The fauna
population is very rich and includes many threatened and vulnerable species,
particularly those of the avian family. The wetland of the Hamuns is a
sensitive habitat of international importance for migratory birds, among which
there are several rare and susceptible species. The environmencal equilibrium
is disruptee by periods of drought and floods. Environmental management is
the responsibility of the Department of Environment through its regional
office in Zahedan and a local office in Zabol. Its mandate is provided uvnder
the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act of 1974.
2.18        The Sistan region is also rich in cultural heritage.
Archaeological remains date as far back as 3,200 B.C. (Shahr-e-Soukhte).
Cemeteries that contain bones and artifacts are still intact. The area is
considered of importance to archaaologists.
Existing Protection Against Floods
2.19        The protection of flood-prone areas in the Sistan plain consists
of earth dikes (levees) along both the Sistan River course (about 120 km in
total) and the lake shore (about 110 km). There is an almost continuous
series of main dikes along the Sistan River downstream of the Zahak barrage
and, in some sections, across saddles in the upper reaches. The height of the
dikes ranges from 3 to 6 meters, with a variable width at the top of between 4
and 6 meters. In some cases where the mair. dikes have been attacked by river
erosion, short reaches of secondary dikes have also been built. Structural
protection measures, such as the provision of riprap or gabions, have not beeu
used in the construction of existing dikes.
2.20        The dikes along the Sistan River were neither properly planned nor
designed to withstand recurrlng floods of the magnitude experienced in 1991.
In many sections the dikes are not located at a sufficient distance from the
normal river channel to provide an adequate waterway for the passage of flood
discharges without causing restriction and excessive velocities. The main
river channel, in many places, is either hugging or approaching the dike toe.
Furthermore the changes in the river regil. levels were not taken into account
in the planning and maintenance of existing dikes, and, as a result, no
adequate freeboard has been provided. River bed degradation is occurring to a
measurable extent on the Sistan River. For these reasons, the dikes along the
river failed in various sections during the 1991 flood (para. 2.22), due to



- 8 -
overtopping and/or breaching, resulting in flooding if large areas (para.
2.26). The dike along the lake shore did not fail but was seriously damaged
by wave action throughout its length.
Major Flood Events
2.21        Floods in the Sistan Plain are caused by spillage from the river
during high flows generated in the upper catchments of the Hirmand River,
located entirely in Afghanistan, and by heavy rainfall and snow-melt, which is
aggravated by steep gradients, impermeable soils and limited valley storage.
The causes and severity of floods in the Hirmand and its main tributary, the
Arghandab, are peculiar to the river system. In high flow years, flooding
also results along the lake shore and as far inland as the towr. of Zabol.
2.22        Floods that have caused extensive damage occurred in 1957, 1982
and 1991. The 1957 flood reached a peak of 1,640 m3/sec, according to the
measurements of SBRWB. Flood waters inundated a total area of about 23,000 ha
and completely paralyzed the irrigation system of Kokak and Zahak barrages.
The 1982 floods were relatively less severe and caused inundation of only
about 7,500 ha of agricultural land. In 1991, however, the Sistan River
received high flows for almost three months, including the record flow of
2,300 m3/sec (in February), followed by two more peaks within a period of six
weeks, each of about 900 m3/sec. This flood event caused the worse
devastation in the region recorded in recent history; large areas were flooded
causing heavy damage to public and private proper<.y and infrastructure. The
situation was aggravated by flooding from the lake due to high water level and
*strong northwesterly winds (>100 km/hr.). Floods of relatively less magnitude
and adverse impact were recorded in 1989 and 1990, with peak flows of about
1,300 and 1,200 m3/sec, respectively.
HydrologX and Hydraulic Characteristics
2.23        Since Iran has no access to data on the flood-generating
catchments of the Hirmand River located in Afghanistan, the hydrologic data
used in this study include actual Sistan River flow records measured in Iran
for a period of 41 years (1943, 1948-52 and 1957-91). Also, Hirmand River
flow records for a period of 31 years (1891-1921 excluding 1904) from
concurrent data of two stations located at Chahar Borjak (some 80 km upstream
of the political border) and Payab Sad-e-Kohak (near the border) were
correlated with the Sistan River data by synthesizing annual peak discharges.
The sample population of annual peak flood flows was screened by tests of the
fundamental assumptions governing normality, the most notable exclusion being
the 1885 super flood called Sal Noh-e-Kalan," treating it as an *outlier
problem." It reportedly peaked to more than 16,000 m3/sec at Qale Bist, some
400 km upstream of the border, and might have produced a peak flow of about
6,000 m3/sec at the head of the Sistan River.
2.24        The frequency analysis was carried out by the use of the annual
peak flows for both the time series 1950-91 and 1891-1991. The analysis
basically involved the application of Gumbel distribution and W.ibull's
plotting position formula, although the Log/Pearson III (usually used in USA)
and GEV distributions were also tested. However, it was not considered
logical to determin floods of different return periods by including the



-9-
Hirmand River data because of the unknown source and lack of knowledge about
the methodology of measurements and approach adopted for converting the Chahar
Burjak peaks to that at the head of the Sistan River. The data of 1943, 1948
and 1949 were also excluded because the remaining data of 1950-91 formed a
relatively more homogeneous time series for analysis, as all the figures
correspond to post-completion of the Kajaki dam in Afghanistan.  According to
the other two distributions, the best estimate for the 100 years lies between
2,600 m3/sec and 3,000 m3/sec.  The selected design flood is only abc_. 2,535
m3/sec with a return period of 1:100 years using post-1950 data: this is
approximately 10 percent greater than the flood peak experienced in 1991.  In
view of the lack of sufficient hydrological information on the future regime
of the Hirmand River and the local factors determining the natural division of
the water between the Parian and the Sistan Rivers, the future possibility of
peak flows in the Sistan slightly higher than the one recorded in 1991 cannot
reasonably be excluded. The results of frequency analysis using Gumbel
distribution are given in Table 2.1 below:

2.25        Keeping in view the design flow of 2,535 m3/s and the present safe
discharging capacity of structures across the Sistan River and river reach, as
well as the Niatak floodway already constructed, three alternative schemes for
flood protection were considered. These alternatives are discussed in
Annex 1. The selected alternative offers the least-cost option for the flood
control of the Sistan River and was used as the basis for the economic
analysis and environmental assessment. This alternative consists of:
diverting 435 m3/s to the Chahnime reservoirs, thus routing the balance 2,100
m3/s in the Sistan River up to the Niatak floodway offtake; diverting 600 m3/s
through the Niatak floodway; routing the remaining 1,500 m3/s through the
Sistan River, as such a flow rate is within the hydraulic capacity of the
existing Sistan and Zahak barrages; and routing 1,500 m3/s through the
Afzalabad (1,000 m3/s) and the Adimt (500 m3/s) branches, which terminate in
Lake Hirmand.

Flood Im&act
2.26        Flood damages include direct losses from river spill to standing
crops, livestock, irrlgation facilities, roads and other infrastructure, and
private and public property damage in villages and Zabol. Other losses arise
from delays in sowing crops and disruption in transport and communications,
from disruptions in economic activities in the service and trade sectors, and
from the considerable time and expense involved in relief and rehabilitation
work. The maximum areas inundated by high floods of the Sistan River were
about 23,000 ha in 1957 and 80,000 ha in 1991. A complete inventory of flood
losses is not available, but some data on direct losses supplied by the
governorate office are shown in Table 2.2 below.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Oxijin
3.01        The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (MEF) first requested
Bank assistance for the proposed project of a World Bank mission supervising
the Earthquake Recovery Project (Loan 3301-IRN) in May 1991. An
identification mission visited the project area in August 1991, and met with
the implementing agency and its consultants.
3.02        During the mission, agreement was reached on the composition of
the project and an action plan for project preparation. Subsequently, two
preparation missions visited Iran in October 1991 and January 1992.
Proiect Objectives
3.03        The key project objectives are: (a) reduce the risks to human life
and prevent damage to public and private property and infrastructure due to
major floods; (b) minimize disruptions to the local economy; (c) provide
protection against major floods for habitats and cultural property; and (d)
mitigate environmental degradation and health hazards caused by floods and by
ad hoe development in the project area.
Proiect Description
3.04        The proposed project consists of: (a) rehabilitating, upgrading
and relocating essential flood control works along the Sistan River and Lake
Hirmand, and developing a rock quarry for the supply of riprap material; (b)
providing training works in the Sistan River; (c) providing a program for
early flood warning and emergency evacuation, and for monitoring the
performance of flood works and river regime, which would provide protection to
the Sistan River flood plain; (d) providing a resource management program for
the sustainable development of local resources and the prevention of
environmental degradation and social distress; (e) providing maintenance
equipment, technical assistance and training for better management of flood
control works; and (f) acquiring land for rehabilitating flood control works.
The Droject location and site specific works are shown in maps IBRD No. 23589
and IBRD No. 23590.   A detailed description of the proposed flood protection
program in the Sistan River flood plain, the early flood warning and emergency
response and evacuation program, and the resource management program are given
in Annexes 1, 10 and 13, respectively. Main components and key elements
supporting the proposed program are given below:
(a)   procurement of civil works for: upgrading the Sistan River 130 km
flood protection dikes and providing training works; upgrading the
42 km Niatak River with the exception of the first 12 km reach of
Niatak floodway built with government funds; improving the
capacity of the existing 3.8 km feeder channel to the Chahnime
reservoirs; rehabilitating and upgrading of dikes approximately
100 km along the southern shore of Lake Hirmand; providing and
upgrading about seven bridges; and developing a rock quarry for
the supply of riprap material;



- 12 -
(b)   acquisition of land for rehabilitating flood control works;
(c)   procurement of equipment for: maintaining the Sistan River, Niatak
River and floodway, and Lake Hirmsnd flood protection works;
improving the central workshop located at Zabol; setting up a
construction quality control laboratory; and establishing
facilities for recording river flow and stage, as well as
procuring vehicles and spare parts for new and existing equipment;
(d)   provision of institutional strengthening of SBRWB and its sub-
regional office in Zabol, consisting of: (i) proper staffing and
facilities for both the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which
will ha responsible for construction management, monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) activities, as well as the special unit dedicated
to the maintenance and repair of flood protection works in the
project area, and (ii) expatriate experts for the provision of
technical services and training, both on-the-job and abroad;
(e)   provision of physical and mathematical modelling of the Sistan
River for optimizing design and maintenance of flood control and
training works;
(f)   provision of tecbnical assistance foi institutional strengthening
of the Sistan Development Organization and of the local offices of
the Department of the Environment and the Cultural Heritage
Organization. This assistance will be carried out as part of the
programs for flood warning and flood emergency response (Annex
10), and for area-wide resource management (Annex 13). The latter
program will address aspects associated with: the conservation of
wetlands (Lake Hirmand) and habitats of plants and animals and of
cultural property, the protection of partiaularly fragile land
resources, and the sustainable development of the region.
Status of Prolect PreDaration
3.05        Project preparation has been carried out by local consulting
engineers assisted by expatriate experts. During the course of project
preparation, several alternatives were considered, and those selected
represent the least-cost solution. Detailed design and tender documents are
well advanced, and most contract packages for the initial two years are
expected to be completed by July 1992.
Project Cost and Financing
3.06        The total project cost is estimated at about Rls 139.7 billion
(US$100.0 million equivalent), of which about Rls 79.2 billion (US$57 million
equivalent) or about 57 percent will be foreign costs. Investments will be
free of duties and taxes under the prevailing government rules. Project
costs, detailed in Annex 2, are summarized by major component in Table 3.1
below:

3.07        The cost estimates for the civil works are based on preliminary
bill of quantities; February 1992 prices for labor and materials; and an
analysis of unit costs of major items of work carried out by the project
consultants, supplemented by bid prices for contracts awarded recently by the
implementing agency for similar works in the project area; Bank preparation
mission estimates; and local costs (in rials) calculated independently from
foreign costs (in US$ equivalent). Cost estimates for equipment are based on
unit prices of similar equipment procured recently in Iran and on price
quotations requested from suppliers. Allowances for physical contingencies
have been provided as follows: 10 percent of the base cost for all civil works
and land acquisition and 5 percent for all other project components. Price
contingencies have been calculated on the basis of a 3.7 percent annual
increase from 1992 to 1998 for the foreign cost; and local costs have been
assumed to increase at a rate of 12 percent in 1992, 10 percent in 1993, and 8
percent thereafter through 1998 when the project is scheduled to be completed
(purchasing power parity is assumed). Total costs (in equivalent currencies)
were calculated by converting foreign costs (estimated in US Dollar
equivalent) into Rls equivalent and by converting local costs estimated in Rls
into US Dollars equivalent by using the "floating exchange rate," which is the
prevailing rate at which civil works are priced to reflect the real cost in
the local market.
3.08        The financing plan consists of a GOI contribution of Rls 60.5
billion (US$43.0 million equivalent) to cover the entire local cost, plus a
Bank loan of US$57 million, corresponding to 100 percent of the foreign
exchange requirements.
procurement
3.09        Procurement will be carried out following International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures with prequalification of bidders for
major civil works, in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. Local



- 14 -
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures will be used for civil works coptracts
below US$2.0 million equivalent. The local procedures have been reviewed and
are acceptable to the Bank. Goods above a value of US$500,000 equivalent per
contract will be procured according to ICB guidelines of the Bank. A limited
amount of goods procurement will be done using international shopping and
direct contracting procedures. Procurement arrangements are summarized in
Table 3.2 below:

1/    Figures in parenthesis are the amounts to be financed under the Bank
loan. Total project cost excludes procurement of land. Other
procurement methods include procurement of consultants.
3.10        The civil works for the Sistan River and Lake Hirmand dikes will
be grouped into contract packages, which represent about 73 percent of the
total civil works, and will be suitable for procurement under ICB procedures
with the prequalification of bidders. ICB contracts will be advertised in
groups to enable interested bidders to make offers on a slicing-and-packaging
basis, allowing them to offer discounts should they be awarded more than one
slice of the package.
3.11        Civil work contracts that will be awarded under LCB procedures
include: (i) the Niatak River dikes, which should be completed early in the
project period; (ii) the Chahnime feeder canal; and (ii) the Sistan River
bridge and risk-prone training works, which will be scattered throughout the
river length and carried out in small parcels, depending upon modelling
results progressively made available by the Water Research Center and
consultants. LCB procedures for these contracts will be consistent with the
need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the project. Also, under
these procedures, representatives of foreign contractors will be allowed to
bid, and all bidders will be treated equally in terms of eligibility for
furnishing bids and performance bonds.



- 15 -
3.12        All civil works contracts with construction periods exceeding one
year will be subject to local cost escalation. Documents and awards for all
ICB contracts and the first LCB contract will be subject to prior review by
the Bank. Other 7'"B contracts exceeding US$1.0 million equivalent will be
subjert to post-aw'i&-a reviews. LCB contracts below US$1.0 million per
contract will be subject to selective post-award review. One set of a sample
bidding docvments for LCB procurement will be submitted to the Bank for its
clearance.
3.13        Contracts for the supply of maintenance equipment, laboratory and
miscellaneous st'pplies and spares, workshop machinery and vehicles, to be
grouped into appropriate packages costing more than US$500,000 equivalent will
be procured under ICB procedures. Qualified domestic manufacturers will
receive a 15 percent (or import duty, whichever is lower) preference in the
bid evaluation.   However, contracts costing less than US$500,000 equivalent
per contract, and not more than US$1.0 million equivalent in the aggregate,
will be procured based on comparing at least three price quotations from at
least two countries through International Shopping (IS) procedures acceptable
to the Bank. Procurement of spare parts for existing equipment amounting to
US$0.3 million equivalent, for reasons of standardization and compatibility,
will be done following direct contracting (DC) procedures. Documents and
awards for all ICB and IS contracts exceeding US$250,000 will be subject to
prior review by the Bank.
3.14        Local consultants, assisted by expatriate experts of a foreign
consulting firm, have already been retained by the implementing agency and are
considered competent for carrying out design. During construction, foreign
consultants will be needed to assist the local consultants on the development
of the physical and mathematical modelling of the Sistan River, procurement
and construction management (Annex 11). The foreign consultants will be
recruited in accordance with Bank guidelines. Bank financing will be limited
to the foreign cost of such services, which are estimated at about US$3.9
million equivalent.
3.15        Additional expatriate experts will be needed to complement the
local consulting firm in carrying out the flood warning, emergency response
and evacuation program (Annex 10), as well as the resources management program
(Annex 13). These experts will be recruited in accordance with specific
qualifications to be provided by the implementing agency and approved by the
Bank. These consultants will be recruited in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Bank financing will be limited to the foreign cost of such services, which are
estimated at about US$2.5 million. The qualifications, experience and
contract terms and conditions of local consultants financed by the
implementing agency were reviewed and are acceptable to the Bank. Agreement
was reached during negotiations that SBRWB will retain local and foreign
consultants in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
throughout project execution.
Disbursement
3.16        The proposed Bank loan of US$57 million equivalent will be fully
disbursed in six and one-half years (including six months beyond project
completion) against the categories and at rates summarized in Table 3.3 below:

3.17        Disbursement withdrawal applications will be prepared and
submitted to the Bank by the PIU (paras. 4.08 and 4.09). Disbursements
against all items will be based on full documentation, except for contracts
below US$100,000 equivalent, which will require only statements of
expenditures (SOEs). It is estimated that total procurement under SOEs will
be about US$1.0 million (about 2 percent of the loan amount). Supporting
documents for SOE claims will not be submitted to the Bank but will be
retained by the project implementation agency and made available for
inspection by Bank supervision missions and project auditors.
3.18        A special account may be set up to finance eligible expenditures
under the Bank loan and will follow standard Bank procedures in this regard.
The special account will be channelled through a commercial bank to be
designated by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to which the Bank will make an
initial deposit of up to US$2 million. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that the GOI may. for the 2uroses of the project. open and
maintain in US dollars a spRcial account on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank,
3.19        Also, withdrawals from the proceeds of the loan are expected to be
handled through withdrawal applications or through letters of credit. The Bank
will accept requests for special commitments and withdrawal applications for a
minimum of US$100,000 for direct payment in accordance with the Bank's
disbursement procedures.
3.20        Given the long hiatus in lending to Iran, there is no disbursement
profile for the country. The implementation period for this project is
estimated at six years (July 1992-June 1998) as shown in Annex 4, based on the
duration of contracts and construction methods specified, the spread of the
works involved and the time-cost relationship. It is anticipated that
disbursoments will be completed by December 31, 1998, about six months after
scheduled project completion. A schedule of estimated disbursements is
detailed ln Annex 3 and summarized in Table 3.4 below:

Project SuDervision
3.21        Progress reports will be submitted by the implementing agency
within 30 days after the end of each quarter during each year of project
implementation. They will focus on progress during the reporting period in
the following areas: (a) the performance of surveys and designs for civil
works; (b) the bidding process by contract for the procurement of major items
of civil works and equipment; (c) the physical achievement by contract of
civil works and the delivery of equipment; (d) the status of technical
assistance, required studies and programs; (e) the annual work program and
budgetary requirements for counterpart funds (March report only); (f) the
status of Bank disbursements, including pending withdrawal applications and
projected disbursements for the following six months (December and June
reports only); (g) the status of covenants, accounts and audit and staff
training; and (h) issues raised by Bank supervision missions and their
resolutions. A brief summary will be added of reasons for shortfalls under
any contract and of actions taken to improve progress.
3.22        Normally, two supervision missions per year for six years (three
weeks of Bank staff time each for combined missions) and one supervision in
the last year (four staffweeks) will be required during the implementation
period to oversee the project. The supervision missions will be generally
staffed by an engineer and a financial analyst and consultants, as required to
cover expertise in flood works construction, the mathematical modelling of
river training and environmental areas. In the first three years, the
following will be required: four man-weeks per year of a consultant
specializing in the design, construction and maintenance of flood control
works and in the procurement aspect' of the project; two man-weeks of a
consultant specializing in the mathematical modelling of river training; and
two man-weeks per year of environmental experts (Annex 5). Initially, four
staff-weeks will also be required to familiarize the project staff with the
Bank procurement, accounts and audit and disbursement guidelines. On arrival,
mission briefings will be held first with the MEF, the MOE and, subsequently,
with the chairman, key staff members and project consultants of the
implementing agency (SBRWB). The supervision missions will make field visit-,
as appropriate. Wrap-up meetings will be chaired by a representative of the
MEF and attended by representatives of the MOE and the implementing agency. A
tentative supervision plan is shown in Annex 5, providing for 13 supervision
missions, including a mid-term review. A total of 40 staff-weeks, or about
US$240,000, (based on an average cost of US$6,000 per staff-week per missijm
for combined missions) are estimated for supervision over the life of the
project, including the completion report mission.



- 18 -
3.23        A mid-term review of all project activities will be conducted
jointly by the MEF/SBRWB and the Bank. To facilitate this review, the
MEF/SBRWB will prepare a detailed report covering all aspects of the project
and submit it to the Bank by January 15, 1995 for a joint review by March 15,
1995. The project completion report will be prepared by the implementing
agency with assistance from the project consultants and submitted to the Bank
not later than six months after the loan closing. Agreement was reached
durine negotiations that the imglementing agencies will submit: (a) the
quarterly grogress reports within 30 days of the closing of each quarter: (b)
the detailed progress report for the mid-term review by January 15. 1995: and
(c) the pRoject completion reDort within six months after loan closing.
Monitoring and Evaluation Program
3.24        The project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) program will be
carried out by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which will be
strengthened by staff from the Technical (engineering), Administration/Finance
(accounting and personnel administration) and Monitoring/Studies Departments
of the implementing agency (see paras. 4.08 and 4.09 for details), assisted by
consultants. There will be three subprograms, i.e., the M&E of project
performance, as well as the physical characteristics of the Sistan River, the
Niatak River and floodway and the Chahnime feeder canal; the M&E of flood
warning and emergency response/evacuation; and the M&E of the resources
management program. The reporting requirements for the first are discussed in
paras. 3.25 and 3.26; and the scope of and reporting on the others is given in
Annexes 10 and 13. Progress on these programs will be reviewed by periodic
Bank supervision missions (para. 3.22).
3.25        The M&E staff in the PIU will collect and process data about the
project's physical and financial performance into a form usable by project
management for assessing whether the schedule (Annex 4) and targets set out
for project implementation (Annex 6) are being met. The PIU will also
quantify changes from the appraisal estimates over the life of the project and
recommend changes in project features, when necessary. The head of the PIU
will supervise the M&E work ar.d will establish a system for communicating
results to the Bank, the Chairman of SBRWB, and the concerned sections in the
MOE and MEF.
3.26        The monitoring of the physical characteristics of the Sistan River
by the concerned field units will include: daily and monthly flows,
corresponding water stages and sediment loads and the annual river survey,
including protection dikes and the affected area of the Lake Hirmand following
the flood season. Similar surveys will also be performed of the Niatak River
and floodway after the routing of floods through it during the high flow
period, or once every two years. In addition, all flood protection works will
be inspected by a team of field engineers and the findings and recommendations
presented in an action-oriented report to ensure that preventive measures were
taken. The information received by the M&E staff will be evaluated to
determine river behavior, its impact on river training and flood protection
works, and the condition and safety of dikes along the river, floodway and
lake. An assessment will also be made of costs incurred each year on special
repairs, if any, and routine maintenance. This assessment will be used as a
basis for preparing annual budget demands for these items. Agregment was
reached during negotiations that the SBRWB will undertake a Monitoring &
Evaluation Program as indicAted in garas. 3.24-3.26.

IV. THE BORROWER AND BENEFICIARY
The Borrower
4.01        The borrower will be the GOI represented by the MEF.  GOI will
repay the loan and will transfer the proceeds of the loan to the implementing
agency for an expeditious execution of the project.
The Beneficiary
4.02        The beneficiaries of the proposed loan will be the Ministry of
Energy (MOE) and the Sistan Baluchistan Regional Water Board (SBRWB), which
will also be the implementing agency. The MOE is responsible for the
generation and distribution of electricity and for the management of water
resources throughout the country. Water resources sire managed through 14
regional water boards (RWBs), which are established under the provisions of
the Law for Establishment of State Corporations and G-overnment Enterprises of
the Commerce Code. These Boards enjoy considerable management autouomy.
Although overall management functions are provided at the central level
through a National Assembly of Water Boards, management functions such as
planning, design, construction, monitoring and evaluation and operation are
carried out by the RWBs. The MOE, through these RWBs, is resoonsible for
developing water resources for multi$)'- use such as for potable water, the
irrigation and generation of electr!_'.y, and flood control and drainage.  At
the farm level, however, the pr   --a of irrigation and drainage is the
responsibility of the MOA. Although the country has not yet developed central
sewerage systems, except for a few cities, the management of such services is
the joint responsibility of the MOE and the municipal governments through
recently enacted legislation for creating Regional Water and Sewerage
Companies. An organizational chart of the MOE is shown in Annex 7, Chart A.
The ImRlementing Agency
4.03        The project will be implemented by the SBRWB iAnder the overall
supervision of the MEF. The SBRWB will also be responsible for the operation
and maintenance of the proposed works. It will coordinate the project
components to be carried out with the close cooperation of other government
agencies such as the Department of Environment (DOE), the Cultural Heritage
Organization (CHO), the Sistan Development Organization (SDO) and local
authorities.
Oreanization and Management
4.04        The SBRWB sas established on April 5, 1970 and is administered
under the Articles of Agreement (bylaws) enacted on February 17, 1975 and
amended on June 18, 1985. The SBRWB consists of three legal bodies: a General
Assembly, a Board of Directors headed by a Chairman of the Board, and an
Inspector & Auditor General (IAG). The General Assembly consists of three
members: the Minister of Energy, the Minister of Finance and the head of the
Planning and Budget Organization (PBO).  Normally the ministers and the head
of PBO nominate one of their deputies to serve in the General Assembly. The



- 20 -
Board of Directors consists of a chairman and two members (and alternates) who
are appointed by the Minister of Energy. The IAG is appointed by the General
Assembly and reports directly to it. The Managing Director of the SBRWB is
appointed by the General Assembly and generally is also the Chairman of the
Board. The Chairman/Managing Director enjoys considerable independence for
managing the company within an approved work program and budget. For this
reason, management decisions are expeditious, and actions are taken promptly.
An organizational chart of the SBRWB is shown in Annex 7, Chart B.
4.05        The SBRWB manages its operations through five branch offices,
including the headquarters located in Zahedan, the provincial capital. The
org.'nization of each branch office varies according to the level and
complexity of services provided and is subdivided in urban and rural
departments. The headquarters is organized under five departments as follows:
(i) Admimistration and Finance, which, in addition to personnel and
administration, is also responsible for maintenance shops, stores, buildings,
vehicles and equipment; (ii) Technical, responsible for construction, the
operation and maintenance (O&M) of water development facilities, irrigation
and drainage and flood control works; (iii) Water Management, responsible for
ground water development and permits and the 06M of water supply in urban
areas; (iv) Planning and Budgeting, responsible for project design and
development; and (v) Projects and Studies, responsible for monitoring, data
gathering and analysis, and for preparing feasibility studies.
4.06        The SBRWB employs about 1,630 people, of whom about 940 are
permanent staff and 690 are under fixed-term contracts. The professional
cadre consists of about 60 graduates in geology, economics and finance,
mathematics, chemistry, physics, water resources, agriculture, irrigation,
mechanical engineering, power engineering and construction management; the
remaining staff consists of about 210 with high school diplomas and associate
degrees in technical fields, and 1,360 skilled and unskilled workers.
4.07        The Sistan Branch office, which is located in the project area,
has a main repair facility for heavy equipment and vehicles. A second repair
facility is located at the headquarters in Zahedan to provide support to the
other branch offices.
Project ImDlementation and Management
4.08        At the central level, overall project management will be handled
by the PIU located at headquarters in Zahedan, which will be supported by
field staff in Zabol. In order to provide the requisite expertise in
technical and procurement matters, and to coordinate with the MOE and MEF, a
local consultant complemented by an expatriate consultant, has been appointed
full-time to assist SBRWB staff in Zabol, Zahedan and Tehran. The MEF will
provide support on procurement particularly on matters related to Bank
procurement guidelines.  The MEF will also supervise project implementation
and management to ensure that the project is properly executed. The MEF will
also coordinate the relations with the Bank.
4.09        The PIU in Zahedan, which now is responsible for ongoing emergency
reconstruction, consists of staff from the Technical Department (engineering).
It will be supported by staff from the Administration and Finance Department



- 21 -
(for accounting and personnel administration) and the Monitoring and Studies
Department (for monitoring and evaluation studies), and strengthened by
consultants (for technical aspects and management of international contracts,
Annex 11). The head of the Technical Department will be the PIU chief who
will report to the Chairman/Managing Director of the SBRWB. The main
responsibilities of the PIU will include: the management of field operations
(procurement, payments, monitoring and evaluation, etc.); the supervision of
and coordination with project consultants and other government agencies (DOE,
CHO, SDO, etc.); the timely implementation of project components particularly
the flood warning, emergency response/evacuation and resource management
programs; the carrying out of M&E programs (para. 3.24-3.26); the preparation
of quarterly progress reports, mid-project reviews and completion reports; the
preparation and submission to the Bank of disbursement applications and
requests for special commitments; the maintenance and annual auditing of
separate project accounts; and the coordination with the Bank particularly
during supervision missions (paras. 3.21-3.23). Agreement was reached during
negotiations that the Borrower will strengthen the PIU located in the
Technical D2nartment. which will be groRerly staffd and equipped in
accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank and as indicated in
Raras. 4.08 and 4.09 for the implementation of the proRosed project.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Present Situation
5.01        The financial situation of the SBRWB reflects the nature of its
operations, the low income levels and living standards of the local
population, and dependence on the Government for a substantial proportion of
its financial resources.
5.02        The SBRWB provides drinking water to seven areas, i.e., Zahedan,
Zabol, Iran-Shahr, Saravan, Nik-Shahr, Chah-Bahar and Kash. The total
population in these areas is about 1.5 million, of which it is estimated that
about 75 percent are served by the SBRWB. Average water consumption levels
are very low. The SBRWB also provides irrigation water to about 124,300 ha of
farm land in the Sistan area and to agricultural areas in Iran-Shahr. In
addition, the SBRWB undertakes studies for dams, barrages, reservoirs,
irrigation and drainage networks, water and drainage systems, and for
groundwater utilization and recharge. Funds are provided by the Government to
carry out these studies, and once completed, the SBRWB also carries out the
construction of the facilities, to the extent that budgetary allocations a-e
made available, and thereafter operates and maintains them.
5.03        The income level of the population in the Sistan area is
substantially lower than the national average (para. 1.04). Consequently, the
Government has seen fit to set the price of both domestic and agricultural
water at low levels. The lowest price for domestic water is Rls 10/m3 for
monthly consumption of up to 10 m3.  Although the highest rate is Rls 40/m3
for consumption above 100 m3/month, very few families can afford or have the
facilities for such high consumption levels. Water tariff for mosques and
public health facilities is Rls 10/m3; industrial, public and administrative
organizations pay Rls 30/m3; and commercial entities are charged Rls 35/m3.
Water for irrigation through the traditional networks around Zabol, which is
unmetered, is provided for Rls 150/ha/year; water supplied through modern
networks is charged at Rls 30/m3.
5.04        SBRWB operational revenues are small, and they come almost
entirely from the sale of water. Water supply operations run at a deficit,
which are covered by GOI budgetary allocations. The accounting system is
rudimentary, and accounts are kept under broad headings. The following table
summarizes the operational revenues and expenditures of SBRWB water supply
operations for fiscal years 1989/90 to 1992/93.

Future Financial Situation
5.05        As mentioned earlier (in para. 4.02), the RWBs are currently
responsible for the provision of water, along with several other water-related
services. Until recently there were no municipal sewerage systems in Iran.
Construction is only starting in a few major cities, and most is still in the
plarning and desigr. stage (including Tehran). The responsibility for
planning, construction and the operation of the sewerage systems has also been
entrusted to the RWBs. Recently, however, the GOI has decided to separate the
domestic water supply operations from the RWBs and to establish autonomous
Regional Water and Sanitation Companies, which will be responsible for the
provision of water supply and sewerage services on a cost recovery basis. The
Parliament has enacted the necessary law and it is expected that these
companies will be established fairly rapidly.
5.06        Based on the above law, the water supply operations of the SBRWB
will be entrusted to a Water Supply and Sanitation Company which will be
created for the Sistan Baluchistan province. This is expected to occur within
the next couple of years. Thereafter, the SBRWB will be left with the
responsibility for planning, construction, operation and maintenance of dams,
barrages, reservoirs, irrigation and drainage networks, water and drainage
systems, etc, which mostly are nonrevenue producing activities.
5.07        This nonrevenue side of SBRWB operations is poised to grow
substantially in the next few years. The limited activities in the past were
largely due to the general shortage of investment funds for infrastructural
improvements during the war with Iraq; similarly, the dramatic increases
foreseen in the next few years reflect the high priority the GOI has given to
improving the living conditions of the population in the area. The details of
SBRWB investment expenditures in the recent past and its future investment
program, are given in Annex 8 and summarized below:

5.08        Once the responsibility for supplying domestic water is taken away
from the SBRWB, its remaining activities, i.e., planning, construction, and
operation and maintenance of dams, barrages, reservoirs, irrigation and
drainage works, and flood protection works, will be in the nature of public
goods. The funds fcr all of these activities will be provided by the GOI
through the annual budgetary process. The income from supplying water for
irrigation will be very small. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
(a) the GOI will continue to provide the SBRWB sufficient funds on an annual
basis for the nroner oReration and maintenance of all existing and proRosed
flood control facilities in the project area: and (b) one month prior to the
start of each fiscal year. the SBRWB will submit. through MOE. its annual
budget for capital investments and operation and maintenance to the Bank for
review.
Accounts and Audit
5.09        The SBRWB follows the accounting procedures as set out in the "Law
for Establishment of State Corporations/Governmental Enterprises" under which
it was established. The accounts are audited by an independent Inspector and
Auditor General, who is appointed by the General Assembly and who reports
directly to it (para. 4.04). This arrangement is satisfactory. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that SBRWB will: (a) keeR separate Rroject
accounts to record all financial transactions related to the Rroject.
including the progosed Statement of Exoenditures and the SRecial Accounto
(b) have the Rroject accounts audited annually by an independent auditor
acceotable to the Bank: and (c) submit through MOE and MEF the audit report to
the Bank within six months of the end of each SBRWB fiscal year.

'T. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01        The project will greatly reduce the risk of loss of property and
income for large numbers of families living in conditions of poverty and
insecurity, and will allow their productivity to increase in the future. It
will also greatly reduce the risk of damage to public infrastructure and
government buildings. In addition, the project will generate environmental
and health benefits that are difficult to quantify. These benefits will be
realized using the least-cost combination of project components (para. 3.05),
and, when calculated in economic terms, the quantified net project benefits
yield a rate of return that is substantially higher than the opportunity cost
of capital.
Environmental Imnact
6.02        On the expectation that negative environmental impacts from the
project will be limited in extent and amenable to mitigation, the project was
classified under environmental Category B at the Initial Executive Project
Summary (IEPS) stage and subjected to the environmental analysis by Iranian
and Pakistani consultants described in detail in Annex 12. This analysis
concluded that the proposed project will have a positive impact on both the
natural environment and the cultural heritage in the project area through its
protection against widespread flood damage. However, since this analysis also
identified environmental degradation already taking place in the project area,
which, if not addressed could jeopardize the benefits to be accrued from the
project, mitigative measures have been included under a Resources Management
Program (RMP) (Annex 13 and para. 3.04).   This Program will carry out
envLronmental assessments and design studies and provide technical assistance
to identify mitigative measures to address increasing water logging, soil
salinity and alkalinity, water pollution in the vicinity of larger towns, weed
infestation of irrigation and drainage canals, waterborne diseases, wildlife
management, desertification and cultural property issues, as well as
environmental monitoring needs. The underlying causes--primarily poor soil
drainage combined with inappropriate agricultural practices and/or
inappropriate sanitation practices--are to a large extent the result of the ad
hbl nature of the development that has taken place. These conditions are
further aggravated by the harsh climatic conditions in the Sistan area
(para. 2.08). The RMP, which has been agreed to in principle by GOI, will
introduce environmental assessments as a prerequisite to any major investments
proposed for the area.
Social Inmg=
6.03        The project will benefit about 200,000 people living in the Sistan
River flood plain, one of the areas targeted by the Government for special
assistance. Household incomes in the area are substantially lower than those
for the country as a whole (para. 1.04). In the past, various flood cycles
caused sedimentation to take place in the lower reaches of the river, changing
the river's course. These changes affected irrigation systems, and, together
with other forms of flood devastation, precipitated a return to a nomadic



- 26 -
lifestyle for some of the area's residents. In addition to averted costs,
therefore, the flood protection and river training components and early
warning systems will generate benefits to the area's residents in terms of
increased security. This is expected to be manifested in increased stability
among the farm families, permitting the optimum use of the infrastructure
already put in place by the GOI as part of its special assistance to the
region; in addition, this stability will encourage land-use planning and on-
farm investments, etc., eventually resulting in higher productivity.
6.04        The project will generate substantial health benefits for the
population living in the flood plain. In addition to the health benefits
accruing from reduced risk of major floods, the RMP will outline plans for
strengthening ongoing Government programs against malaria and schistosomiasis,
as well as improving sanitation to address other water borne and vector
transmitted diseases, and expanding the pest control management program.
Proiect Benefits
6.05        The main quantifiable project benefits relate to the reduction in
flood-related losses (para. 2.26). Flood-related damage includes losses or
partial destruction of irrigation and drainage works, roads and utility
networks (water, telephone and electricity), public and private buildings,
agricultural equipment and vehicles, livestock, standing crops, stored inputs
and products, and losses in future agricultural production while land remains
flooded. Additional benefits relate to reductions in the cost of frequent
emergency response programs and long-term assistance to the affected
population during the period of economic inactivity. Other benefits
attributable to the project, but which are generally nonquantifiable, include
the reduced risk to human life, reduced health risks and fewer people left
homeless.
Economic Analysis
6.06        The economic analysis compares the estimated costs of the flood
control and river training aspects of the project to the expected benefits
accruing as a result, with both costs and benefits expressed in economic
terms. Details of the assumptions for the calculation of the economic rate of
return, and for the sensitivity analysis, are given in Annex 9.
6.07        Cost and Benefit Streams.  Items included in the cost stream are
land, design, civil works, construction supervision and equipment, and the
cost of operating and maintaining the works throughout their economic life (50
years). The costs of excavating riprap from a quarry are included as a
separate item. Physical contingencies are included at 10 percent for civil
works and 5 percent for vehicles and equipment. Cost estimates for the
economic analysis are net of taxes. Benefit streams include estimated averted
losses of agricultural output, buildings, and infrastructure; savings of
expenditures on emergency works, annualized and weighted by probability of
occurrence; and estimated increases in crop production of about 5 percent per
year due to changes in land use as a result of increased security from flood
damage. The residual value of the quarry, after excavation of the material
needed for construction of the flood control works, is also included as a
benefit.



- 27 -
6.08        Economic Rate of Return.  The proposed project will yield an
estimated economic rate of return (ERR) of about 15 percent for the base case
scenario (based on an economy-wide shadow exchange rate of Rls 920 per
US dollar). The estimate is considered conservative in view of the fact that
the project's impact on human lives and health, on archaeological sites, and
on the natural environment are not quantified. Nor does the ERR include any
benefits related to expected improved yields per hectare due to the additional
agricultural programs to be implemented by the Government. A sensitivity
analysis shows the estimated return to be fairly robust, in that a worst case
scenario of a 20 percent increase in costs and a 20 percent decrease in
benefits results in an ERR of about 10 percent. The assumption of lower
growth in agricultural productivity (3 percent per year instead of 5 percent),
decreased the ERR to about 13 percent. A 50-year project life, related to the
physical life of the flood protection works, has been assumed; a shorter
project life (10 years after completion of construction) reduces the ERR to
about 11 percent. The use of the "competitive" exchange rate will yield an
ERR of 17 percent.
Proiect Risks
6.09        Two main project risks are foreseen; namely, those associated with
a lack of knowledge of Bank guidelirnes and regulations, particularly those
related to procurement, and risks associated with the normal construction of
works of this nature, particularly regarding construction taking place during
the flood season. To address the first concern, provisions have been made to
provide expatriate consultants familiar with Bank guidelines, and measures
will also be taken to provide Bank seminars on procurement, disbursements and
on modus operandi; close Bank supervision will also be provided during
implementation. To address the second concern, measures have been taken to
ensure a sound project design and construction methods that will protect the
safety of workers, equipment, structures and work in progress at all times.
Risks associated with floods which could exceed the design capacity are being
addressed through a flood warning and emergency response program.
Land Reauirements
6.10        The Sistan River project will require the acquisition of private
property consisting of 1,270 ha of barren and agricultural land and about 15
houses. The acquisition is necessary to relocate existing dikes in some
sections along the Sistan River and to upgrade the Niatak River dikes, which
mostly will traverse barren desert land. The Government intends to purchase
private property at the market value prevailing at the time of acquisltion
plus additional compensation in kind for hardship. These arrangements are
satisfactory to the Bank. Most of the land involved, however, is government-
owned, and its acquisition will not affect populated or agricultural areas;
only about 15 families in about 5 different areas will be affected who will be
relocated within their villages and at nearby villages where Government is
building housing and ir.frastructure (roads, water supply, irrigation and
drainage canals) for victims of the 1991 flood. During negotiation.  rem
was reached that the Borrower will make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
for acguisition of land and relocation, if any. and proper com2nnsation of
affected families.

funds on an annual basis for the proper operation and maintenance
of all existing and proposed flood control facilities in the
project area; and (b) one month prior to the start of each fiscal
year the SBRWB will submit, through MOE, its annual budget for
capital investments and operation and maintenance to the Bank for
review (para. 5.08);
(vii)  that SBRWB will: (a) keep separate project accounts to record all
financial transactions related to the project, including the
proposed Statement of Expenditures and the Special Accounts; (b)
have the project accounts audited annually by an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank; and (c) submit through HOE and
MEF the audit report to the Bank within six months of the end of
each SBRWB fiscal year (para. 5.09);
(viii) the Borrower will make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for
the acquisition of land and relocation of people, if any, and
proper compensation of affected families (para. 6.10).
7.02         Agreement having been reached on the issues referred to in
chapter III through VI of this report, the proposed project will be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$57 million equivalent to the Government of the Islamic
Republic of Iran under the Bank's standard variabla interest rate with a
maturity of 17 years, including five years of grace.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
SISTAN RIVER FLOOD WORKS REHABILITATION PROJECT
Flood Protection Program
A.Hydrology
1.          Floods in the project area are caused by spillage from the Sistan
River which is entirely fed by the Hirmand River. At the border between Iran
and Afghanistan, the Hirmand bifurcates into the Sistan and Common Parian
Rivers. The length of the Hirmand is approximately 1,000 km, and the drainage
area 275,000 kma. Of this some 51,600 km2 area is drained by the Arghandab
River which joins the Hirmand at Qal-eh-Bist, about 400 km above the border.
The Hirmand River system is fed mainly with snow and rain falling in the upper
catchment areas. The average annual precipitation ranges from approximately
340 mm in the upper reaches to about 125 mm in the lower reaches in the desert
area. Over 90 percent of the precipitation occurs from December to May. The
maximum peak flood estimated at 17,000 m3/sec occurred in 1885 at the Qal eh
Bist station, giving specific flood discharge of 0.061 m3/sec/km2. The
corresponding peak flood in the Sistan River was probably about 6,000 m3/sec.
2.          From the hydrological point of view the Hirmand, Sistan and Common
Parian rivers comprise the principal elements draining the Hirmand River
basin. Flood protection and management of the Sistan River, therefore,
requires an understanding of the hydrology of the Hirmand River.
Nevertheless, hydrologic analysis by the use of regional statistical approach
and flood routing procedures is not feasible for the Sistan River because of
the lack of information about the flood producing catchment areas and the
Hirmand River which lie in Afghanistan. The 1973 agreement between Iran and
Afghanistan on sharing of the Hirmand waters stipulate monthly inflows for use
by Iran but is not specific about management of flood flows.
3.          Two dams, the Khajake and the Arghandab, were constructed in
Afghanistan in 1950. The former was built on the Hirmand branch and the
latter on the Arghandab branch of the Hirmand River system. In addition,
three barrages have also been constructed on the Hirmand River and two
barrages on the Arghandab River in Afghanistan. A study of water availability
and floods coming to Iran was made before and after the construction of these
works. It indicates that annual flow volumes in the post-1950 period have
decreased for lower return periods, and show little reduction above 5-year
return period.
4.          In view of the lack of data about the Hirmand River, flood
frequency studies were based on a review of the annual maximum peak discharges
experienced in the Sistan River in Iran during the period of record. The
available data includes: (a) recorded peak flows of the Sistan River for the
years 1943, 1948-49 and 1950-91; and (b) synthesized peak discharge data for



- 30 -
Page 2 of 6
the Sistan River for 1891-1921 poriod. The latter time series was derived by
correlating the Hirmand River data observed in Afghanistan at two stations
located within 80 km of the border. Frequency analysis were carried out for
both the time series using Cumbel distribution (split above 2.33 year return
period and composite) and Weibull's plotting position formula. 'The data of
1943, 1948 and 1949 were excluded from analysis as the remaining data 1950-91
would form a relatively more homogeneous time series for analysis as all the
figures would correspond to post-Khajake dam conditions. For fitting the
line, linear regression was carried out between factor OK" and data sorted in
descending order. The results using Cumbel split on 1950-91 time series were
adopted because: (a) 1891-1921 data could not be verified for correctness; and
(b) regression analysis on the points above 2.33 year return period provided
required weightage to higher floods. Based on this analysis, the estimated
flood peak would be 2,535 m3/sec for 100-year which was selected as the design
flood for the protection works. In addition to Gumbel method, Log Pearson
III and GEV distributions were also tested. According to these two
distribution, the best estimate for the 100 year flood lies between 2,600
U3/sec (Log Pearson III) and 3,000 m3/sec (GEV). Data supporting the analysis
and its results are available in the project flle.
5.          Only a few major floods have occurred during this century; the
maximum peak discharge was recorded in February 1991, estimated at 2,300
a3/sec. The design flood of 2,535 m3/sec is approximately 10 percent more
than the peak discharge experienced in 1991. The future possibility of peak
discharge in the Sistan River exceeding the 1991 figure cannot be reasonably
excluded, taking into account that:
(a)   the historical data may not be adequately reliable due to poor
gauging procedures;
(b)   the local factors which determine the natural division of the
Hirmand waters at the bifurcation may change, inducing more flood
flows into the Sistan River; and
(c)   the stochastic nature of floods and the lack of knowledge of the
hydrometeorological conditions which caused the 1885 flood and of
the changes taking place in the Hirmand drainage basin.
B.Flood Routing Plan
6.          Three alternatives were consldered for routing the design flood of
2,535 m3/sec and for flood protection works, keeping in view the present safe
discharging capacity of operational barrages on the Sistan River and river
reach and the under construction the Niatak floodway with design capacity of
600 m/sec. The selected plan represents the least-cost solution compared to
flood protection works required for routing the design flood through: (a) the
Sistan River without any floodway; or (b) the Sistan River with two floodways.



- 31 -
Page 3 of 6
Practical merits and demerits of each alternative were also considered. The
principal features of the selected alternative for designing flood protection
works are shown in Table 1 below:

C.Flood Protection Works
General
7.    The flood protection plan against the Sistan River and lake flooding
will be limited to the essential works. It includes works being built with
Government funds and those to be provided under the project. A complete
layout of these works is shown in IBRD Map No. 23590, and a detailed
description is given below.

Priority Works Funded by Governrent
8.          The Government-funded works are expected to be completed by
September 1992. The main works include the following priority activities:
(a)   the restoration of the Sistan Riv.r damaged dikes to pre-flood
condition at critical locations along the Sistan River (total cost
Rls 300M);
(b)   the construction of a dike around Zabol town, approximately 20 km
in length (total cost Rls 600N);
(c)   the first 12 km length of the Niatak floodway excluding four
bridges in this reach and the floodway offtake from the Sistan
River (total cost Rls 8,300M); and
(d)   the works required for river training at critical locations
(estimated cost Rls 5,000N).
Princigal Features of Project-Financed Works
9.          The methods applicable to control flooding from the Sistan River
inc;lude flood confinement, river training and diversion of part of flood flows
through the Niatak floodway. The efforts to prevent flood flows from
spreading would be realized by dikes. The dikes would be designed and located
to enable the river and the Niatak floodway to carry the design discharge
without causing restriction and excessive velocities. In selecting the
distance between floodway dikes, both engineering and economic factors were
considered. The design of dikes along the lake shore would take into account
water levels in the lake (corresponding to the design flood discharge) plus
wind-induced surge. Generally, the designed dikes would have a crest width of
6 m, to ae:.-ommodate the road requirements, freeboard of 1.25 m including
allowance for settlement and water/land side slopes of generally 2.5 H: l.OV
and 2.OH:1.OV respectively. The basic design requirements for dikes may be
briefly stated as follows: the dikes must be stable, any settlement of dikes
or foundations must not be excessive and seepage through or under the dike
must be of limited nature. They would be constructed with well-compacted,
impervious material locally available. The purpose of river training works,
in general, would be to guide the river flow in a manner such that a stable
channel will be produced and maintained along a desired alignment.
10.         Sistan River.  The flood confinement or management works would
include:
(a)   the upgrading or relocation of the Sistan River existing dikes
having a total length of about 80 km with 31 km on the left and 49
km on the right bank, to heights varying from 3.1 to 4.0 m;



- 33 -
Page 5 of 6
(b)   the provision or improvement of dikes to heights ranging between
2.0 to 2.5 m along both banks of the Adimi and Afzalabad branches,
each approximately 12.5 km long;
(c)   the armoring of dikes with stone revetment on the river side for a
total length of about 17 km;
(d)   the construction of a concrete bifurcation structure at the head
of Adimi branch to control discharge to a maximum of 500
m3/sec; and
(e)   the provision of additional box culverts under the approach road
embankments of the Zabol-Zahedan road bridge.
11.         The present condition of the river will require training works at
some locations from its head to the 4 stan fork. While the identified
locations could be modified depending upon the river behavior over the project
life, the estimated quantities of work are not expected to vary beyond ± 10
percent. The river training works mainly consist of channel rectification at
present estimated for a total length of about 5.0 km, and protection with
stone revetment where necessary. The river training works would generally be
designed on the basis of hydraulic model tests.
12.         Niatak River and Floodway.  The Niatak River and floodway will
provide the most needed relief to the Sistan River by diverting part of the
design flood. This 42 km long floodway will offtake in front of the Zahak
barrage on its right bank, pass through relatively undeveloped area, and
outfall into the hamun. The proposed plan will use the abandoned Niatak River
channel in the last 30 km length. The project will thus provide excavation as
necessary for the construction of suitably spaced dikes along both banks of
the 30 km long old river channel. It will also provide the construction of
offtake structure and six bridges over the floodway. The flood confining
dikes will be tied to the channel being formed with Government funds, and to
the dike along the lake shore at the outfall end. The offtake structure will
be an open weir of nominally reinforced concrete with the crest designed for
expected operating conditions. The length of each bridge is about 90 m. It
is proposed to construct concrete bridges with prestressed concrete girder (30
m x 3 m spans).
13.         Dike along the South Shore of Lake Hirmand.  The existing earth
dike along the lake shore is about 110 km in length; it was severely damaged
due to wave action during the 1991 flood. The project would provide for the
rehabilitation of about 100 km length of the existing dike to pre-flood
condition with 6 m crest width, average height of 5 m and water/land side
slopes of 3H:lV respectively. The wind velocity considered for the design is
80 km/hr and the effective fetch lengths of 24.5, 38.5 and 52.5 km for various
dike reaches. Under these conditions, the criteria of providing minimum
freeboard is in accordance with American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
recommendations. The project would also provide for: the provision of 0.6 m

thick riprap protection laid on filter material in crltical reaches totalling
30 km in length; the placement of gravel of 0.1 m thLekness on top of the
dlke; the placement of 30 cm thick horlzontal drainage blanket draining to a
vertical drain in sand reaches; and the construction of 14 drainage inlets.
14.         edelling gf the hahime FEeder Channel.  The channel divertlng
flood flows to the exlsting Chahnime reservoirs would be enlarged to
accommodate the increased discharge of 435 m3/sec. The remodelling work would
involve the addition of two bays to the intake struc=.ure of the channel and
enlarging lts bed width to 45 m. To fix the deslgn parameters of the
remodelled channel HEC-2 computer program has been run under various operating
condltions of water levels ln the river and Chahnime reservoirs.

SISTAN RIVER FLOOD WORKS REHABILITATION PLJJECT
Ecgonmic Analysis
1.    The economic analysis compares the estimated costs of the flood control
and river training aspects of the project to the expected benefits, with both
costs and benefits expressed in economic terms. The economy-wide shadow
exchange rate was used throughout the analysis.
Estimation of Costs
2.    Capital cost items included in the analysis are those related to land,
design and supervision, civil works, and vehicles and equipment. Land costs
are calculated on the basis of the number of plots that need to be acquired,
the class of land according to its suitability for agriculture, and the market
price for the land. Five residential plots will also have to be acquired, and
they are also valued at market price. The total land cost is Rl 2000 million.
Land acquisition is assumed to take place according to the construction
schedule.
3.    The costs of excavating rip-rap from a quarry are included as a separate
item. Physical contingencies are included u;. lOX for civil works and 5X for
vehicles and equipment. The cost of operating and maintaining the works
throughout their economic life (50 years) is also included; and this eost
stream includes the replacement of maintenance vehicles over the entire
period. Cost estimates are net of taxes for the economic analysis.
Estimation of Benefits
4.    The main quantifiable project benefits relate to the reduction of the
risk of flood-related losses. Included are losses or partial destruction of
irrigation and drainage works, roads and utility networks (water, telephone,
and electricity), public and private buildings, agricultural equipment and
vehicles, livestock, standing crops, stored inputs and products, and losses in
future agricultural production while land remains flooded. Additional
benefits relate to reductions in the cost of frequent emergency response
programs and long-term assistance to the affected population during the period
of economic inactivity. The residual value of the quarry, after excavation of
the material needed for construction of the flood control works, is also
included as a benefit.
5.    The losses are estimated in five categories: (i) agricultural output;
(ii) damage to housing; (iii) road damage; (iv) other direct damage, including
damage to dikes, irrigation systems and other infrastructure, livestock, etc.;
and (v) indirect damages, including damage due to disruption in irrigation And
other services, and costs of emergency systems. Each of these is estimatt

per hectare, for the design flood. Total damage from selected flood events
were calculated for the "with" and "without" project scenarios to establish a
damage frequency relationship. These are then converted to average annual
damages expected in any given year for all levels of flooding)]
Assumptions used in the Calculations
6.    The estimates of flood damage to crops are based on the revenues per
hectare of the various crops grown in the Sistan area, net of input costs.
All estimates are calculated in terms of market prices, and adjusted to
international prices using appropriate conversion factors. The resulting net
potential flood losses are as follows:-

For the total cultivated area covered by the project, 123,400 hectares, total
damages amount to Rls 23,310 million.
7.   Flood damage to houses is also estimated on a per hectare basis.  There
are an estimated 331,360 people living in the total flood plain area of
250,000 ha (1992 estimate), including an estimated 44,580 households in the
It should be noted that by using the average annual flood damage, the
risks of flooding are evenly distributed over the life of the project.
The discounting procedure inherent in the rate of return calculation
assigns less importance to flood events occurring in later years of the
project.   The results of an exercise to simulate the random nature of
flood occurrences are described in para. 11.

rural area.1' An estimated 43,040 occupy houses made of unbaked bricks; and
the rest are made of baked bricks. The damage caused by the design flood is
estimated at Rls 2.5 million and Rls 10 million, respectively, for these two
kinds of construction. The damage is therefore estimated at Rls 492,000 per
hectare; for the project area of 150,000 ha., this amounts to Rls 73,800
million.
8.   Other Damage. Road damage is estimated at Rls 36,918 per hectare, using
densities of .085 and .098 km/km2. and repair costs of Rls 35.3 million and
Rls 7.1 million per km for primary and secondary roads, respectively. Other
direct losses are estimated assuming a ratio of project area damages to crop,
housing and road damages of 1.3:1. This is a conservative estimate compared
to the recorded ratios of 1.34:1 and 1.40:1 recorded in 1982 and 1991 events.
Indirect damages, including emergency costs and costs of disruption are
estimated at 20 percent of direct damages. Using these estimates and ratios,
the total damage associated with the 100 year (design) flood for the project
area is:
TIpe of Damage or Cost                Value
Rls Million
Crops                                 23,310
Private housing                       73,800
Roads                                  5,538
Other direct damage                   34,042
Indirect damage                       29.503
Total                         166,193
9.   The resulting figure of Rls 166,193 million is the damage associated
with the design flood, discharging 2535 cubic meters per second. Table 1
shows the calculations for the average annual damages averted by the project
used in the cost-benefit analysis. Average annual damage averted, at Rls
9,593 million, is the difference between the average annual damage averted by
the project, and the average annual damage that would occur even with the
project works (i.e., from a flood larger than the design flood). This figure
is the basis for the benefit streams for damage averted, taking into account
the lower values for the early years of the project when construction is not
complete. The figures also include the value of improved yields from the land
due to the flood control works, estimated at five percent annually over the
next ten years, and remaining constant thereafter.
2/   Urban households are already protected against the design flood.

Economic Rate of Return
10.  The proposed project would yield an estimated economic rate of return
(ERR) of 15.01 for the base case scenario. The cost and benefit streams are
shown in Table 2. The estimated ERR is considered conservative in view of the
fact that the project's impact on human lives and health, on archaeological
sites, and on the natural environment are not quantified. A sensitivity
analysis shows the estimated return to be fairly robust, in that a worst case
scenario of 20X increase in costs and a 201 decrease in benefits results in a
331 decrease in the ERR, to about 101. An assumption of lower growth in
productivity (31 per year instead of 5X), decreases the ERR to 13.11. Under
the scenario that the useful life of the project continues for only ten years
after construction, the ERR would be reduced to around 111. The ERR estimates
resulting from some of the sensitivity tests carried out are as follows:-
Cost Over-run
Benefits Reduction         0        ±121         +20X
0                   15.01     13.71        12.51

-201               12.5Z                   10.O0
11. Analysis using random flood events. The random nature of flood events
was simulated in 500 computer trials. In each trial, the cumulative flood
damage distribution was sampled at random for each of the 50 years of project
life, and the net present values (NPV) of the 50 year stream of project
benefits and costs were calculated. The benefit-cost ratio associated with
the "risk" calculation, 1.88, was about 251 higher than the ratio calculated
using the average annual series.

SISTAN RIVER FLOOD WORKS REHABILITATION PROJECT
Flood Warning. Emergency Response and Evacuation Program
IntroductiMo
1.          Engineerin& works such as dikes designed to control floods can
rarely, if ever, control extreme floods. Nevertheless potential damage and
sufferings caused by floods can be reduced by a positive program prepared in
advance to take the necessary actions during an emergency. There is thus the
need to have an emergency action plan, focusing on flood disaster preparedness
and prevention as an integral part of the project. The proposed plan should
provide a brief review of the existing situation, and a comprehensive
description of flood emergency measures. It should also include (draft)
regulations concerning the responsibilities in a flood situation.
2.          The Strategy in this Annex provides the conceptual framework for
the proposed study.  The emergency action plan should, however, be carefully
designed to fit the local conditions under which it will be used. In
addition, the flood loss mitigation hinges a great deal on the interest and
support of the majority of the population in the flood-prone areas. This
means that the local people should be aware of what the problems are and what
the proposed actions are intended to achieve.
organization of the Study
3.          It is envisaged that the proposed study will be managed by the
Chairman of SBRWB through the Chief of PIU. It will be carried out by the
project consultants' local/expatriate specialists in active collaboration with
the project staff and the provincial and local authorities. The KOS will
appoint a committee composed by representatives of the concerned agencies to
coordinate and review consultants' work. The committee will be chaired by an
official nominated by the Ninistry.
4.          The study will begin during the second year of the project and its
duration will be 18 months. An inception report, outlining the approach of
the study, will be submitted for review after 2 months, a (draft) final report
after 18 months.
Elements of the Action Plan
5.          The key elements of the action plan may be placed in five broad
categories:
(a)   flood forecasting;
(b)   flood warning;
(c)   flood fighting;
(d)   evaluation of damages and relief; and
(e)   post-emergency activities.



- 54 -
Annex 10
Page 2 of 4
Flood Forecasting
6.          The hydrological emphasis in emergency measures would be in
promoting by SBRWB reasonably accurate forecasts of flood conditions as soon
as is practicable or desirable. The proposed study would take stock of the
present problems and indicate how the flood forecasting could be improved. It
should make distinction between proposals which could be implemented under the
project and those which need more time.
7.          It is recognized that effective and efficient flood forecasting
for the Sistan river requires international cooperation, particularly between
Iran and Afghanistan. If the required cooperation and active interaction were
forthcoming, forecasts can be made by correlating the Hirmand river flow with
the Sistan river flow, using past records or analytical models. The
consultants would study this possibility and prepare a detailed proposal,
including:
(a)   the identification of two flow recording locations on the Hirmand
river which will allow forecasts of flood crests at the head of
the Sistan river at least three days in advance;
(b)   the method of data transmission from each flow recording location
to a nearby source monitoring center;
(c)   the transmission links between the source stations and flood
monitoring or reception centers to be located at Zabol and
Zahidan;
(d)   the methodology and coefficients, for correlating river flow at
source locations to flow recording station at the head of the
Sistan river;
(e)   the organizational set-up for the source and reception centers:
the first having a flexible framework, and the second providing
for both the interpretation of flow data into the forecasts for
the Sistan river and for disseminating the forecasts in the form
of warnings to all concerned; and
(f)   the cost estimate.
Flood WarnLng
8.          The objective of designing a dissemination system would be to give
timely warnings to the people concerned and to the organizations responsible
for flood fighting and evacuating people from the flood area. The consultants
would review the various methods which can be used with success in flood prone
areas depending upon size and type of settlements, available communication
facilities, etc. The methods may include radio, television, newspapers,
telephone, visual signals, sirens and local communication facilities such as
field telephone or wireless radio sets. The recommended plan would be based
on available facilities and those which can reasonably be provided. It would



- 55 -
Annex 10
Page 3 of 4
also provide for education of the public in the use of the flood warning
system, and for its regular testing and periodic updating.
Flood Fightin
9.          The consultants would prepare operational procedures for flood
fighting only during the flood period. The procedures will include but not
limited to the following emergency measures:
(a) the surveillance and operation of existing flood control works;
(b) the repair, strengthening, and raising of flood works to prevent
their failure by overtopping, riverside and wave erosion, seepage-
boils, bank slips and collapse;
(c) the building of emergency works such as secondary dikes;
(d) the deliberate breaching of a predetermined section of dike
particularly along the Sistan river;
(e) the establishment of reserve stock of revetment material, jute or
similar bags, etc. at critical locations; and
(f) the organizational arrangements, including the regional and local
centers from which the operations can be directed and coordinated.
Evacuation and Relief
10.         In this part of the study, the consultants would formulate plans
for efficient evacuation and the relief of flood victims. A survey of needs
arising out of a flood disaster should form the basis for relief actions. The
planning should be in detail; it should also be flexible, as no two flood
situations are exactly alike. Maps of areas vulnerable to floods would be
made. They should preferably be simple and easily understood.
11.         Planning for evacuation and relief may include:
(a) a proper and thorough evaluation of when evacuation should take
place, and by whom the decision to evacuate should be made;
(b) possible places where evacuated persons should be taken and the
type of shelter available or to be provided at these points;
(c) alternative routes out of vulnerable areas and to the evacuation
centers;
(d) availability of transport for mass evacuation by land and water,
and care of evacuated persons enroute;
(e) arrangements for supplying food, water and clothing into the
disaster area;

Annex 10
Page 4 of 4
(f)   special care required for the elderly, sick and infirm people;
(g)   financing for recommended operations; and
(h)   public information.
12.         The proposed plan should contain the organizational framework to
perform the various operations required in evacuation and relief. It should
specify the responsibilities of regional organization in terms of directing
local operations, using regional resources and obtaining help from the
provincial and national authorities as necessary. The plan should also
specify at the very least: the responsibilities of key personnel; a list of
other personnel specifically assigned to flood disaster operations; the
training of personnel in relief operations; the availability and location of
equipment; the current procedures for requesting materials and equipment; and
the reporting system.
13.         Finally, it should be mentioned that the effectiveness of the
emergency action plan would depend upon the extent of preparation. The
general elements and fundamental concepts of planning outlined above would be
reviewed in the light of the consultants approach in the proposed inception
report and improved as necessary. The regional authorities should encourage
active participation by their representatives to ensure that the plan is in
harmony with the local conditions. The review process by the coordinating and
review committee would be progressive. The Bank would be furnished with the
(draft) final report for its review and comments.
Post-emergency Activities
14.         The proposed plan should set forth broad proposals for the post-
disaster activities which should be consistent with the policies of GOI and/or
the provincial authorities. These activities may include:
(a)   the assessment of direct physical damages;
(b)   the compilation of costs incurred on emergency actions;
(c)   the rehabilitation and reconstruction; and
(d)   the health problems due to floods.

SISTAN RIVER FLOOD WORKS REHABILITATION PROJECT
Environmental Analvsis
Introduction
1.          An environmental analysis (EA) was conducted by consultants
(Tehrar Sahab Consulting Engineers, the Institute of Environmental Studies of
Tehran LL.iversity and NESPAK Consulting Engineers of Pakistan) in accordance
with terms-of-reference provided by the Bank in August 1991.   A report was
made available prior to project appraisal and comments on its review were
considered in the appraisal mission terms of reference. During appraisal,
further analysis were carried out by both the consultant and the appraisal
mission taking into account the Bank's pre-appraisal review comments.
Project Description
2.          The project consists of rehabilitating and upgrading existing
flood control works in the Sistan River and Hirmand Lake located in the
Sistan-Baluchistan province in the southeast of Iran. The project would also
include river training in some sections of the Sistan River, upgrading and
providing bridges, a resources conservation program and an early flood warning
and emergency response program, technical assistance and the provision of
maintenance and laboratory equipment.
Environmental Review
3.          Details on the description of the area environment, the known
sites of cultural heritage importance, and a description of mitigative
measures, are provided in the Environmental Analysis Report and the Master
Plan Report which are in the project file and are available upon request.
The environmental and social review included both the direct impact of the
proposed works on the lake and land environments and cultural property, as
well as environmental issues in the project area due to human settlements and
economic activity. The latter was done to identify measures that would
prevent environmental degradation and thus ensure the long-term sustainability
of the proposed project. The various alternatives and construction methods
considered were examined to determine the type and extent of impacts, if any.
Detailed reviews were conducted for the least-cost alternative. The impact of
sedimentation could not be assessed fully due to a lack of data during major
floods which are the conditions that could result on negative er-nvironmental
impacts on the wetlands. However, estimates were made to determine the order
of magnitude of sedimentation problems associated with the proposed works.
This analysis showed that since the floodways (Sistan and Niatak) would
distribute the flood flows in two areas of the lake instead of only at one
place, the Sistan river mouth, plus the fact that existing barrages in the
Sistan river would operate within design hydraulic capacity, sedimentation
would occur mainly within these control sections of the river. This measure
would enable the removal of sediments after flood events in accordance with a
well designed maintenance program to be developed under the project.



- 62 -
Page 2 of 2
Negative Environmental Impacts
4.          The main environmental concern identified by the EA was the
environmental degradation that is already taking place in the project area.
This condition is the result of ad hoc development and it would not be
exacerbated by the proposed project. The environmental degradation is
described in Annex 13 and briefly summarized as follow: (i) severe
waterlogging and soil salinity; (ii) increase of weed infestation of
irrigation and drainage canals; (iii) increase of water pollution in the
vicinity to Zabol and large towns; (iv) increase of water borne diseases
(malaria and schistosomiasis); (v) threat to fresh water quality in' the lake
(Hamun) due to potential discharges into it of sewage and drainage waters;
(vi) threats to cultural property; and (vii) tendency to desertification.
5.          Potential problems might also result from sedimentation in the
floodway channels and the marginal areas of Hirmand Lake.  H¢wever, these
problems would always occur with or without the project.
Nitigative Measures
6.          To mitigate any negative effects that might result from the
deposition of sediments in the Sistan river, provisions have been taken under
the project to provide maintenance equipment and to carry out a river
modelling program consisting of physical and mathematical models based on data
being collected, which would simulate the river hydraulics and sediment load
transport to design a river training and maintenance program for the
protection of such flood control works anid effectively manage sedimentation.
7.          The project has also made provisions to address concerns to
prevent environmental degradation and threats to cultural property by
including several programs (Resources Management Program -RMP) to study the
extent of environmental damage and identify mitigative measures to be
implemented by GOI. The proposed environmental assessments and design reviews
of proposed irrigation and drainage schemes, as well as.waste water and solid
wastes disposal projects, would introduce a strict criteria for the analysis
of projects during the planning stage as a standard procedure for future major
investments in the area. The technical assistance for these studies provided
under the RMP would be used to strengthen the local offices of the Department
of Environment, the Cultural Heritage Organization and the Sistan Development
Organization. The latter is a local agency recently established by Government
in response to these concerns for the integrated planning and management of
the Sistan area resources. The GOI has expressed interest and willingness to
support the RMP by making available human and financial resources for the
proposed project.
Environmental Review Category
8.          Based on the findings and recommendations of the environmental
analysis, the decisionmade at the IEPS stage was confirmed that the project
should be classified under environmental category B.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
SISTAN RIVER FLOOD WORKS REHABILITATION PROJECT
Resources Management Program
Introduction
1.          The Resources Management Program is intended to address
environmental degradation reported in the Environmental Analysis Report which
brings forth the extent to which this issue should be considered and gives
specific recommendations on mitigative measures. Thie report points out that
environmental degradation iz, already taking place in the project area as a
result of a number of human activities which, together with the harsh weather
conditions associated with high evaporation rate and strong winds which
prevail for the most part of the year, are a major threat to the economic
sustainability of the area. The proposed flood works rehabilitation project
would contribute positively to environmental enhancement by controlling flood
waters and maintaining them confined to the dike system and the Hamun-e-
Hirmand lake, a measure that would also contribute to the preservation of
archaeological sites provided proper actions as recommended herein are taken
to ameliorate or reverse the above-mentioned environmental degradation. This
program covers the environmental degradation which requires immediate
attention and the proposed mitigative measures to begin to address such
concerns. The Government has expressed willingness to implement this program
and to improve the management of resources in the area to ensure reversing, to
the extent possible, such environmental degradation.
Environmental Degradation
2.          The most significant environmental degradation taking place
consist of:
(i)   severe water logging, soil salinity and alkalinity which is
the result of poor soil drainage and improper agricultural
practices;
(ii) increase of weed infestation of irrigation and drainage
canals which is further aggravated by the improper use of
agro-chemicals;
(iii) increase of water pollution in the vicinity of larger towns
such as Zabol due to 'hallow water table and poor soil
drainage;
(iv) increase of water borne diseases such as schistosomiasis and
malaria;
(v)   threat to water quality in the Hamun lake due to potential
discharges of saline drainage water and sewage from major
towns;



- 64 -
ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 3
(vi)  threat to natural habitats by lack of management plans for
such areas, and lack of hunting control during the migratory
birds season;
(vii) threat to cultural heritage sites due to a lack of a
management plan; and
(viii)tendency to desertification due to a lack of a sand dune
management plan.
3.          The proposed project is an essential mitigative measure to provide
protection against flood damage to people, public and private property as well
as to the various cultural heritage sites which are located within the Sistan
river flood plain. The proposed project would also contribute positively to
maintaining a water balance in the Hamun lake by keeping the flood waters
within it.   However, the proposed project would provide a sense of security
which would promote further development. It is this development which, if not
properly managed, would threaten the environmental sustainability of the
entire area. The problems described above such as water logging and salinity,
the potential water pollution of fresh waters and the Hamun, the threats to
cultural heritage sites and migratory birds, can be directly related to the
human presence and the concomitant economic development. Fcr this reason, the
prompt implementation of the mitigative measures proposed below would be of
paramount importance.
Pr2osed Mitigati3ve Measures
4.          To properly address the environmental threats previously
discussed, the following mitigative measures have been included in the
proposed project:
(i)   undertake an environmental assessment of the entire
irrigation and drainage system to identify mitigative
measures both to reduce water logging and soil salinity.
This review would also include the preparation of design and
procurement documents for the construction of irrigation and
drainage systems and for the disposal of drainage water;
(ii)  develop and implement an afforestation management plan to
(a) reduce water logging by pumping ground water through
evapo-transpiration; (b) control sand dune transport by
serving as a wind breaker; (c) provide a source of properly
managed fuel wood; and, (d) improve the scenic view of the
Hamun fringes. In the preparation of this plan,
consideration should be given to the selection of trees and
the location where they would be planted to mitigate any
negative effects. The participation of the local community
would be an integral part of the program to ensure a long-
term protection of these areas;
(iii) develop and implement a park management plan for the Hamun
lake, which is currently reserved as a protected area;



- 65 -
ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 3
(iv)  strengthen the ongoing Government programs for eradicating
malaria and schistosomiasis, improving sanitation to address
water borne and vector transmitted diseases, and expanding
the pest control management program;
(v)   undertake environmental assessments of (a) the wastewater
disposal systems for the major populated areas particularly
those which are a direct threat to fresh water quality and
the Hamun lake; (b) the proposed development of a storage
reservoir at Chahnime depression (Reservoir No. 4); and, (c)
the proposed waste disposal site located at a natural
depression to the west of the project area;
(vi)  design and develop a long-term environment monitoring
program to be implemented by DOE, which would measure water
quality and soil conditions, air quality changes, conditions
of the Hamun reserve and of fauna as well as flora and
cultural heritage sites, and determine the impact of
proposed land developments on the natural resources; and
(vii) strengthen local Government agencies, particularly the
Department of Environment, the Cultural Heritage
Organization and the newly established Sistan Baluchistan
Development Organization through technical assistance for
the above-mentioned studies. Technical assistance would be
coordinated by the PIU and implemented with the cooperation
of the local Government agencies.
5.          A general scope of work for each of these programs has been
included in the Environmental Analysis report which would be elaborated in
more detail during project implementation after undertaking preliminary
surveys of conditions. The Government has expressed willingness to take more
assertive actions to be implemented through a well designed Action Plan.
Although this program would be implemented by local environmental experts,
provision has been made to complement such work with the assistance of
expatriate experts as required, and through organize visits abroad to learn
from similar cases in other countries.
