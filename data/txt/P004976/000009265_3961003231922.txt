INCRA±4DUM AND RECOIEMNDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TUE DEMOCRATIC AND POPMLAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A HOUSING COMPLETION AND SECTOR DEVELOPKMNT PROJECT
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for US$200 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would help finance the completion of
51,000 social housing units for sale, as well as part of the private sector
unfinished housing stock, and would assist the Government in implementing key
housing policy objectives, with particular focus on reforming housing finance and
housing subsidies.
S. BACKGROUND
1.1         In 1987, the Government of Algeria embarked on a far-reaching program
of macroeconomic adjustment and economic reform aimed at increasing economic
efficiency and restoring growth.   In  subsequent years, the program made
substantial progress in expanding the role of market forces in the economy and
correcting macroeconomic imbalances. However, a combination of low oil prices,
a growing external debt burden, and significant structural problems resulted in
continuing recession.   Economic stagnation generated a social crisis and
contributed to political instability. The present Government, established in
July 1992, has accorded top priority to strengthening the authority of the State
and addressing the immediate crisis. While the Government is taking a cautious
approach to economic reform and has stepped back temporarily from some of the
more ambitious reform measures of its predecessors, notably in the area of trade
liberalization, it has reaffirmed the objective of transforming Algeria into a
market economy.
A. THE ADJUSTMENT AND REFORM PROGRAM
1.2         At its core, the adjustment and reform program has encompassed: (a)
the correction of macroeconomic imbalances to ensure stability; (b) reform of the
trade and foreign exchange regime to encourage competition from the external and
private sectors; (c) incentive reforms to correct price dif3tortions and eliminate
price subsidies; and (d) financial sector reform, including the eattablishment of
a modern legal framework for financial intermediation; and (e) structural
transformation of the productive sector, with particular emphasis on the
restructuring of public enterprises and the development of the private sector.
Macroeconomic adjustment has succeeded in absorbing excess liquidity and reducing
the parallel market premium. The year-end ratio of broad money to GDP dropped
from 84 percent in 1988 to 52 percent by 1992. With the authorities, decision
to devalue the dinar, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by over two-
thirds between 1988 and 1991, and the ratio of the parallel to official exchange
rates fell from 5:1 to 2:1.
1.3         Although it remains incomplete, economic reform has affected nearly
all aspects of the economy.  The private sector is no longer subject to



discriminatory restrictions on foreign exchange and domestic credit.   Legal
import monopolies have been abolished and formal import licenses eliminated.
However, the allocation of official foreign exchange and external credit has
remained largely under administrative control. The foreign investment regime has
also been liberalized, including the authorization of production-sharing
arrangements in the hydrocarbon sector with SONATRACH, the State-owned oil
company. A major tax and tariff reform has resulted in the introduction of a VAT
and new personal and corporate income taxes, as well as a reduction in the number
of import tariffs and a 50 percent cut in the maximum rate.  Recent labor
legislation has decentralized collective bargaining, dropping the centrally
determined wage scale in favor of a single minimum wage requirement. Consumer
price subsidies have been eliminated for all but three food items (flour for
bread, milk and semolina) and energy prices have been increased to better reflect
economic costs. On the whole, deregulated prices, which accounted for about 10
percent of the CPI in 1988, account for about 80 percent of the same basket
today. The complex interest rate grid has been replaced with a unified 20
percent rate ceiling. Responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the
banking system has been formally devolved to the Central Bank, and new prudential
regulations and accounting standards have been introduced. Public enterprises
have been granted autonomy and State farms have been broken up into private
cooperatives holding long-term usufruct rights.
1.4         The Bank has supported the adjustment and reform program with a
US$300 million Economic Reform Support Loan (ERSL, Loan No. 3117), approved In
FY90 and closed in FY93, and a US$350 million Enterprise and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan (EYSAL, Loan No. 3352), approved in FY91 and on-going. The INF
provided support in the form of a first SDR 470 million (US$584 million) combined
Standby/CCFF in 1989, and a second SDR 300 million Standby (US$430 million) and
SDR 200 million CCFF (US$301 million, not drawn) in 1991. However, due to the
inflationary and budgetary impact of generous increases in wages and household
transfers granted in late 1991 and early 1992, the second Program review,
scheduled for March 1992, was cancelled and the fourth SDR 75 million drawing was
foregone. Nonetheless, the revised fiscal and monetary performance criteria for
end-September and end-December 1991 were observed. Article IV consultations were
he.d in November 1992, and a follow-up IMF mission visited Algiers in early
February 1993.
B. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.5         The adjustment and reform program has not yet restored growth to an
economy hobbled by severe external resource constraints. The fall in oil prices
in 1986 led to a rapid build up of short maturity external debt. Total debt is
currently about US$27 billion or 60 percent of GDP. The economy has been unable
to adjust to the burden of debt service, which consumed an estimated 75 percent
of foreign exchange earnings in 1992. Between 1986 and 1992, GDP grew a scant
total of 3 percent. Six years of economic stagnation and 2.7 percent annual
population  growth have  created  an  acute  social  crisis.    Official  open
unemployment, already over 16 percent in 1986, now exceeds 20 percent (30 percent
in the 20-25 year age group). The social stresses in Algeria are evident in, and
accentuated by, the very large shortage of housing units, now estimated at more
than 2 million, which has resulted in an average occupancy rate 8.5 persons per
unit, one of the highest in the world. The social crisis helped fan growing
political instability. The cancellation of national legislative elections in
December 1991 precipitated a political crisis, leading to the imposition of a



- 3 -
state of emergency in February 1992. The assassination of President Boudiaf in
June 1992 was followed by the appointment of a new Government.
1 6         The new Government announced its economic program in September 1992.
While the program underscores the Government's commitment to economic reform, it
also calls on the State to increase its direct role in the economy during the
transition period in an attempt tz manage the process more effectively and
cushion the social shock. The program includes short-term measures to addrest
the most pressing socin'l prob'ems, mainly through public spending on housing,
infrastructure investment,  and social programs.   It also aims to loosen
progressively the external resource constraint.  This is to be accomplished
through a three-year austerity program to restrain import demand and reduce
external (especially shorter-term) indebtedness, together with major new
investments to expand hydrocarbon export capacity.  The strategy excludes a
formal debt rescheduling.   however, bilateral refinancing agreements were
concluded in 1991 with a major trading partner and with a syndicate of
international banks.
1.7         Short-term  Mteasures.   To implement the austerity program, the
Government has introduced new restrictions on the exchange and trade regime,
includingq (i) the establishment of an interministerial committee to ensure that
ceilings on shorter-term external borrowing are respected and that the import
requirements of essential activities are met, (ii) the suspension of certain
luxury imports, and (iii) the ineligibility of other non-essential imports for
access to official foreign exchange and external credit. The Government views
these restrictions as a temporary step back from the sweeping trade
liberalization announced in mid-1991. In particular, it plans to establish a
free market for foreign exchange in the coming months with the intention of
unifying the official and free market rates over a three-year period. While the
official fixed exchange rate is expected to remain rtable, the share of
transactions occurring through the free market will be expanded over time. The
austerity program also includes a major effort to limit wage increases, notably
in the public administration.
1 8         Other short-term priorities include alleviating the housing shortage
and promoting employment. The Government is accelerating the delivery of ome
360,000 public housing units planned or under construccion. The authorities
understand, however, that generating a supply response sufficient to eliminate
the enormous housing shortfall requires extensive structural reform, and they
have initiated a comprehensive reform program for the housing sector (para. 2* 1).
To allow time for these reforms to take hold, the Government has also decided to
initiate a limited number of new public rental housing programs which will be
targeted strictly to low-income groups and implemented under market conditions
with bidding procedures fully open to private contractors.  In addition to
stimulating housing construction, the Government is attempting to promote
employment through an increase in public infrastructure investment.
1.9         Stabilization and Reform. The Government is aware of the importance
of achieving its short-term objectives through a strategy which maintains
macroeconomic stability and furthers economic reform.   The importance of
additional stabilization efforts is underscored by the acceleration in CPI
inflation from 6 percent in 1988 to over 30 percent in 1992. Recently, budgetary
revenues have not kept pace with expenditures, however, leading to the
reemergence of large deficits. The Treasury's overall balance shifted from a 1
percent of GDP surplus in 1991 to a 7 percent deficit in 1992. These deficits



risk crowding out non-goverr,ment investment and sustaining inflationary
pressures.   There is an urgent need for the authorities to review public
expenditure levels and priorities, and improve the targeting of social programs.
1.10        In parallel with stabilization, restoring growth requires that the
momentum of economic reform be maintained. Particular consideration should be
given to replacing the new administrative restrictions on the trade and exchange
regime with more market-based measures capable of achieving the sought-after
objectives at lower economic cost. Several key initiatives have recently been
undertaken in favor of the private sector, which the Government recognizes as
essential to sustainable growth.   These include: (i) the decision to allow
autonomous public enterprises to open their capital to private investors, up to
100 percent in affiliates and 49 percent in parent holding companies; and (ii)
the adoptien in January 1993 of a revised Commercial Code authorizing the
creation of joint-stock companies and establishing bankruptcy procedures for
public enterprises. An Investment Code, which will clarify the legal framework
and incentives for foreign investors, is expected to be adopted in the coming
weeks. Further efforts are needed to promote private initiative, notably with
regard to the financial sector, and to restructure public enterprises, including
privatization where appropriate. A return to growth is unlikely, however, until
external resource constraints are relaxed, which underscores the importance of
a viable external financing plan. The authorities expect to conclude several
major production-sharing agreements with foreign oil companies which will provid-
additional resources.  These agreements will increase the confidence of the
international community in the management of the Algerian economy.
1II TEs PROJECT
2.1         In tandem with its adjustment program and market economy reforms, t.sle
Government of Algeria (GOA) has embarked on an in-depth reform of the housing
sector. The main objectives of the reform are twofold. The first and short-term
ciJective is to alleviate the severe ho)using shortage by generating a significant
supply response to ongoing sector reforms, focusing simultaneously ons the rapid
completion of the current public housing program (26b.000 under construction);
enhancement of private sector participation (450,000 units under construction)
through, inter alia, establishing a more level playing field between public and
private contractors; liberalizing real estate development; and freeing the rental
housing market (18 percent of the housing stock was vacant or only partly
occupied during the 1987 census), by taking specific actions on the regulatory
framework. The second and mediLum-term objective is to remove the major obstacles
that are impeding the functioning of the housing market. During the current
period of transition to a market economy, it is GOA's intention to create a
sustainable environment for the housing market, whre critical constraints on
property rights, housing finance, and housing subsidies are gradually removed,
along with the setting up of a new institutional framework, with a more balanced
public versus private role.
2.2         The major constraint to an immediate increase of the current housing
production, whether public or private, is the deficit of critical building
materials. Until local production increases substantially, the Government has no
choice but to facilitate imports of critical building materials to complement
domestic production. However, while this production is being stimulated by recent
price liberalization (June 1992), as well as by the on-going restructuring



program of the constructicn industry, the following basic constraints would also
have to be removed to generate a quick supply response: weakness of the
management functions of the public devolopers in charge of the public housing
program for rent (SHPR); unaffordable building and technical standards; weaktiess
of the production and distribution system of building materials; inhibition of
the private formal secLor and self-help construction sector, particularly with
regard to access of serviced land, as well as to the rental market.
2.'         Major actions are also needed on the demand side in the following key
arias: (a) develop a sound framework for housing finance reform, implying the
restructuring of the current housing finance monopoly institution (CNEP),
adjustments to the structure and increases in the level of interest rates, and
creation of appropriate mortgage instruments; (b) reform hc.sing policy, in order
to reduce housing subsidies to fiscally sustainable levels end better focus on
the lower income groups; and (c) streamline the management of property rights in
order to facilitate households' mcbility, devalop a private rental market, and
avoid a massive increase in squatters.
2.4         As highlighted in a Sector Development Letter, attached to the Staff
Appraisal Report No 11545-AL, the Government is firmly committed to these key
reforms and actions, which deserve Bank support. Above two pronged strategies,
where short-term versus medium-term actions, as well as key policy actions on the
supply-side and the demand-side can be clearely discerned, underline the
justification for and the structure of the project.
2.S         Project ObJectives.  The main objective of the project would be to
trigger a quick housing supply response, and to support and enhance the medium-
term objectives and priorities of the market oriented reforms of the housing
sector, through:
(a)   accelerating the completion of both the public housing program under
construction and the private unfinished stock, as well as
encouraging the private sector to use the existing housing stock
more efficiently;
(b)  assisting GOA in creating adequate policy and institutional sector
framework during the transitional period, by providing technical
assistance on sector policy formulation and implementation.
2.6         Project Description. The project includes the completion of a social
housing program for sale, an import program of critical building materials for
the private sector, and a technical assistance program, as follows:
(a)  Social Housing Program for Sale (SHPS).  This component (US$130
million from the Bank loan) would accelerate the completion of
about 51, 000 social housing units for sale, under EPLFsI management,
through: supply of strategic construction materials (cement, wood
and steel rods), finishing products, and small equipment and spare-
parts, for the 1993-95 import needs of the SHPS;
(b)   Private Housing Program. Targeted primarily to self-help builders,
this component (US$ 65 million from the Bank loan) would assist the
private sector in completing its unfinished housing stock. It would
supply the private sector with strategic construction materials
(cement, wood and steel rods); and



6 -
(c)   Technical assistance program (TA). This component would assist the
Government in implementing key housing policy objectives in the
following three critical areas: improving housing supply incentives;
reforming housing finance, through the entry of CNEP into the
banking sector; and reforming and better targeting housing
subsidies.   In addition, the TA program would provide specific
support to the Ministry of Housing to mitigate the negative
environmental impact of the housing construction sector.
2.7         Rati.onale for Bank Involvement. Bank missions to Algeria in 1991 and
1992 have undertaken an in-depth review of the housing reform program launched
by the Government. They have found the program consistent and proceeding in the
right direction. This program, as well as the Bank recommendations for further
actions, were detailed in a Housing Sector Report, d-ated April 14, 1992 (Report
No. 10435-AL).   However, due to the sluggish supply response, particularly
impeded by a severe shortage of critical building materials, the resulting
housing shortage is hindering the reform program, to the point of seriously
exacerbating the current social crisis. Rapid Bank involvement in providing
urgently needed foreign exchange for the import of critical materials is vital
to ease the severe supply crisis, decrease the damaging economic effects of
delays in completing housing projects, and enhance the credibility of the reform
program.
2.8         Bank involvement is also crucial to assist the Government in
implementing the reform program. The project would not only complement the EFSAL
in the housing finance sector, but also help initiate key policy actions aimed
at deepening reforms with far-reaching long-term implications on the demand side.
Further, it would support preparatory work for future Bank assistance programs
in key priority areas, including the provision of infrastructure and serviced
residential land, and the creation of a mortgage market.
2.9         Project Implementation.  The loan would be made to the Government,
but, in order to eliminate price distortions in the domestic market, selected
importers under the private housing program would have access to the Bank loan
through on-lending arrangements in foreign exchange, under terms equivalent to
those of commercial credits, i.e. 360 days maturity with interest rate based on
LIBOR. Such a procedure will not apply to the SHPS, since the social units for
sale are strictly targeted. Under this component, imports will be financed
through a swap of loan proceeds for the equivalent amount of dinars at the
official exchange rate, the Government bearing the full foreign exchange risk.
However, the Government has committed itself to replace the implicit import
subsidy linked with the difference between commercial and concessional credit
lines, with an explicit budgetary subsidy, starting in March 1994 for all new
housing operations.
2.10        Project monitoring. To permit close monitoring of progress under the
project, the following key instruments have been agreed upon: (a) detailed
implementation plans which provide monitorable benchmarks for implementing
housing finance and subsidy reforms, in ccmpliance with agreed dated covenants,
as well as for performance of the SHPS, in terms of number of units to be
delivered, according to an agreed calendar. It will be the responsibility of the
Project Coordination Committee (PCC), to be established within the Ministry of
Housing (MOH) with representatives of key ministries involved, to monitor the
implementation plans; (b) a mid-term review will be carried out by Bank staff not
later than October 31, 1994, to assess progress made on both the Sector



- 7 -
Development Program and the implementation plans. During negotiations, it was
agreed that, should such progress be considered unsatisfactory by the Bank, and
should the Government and the Bank fail to agree on a new timetable of actions,
the Bank will be entitled to suspend disbursement under the loan. Prior to
suspension, all feasible and alternative options would be scrutinized to meet the
objectives of the project, including auctioning rather than finishing part of the
public housing program; and (c) a continuous tracking of imported materials,
which will ensure that loan proceeds are used for the intended purpose under the
project. Systematic pre-shipment inspections will be required for all imports,
and specific procedures will apply for materials sold by importers to public and
private contractors, as follows: Imports for SHPS will be fully documented in
advance; and materials sold to the private sector will be subject to an ex-post
review on a sampling basis.
2.11        Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project is estimated at
about US$585 million. The proposed loan of US$200 million would finance 93% of
the project's estimated foreign costs, equivalent to 44* of total project cost
net of taxes and duties.  The loan would finance the public and private housing
programs in amounts of US$130 million and US$65 million respectively. However,
the loan sharing between the public and the private sector would reach 53% and
47% respectively, taking into consideration that about 20* of SEPS contractors
are private contractors. The Government and/or the final beneficiaries would
finance the remaining foreign costs, as well as all local costs, including US$103
million equivalent of duties and taxes. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
2.12        Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 11545-AL is being distributed separately.
2.13        Principal Actions Agreed upon:
(a)   Schedule of completion of the SHPS, leading to the delivery of the
entire appraised progra¢. (11,300 units) by December 31, 1995;
(b)   Housing finance reform: plan of action with specific dated covenants
in 1993 and 1994 for the transformation of CNEP into a commercial
housing bank, not later than September 30, 1995. Dated covenants
include measures to raise CNEP standard interest rates to banking
sector level;
(c)   Subsidy reform: plan of action with specific dated covenants in 1993
and 1994, leading to: (i) a decrease of the overall housing subsidy
level, starting in 1994; (ii) a satisfactory budgetary allocation of
housing subsidies in 1994, and the setting-up of a multi-year
subsidy program for the subsequent years; (iii) full cost recovery
for public housing for rent; and (iv) reform of the subsidy system
for housing purchases;
(d)   enactment of legislation not later than March 1, 1993 on: real
estate development; contractual relationship between owners and
renters; and rules governing co-ownership;



- a -
(e)   as a condition of effectiveness: on-lending arrangements for the
financing of the private housing program would have to be entered
into by the Government with selected importers in an amount
equivalent to at least US$40.0 million; and
(f)   as conditions to continue disbursement:
(i)   by March 31, 1W94, and for all new housing operations, the
budgetary law should include specific measuzes, including
managing procedures and targeting, to replace the implicit
import subsidy linked to the difference between commercial and
conce_,sional credit lines, with an explicit budgetary subsidy;
(ii) at mid-term review, the SHPS should be delivered according to
the agreed schedule; agreed dated covenants to implement
housing finance and subsidies reforms should be met; and
progress in implementing the Sector Development Program should
be satisfactory to the Bank. Suspensiou of disbursement will
occur only if the Government and the Bank fail to agree on a
new timetable of actions.
2.14        Lessons from Previous bank Involvement.  The proposed project would
be the first housing project in Algeria. The main lessons learned from Bank
involvement in Algeria are primarily related to project implementation delay,
leading to a large oustanding Bank portfolio.   While this generic issue is
currently addressed through a series of actions to improve portfolio management,
including procurement and disbursement procedures, and implementation review at
the country level, projects entering in the portfolio would have to pay
particular attention on the following: ensure full commitment of the Government
at each stage of project preparation, avoid overly complex design, and establish
detailed implementation plans, whenever possible. The proposed project has taken
thebe recommendations into account, in particular through: (a) an intensive
dialogue with the Government, conducive to a fully internalized Sector
Development letter, where critical actions scheduled for implementation in the
short, medium and long-term are clearly stated; (b) detailed implementation plans
for each of the project components, which provide a complete set of instruments
for ensuring timely project implementation; and (c) a mid-term review to evaluate
project performance against agreed benchmarks reflected in the Loan Agreement.
2.15        Unvirommental Impact.  Primary environmental issues relate to the
mitigation of negative environmental impacts in the following areas: collection
of sand and gravel, water supply, wastewater, and solid wastes. Accordingly, the
project has been rated Category B. To minimize the negative impact resulting
from housing development, the project's TA component would finance two long-term
consultants specialized in environmental impact assessment and environmental
training. Their main tasks would be to help address the above negative impact,
by carrying out detailed environmental impact assessments of on-going
construction, and strengthening environmental management and implementing
capacities within MOH; train urban planners and environmental specialists at the
national and local level; and increase the level of cooperation between
appropriate ministries and agencies to address environmental issues in the
housing sector.



2.16        Benefits and Risks.   First, the project would result in immediate
benefits to: (a) the economy as a whole, by reducing the annual economic losses
due to construction delays, currently about 2% of GDP; (b) low and medium-income
households (44% of the potential beneficiaries have a monthly income below
US$225) who would benefit from the anticipated availability of the targeted
51,000 social housing for sale; and (e) self-help private developers, who would
be in a better position to compete with the public sector for the acquisition of
building materials. becond, the TA program would provide longer term benefits to:
(a) the housing sector as a whole, through the acceleration of key sector
reforms, both on the supply side and on the demand side; (b) the State budget,
which currently finances, through CNEP, 100 percent of the social program for
rent, and is heavily committed to subsidizing the housing sector, through
restructuring of the current subsidy schemes; (c) private developers, who would
benefit from incentives to build for the rental market; and (d) low-income
households, who would be targeted under a new housing assistance program,
directly linked to their income level.
2.17        In the short term, the primary project risk lies in Algeria's
political and economic uncertainties, which could lead to an acceleration of
social tensions, and therefore negatively impact the implementation of sectoral
reforms, as well as their management. Mitigation of this risk for the project
would come from: (a) a strong Government commitment to reform the housing sector,
evidenced by the content of its policy letter; and (b) a careful implementation
review of the agreed plans of action. Another short term risk, exacerbated by
the visibility of the project and its social impact, could come from the non-
accomplishment of the targeted SHPS program. The mid-term review would assess
this risk, and, if needed, would define specific measures to ensure timely
project completion.  In the longer term, as far as project sustainability is
concerned, the main risk would be the persistence of a weak supply response to
housing reforms, prolonging the role of the State as a direct provider of social
housing. Mitigation of this risk would come from the Government's commitment to
pursue sectoral reforms and to produce strictly social safety net units, where
family income determines eligibility.
2.18        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
