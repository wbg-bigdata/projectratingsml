Loan 2850-JM
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Sugar
Rehabilitation Project (SSRP), for which Loan 2850-JM in the amount of US$34 million
was approved on June 17, 1987 and made effective on October 30, 1987.
The Closing Date of the Loan was extended to September 30, 1995,
compared with the original closing date of September 30, 1993. The project was
redesigned in April 1992 and US$4.15 million canceled. Final disbursement took place on
February 9, 1996. US$29.12 million was disbursed.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Daniel Moreau, Task Manager, Natural
Resources Management and Rural Poverty Division, Latin America and the Caribbean
Region and Mrs. Anne del Castillo, Economist, Consultant. The ICR was reviewed by
Jonathan Parker, Acting Division Chief, Natural Resources Management and Rural
Poverty Division and Robert Crown, Project Advisor, Country Department In. The
Borrower provided its own contribution to the report which has been summarized as an
annex to the report.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/
completion mission, September 1995. It is based on material in the project file and
discussions with representatives of the Borrower's staff and the beneficiaries.

SECOND SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
Loan 2850-JM
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    In 1978, a First Sugar Rehabilitation Project was initiated to restore the sugar
production to 225,000 tons at the Frome, Monymusk and Bernard Lodge factories. The
project performance was poor mainly because its scope was limited exclusively to factory
rehabilitation, while the cane area and yields continued to decrease. In 1984, the
Government started discussions with the Bank on the possibility of a Second Sugar
Rehabilitation Project focusing on field as well as factory operations. A Government
commissioned study revealed that the Bernard Lodge factory was not economically viable
and that the industry needed major structural reforms. In 1985, the fixed assets and
outstanding shares of Frome and Monymusk were transferred to Jamaica Sugar Holdings,
Ltd. (JSH), a newly-formed Government entity. A Bank mission reviewed and endorsed
the Government's policy towards the sugar industry to reduce sugar imports, maintain
exports to preferential markets, sustain employment, and create a financially self-
supporting industry. The Bank agreed to finance an investment program for the sector
and the project was appraised in May 1987 and a loan of US$34.0 million was approved in
June 1987.
A.   Project Objectives
2.    The original objectives of the project were to: (i) rationalize sugar production by
concentrating production in efficient sugar mills; (ii) maintain national sugar production at
240,000 tons, a level sufficient to satisfy the domestic market and the European and U.S.
export markets, to which Jamaica has access under special arrangements; (iii) improve the
overall efficiency and financial viability of the sugar industry; and (iv) strengthen the Sugar
Industry Research Institute (SIRI).
3.    In 1991, the Bank and the GOJ through an informal agreement, decided to
concentrate project resources on the following objectives: (i) regulatory reforn and
preparation of the public sugar mills for privatization; (ii) rehabilitation of specific
irrigation systems, including infrastructure investment, training and extension services; and
(iii) elimination of public subsidies for irrigation operation and maintenance costs (O&M)
by introducing irrigation charges which cover O&M costs and encouraging the
establishment of Water Users' Associations (WUA).



General Description
4.    The principal components to be financed under the original project were:
*  Part A: rehabilitation of Frome and Monymusk factories and estates, under
JSH control;
*  Part B: technical and managerial assistance to JSH under a ten-year
management contract with TLTS;
* Part C: rehabilitation of the public irrigation systems in the Southern Plains
area to benefit Monymusk;
*  Part D: upgrading of the capabilities of SIRI by providing training and
equipment; and
*  Part E: strengthening of a project monitoring and coordination unit.
B.   Implementation Experience.
5.    During project implementation, the Jamaica Sugar Holdings (JSE) company
responsible for implementing the sugar industry rehabilitation component of the project
(Part A) was unable to generate adequate counterpart funds to support project
investments, and could not service its debt under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the
Government. In November 1991, by virtue of a request from the GOJ, the unexpended
portion under the Jamaica Sugar Holdings' component was transferred to the
"unallocated" disbursement category. The Frome and Monymusk factories and estates
were subsequently divested and sold to the private sector in late 1993.
6.    In April 1992, the Bank agreed informally with the GOJ to limit the project to its
irrigation and research components. Pending the preparation of a comprehensive
irrigation plan for the Mid-Clarendon Plains, loan disbursements for the irrigation
component (Part C) were put on hold in March, 1991, with resumption in April, 1992.
C.   Achievement of Objectives and Results.
7.    Albeit by a combination of means, two major project objectives were
accomplished: the divestment of public sugar factories and estates, as well as sugar price
liberalization. Nevertheless, the project performance as measured by its re-estimated
internal economic rate of return of negative 172 percent and negative net present value (at
12 percent discount rate) was not satisfactory. The project achievements are as follows:
(a)   The Sugar Industry
(i)   production has been concentrated on two units (Frome and Monymusk
factories). Despite the difficulties encountered by JSH, the implementation of the
sugar industry rehabilitation component arrested and reversed the decline of both
JSH factories. Equipment and facilities, provided under the project have resulted
in some upgrading of these two critical sugar factories, which may have



-iv -
strengthened the Government's position with respect to negotiations for their
divestment;
(ii)   sugar production level of the two plants was sustained. For Frome and
Monymusk factories, total sugar production was in 1986/87 of 101,245 tons and in
1992/93 of 101,648 tons. However, the factories combined sugar output was
nearly 60 percent below the appraisal target levels. The threat of the loss of the
preferential EEC market for sugar never materialized.
(iii)  however, the overall efficiency and financial viability of the industry was
not improved. The cane/tons sugar ratios worsened, increasing to about 11.7 at
Frome and 13.1 at Monymusk, as compared with pre-project levels of respectively
10 and 11.4. Between 1988 and 1991, despite US$20 million in loan-financed
managerial services and equipment, the JSH produced increasingly greater annual
operating losses, resulting in aggregated financial losses of approximately US$70
million. As a result, the JSH could not generate adequate counterpart funds to
support project investments, and eventually, could not service its debt under the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Government. The sugar factories were
eventually divested under the Private Sector Development Adjustment Operation
(Ln. 36220-JM).
(b)   The Irrigation Rehabilitation Program. The irrigation rehabilitation program
was designed to raise sugar production and improve the productivity of the sugar
estates. After reformation, the revised physical objectives of the irrigation system
rehabilitation program were fully achieved, but the use of irrigated land to grow cane
proved uneconomic. Major improvements have been made with regard to irrigation
water pricing legislation, but profitability of growing cane will not support the
mandated cost recovery. In the project irrigation area, Water Users Associations
have been established and trained so that, with their irrigation infrastructure fully
rehabilitated and operational, the WUAs have the entire responsibility for the
operation and management of the irrigation schemes.
(c)    The Institutional Strengthening Program of the Sugar Industry Research
Institute (SIRI). This program has been successfully implemented. SIRI has been
reorganized with the amalgamation of the Agricultural and Factory Divisions based
in Mandeville. The upgrading of the central laboratory has increased the quality and
quantity of analyses that can now be carried out. New more productive varieties of
sugar cane have been released.
8.    Project Performance and Sustainability. The project was instrumental in
promoting sound sectoral policies and establishing satisfactory institutional arrangements
that will benefit the major stakeholders in the sector - i.e., the Government, private
investors, the work force employed by the industry and the producers. The sugars mills
under private-ownership are in a better position to become more efficient. SIRI is now an



efficient research institute. However, the project's economic cost far outweighed its
social-economic benefits, and the project had a significantly negative rate of return.
9.    Bank Performance. The Bank's performance in project preparation and design
was unsatisfactory. The project design reveals a fundamental disregard for basic economic
concepts and appraisal was based upon poorly prepared background data. In addition, the
Bank could have been more scrupulous in its review and approval of procurement and the
relationship between the Bank and major contractors. The program for improving the
efficiency and financial viability of the sugar industry needed detailed key performance
indicators that would have helped monitor the restructuring process. The Bank's
supervision performance has been satisfactory. The Bank assisted in ensuring sound
policy for the sugar and irrigation sub-sector. The Bank was flexible in terms of delaying,
modifying and redesigning the project. The Bank was responsive to the Government's
request to extend the closing date by two years so that the irrigation rehabilitation
program could be entirely completed.
10.   Borrower Performance. The borrower's performance is considered as mixed in
terms of sector policies, financial policies, institutional development, physical objectives,
social objectives and overall preparation, implementation and operation. The
Government's commitment to embark on a major restructuring of the sugar industry was
impaired by the highly politicized structure of the sugar sector in Jamaica. The project
was soundly managed and effective inter-institutional working relationships were
maintained. However, while many of the project objectives were eventually achieved, the
project was only marginally instrumental and its outcome and its economic performance,
as evidenced in the ex-post IERR, were unsatisfactory.
11.   Findings and Key Lessons Learned. The most significant lessons learned are as
follows that: (i) restructuring of public sector enterprises, with a view to making them
more efficient, usually is not successful. Divestment through outright sale has been shown
to be most effective; (ii) high quality appraisal is a sine qua non for a sound project; (iii)
the Bank needs to be scrupulous when it deviates from Bank procurement guidelines; (iv)
a sustainable project must be based on sound economic policies for achieving sectoral
objectives; (v) irrigation of sugar cane does not represent an efficient use of water; and
(vi) the role of the government in the irrigation sub-sector should be limited to defining
policies, enforcing legislation, and promoting sustainable irrigated farming development
strategies.
12.   Future Operations. None planned so far.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2850-JM)
JAMAICA
PART I:  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Background
1.    Jamaica is a relatively small country in the Caribbean, covering about 11,000 sq.
km. and having a strong natural resource base. Its population of approximately 2.4
million people (1990) increases at a modest annual rate of 1.9 percent. While agriculture
accounts for only 7 percent of GDP, 27 percent of the work force is engaged in farming
and almost half the population lives in rural areas. Small farmers, cultivating the hillsides,
produce a wide range of annual crops (pulses, root crops and vegetables) and perennials
(citrus, bananas, cocoa and coffee). The large-scale plantation export crops, primarily
sugarcane, are grown on the flat coastal plains. Sugar has long been a cornerstone of the
economy, an important source of income, employment and foreign exchange. Since
1970, sugar output has steadily declined, the main reasons being: (a) a decline in the
supply and quality of cane from Government-owned or managed estates; (b) neglect of
the irrigation networks in the Southern Central Plains, coupled with salinization and
drainage problems, and; (c) excessive unit production costs in the public sector factories.
2.    Request for Assistance A First Sugar Rehabilitation Project was initiated in
1978 to restore the annual sugar production to 225,000 tons at the Frome, Monymusk
and Bernard Lodge factories. The project performance was poor because of its limited
scope, focusing exclusively on factory rehabilitation, while cane acreage and yields
continued to decline. In 1984, the Government started discussions with the Bank on the
possibility of a Second Sugar Rehabilitation Project focusing on field as well as factory
operations. A study revealed that the Bernard Lodge factory was not financially viable
and that major structural reforms in the industry were needed. In 1985, the fixed assets
and outstanding shares of Frome and Monymusk were transferred to Jamaica Sugar
Holdings, Ltd. (JSH), a newly-formed Government entity.
3.    Bank Response. The findings of the Bank mission endorsed the Government's
policy towards the sugar industry to reduce sugar imports, maintain exports to
preferential markets, sustain employment, and create a financially self-supporting
industry. The proposed project was to have a six year implementation period with the
following components: (a) rehabilitation of Frome and Monymusk factories and estates,
which were under Jamaica Sugar Holding's (JSH) control; (b) technical and managerial
assistance under a ten-year management contract with Tate and Lyle Technical Services
(TLTS); (c) rehabilitation of the public irrigation systems in the Southern Central Plains
area to benefit Monymusk; (d) upgrading the capabilities of the Sugar Industry Research



-2 -
Institute (SIRI) by providing training and equipment; and (e) strengthening of a project
monitoring and coordination unit.
4.    Statement of Objectives. The original objectives of the project were to:
(i) rationalize sugar production by concentrating production in efficient sugar mills;
(ii) maintain national sugar production at 240,000 tons, a level sufficient to satisfy the
domestic market and the European and US export markets, to which Jamaica has access
under special arrangements; (iii) improve the overall efficiency and financial viability of
the sugar industry; and (iv) strengthen the SIRI.
5.    In December 1991, the Bank and the GOJ agreed informally to concentrate
project resources on the achievement of the following objectives: (i) regulatory reform
and preparation of the public sugar mills for privatization; (ii) rehabilitation of specific
irrigation systems, including infrastructure investment, training and extension services;
and (iii) elimination of public subsidies for irrigation operation and maintenance costs
(O&M) by introducing irrigation charges which cover O&M costs and encouraging the
establishment of Water Users' Associations (WUA).
6.    Evaluation of Objectives. The project's aim to increase the efficiency and
viability of the Jamaican sugar sector was valid. The sugar sector was extremely
important to the economy as a principal foreign exchange earner as well as a significant
source of rural employment. In addition, at the time, the fiscal burden of maintaining the
sector was growing. Hence, increasing the efficiency of the sugar sector was high
priority.
7.    The objectives of the refocused project regarding the irrigation sub-sector were
not sufficiently clear to ensure long-term sustainability. Because of poor maintenance,
deteriorating irrigation infrastructure was in urgent need of rehabilitation. It was also
important to ensure the sustainability of these investments with the establishment of
effective cost recovery policies and Water Users' Associations. But to be sustainable
these investments would need to be directed to production of crops (such as fruits,
vegetables and flowers, but not cane) with market values which yield margins sufficient to
cover O&M costs.
8.    General Description. The principal components to be financed under the
original project were:
*   Part A: Rehabilitation of Frome and Monymusk factories and estates, under
JSH control;
*  Part B: Technical and managerial assistance to JSH under a ten-year
management contract with TLTS;
* Part C: Rehabilitation of the public irrigation systems in the Southern Plains
area to benefit Monymusk;
* Part D: Upgrading of the capabilities of SIRI by providing training and
equipment; and



-3 -
Part E: Strengthening of a project monitoring and coordination unit.
B.   Achievement of Objectives and Results
Sugar Sector
9.    Rationalization of Sugar Industry. Actually, the project did not achieve its
objective of concentrating sugar production to efficient units. During project
implementation, the Government-controlled JSX composed of the Frome and Monymusk
mills, experienced significant financial difficulties. This was primarily because the
potentially viable mill, Frome, was forced to subsidize Monymusk, by absorbing its
substantial financial losses.
10.   Maintain Annual National Sugar Production During the project life, national
sugar cane production fell from 237,000 tons in 1988 to 210,000 tons in 1995 with
yields, during the same period, falling from 65 tons per ha to 60 tons per ha. Production
from the Frome and Monymusk factories was virtually unchanged; with a level of
101,245 tons in 1987/88 and 101,648 tons in 1992/93, when the Bank terminated its
support to the plants. Throughout the project, the plant's combined actual average
annual production levels were 25 percent and 34 percent below the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) estimated levels. Furthermore, cane/ton sugar ratios in Frome and
Monymusk worsened, increasing from 10 and 11.4 to about 11.7 and 13.1, respectively
(Table 5).
11.   Improve the overall efficiency and financial viability of the industry. To
increase the efficiency of the sugar industry, the project proposed to provide to the two-
largest state owned sugar mills technical assistance, primarily through a 10-year
managerial contract, and equipment and machinery. Between 1988 and 1991, despite
US$20 million in loan-financed managerial services and equipment, the JSH produced
increasingly greater annual operating losses, resulting in aggregated financial losses of
approximately US$70 million. As a result, the JSH could not generate adequate
counterpart funds to support project investments, and eventually, could not service its
debt under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Government.
12.   Reform of the regulatory framework and prepare the public sugar mills for
privatization. With the strong pressure from the Private Sector Development
Adjustment Loan (PSAL, Ln.36220-JW), this objective was achieved. In February 1992
the Government agreed to pursue deregulation and privatization of the sugar industry.
Taking at least two public sugar mills to "the point of sale" and introducing reforms to
liberalize the sugar sector were two conditions met for the release of the second tranche
of the PSAL.
13.   Significant refonns were introduced to permit greater private sector participation
in domestic and international sugar marketing. In addition, the JSH sugar mills, along
with Bernard Lodge, were sold to a private sector consortium, which included the British
sugar company which had provided the technical assistance under the project, Tate and
Lyle. The estimated sale price for the factories, was US$54 million, considerably below



- 4 -
the 1988 estimated value of the Frome and Monymusk fixed assets of US$76 million.
Critics of the divestment claim that the exercise served only to replace the public
monopoly with a private one (or rather recreated the old one). After divestment, a single
interest maintained control of 75 percent of the country's milling capacity.
Irrigation Rehabilitation Component
14.   The irrigation rehabilitation program (Part C) was to raise sugar production and
improve the productivity of the sugar estates. As the result of a significant reformation
during implementation, the revised physical objectives of the irrigation system
rehabilitation program were met.
15.   Rehabilitation of specific irrigation systems. Canals and wells, on more than
5,700 ha of primarily large sugar plantations (zones 1, 2, 3, and 4), were rehabilitated. In
addition, during project implementation, a water resource integration plan, incorporating
four zones, was designed and completed.
16.   Irrigation Policy Development.
(a)   Introduce irrigation charges covering full operation and maintenance
(O&M) costs An important objective of the redesigned project was
ensure the sustainability of the rehabilitated irrigation systems by
introducing water charges that cover O&M costs, improving collection
rates and establishing WUA. The project was instrumental in promoting
regulatory and legislative reforms to allow charging users rates which
reflected O&M costs. As a result of the project, the agricultural water
users could be assessed for overhead, fixed and variable costs But,
because irrigated sugar cane production is not efficient in the prevailing
conditions, cane producers' profit margins were not sufficient to cover
irrigation O&M costs.
(b)   Establish Water Users Associations. In addition, in the project irrigation
area, the Mid-Clarendon Plains, Water Users Associations (WUA) were
established and trained so that, with their irrigation infrastructure fully
rehabilitated and operational, the WUAs would assume the responsibility
for the O&M of the schemes.
(c)   Eliminate irrigation subsidies Project accomplishments in this area were
modest. During the life of the project, public subsidies for irrigated water
in the project area fell from 95 percent to 85 percent of O&M costs.
Institutional Strengthening Program of the Sugar Industry Research Institute
(SUM
17.   While behind the Appraisal schedule, most of the objectives and targets of this
component (Part D) were successfully attained. SIRI was reorganized and the
Agricultural and Factory Division was consolidated into its headquarters in Mandeville.



-5 -
This resulted not only in significant savings in operational costs, but also improved the
laboratory's services to producers and manufacturers. In addition, SIRI designed and
implemented a new cane quality payment system, providing, for the first time, tangible
incentives to farmers and manufacturers to invest in quality control. Improvement in
SIRI extension services reduced the time needed from cane cutting to factory delivety by
40 percent. In addition, SIRI's varietal selection program enhanced the industry's
capabilities of producing higher yielding sugar cane varieties.
C.   Major Factors Affecting the Project
18. Factors Not Subject to Government Control. Project performance was
substantially effected by the unrealistic assessment made at appraisal regarding the
financial and economic viability of the sector, in general and the factories, in particular.
Hurricane Gilbert of September 1988, which devastated the island's cane plantations,
provoked losses of about US$18 million to both Frome and Monymusk (see figures in
Table 5 for the 1988/89 crop year). In addition, (i) debt service on short-term loans; and
(ii) exchange losses on foreign debt aggravated JSH's more chronic financial problems.
19. Factors Subject to Government Control. Project performance was generally
satisfactory in terms of factors subject to Government control such as appointment of key
staff, provision of counterpart funds and adherence to acceptable administrative
procedures.
20.    Factors Subject to ImplementingAgency controL Project performance was also
generally satisfactory in terms of factors subject to implementing agency control such as
management effectiveness, staffing, cost changes, procurement, etc.
D.    Bank Performance
21.   Preparation and Appraisal. The project reflects poor preparation and appraisal.
This project was designed to increase the efficiency and financial viability of the sugar
industry by providing technical and financial support to perpetuate publicly owned and
subsidized sugar mills and estates. But, only by calling for significant transfers from the
domestic consumer to the industry would the project be able to ensure the financial
sustainability in the sector. During preparation, there was apparently no comparative
evaluation of the relative merits of other measures to increase economic efficiency, such
as divestment, market liberalization and crop diversification. On the contrary, the
prevention of privatization was originally identified as one of the project's major benefits.
22.   The rationale behind the strategy chosen is difficult to appreciate. It would be
facile to explain away the faulty project design as being the product of a Bank not yet
prepared to fully endorse privatization as a viable project option. Indeed, at the time of
preparation, the Bank was much involved in divestment and privatization activities. In
addition, the Board, upon review of the project, specifically queried Bank staff
concerning the desirability of the consolidation of State market participation.



-6 -
23.   The information provided to the Bank by the Borrower's consulting engineer at
Appraisal was unreliable and misleading1. The Bank, by waiting until negotiations for the
presentation of important financial data (as a condition of negotiation), may have lacked
sufficient time to detect inconsistencies in the data. Had the Bank management access to
accurate information during appraisal, it is unlikely the Bank would have supported this
project, as designed.
24.   The project aimed to address the sugar sectors financial problems by improving
management and rehabilitating the plant and estates. The appraisal assumed that: (i) the
mills would be supported by revenues from the excess profits earned from selling sugar in
the internal market at the export parity price (the weighted average of the price received
in the preferential international markets); (ii) earnings of the Frome factory would be
sufficient to absorb the losses of the Monymusk factory; and (iii) the factories' cane
supply would increase by 40 percent during the life of the project.
25.   Regarding the first assumption, a Loan Covenant (3.04(c)) required that the
Borrower sell sugar in the domestic market at the export parity price. The export parity
price was the weighted average of the prices Jamaica received for the preferential
European and US markets (average (1984-1986) annual price of US$385/ton). During
the time of project appraisal, this price was nearly double the import parity price (average
(1984-1986) annual price of US$190/ton). By charging the Jamaican consumer the
export parity price and not the import parity prices, the covenant would have imposed a
substantial tax on the Jamaican consumer to support the sugar industry. According to the
GOJ, adherence to this covenant from 1988 to 1992, would have represented a
tremendous and unwarranted economic burden to the general consumer public of
Jamaica. Because of the political implications of increasing the cost of a food staple, the
GOJ never complied with this covenant 2.
26.   With respect to the other assumptions, the losses of Monymusk proved to be
substantially greater than had been projected at Appraisal. As a result, Frome was not
able to carry the financial burden of Monymusk. This could have been anticipated at
see SAR Annex 14 (p.57). Projected ex-factory raw sugar prices for Frome and Monymusk factories
were substantially different. The unjustifiably high prices received by Monymusk obscure the
weakness of its financial position.

2 In late 1992, because of the privatization process of the sugar industry, the covenant was no longer
relevant. The Government was no longer in control of sugar pricing and an agreed new sugar pricing
system was introduced in the 1993/94 sugar campaign.

Appraisal had the Bank access to more accurate financial inforrnation. One of the more
serious reasons why cane production failed to increase as expected was the poorly
designed project-supported irrigation rehabilitation investments on the Monymusk
estates. Failure on the part of the Bank to conduct a full technical and economic
appraisal on the irrigation component provoked serious salinization, forced cane area to
be taken out of production, and contributed to the Project's negative internal rate of
return.
27.   It would appear that detailed key performance indicators for improving the
efficiency and financial viability of the sugar industry would have helped monitor the
restructuring process. Project risks should have considered foreign exchange losses and
the possibility of the adverse weather, especially hurricanes in the Caribbean.
28.   Supervision The Bank was flexible in terms of delaying and restructuring the
project. On the basis of Supervision reports, disbursements to the sugar nills were
informally suspended from November 1991 to mid-1992. During that period, the Bank
focused on the financial situation of JSIX compliance with the sugar pricing covenant,
and ensuring sufficient cane supply to Monymusk plant. Extensive discussions were held
during the third year of project implementation with GOJ to redesign the project. The
new design involved channeling funds away from the sugar mills and the Monymusk
Irrigation Redevelopment program towards the establishment of sustainable irrigation
systems through specific infrastructure rehabilitation, appropriate water charges and
promotion of WUAs. The Bank was responsive to the Government's request to extend
the closing date by two years so that the irrigation rehabilitation program could be
entirely completed.
29.   During the early stages of project implementation, supervision, especially
regarding procurement practices, could have been more thorough. However, during the
latter part of the project, Bank supervision was greatly improved. Supervision Missions
were instrumental in re-designing the project and ensuring the provision of appropriate
technical assistance to the Borrower, particularly with respect to the formulation of sound
cost-recovery policies for irrigation systems.
30.   Procurement Throughout the life of the project, competitors of the selected
consulting firm brought to the Bank's attention their concerns of possible conflict of
interest and improprieties in procurement and contractual arrangements. As in the
previous project, the accusations in this project stem from the project's arrangements
with a service company of the consulting firm, the recipient of the long-term managerial
contract, which absorbed about a third of the US$34 million loan. In October 1985,
private contractors objected to the award, without competition, of the technical assistance
contract to the firm which was involved in project preparation. Moreover, later in 1991
concerns were raised by competitors over the role of the contracted firm as a technical
adviser and as representative of the largest suppliers of machinery and equipment to the
sugar industry in the Caribbean. The award of the contract to this firm, the former owner
of the sugar plants (who eventually repurchased the plant at the close of the project) and
manufacturers of the much of the equipment, contributed to the appearance of possible
conflict of interest. Despite the fact that the consulting firm was the sugar plant's former
owner as well as the principal contributor to project preparation, the propriety of



- 8 -
awarding the contract to this firm without competition was never considered as a serious
issue by the Bank, and no further action was taken.
E.    Borrower Performance
31.   Project Preparation and Implementation. The Government's commitment to
embark on a major restructuring of the sugar industry was impaired by the highly
politicized structure of the sugar sector in Jamaica. Nevertheless, project management
was sound, maintaining control of administrative expenses and effective inter-institutional
working relationships.
32.   Compliance with Loan Covenants. The GOJ did not comply with loan
covenants related to: (i) the control of ex-factory sugar price; (ii) compliance by JHS
with the financial covenants in the Project Agreement; and (iii) the level and collection of
water charges. Loan Agreement Section 3.04 (c) required that the ex-factory price for
sugar destined to the local market be set "no less than the average ex-factory price for
sugar sold in the export market". As mentioned above, this covenant was never satisfied
and was eventually waived. Despite Loan Agreement Section 4.02 which stipulated that
the JSH shall not incur into one year or longer debts, JSH began in 1989 to take out
short-term loans to continue its operations. The GOJ did introduce legislative reforms to
allow for the assessment and collection of water tariffs to cover full O&M costs.
Nevertheless, in the project area, the actual level of collection of tariffs relative to costs
remained below 15%. Although there were delays, audits, undertaken by independent
qualified auditors, were generally satisfactory.
F.    Project Sustainability
33.   Sustainability. This project, along with other Bank initiatives, contributed to the
liberalization of the sugar market in Jamaica which will benefit the major stakeholders in
the sector - i.e., the Government, private investors, workers, cane growers and
consumers. Under private-ownership, sugar mills are in a better position to become more
efficient. In addition as a result of the project, SIRI is a viable and efficient research
entity.
34.   However, the accomplishments of the project's irrigation component needs
continued support. - The project has demonstrated that irrigated sugarcane production is
not economically viable, requiring substantial subsidies (in excess of 90 percent of the
O&M costs) to be financially viable. Without crop diversification and better
infrastructure management, the project's irrigation rehabilitation investments will not be
sustained. In addition, before O&M management can be fully transferred to users,
respective legal and financial responsibilities of WUA and the government for O&M
management of public irrigation schemes need to be clearly defined.
35.   Economic Impact (Internal Economic Rate of Return) At the time of
appraisal, the Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) was estimated at 30 percent over
a 20-year period. This was based on the assumption that, in the absence of the project,
production at both Frome and Monymusk factories would have stopped entirely by the
end of the 1985/86 milling season. "Without project" benefits were based on 50 percent



- 9-
of the book value of the residual equipment and machinery plus the revenue that could be
earned from leasing the land. No "without project" costs were assumed.
36.   As in the original SAR's IERR calculations, the re-estimation of the project's
IERR assumed that, without project support, the Frome and Monymusk factories would
have closed. Therefore, sugar production from these factories was considered an
incremental project benefit. Other project benefits were those derived from the irrigation
rehabilitation investments, such as improvement in sugarcane yields, reduction in
sugarcane production costs and reduction in the public irrigation subsidy.
37.   The project factories' sugar production was allocated between the export and
domestic market based on the allocation national production. Therefore, it was assumed
that half the factories' sugar production was destined to the preferential export market
and half to the domestic market. The sugar price applied to the exported share was the
export parity price3. In the case of domestic sugar sales, as the Loan Covenant requiring
the setting of the ex-factory price to the export parity prices was never complied with, the
import parity price was applied 4.
38.   While not included in the original IERR estimate, the re-estimate included the
social benefits derived from the project. In the absence of the project, it was assumed
that many workers would have lost their jobs with the closure of the sugar factories . As
the Frome and Monymusk factories produce approximately half (47 percent) the national
sugar output, it was assumed that the project maintained employment for about
35 percent of the 45,000 workers employed in sugar sector related activities in Jamaica.
It was assumed that the project, by protecting these jobs provided a benefit to the
economy equivalent to US$500 per worker annually.
39.   Based on a recalculation of the project's economic benefits and costs, on average,
annual Jamaican sugar production costs exceeded the weighted market price (export and
domestic) by more than 12 percent. As the project's economic cost far outweighed its
social-economic benefits, the project had a net economic present value of negative
US$62.0 million (applying a 12 percent discount rate) and a significantly negative internal
rate of return.
40.   Social Impact The project prevented the sudden loss of considerable
employment which would have occurred if the public sector sugar factories had been
closed or operated far below capacity. Consequently, for a period of time, the project
helped safeguard the employment of up to 22,500 Jamaicans. Further efforts are needed
to improve the efficiency of cane production and increase farm income by diversifying
production from pure sugar cane toward higher valued crops, in particular fruit crops and
vegetables, for which improved irrigation scheme can be cost effective.
3   The actual unit export price was calculated by dividing annual sugar export revenues by the volume
of annual sugar exports.
4  The actual unit import price was calculated by dividing the annual sugar import bill by the volume
of annual sugar imports.

G.   Assessment of Outcome
41.   While many of the project objectives were eventually achieved, the project was
only marginally instrumental and its economic performance, as evidenced in the ex-post
IERR, was unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, the sugar factories and estates, having been
divested, are in a better position to compete in the international market and the SIRI is an
efficient research institute. The irrigation rehabilitation program initiated the process of
establishing sound management principles for sustainable irrigation through: (i) the
creation of WUA to manage O&M; (ii) an improved cost recovery water tariff system;
and (iii) limited diversification from pure sugar cane toward higher valued crops.
H.    Future Operations
42.   No future operation is, required or anticipated.
L     Key Lessons Learned
43.   The most significant lessons learned are as follows:
(a) this project underscores the cumulative Bank experience in Jamaica and
elsewhere that restructuring of public sector enterprises, with a view to making
them more efficient, usually is not successful. Divestment through outright sale
has been shown to be most effective;
(b) this project reflects the consequences of a poorly appraised project. Critical
financial and economic data should have been available to the Bank to allow
adequate review and assessment during appraisal;
(c) to ensure objectivity and avoid even the perception of conflict of interest, the
Bank needs to be careful when it decides to deviate from normal Bank
procurement guidelines. Effective design and appraisal may have been
compromised by the influence on the eventual contractor;
(d) this project demonstrates the importance of sound economic policies for
achieving sectoral objectives. The project's proposed implicit consumer tax to
achieve its financial objectives was misguided. Economic and financial parameters
would have been relevant tools to monitor project's performance at the early
stages of its implementation and examine measures to improve it; and,
(e) the irrigation component demonstrates that in the Coastal Plains of Jamaica,
irrigation of sugar cane does not represent an efficient use of water.
Diversification from sugar cane into higher valued crops is needed to justify any
investment in irrigation, with sugar cane production being limited to suitable rain
fed areas. In addition, the project experience reinforces the need to limit the role
of the government in the irrigation sub-sector to defining policies, enforcing
legislation, and promoting sustainable irrigated farming development strategies.

SECOND SUGAR REHABILITATIOCN PROJECT
(Loarn 2850-J3)
World Bank- Final Supenision NMission September 25- October 13, 1995
A I D E -MNI ENI O I R E
1.     This Aide-Iemoir-e summarizes the findings of a World Ban-k F;-7t
Supervision Missior cor-orising Messrs. Fernando Charduvi (FAO Land and Water
Division) and Daniel MNoreau (Mission Leader) which visited Jamaica be sveen
SeDtember 25 and October 13, 1995. The fIndings of the Mission are subiec: to
suDsecuenc conr1Mation by World Bank Maniagement in Washington. DC. The
mission undertook a fie'd visit to the project supported irrigation work<s in Mid-
Clarendon (MCLA.). MIeetings were held with the National Lrrigation Commission
(NIC) and the Siu.gar Lndustry Research L^iszinute (SIRI). The rmission waz  to hsan k
all agencies and officia!s contacted for the exxcellernt cooperarion and the fr nak
discussions held.
Background and Setting.
2.     Based on the a-reements reached during the May 1993 supervisicn mission on
a program of actions for the investment program, policy actions and othe: actavities,
the Bank extended the original Loan Closing Date (September 30, 1993) to September
30, 1994, canceled USS4.15 million of savings, and reallocated the remaining funds to
allow the completion of the irrigati6n prosram, as requested by the Government of
Jamaica. An other one-ear extension of the closin  dace to September 30, 1995 has
been approved to complete the proposed program. Current project activities consist
of: (i) rehabilitation or irrigation infraszrcrure (wells, canals, sur.ace storage);
(ii) work on reforms of the system and levels of irrigacion water charges, on the
formnation of water users' associations, and on the provision of agricultural support
services, e.g., extension, for farrners in the rehabilitated areas; and (iii) crairing of
irrigacion operators and farmers.



PROJECT PERFORMA-N'CE ALN-D SUPERVISION
Status of the canal and the well rehabilitation programs as of end of Septe.mber 1995:
3.     Canal rehabilitation works. Zones 1 and 3 were compleced in June 1993 and
December 1994 respectively. All comruitments necessary for completina caral
rehabilitation works in zones 4 and 2 have already been entered into prior Senteernber 30,
1995. From a total for both zones of 37.,4 Km proposed for rehabilitation. 14.1 km have
been completed (Tables I and 3). The remain;nrg works are at different stases of
completion (topogra-phical survey, provision of materials, rubble packiLn, alig-nmenr of
section templates, concrete). It is estimated that all work-s will be comopleted within three
months, this is, by the end of December 1995. The delay in these works has been due
mostly to cash release problems and rainv conditions, but not to MC's ttchnical capaciry
to carry out thejob.
4.     WeIl rehabilitation program. Works in zones 1 (ten wells) and 3 (five wells)
were completed in June 19931 and July 1994 respectively. The well relinauitzation
program  in zones A (tLrte wells) and 2 (,five wells) as conflzrmed bv fieid i-_petcions
(SepcemLber 1995) shOw a -ate of progress of 90.c The national corpe i-ve biddizg for
the provision of switch sear panels was carried out early 1995 and at prese-- -he panels
are in the supolier's warehouse in Spanish Town. All works within this o)r-srarn are
exD,ected co be cornpleted witiin thre-e months, by the end of December 1995.
5.     Water manazement plan for zone 1. In November 1993. the .;sSon-
recommended the prer- arion of a water man gement pLan for zone 1 i_! or-er to operace
the svstem with th-e ig:.-est erriciency. NIC gathered the informacion recu-.es to or-oare
this plan. includinG: (i) wacer requirements of crops in the area; (ii) the a     area under
irnigation; (iii) the lis; of water users contracts, including payments mnade y'D users. and;
(iv) flow measurements in canals and in wells. As of MNav 1994, iNIC h_d a-ea-dv made
a start towards the water .management plan. As of February 1995, the ian was still
being finalized and the mission recomm.ended NIC to make a final effor; to imolenent
this plan. Finally in September 199$, the water management plar has been, frnalized.
Tne plan will assist the farmers in zone 1 since they wiHl be is in a beater ncsition to
understand and operate the system more efficiently.
6.     Development of Zones 4 and 2. With a view to integrate the wacer resources
from all four zones, the NIC proposed (February 1995) a rehabilitation orogram for
zone 4 and 2. As of Seotember 1995, the stacus of execution is as follcws:
*  extension of the Old Milk River Canal from zone 3 to zone 4 at Cross
Comatry Canal to facilitate the use of the excess water from zone 3: ynder
constm-ction;
*  upgrading of Dam #2 in zone 2: a search for spare parTs for !h.e e-rine was
unsucc:S_filj a new engine will have co be purchased, but cannot anymore be
financed under the Loan;



-3 -
* Dam #20 to be upgraded to pump into Main Canal at Rhvmesbury: no work
undeWru,-z due to financial constraints, and;
Control gates and silt traps to be constructed along the Main Canal to
facilitate the recharging of Dam .#2 with flood waters from the MiLk River
Tributary at Si. Toolis: half of the control aates have alreadv been installed.
7.     Water flows monitorina. The Undereround Water Authority (UWA), the
agencv responsible for ground water resources continued carrying out its flow
monicoring prograim witLhn t-he project area. One of the monitorinr stations is in the
MLiLk River at the Scor-s Pass aauging station, upstream of the MaTin Canil tLe off,
where the reliable yield of 80% for a 20-year record is 0.25 million US gallons per day
(MUI-SGD) equivaleat co 10.95 U/s. The mission reviewed daily records taken up to May
1995. The continuous monitoring, and the analyses of the information have added a
sound footing to the planned irrigation works.
Irrigation Policy Development
S.     Irrigation Water Pricing. On water charges ard levels of subsicv. no real
increases in water charges were applied between 1990/91 (JS240 or US3S29.2 per
cuyd/hr for large farmers) and 1992193 (JS652 or USS29.4 per cuycUhr). The applicable
water charge for the pe.io dApril 941 -March 95 was JS862 per cuydlhr (=TUSS6.1 per
cuvdlhour) which means that no real increases in water charges took place since 1991 up
to A.ugust 1995. Th-.e GOJ subsidized the MYCLk's cost of O&Ml as follows:
1990/91: 84%;
1992193: 85 %;
1993/94: 95%c.
For the period 1993/;94, tre subsidy reached JS21 million and for Aprl 1994/fMarch 95
it reached at least JSS3'1.5 million (See Table 5).
9.     Upon recormendaion by the Bank, NIC prepared (November 1993) a new
concractual agreerment for the sale of agricultural water to farmers islandwide. The race
structure consists of: (i) a basic charge, water rate, that corresponds to NIC's prorated
fixed and overhead costs for the zone (maintenance, capital recovery and administration
expenses); and (ii) a variable charge, water due, per cubic meter/hour/year received by
the farmer, that corresponds to the variable -costs of producing irrigation water.
10.    Updated agricultural water charges. Towards the end of the project in August
1995, the NIC, currently an agency of the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport
(MPUT), finally carne up with a proposal for agricultural water charges. Tne proposal,
which has already been approved by the Minister of the MPUT, was gazected on August
16, 1995 and came into ooeracion on September 1, 1995. The main characteristics of the
current agricultural water charges system are as follows:



-4 -
(a)   the charges are applicable island wise, i.e. they are the same for all
irngaion schemes;
(b)   the water charges levels were determined based on a projecton of the
tocal costs for the period April 1995/March 1996. Except for capital
costs, these costs included the overhead, fiLxed and variable costS of
producing irrigation water;
(c)   the --tes have two comp.onenrs: a service charge accordinz .o the size of
the rarm -and dermand charge per day according to arno''un of water
r-eeved;
(d)   the number of days to calculated the demand charge is deteri ned by
detuctinz the number of rainfall days from the 365;
(e)   the wa.er charges include atle cosz of the head office. and:
(if)    soci^a consideramion (farm size) has been taken i-no accouzr.
VWater Tfsers' Associations
11.    The creaton and dromotion of the Water Users' Associations (W CAs) were
proposed to ensure he sustai:ability of the project through farmers' par-ictaton a n
O&M\ activities. iTe followving actions were carried out duri tr Lhe life or the project
towards the prortcion or tie W`JAs: (i) car.ographic inventory of the proce-r
boundaries of all FAz ners: (ii) installation of parshall flumes at farms' turnouts; and (iii)
irainLris farmers i water manaement, operation and maintenance of the secondary and
tertiary canals. Two orficers, one from RADA and one from NIC, did A 7-dav visit
(Mvarch 1993) to Guateemala. In May 1993, one MIC officer went to Mexico co observe
the experience of ;he turnover of the irrigacion districts. During June/July 1993, rwo
other officers, one from SIRI and one from  MIC artended the "On Farm Water
Management" course offered by the Interrational Irrigation Cenrer in Logan, Utah,
UISA.
12.   NIC prepared the operational framework for the establishment of t-e WlJAs. It
was approved by N:IC's Board in October 1993 on an experimental basis for
implementation in zone 3 of the project area. Tne Minister of Water an:d Transpor.
confirmed (IMlay 1994) his readiness to promote farmers' participation inc che O&M of the
irrigation systerns utilizing a "Jamaican" approach. Following his directives NIC
prepared a Memorandum of Undersranding between Water Users Groups in September
1994 which represents'a further development towards the formation of the Water Users'
Associations. This Memorandum of Understanding defines the W`UA's snuctare, the
farmners' sub-groups and groups as well as their aims and functions.
13.    A good progress has been made towards the formnation of WUA in the MCIA.
The irrigation infrasxructure will be fully operationa-in 1996, farmers have received



-5 -
training from SIR and from RADA and the farmers are aware that in the near fumre
they will have to be fully responsible for the operation and management of the scheme.
Although only four sub-groups and two Groups were formed during the life of the
project, it is recomrnmended that NIC continue promoting the WUA, not only in the
MCLA but in the other ir-igation schemes as well. Other very irnportant issues still
requiring attention are the revision of the Irrigation Act to accommodate the WlJAs and
the drafting of the WUAs' constitution.
OTBE'RS
14 .    Extension. The contract of the extension officer ended on June 30. 1995.
Demonstrations ploc;, field days and meetings were organized with a good farmers'
participation. However, ic is difficult to measure the impact of these extension
activities for a such short period of time.
15.     Training for Improved Irriaation Efficiencv. With the helD of o.ficers
from the Underground Water Authority (lUWA), RADA, NIC and the Clarendon
Sugar Company, inhouses lectures and field demonstracions have been unde-rtken.
Two traiiing manuals we.e prepared and distribuzed to farmers and far'i 
insdirutions. The training program was completed as scheduled in zones I and m. In
zones II and IV, the program was delayed since the rehabilitation work: was -ot
completed and thus. the farmers could noc be trained on their own plots.
Project Coordination and Financing
16.     Project Financina. From the approved budgec of JS78.0 millicn. J_1 '1.56
million were actually ailocated to the Project up to September 30, 1995. and advanced
to MIC. JS35 milliorn have been disbursedb by NIC. Only comminnents mad- prior to
September 30, 1995 would be financed under the Loan.

Recommended Actions to be Taken
17.     Water Charaes. The opinion of the mission is that the water charges
structure that has been proposed, i.e. a flat nationwide rate, will not promote sound
management principles for irrigation schernes. This will lead to efficient irrigation
systems (mostly by zravirv) subsidizing less efficient pumping irrigation sys,ems. in,
addition, as soon as .he Water User Associations will realize that chev are not paying
the real costs of water of their own scheme. it will be difficult to ernforce the targeted
1.007% water char2es collection rate. The rnission thus proposes that MrC establish the
real costs of water (O&MI) for each irrigation scheme, and seek to promote a more
equitable water charges system between the iurigation schemes and mhe cii.--rent
categories of fatmers
18.   Operational Plan and Performance Indicators. In addition co t-e National
L-rriation Develoorm.ent Plan under preparation, the mission recomrme-ds NTC to
prepare an Operational Plan for 1996-2001 arnd a list of key Perfornaace Ln-icators
that would be used L0. t oroitoring its imolementcation. This will helo C-0i NIC co
ensure the sus-ainabilin; or its irrigation inv-esments and operations f'or ;.e  five
years.
19.   Preparation of Borrowers Contribution to the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR). The SSRP coordinating Umit of the MINAG has corlLed nat it will
prepare a drarft of tle Borrowers Evaluation Re-ort to be included Ln r-e TCR and
subrrit to PIOJ for finalization and submrission to the World Bank. The SSR?
coordinating urit (SSRP-Cu) and PIOJ have indicated that the docum.,e - sh,ould be
available by the end ofL January 1996. The Mission has provided advic- as recuested
regardinzn the documeatr which should providce the Borrower's evaluatton o-:
(a)   thue Project's execution and Lmitial operation includirg an assessmntn of
thle Project objectives, design, imnplementation and opea.ioron
experience;
(b)   the Ptoject's costs and benefIts, and the extent to which t-e purposes of
the Loan were achieved;
(c)   the Borrower's own perform=ance during the evolutionand
inolemencation of the Project including the Borrower's obligatiorns
under the Loan Agreement;- special emphasis should be Siven to lessons
learned that may be relevant in the future; and
(d)   the perfornance of the Bank during the evolution and implertentation of
the Project including the Bank's obligations under the Loan Agreement
and the effectiveness of the relationship between the Borrzower and the
Bank-: s-ecial emphasis should be given to lessons learned that may be
relevant in the futrure.



-7 -
20.   The Borrower's Evaluation Report will be attached unedited to the ICR unless
it is over ten pages long, in which case a summary should be prepared which will
instead be included in the ICR. To assist in the preparation of the document, SSRP-
CU and PIOJ have been provided with a copy of World Bank Operational Policies OP
13.55 and Bank Procedures BP 13.55. The content of the Borrowers Report is
outlined in Operational Policies OP 13.55 page 1, para. 3.
21.   SSRP-CU also confirmed that they would provide information requested by the
Mission to prepare certain cost, financial and implementation tables recuired in the
ICR. Such infor;mation should be available by the end of November 1995. A draft of
the Bank's ICR will be provided to SSRP-CU and PIOJ by mid-December 1996 for
comment which should be provided if possible by the end of January 1996, so that the
document can be finalized and issued by the end of March 1996.

SECOND SUGAR REHAB.IB.ATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2850-JM)
(Summary of Borrower's Project Completion Report)
Project Implementation
L Project Effectivity
The Second Sugar Rehabilitation Project, Loan 2850-JM~ became efective
October 30, 1987 with the original Loan closing date being September 30, 1993. The first
extension, approved by the IBRD, moved the closing date to September 30, 1994, with
the final extension approved moving the closing date to September 30, 1995. Both
extensions were granted to facilitate the completion of the irrigation component of the
project.
I. Degree of Achievement of Project Objectives
A. Jamaica Suaar Holdings Ltd.
1.    This component of the project, which was aimed at the rehabilitation and
modernization of the Frome and Monymusk sugar factories and estates, and the provision
of technical assistance to JSI, was terminated in November 1991.
2.    ISH failed to achieve the objectives of.
  raising the sugar production levels of the two factories; and
* improving their overall efficiency and financial viability.
3.    The financial position of JSH deteriorated steadily resulting in the company having
a negative net worth, thereby being unable to service its debts.
4.    Sugar production inNovember 1991, at the time of the terrnination of the
component, was only marginally higher than at the start of the project in 1987. There was
significant improvement in the cost of production, however, with cost per pound moving
from US$0. 18 per lb. in May, 1987 to a unit production cost, before depreciation and
finance charges, of USS0. 124 per lb. at Frome; and USS0. 156 per lb. at Monymuskl.
'Figures calculated at USS1 = JS16.8721 at October 1, 1991.



2
5.    The physical facilities of both factories were improved, making them more
mechanically secure, and reversing the decline of both factories thereby reducing the threat
of the loss of the preferential EEC market for sugar, which had been identified as a project
risk.
6.    This improvement of the two factories also put GOJ in a more favorable position
in the negotiations for their divestment which was achieved in December, 1993. The
divestment of the factories concluded the involvement of JSH in the project.
B. Sugar IndustrY Research Institute
7.     The project period for this component was rescheduled from 198-1990 to
1988-1992 because of a long delay in identifyinc a coordinator to head a Central
Administration of both the Field and Factory Technology Divisions. The situation was
further aggravated by the lack of cooperation of the Head of the Institute.
8.    The merging of the Field and Factory Techrnology Divisions into a Central
Admiristrative unit resulted in significant cost reductions. This is demonstrated by the
fact that, despite high inflation rates, the budget for the fiscal year 1992/93 was 1525.2
million as compared to JS25.6 million for the fiscal year 1991/92. The 1991/92 budget
represented 1.14 percent of total industry proceeds complying with the set plidelines that
SI's budget should not exceed 1.5 percent of the total proceeds of the industry.
9.    The new method for the payment of sugarcane, based on core sampling, was fully
accepted by both manuf:acturers and Larmers by the end of the project. There was
improvement in cane quality each year after the introduction of the new method of
payment except for 1993 when excessive rainfall affected overall perforrance.
10.   Factory efficiency improved moving fom 84.5 percent in 1989 to 371.6 percent in
1993. Other improvements included the improvement of the industry's capaoiliry of
producina higher-yielding cane varieties on amore timely basis; the reduction in the time
between cane being cut and delivered tot he factory from five days to three days; the
improvement in both the quality and quantity of laboratory analyses; and the improvement
of the skills and knowleage of SEI staff members as a result of their particioation in
training programs. All of this have resulted in tne improvement of the overall efficiency
and financial viability of the industry.
C. The Rehabilitation of the Clarendon, St. Dorothy and sections of the Rio Cobre
Irrigation Systems
11.   The rehabilitation of the Clarendon, St. Dorothy and Rio Cobre canal irrigation
systems was aimed at the development of sugarcane production in the areas supplying the
Monymusk suzar factory.



3
12.   The Clarendon system irrigated 40,000 acres, most of which were under
sugarcane, and with supply being derived from the Rio Minho, the Milk River, the Cockpit
Springs and deepwells. The St. Dorothy system irrigated approximately 5,000 acres of
which 2,0000 acres were under sugarcane, deriving its supply exclusively from deepwe}ls.
The Rio Cobre system irrigated about 30,000 acres of which 16,000 acres were under
sugarcane, deriving its supply from the Rio Cobre and deepwells.
13.   At Project inception the charg,es collected by UWA for irrigation water
represented only about 10 percent ofthe rea1 costs of eater and assurances were obtained
from GOJ that it would introduced a program to reduce the level of water subsidy and
improve the collection of charges from agricultural users.
14.   The implementation of this component of the project, prior to the suspension of
the disbursement of loan funds by the IBRD, resulted in:
* the rehabilitation of infrastructure at the Rio Cobre headworks;
*  the connection oF the Rio Cobre and the St. Dorothy systems at Bushy Park,
St. Catherine;
*  the replacemnent of the wooden-stave conveyance system with steel pipes; and
*  the upgrading of the pumping systemn at the Free Town wells.
15.   The disbursement ofloan funds was suspended because the proposed plan of
activities for the rehabilitation program, prepared by NIC, was not acceptable to the
IBRD. A separate proposal for the development of the irrgation system at Monymusk
was not approved by ERD.
16.   The re-designed component of the project, which was restricted tot he Mid-
Clarendon plains, consisted of:
*  the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure;
* training of irrigation operators;
*  the provision of irrigation/agricultural extension services;
*  the formation of Water Users groups;
* improved water distribution; and
* operation and maintenance cost recovery in the Mid-Clarendon irrigation
district.
17.   The primary objectives of the redesigned project were to expand the area under
irrigation and to increase available water from 2,201IVs (10,367 cuyd/hr) to 5,163 Ils
(24,3 I8 cuyd/hr). The establishment of irrigation water charges to cover the full
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs; and the promotion of farmers participation in
the O&M activities were expected to make the scheme sustainable.

18.   The area was divides into four zones with the targets summarized as follows:
Zone     Irrigated area prior to | Target area for |   Scheduled
.___________ I proiect (ELA)    I   irriLation    completed date
1     l        951        l      1151         1992 to 06/93
2     l        747               1163         06/93 to 06/94
3     |        759               1 1503       07/94 to 12/94
4        _    173 1              1913         07/94 to 06195 1
Total           4188               5730
19.   The canal and well rehabilitation works in Zone 1 were completed in June, 1993 as
targetted. The well rehabiiitation works in Zone 3 were completed in July, 1994, with the
canal rehabilitation works being completed in December, 1994.
20.   At September 30, 1995, the canal rehabilitation works in Zones 2 and 4 were
completed; with the well rehabilitation works 90 percent completed in both zones.
21.   The updated agricultural water charges were gazetted on August 16, 1995 and
became operative in September, 1995, accompanAied by protests from farmers.
22.   The creation and prornotion of the Water Users' Associations (WUA's) involved
the cartographic inventorv of the property boundaries of all farmers; installation of partial
flumes at farms' turnouts; training of farrners in water management, and in the operation
and maintenance of the secondary and tertiary canals.
23.   A Memorandum of Understanding which provides details on the structure of the
WUA's, the farmers' sub-groups and groups as well as their aims and functions, has been
developed. The revision of the Irrigation Act to accommodate the WUA's and the
drafting of the WJUA's constitution were still outstanding at September 30, 1995, the
Project Closing date, however.
24.   Two Water Users groups and four sub-groups were formed durinz the life of the
project.
D. Project Management and Coordination Unit (PMCU)
25.   The Project Management Unit of the Exports Crops Project (Loan No. 2414-JA
was upgraded and renamed the Project Management and Coordination Unit (PMCU). As
early as 1990, IBRD supported a proposal for the PMCU to assume responsibility for the
coordination of all projects being implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, inclusive of
non-MBRD financed projects. The upgrading of the relevant posts to a satisfactory level



5
was not achieved until 1994. This resulted in the PMCU experiencing diffculties in
attracting and retaining the caliber of staff needed, especially in the area of accounts.
E. Borrower Performance
26.   Borrower performance was not satisfactory in some areas and clearly deficient in
others. this was manifested in the terrnination of the Jamaica Sugar Holdings component
of the project; the suspension of funding of the irrigation component for an extended
period of time; and the need for the extension of the Project closing date twice.
27.   Sections 23.04 a, b, c, e and g of the Loan Agreement were breached at different
stages of project implementation.
28.   The lack of compliance with Section 3.04 (c) which relates to the price of
domestic sugar and the distlibution of sugar proceeds, deprived JSH of gross income of
approximately JS901 million for the period 1988 to 1993. JSH estimates that the total loss
to the sugar industry for the 1986 to 1993 period wa JS 1898 million.
29.   The average selling price for sugar fell in real terrns from JS2435 per ton in 1987
to JS194 1 in 1990, causing a reduction in JSH's profit of JS61 rmillion.
30.    BRD, in a letter to the borrower in 1991 expressed it's concem that the pricing
system reflected a large implicit subsidy to the sector at the expense of consume.rs and the
Gove=rnent and that it contributed to the conservation of inefficiencies in the industry and
was, therefore, neither conducive to the developmrent of the industry nor to the
development of the Jamaican economy.
3 1.   The transfer of 500 acres of the Heartland's section of Inswood estate outside of
the direct control of JSH's control and the consequent loss of 15,000 tons of cane to
another factory; as well as the re-opening of the Bernard Lodge sugar factory represented
a breach of Section 3.04 (b) of the Agreement.
32.   Section 3.04 (a) of the Loan Agreement states:
"The Borrower shall carry out the program agreed upon between the Borrower
and the Bank for reducing the existing level of water charges and subsidies and for
improving the collection of water charges from users."
33.   There was no real increase in water charges, despite this agreement, between 1991
and August 1995. GOJ's subsidies of Mid-Clarendon Irrigation Authority's (NICIA)
operation and maintenance costs were as follows for the fiscal years 1990-01 to 1993-94
and moved to JS3 1.5 million for the 1994-95 fiscal year.



6
Fiscal Year         Level of Subsidv
1990-91                   84%
1992-93                   85%
1993-94                   95%
34.    Section 3.04 (g) of the Loan Agreement stated that the administrative re-
organization of SRI, satisfactory to the Bank, should not have taken place later than
October 3 1, 1987. The project period for the SIRI component had to be rescheduled from
1936-1990 to 1988-92 because of the delay in the reorganization of the Institute.
35.   The staff structure of the PMCU was approved by the Ministry of the Public
Service in 1989. The process of classifying and upgrading the respective posts in line with
the greater responsibility, attached to each post, lasted for several years, with final
approval, satisfactory to well, being granted only in 1994. This situation affected the
PMCU' s ability to attract and retain the caliber of staff required, especially in the area of
Accounts.
36.   A combination of both inadequate budgetary allocations and the failure to issue
adequate warr;ants on a timely basis, even in those cases of adequate allocation, plagued
the project throughout the entire implementation period. Th.i s created cash ffow problems;
affected the financial contribution of the borrower, and had an adverse efrec: on borrower
perforrnance.
37 .   Other factors affectinz borrower performance were the occurrence of HTurricane
Gilbert in 1938. This resulted in JSH's loss Of 43,000 tons of sugar and a loss of JS57
million instead of the projected profit of J320 million for the year. The damnag.e to the Rio
Cobre headworks and dam in 1991; and the unusually hea,y and persistent rainfall of
595m in January to Febnuar, 1993 as compared to a 44 year average of 1 lrmm, caused
damage to irrigate works and delays because of the need of an extended period ror a
drying out process.
38.   Industrial action caused delays in the start of both the 1988 and 1989 sugar crops
and also had an adverse effect on performance.
E. Bank Performance
39.   The suspension of loan disbursement by MBRD, as well as the change in the
requirements for the irrigation component of the project had an adverse effect on Project
implementation. This was especially so for the irrigation component, and resulted in the
need for two extensions of the Project Closing date. The PMCU expressed the opinion, in
one of it's reports, that the suspension of loan disbursement resulted also in less effective
use being made by some of the consultants contracted for the project.



7
40.   Bank performance was satisfactory but it is possible that more effort could have
been made to achieve consensus between IBRD and the GOJ on a number of issues so as
to avoid delays.
F. Project Outcome
41.   The implementation of the Second Sug,ar Rehabilitation Project failed to raise
sugar production to a level suEficient to satisfy both the domestic market and Jamaica's
preferential markets in Europe and the U.S..4 Sugar production in 1994 was 217,000
tons as compared to a pre-project level of 210,000 tons, representing a marnial increase
of only 3.3 percent. Sucar production, which increased to 228,000 ton in 1991, actually
declined for the period 1991 to 1994.
42.   The rehabilitation of the Frome and Monymusk factories was 70 percent
completed, despite the discontinuation of the JSE component, with a major overhaul of
both factory and equipment, and the purchase of vehicles and equipment. Production
costs were reduced at both factories and the implementation of the project reversed the
decline of both the Frome and Monvrnusk factories. This facilitated the priva.z_tion and
divestrnment of the public sector owned section of the industry which was achieved in
December, 1993.
43.    The introduction of the new system of payment for cane, and the improvement of
both the research and extension capabilities of SIRI, have beneited both far;ners and
manufacturers and resulted in the improvement of overall factory efficiency.
44.   The successful cornoletion of the ir,igation component will result in irrnzated area
moving from 4,188 hecta-es to 5,730 hectares, an increase of 36.8 percent. The more
realistic charges for water which will allow the recovery of all operation ;and maintenance
costs and the promotions of farmers' participation in the Water Users Association should
all result in a more efficient and self-sustainable irrigation system.
G. Future Operations
45.   The changes in international trade, with the establishment of the World Trade
Organization and the inclusion of the trading of agricultural comrnodities in the new body
of rules, represents a th,reat to Jamaica's continued access to the EEC market under the
LOME convention.
46.   The rationalization and privatization of the sugar industry and the other
achievements of the project should result in the industry becoming more efficient. This
should improve the competitive advantage of the Jamaican sugar industry in a world
where such an advantage, and not preferential markets, will become the reality of the
fiture.



8
47.   It is expected that NIC will continue to promote the WUA's, not only in the
MICA, but also in their other irrigation schemes; and that the legislation concerning the
WUAs will be enacted.
H. Key Lessons Learned
48.   GOJ should negotiate smaller projects with international institutions such as the
IBRD. This would take into consideration GOJ's existing fiscal and human resource
constraints and should mean more effectively managed and funded projects. This cold
have a much greater impact on the country's economic development than the large scale
projects, undertakcen to date, which have either had to be terminated, or suffered extensive
delays because of GOJ's inability of adequately staff them and/or finance their component
of these projects.
49.   Human Resource Training, with the primary aim of providing the county with
either scarce or critical skills; as well as a rnedium term maintenance contract for all
equipment provided under these projects, should be conditions of all loan agreements.
50.   The following acrivities should precede project implementation even if fully or
partially financed where necessary from loan funds:
e  The approval of any changes in the organization structure of key imnplem enting
agencies by the relevant Ministries or institutions;
- the preparation f major engineerins designs, costings and quantity surveys of
engineerng works and the identification of t he relevant expertise;
* the selection of counterparts for consultants; and
*  the dissermnation of information, concerning the project to key implementation
agencies to ensure that the relevant key personnel are properly apprised of the
major objec-ives of the project, prior to the start of implementation.
