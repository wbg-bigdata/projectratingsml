MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
* AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO JAMAICA
FOR A SECOND SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Jamaica for the
equivalent of US$34.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would have a term of 17 years, including four years of grace, with interest
at the standard variable rate. About US$25.4 million would be onlent to
Jamaica Sugar Holdings, Ltd. (JSH) on the same terms as the Bank loan.
Background
2.       Sugar production in Jamaica dates back about 300 years.  Sugar has
long been a cornerstone of the economy, an important source of income,
employment and foreign exchange. The growth of the industry accelerated
after World War II; in 1965, sugar production among the 18 factories then
in existence, all privately owned, reached an all-time high of 506,000
tons. Since 1965, however, production has declined to its current level of
about 210,000 tons, and the area of cane cultivation has declined from
148,000 acres to about 100,000 acres.
3.       The sugar industry in Jamaica has had a turbulent history,
punctuated with fractious disputes between factory management, trade unions
and cane farmers over wage demands and the formula for sharing sugar
revenues. After 1965, these problems were exacerbated as growing world
competition in sugar productio:. increased the pressure on the industry for
greater efficiency. In 1970, the Government of Jamaica established the
Sugar Industry Authority (SIA), as the principal policy-making and control
entity for the sugar industry. Following this, during the 1970s, it
gradually purchased eight foreign-owned sugar factories and privately owned
estates. In 1977, the Government purchased the Frome, Monymusk and Bernard
Lodge factories from Tate and Lyle, UK (a UK-based international sugar
company). As a result, the Government controls 65% of the sugar processing
capacity in the country.
4.       Since 1970, sugar output has steadily declined.  Despite its
decline, the sugar industry is still vital to the Jamaican economy. Cane
still covers about 25% of the total area under crops. Sugar is the
dominant agricultural export crop and, together with rum, provides over 602
of the value of all agricultural exports. Sugar-related activities are
also the main source of employment in the agricultural sector, employing
18% of the agricultural labor force, or about 45,000 workers and farmers.
Although the Government is undertaking a concentrated effort aimed at crop
diversification, focusing on joint venture projects with foreign
participation, no alternative crop could fully substitute for sugarcane in
the short to medium term. Since the early eighties, the Government has
been implementing a major rationalization of the State-owned sugar industry
as part of its broader economic adjustment efforts. A major focus of the
program is to concentrate sugar production at two factories -- Frome and
Monymusk -- and to stop production at the remaining six factories.



- 2 -
5.       Proiect Obiectives.  The Government's principal policy objective
for sugar is to create a financially self-sufficient industry capable of
meeting the demands of the preferential export markets (EEC and US) and the
domestic market. The proposed project would support this objective. It
would (a) raise sugar production to 245,000 tons; (b) concentrate the
State-produced share of this production (160,000 tons of the total) at
Frome and Monymusk, the two most efficient public sector factories, thus
achieving economies of scale; (c) significantly improve management at these
two factories; and (d) reduce production costs and create a financially
self-supporting public sector sugar industry. The key differences between
the present situation and that which prevailed during the first
Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 1517 - FY78) are the existence of highly
competent management (under contract), the focusing of cane supply on the
two most efficient factories, and significantly improved marketing
arrangements in the hands of the factories themselves.
6.       Project Description.  The proposed project, to be carried out over
six years, would have the following main components: (a) rehabilitation of
Frome and Monymusk factories and estates; (b) continuation of technical and
managerial assistance to JSH under the contract with Tate and Lyle
Technical Services (TLTS); (c) rehabilitation of the public irrigation
systems in the Southern Plains area, mainly to benefit the Monymusk estate
and the farmers in that area; (d) upgrading of the capabilities of the
Sugar Industry Research Institute (SIRI) by providing training and
equipment; and (e) strengthening of the project monitoring and coordination
unit.
7.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$47.1 million,
exclusive of import duties, including US$37.1 million in foreign exchange
(79%). A breakdown of costs is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement, as well as the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule
B. The proposed Bank loan would provide US$3.4 million in retroactive
financing. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group Operatiors in Jamaica are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. A map showing project locations is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 5827-JM, dated May 20, 1987, is being distributed
separately.
8.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government's adjustment
program aims at sustaining growth of incomes and employment while restoring
fiscal and balance of payments viability. The project would make an
important contribution to meeting those objectives. By rationalizing
public sector sugar production and encouraging a rebound in sugar output to
245,000 tons, the project would safeguard 45,000 jobs in the industry,
increase Jamaica's export earnings, and enable JSH, which currently
requires fiscal support, to become financially self-sufficient in the third
year. The proposed project also complements other operations aimed at
diversifying agricultural exports (Export Crops Project, Loan 2414-JM).
9.       Actions Agreed On.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to:
(a) obtain Bank approval for key managerial appointments under the
management contract; (b) introduce a program to reduce the level of water
subsidy and improve collection of charges from farmers within the first
year of project implementation; (c) implement an administrative
reorganization of SIRI by October 31, 1987; (d) continue to grow cane on



-3-
certain public lands identified under the project in o_-der to supply the
Frome and Monymusk factories unless an economic analysis, satisfactory to
the Bank, demonstrates that this land could be put to better use; (e) fix
the ex-factory price of sugar sold on the locai market at not less than the
average ex-factory price of sugar sold on the export markets; and (f)
consult the Bank each year on the distribution of the sales proceeds
between factories and farmers. It was also agreed that JSH would be
restricted in its ability to incur debt and make dividend payment, and that
it would revalue by December 31, 1988 its fixed assets as of September 30,
1988.
10.      Justification.  A major benefit would be the increase in national
sugar production from its current level (210,000 tons) to 245,000 tans,
which would meet both local demand and preferential export quotas. In
addition, the proposed project would create a more efficient sugar
industry, thereby eliminating government subsidies. It would also
stabilize employment levels in the sugar industry. The project's economic
rate of return is estimated at 30X.
11.      Risks.  The principal risks facing the project are related to
three major issues: (a) a possible reduction in Janaica's access to the
EEC market; (b) sustained Government commitment to appropriate policies for
the sugar industry as a whole as well as good management in the Government-
owned industry; and (c) the Government's ability to supply the initial cash
required to get JSH back on its feet. These risks are acceptable. A major
change in Lome provisions seems unlikely in the medium-term. While a fall
in the EEC price of sugar is possible, it is not expected to exceed 10%,
thus allowing the ER-R to remain satisfactory. The degree of the
Government's commitment to policy and institutional reform is already being
demonstrated in its closing of financially unviable factories, the
installation of high-quality professional management in the remaining
public sector factories, and the creation of a new privately managed sugar
marketing company. As for the Government's financial commitment to JSH,
the Government has already provided JSH with sufficient funding for its
initial years of operations and within three years the company is expected
to be self-financing.
12.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
