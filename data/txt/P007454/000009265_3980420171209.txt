JAMAICA
SECOND SUGAR RERABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:       Government of Jamaica
Beneficiary:    Jamaica Sugar Holdings, Ltd. (JSH)
Amount:         US$34.0 million equivalent
Terms:          Repayable in 17 years on a fixed amortization schedule,
including 4 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
On-lending      The Ministry of Agriculture would be the executing agency for
Terms:          the loan.  It would on-lend about US$25.4 million of the loan
proceeds to finance JSE operations on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan; the balance of US$8.6 million
would be used by the Ministry of Agriculture for the direct
financing of activities under its own control (irrigation,
research, and project coordination).
Praject         The proposed project is designed:  (a) to rationalize the
Description:    State-owned sugar industry by concentrating production on
efficient units (Frome and Monymusk factories); (b) to raise
sugar production in the country to a level sufficient to
satisfy the domestic market and those export markets to which
Jamaica has access under special arrangements (EEC, US); and
(c) to improve the overall efficiency and financial viability
of the industry.
The project would comprise:
(a) physical rehabilitation and managerial and technical
assistance for the two main public sector factories and
estates;
(b) rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure for cane
cultivation in the dry Southern Central Plains region;
and
(c) sugar research activities.



-2-
Benefits:       At full development in the fourth year of implementation, the
two assisted factories would produce 160,000 tons of sugar,
thereby restoring national production to the planned
objective of 245,000 tons from its current level of 210,000
tons; that production level would meet the existing export
quotas and the de-ands of the domestic market.  The project
would create stability in an industry whose foreign exchange
earnings are vital to the country's balance of payments, and
safeguard the incomes of over 45,000 workers and farmers who
depend on the industry.
Risks:          The principal risks facing the project are related to three
major issues: (a) Jamaica's continued access to the EEC
market under the Lome Agreement; (b) sustained Government
commitment to appropriate sectoral policies as well as good
management in Government-owned industry; and (c) the
Government's ability to supply the initial cash required to
get the industry back on its feet. These risks are
manageable. A major change in the Lome Agreement would imply
a significant change in world agricultural trade
relationships, which is unlikely in the foreseeable future.
The degree of the Government's commitment to appropriate
sectoral policies is already being demonstrated in the
closing of financially unviable factories, the installation
of high-quality professional management in the remaining
public sector factories, and the creation of a new privately
managed sugar marketing company. Finally, the Government has
already provided JSH with sufficient operational funding for
the 1985/86 and 1986/87 fiscal years. Funding beyond that is
unlikely to be needed as JSH is expected to become
financially self-sufficient.

II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Agriculture's Role in the National Economy
2.01      The relative contribution of agriculture to Jamaica's economy has
declined since the mid-1960s as the manufacturing, mining and tourism sectors
have played increasingly important roles. In 1986, the agricultural sector
contributed only 7% of total gross domestic product (GDP). Of the total
value, 17Z came from exported agricultural products (mainly sugar and
bananas), 48% from agricultural products for domestic consumption, and 35Z
from livestock, fisheries and forestry. The value of export earnings
(f.o.b. Jamaica) from fresh and processed agricultural products reached
USS98.0 million, or 13% of the country's total exports. Sugar and related
products accounted for 61% of the total agricultural export value; coffee,
7%; bananas, 5%; cocoa, 3%; root crops and vegetables, 6%; citrus, 5x; and
pimento, 5%.
2.02     Of the total population of 2.2 million, about 37% lives in rural
areas. In 1983, the agricultural labor force in Jamaica amounted to about
21% of the total labor force. The rate of rural unemployment was 6% compared
to the general unemployment rate of 26%; however, underemployment of the
agricultural labor force is prevalent during most of the year.
2.03     The climate of Jamaica is favorable, and the island enjoys a
comparative advantage in a wide range of crops. Groundwater resources exist
in a number of limestone and alluvium aquifers located throughout the island
and provide 60-70% of the present irrigation water supply. Presently, there
are sufficient water resources in Jamaica to meet industrial, irrigation and
human needs. Supplementary irrigation is needed in some areas with moisture
deficiencies.
2.04      The potential for agricultural production far exceeds its
performance over the past decade. Only recently has the Government
undertaken a major effort to diversify crop production, increase output,
divest Government parastatals and deregulate the principal commodity boards.
The declines in ezport earnings and employment from the bauxite-alumina
industry, due to depressed demand on world markets and the recent withdrawal
from Jamica of several multinational corporations, have underscored the need
for a revitalization of the agricultural sector for both traditional and
non-traditional crops.
B. The Sugar Subsector
Background
2.05      Sugar production in Jamaica dates back about 300 years.  Sugar has
long been a cornerstone of the economy, an important source of income,



-5-
employment and foreign exchange. The growth of the Industry accelerated
after World War rI; in 1965, sugar production among the 18 factories then in
existence, all privately owned, reached an all-time high of 506,000 tons.
Since 1965, however, production has declined to Its current level of about
210,000 tons (Annex 1), and the ares of cane cultivation has declined from
148,000 acres to about 100,000 acres.
2.06      The sugar industry in Jamaica has had a turbulent history,
punctuated with fractious disputes between factory management, trade unions
and cane farmers over wage demands and the formula for splitting sugar
revenues. After 1965, these problems were exacerbated as growing world
competition in sugar production increased the pressure on the industry for
greater efficiency. In 1970, the Government of Jamaica established the Sugar
Industry Authority (SIA), as the principal policy-making and control entity
for the sugar industry (para. 2.13). It took the first step in its gradual
purchase of eight foreign-owned sugar factories and privately-owned estates.
In 1977, the Government purchased the Frome, Monymusk and Bernard L*dge
factories from Tate and Lyle, UK (a UK-based international sugar company).
The acquisitions gave the Government control of 652 of the sugar processing
capacity in the country, although six of the eight factories (all but Frome
and Ionymusk) have been closed or will soon stop producing sugar. Through
its control of SIA, with its regulatory and marketing functions, and its
ownership of these factories, the Government has exercised a dominant role in
shaping developments in the sugar subsector to date.
2.07      Since 1970, sugar output has steadily declined.  The main reasons
have been:
(a) a decline in the supply and quality of cane from Government-owned
or managed estates, cooperatives and independent farms, caused by
the insufficient and untimely provision of agricultural inputs and
credits, the outbreak of smut and rust disease and discontent with
the price received for cane; for these reasons, the cane yield has
declined over the years from 32 tons/acre to the present average of
about 25 tons/acre;
(b) neglect of the irrigation networks in the Southern Central Plain,
west of Kingston, coupled with salinization and drainage problems,
which led to a sharp decrease in the volume and quality of
irrigation water in this region, affecting the Honymusk estate;
(c) excessive unit production costs in the public sector factories
resulting from high maintenance costs, overstaffing, high fuel oil
consumption and downtime, and poor quality cane; an*
(c) a squeeze on the incomes of the sugar factories and farmers
resulting from revenue distribution under the guaranteed price
scheme administered by SIA.



-6-
2.08     These problems have brought about: (a) mounting financial losses
tothe Cowernment; (b) a lack of reinvestment in factbry and field equipment,
in both the private and public sectors; and (c) a steady deterioration in
factory and field management of the public sector entities.
2.09      Despite its decline, the sugar industry is still vital to the
Jamaican economy. Cane still covers about 25% of the total area under
crops. Sugar is the dominant agricultural export crop and, together with
rum, provides over 602 of the value of all agricultural exports. Sugar-
related activities are also the main source of employment in the agricultural
sector, employing 18S of the agricultural labor force, or about 45,000
workers and farmers. Although the Government is undertiking a concentrated
effort at crop diversification, focusing on joint venture projects with
foreign participation, it is generally accepted that no alternative crop
could fully substitute for sugarcane in the short to medium term.
Principal Sugar Entities
2.10      The sugar industry in Jamaica currently consists of four
privately-owned factories (three of which also produce rum) and five public
sector factories and estates (Frome, Monymusk, Bernard Lodge, Duckenfield and
Long Pond). The Government has declared its intention to stop sugar produc-
tion at Bernard Lodge and Duckenfield and to substitute ethanol production
for sugar. These two factories have already been divested, Bernard Lodge to
the Jamaican Petroleum Company and Duckenfield to a private industrial
conglomerate, Tropicana. Sugar production will cease at these two factories
as soon as ethanol production equipment can be installed. The Long Pond
factory, currently managed by farmers and factory personnel under a lease
arrangement and without the Government's financial support, will continue to
produce sugar.
2.11      Jamaica Sugar Holdings, Ltd. (JSH). On October 1, 1985, the fixed
assets and outstanding shares of Frome and Monymusk were transferred to
Jamaica Sugar Holdings, Ltd. (JSH), a newly-formed Government entity. JSH
has a Board of Directors comprised of the three representatives from the
Government, three from Tate & Lyle Technical Services (TLTS) (a UK management
consultant company and a subsidiary of Tate & Lyle, Ltd.), and a chairman
recently appointed from the Jamaican private sector.
2.12      Private Sugar Sub-sector.  As production of the Government-owned
factories has declined, private industry's share of total sugar production
has risen, to 38X in 1986 compared to 15% 4n 1975. The four privately-owned
sugar factories (Appleton, Hampden, New Yarmouth, Worthy Park) still operate
profitably in spite of aging plant and equipment. Although they represent
smaller production units than the public sector factories, with proportion-
ally higher overheads, the private factories have tended to be more efficient
because their equipment is in better condition and their managerial staff is
more dedicated. However, the private factories are operating close to their
nominal capacity, and cane acreage in their respective supply areas is
limited; therefore, the private sugar factories, which altogether produce
less than the domestic market requirement, could by no means produce the
quantities currently marketable under the export quotas.



-7-
2.13      Sugar Industry AuthoritY (SIA).  SIA is a statutory body
established by an August 1970 amendment to the 1937 Sugar Industry Control
Minister of Agriculture, SIA operates autonomously. While its major
respcasibilities are to regulate the marketing of sugar both internally and
for the export market, at times it has handled the marketing of sugar
directly. However, since 1986, the main responsibility Eor marketing
domestically produced sugar has been vested in a new privately controlled
company (para. 2.18). SIA continues to propose prices for raw sugar and
cane, to arrange financing for the public sector factories and estates
through JSR, and to administer the Sugar Industry Research Institute (para.
2.14). Imports of raw and refined sugar are also channelled through SIA. .
2.14      SIA is nominally controlled by a Board of Directors, which includes
representatives of the farmers, private sector factories and labor unions.
In practice, decisions tend to be made by the Chairman of SIA, who is
nominated by the Minister of Agriculture. In recent years, SIA has become
heavily Involved in the day-to-day problems of the sugar industry and the
public sector factories in particular. As a result, insufficient sttention
has been given to long-term issues and policy reforms. Recently, the situa-
tion has improved because of the divestment of STA's marketing responsi-
bilities (para. 2.17) and the transfer of factory and estate management
responsibilities to TLTS, under JSH control.
2.15      Sugar Industry Research Institute (SIRI).  This once world-renowned
institution has traditionally provided applied research and extension
services in support of the industry, and gained the respect of both factory
and farmer groups. Since 1970, it has been part of SIA, and financial
coostraints have increasingly reduced its effectiveness. SIRI has lost many
of its skilled and experienced staff over the years, and presently lacks
vital equipment and financial resources to carry on with research and other
activities. One of the main objectives of the proposed project is to
strengthen SIRI (paras. 3.11 and 3.12).
Recent Policy Towards the Sugar Industry
2.16      The Government's principal policy objective for sugar is to create
a financially self-sufficient industry capable of meeting the demands of the
preferential export markets (EEC and US) and the domestic market. This
policy is being implemented by rationalizing production in the public sector,
closing unprofitable factories and reducing costs in the remaining units
through improved maagement, optimum cane throughput and investment in modern
equipment.
2.17      In 1984, the Government took a major step to extricate itself from
its manag_ment responsibility for public sector sugar operations and the
mounting losses resulting therefrom. After negotiations with Tate & Lyle
Ltd., a ten-year agreement was signed in June 1984 for the management of the



-8-
Froame, Monymusk and Bernard Lodge factories and estates.2/ The agreement was
predicated on the acceptance by the Government of a corporate planning study
to be undertaken by TLTS covering these three sugar factories which were
responsible for the bulk of public sector sugar production. The agreement
was also dependent on the securing of necessary long-term loan financing.
Under TLTS management, the operations of Frome and Monymusk, in terms of
production, factory efficiency and cane yields, have improved significantly,
and financial losses have been reduced. By 1987, the combined losses of the
public sector sugar factories had been reduced to USSl.0 million equivalent
from an estimated US$10 million per year in the period 1980-1984. By 1988,
it is anticipated that financial self-sufficiency will have been achieved.
Furthermore, the process of cost reduction is anticipated to continue until
1991, by which time the Jamaican public sector sugar industry will produce
raw sugar at a cost of only US$0.15/lb. The Bank has agreed to finance the
expenses of the management contract from the ongoing Export Crops Project
(Loan 2414-JM) and by extending to the project a Project Preparation Advance
(US$1.5 million).
2.18      In 1986, as a further indication of its intention to extricate
itself from the industry, the Government removed the responsibility for sugar
marketing from the Sugar Industry Authority (SIA) and established - private
company to exercise that marketing function, under the control of tule sugar
manufacturers ane cane farmers. This company, Jamaica Cane Products Sales
Company, Ltd. (JCPS), has been operational since the 1986/87 crop season, and
the 'wndustry is now deriving the full benefit of its sales revenues.
C. Experience with Past Bank Lending
2.19      Bank involvement in the agricultural sector in Jamaica started in
the 1S70s with two agricultural credit projects (Loan 719-JM for USS3.7
million and Loan 1004-.JM for US$5.5 million), a First Rural Development
Project (Loan 1464-JM for US$15.0 million), a Forestry Project (Loan 1716-JM
for US$12.0 million), and the First Sugar Rehabilitation Project (Loan
1517-JM for US$18.0 million). The Export Crops Project (Loan 2414-JM for
US$15 million), approved in 1984, is extending subloans for private
agricultural investment and technical assistance to the Government and some
infrastructure needs. In addition, the Bank has made three Structural
Adjustment Loans to Jamaica, which have affected agriculture through policy
support for the deregulation of various Government commodity boards and the
divestment of parastatal entities.
D. The First Sugar Rehabilitation Project
2.20      The First Sugar Rehabilitation Project was initiated in 1978 with
the primary objective of restoring sugar production to a level of 225,000
tons at the Frome, Monymusk and Bernard Lodge factories. Delays in the
installation of machinery, equipment and spare parts financed under the Bank
21 Consisting, since 1985/86, of the Frome and Monymusk factories only; in
1985, the Bernard Lodge factory was considered unviable, and the
Government declared its intention to stop sugar production.



oan, as well as the mismanagement of factory and estate operations and the
general lack of proper maintenance, adversely affected both tle efficiency
and output of operations. Technical assistance consultants were financed
under the first project, but they were introduced into factories on an ad hoc
basis and did not have sufficient authority to improve factory and estate
management. The project was also limited in scope, focusing on factory
rehabilitation only, while the total acreage and productivity of land devoted
to cane continued to decrease. The decrease occurred because of shortages of
fertilizers and other inputs (related to foreign exchange and credit
constraints), poor agronomic practices, and inadequate price incentives to
the farmers. A Project Completion Report, presented in June 1986,
highlighted those constraints and shortcomings.
2.21      The poor performance of the first project was due to fundamental
weaknesses (weak management, overstaffing, inadequate farmer incentives)
which the Government has recently been taking steps to remedy. This is
evidenced in particular by the TLTS management contract (para. 2.10), by the
transfer of marketing responsibility r- the industry itself (para. 2.17), and
by the adoption of a pricing policy aimed at transferring a higher share of
total revenues to the farmers (para. 7.01). The Government has also provided
Jamaica Sugar Holdings (JSH) with sufficient equity funding for initial
working capital requirements.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin and Rationale for Bank Involvement
Origin
3.01      After the Government decided in 1984 to contract TLTS, it started
discussions with the Bank on the possibility of a Second Sugar Rehabilitation
Project, focusing on field as well as factory operations. TLTS conducted a
study which revealed that the Bernard Lodge factory was financially unviable
and that major structural reforms in the industry would be necessary before
the project could be considered for Bank financing. Based on the analysis in
the TLTS study, JSH was established in March 1985, and the fixed assets of
Frome and Monymusk were transferred to it. The project was appraised in
March and May 1985. Negotiations took place in April 1986.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.02      The project would meet the main objectives of Government policy
towards the sugar industry, which are supported by the Bank. These are to
reduce sugar imports, maintain exports to preferential markets, sustain
employment and create a financially self-supporting industry. To this end,
the project focuses on cost reduction, improved management and the
concentration of output on the most efficient production units. With the
project, JSH costs of production, including financing costs and duties, would
go down from USS400/ton of raw sugar (US$0.18/lb), when JSH took over from
NSC, to about US$330/ton of raw sugar (USS0.15). Without the project, it is



- 10 -
certain that Jamaica would lose its EEC quota, which it is only able to
satisfy at present by Liporting refined sugar for domestic consumption.
Also, the employment of over 45,000 workers and farmers would be put in
jeopardy, and Jamaica's foreign exchange earnings be reduced by at least
US$20 million.
3.03      The incremental production resulting from the project would not
pose any marketing problems since the entire projected output of sugar is
destined for domestic consumption and for established markets overseas in
which Jamaica enjoys privileged quotas (EEC and USA).   In fact, without the
project it is certain that Jamaica would lose its EEC quota, which it is only
able to satisfy at present by importing refined sugar for domestic
consumption. The basic rationale for the project, therefore, rests on:
(a) preserving the EEC quota; (b) significantly reducing production costs;
and (c) producing refined sugar for the domestic market. Reductions in the
US quota would only have a marginal effect on total exports, and the project
would still be justified without it.
B. Objectives and General Description
3.04      The objectives of the project are to:  (a) rationalize sugar pro-
duction by concentrating production on efficient units (Frome and Monymusk
factories); (b) raise sugar production in the country to a level sufficient
to satisfy the domestic market and those export markets to which Jamaica has
access under special arrangements (EEC and US); and (c) improve the overall
efficiency and financial viability of the industry. In order to meet these
objectives, the proposed project has been designed around the transfer of
management at Frome and Monymusk te TLTS and the restructuring of marketing
arrangements already referred to in para. 2.17.
3.05      The principal components to be financed under the project are:
(a) rehabilitation of Frome and Monymusk factories and estates, which are
under JSH's control; (b) technical and managerial assistance under a ten-year
management contract with TLTS; (c) rehabilitation of the public irrigation
systems in the Southern Plains area to benefit Monymusk; (d) upgrading of the
capabilities of SIRI (para. 2.14) by providing training and equipment; and
(e) strengthening of a project monitoring and coordination unit.
C. Detailed Features
Rehabilitatio_ of Frome and Monymusk3/
3.06      The TLTS study detailed the physical deficiencies responsible for
the unsatisfactory level of performance at the Frome and Monymusk factories
and estates. These deficiencies include: aging factory and field machinery
and equipment, lack of spare parts, and inadequate storage and maintenance
facilities. The proposed project has consequently been designed to:
(a) rehabilitate and modernise factory equipmert, including the purchase and
installation of new equipment and the provision of an adequate supply of
3/ See Annex 2 for a detailed description of the rehabilitation of
the Frome and Monymusk factories and estates.



- 11 -
parts; (b) purchase new agricultural equipment for the cane estates and
improve the workshop infrastructure for equipment maintenance and repair; and
(c) restore the estates' irrigation and road infrastructure. The total cost
of rehabilitation is estimated at US$25.4 million, including contingencies.
While most of these costs would be financed by the Bank loan (about US$16.8
million, including contingencies), about US$5.1 million would be available
through external suppliers" credits requiring the guarantee of the Government
to the export credit agencies of supplying countries. Potential suppliers
under this scheme are expected to be from the United States, the United
Kingdom, other members of the EEC, and possibly Brazil.
Provision of Technical and Management Assistance
3.07       Under the JSU agreement, TLTS would appoint JSH's Managing
Director, who would have overall managerial responsibility for the company's
operations. Key personnel would be posted in managerial and supervisory
positions at Frome and Monymusk. The management agreement calls for
123 staff years of service in Jamaica by TLTS staff over a ten-year period
beginning October 1985.  The contraet would be subject to review after five
years. As the project progresses, TLTS would commence a phased program of
reducing the numbers of its own staff to be replaced by qualified Jamaicans
trained from within JSH, Frome and Monymusk. TLTS has comuitted itself to
institute a formal training program, now in preparation, to fill new or
vacated posts in field, factory a-d administrative operations.  In the final
year of the management contract, five TLTS personnel would remain holding key
managerial responsibilities, including the Managing Director of JSH. The
Bank loan would finance the total cost of the management contract, estimated
at about US$9.0 million, including contingencies, in foreign exchange, over a
four-year period. The Bank has reviewed the financial terms of the
management contract and found it reasonable and acceptable for
financing. Also, the Bank has reviewed and approved the qualifications of
the TLTS staff which is currently in charge of JSH operations.
The Government has submitted a signed management contract between the
Government and TLTS, satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations, the
Government gave assurances that key managerial positions in JSH under the
management contract would be filled with candidates satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 9.01).
Rehabilitation of Irrigation Systems4/
3.08     To develop cane production in the Monymusk factory area, the project
would rehabilitate sections of three irrigation systems: the Clarendon,
St. Dorothy and Rio Cobre canal systems. The Clarendon systems distribute
water to cane farmers in the Mid-Clarendon Plains and to the Monymusk and New
Yarmouth Estates. These systems irrigate about 40,000 acres, mostly under
cane, and derive their supply from the Rio Minho, the Milk River, the Cockpit
Springs and deepwells. The St. Dorothy system irrigates about 5,000 acres,
of which 2,000 acres are under cane. It derives its supply exclusively from
4/ See Annex 3 for a detailed discussion of the "Rehabilitation of the
Irrigation System.-



- 12 -
deepwells. The Rio Cobre system irrigates the Innswood Estate and farmers'
cane lands supplying cane to the Monymusk factory; it covers about 30,000
acres, of which 11,000 acres would remain under cane, and derives its supply
from the Rio Cobre and deepwells. Detailed studies on the nature and scope
of the rehabilitation program for cane production were prepared prior to
appraisal by a local TLTS subsidiary (Wallace Evans). The loan would provide
about US$5.3 million, including contingencies, for the purchase of
maintenance eauipment and expenditures for improving the canal systems and
the deepwe'.ls.
3.09      The Underground Water Authority (UWA), attached to the Ministry of
Agricuitu e (MINAG), would be responsible for the implementation of the
rehabilitation program.   This program would be carried out within the
six-year project period and executed by private contractors and under force
account (para. 4.08). UWA is receiving technical assistance from various
external agencies and will be further stren'gthened by the transfer of the
local irrigation technicians from the National Water Commission. UWA is
experienced and able to carry out this component. MINAG's Division of
Agricultural Engineering and Irrigation, jointly with the relevant irrigation
authorities, is responsible for the routine maintenance of the system.
3.10     The charges collected by UWA for irrigation water represent only
about 1OZ of the real cost of water. MINAG has commissioned FAO to produce a
study to develop a basis for setting irrigation tariffs in the public
irrigation systems in order to significantly reduce the level of subsidies.
During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it would introduce a
program to reduce the level of water subsidy5/ and improve collection of
charges from agricultural users (para. 9.01).
Provision of Training and Equipment for SIRI
3.11      SIRI has provided strong technical support to the industry in the
past and has gained the respect of factory and farmer groups in the country.
However, its effectiveness has deteriorated over the years as a result of
financial and managerial constraints.
3.12     Under -'  proposed project, the two departments of SIRI-Field and
Factory Technology-would be consolidated.  The Field Department would
emphasize varietal selection, crop monitoring and surveying, and economic
research. Its extension staff would advise farmers on ways to increase crop
productivity and improve cane quality. The Factory Technology Department
would continue to monitor the factories' performance and sugar quality and to
implement limited personnel training. About US$1.5 million, including
contingencies, would be financed by the loan to upgrade SIRI's research,
monitoring, extension and training program activities and capabilities.
Items to be financed would include equipment and training abroad. During
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it would conclude the
administrative reorganization of SIRI before October 31, 1987 (para. 9.01).

Streongthening of Project Coordination and Monitoring
3.13      The small monitoring and coordination unit for the Export Crops
Project, already established in MINAG, would be strengthened to oversee
project implementation (para. 5.01). For this component, the loan would
finance about US$100,000, including contingencies. The Government gave
assurances that it would adequately staff and maintain the Project
Coordination Unit in KINAG until the end of the project (para. 9.01).
Project Preparation
3.14      Because Board presentation was postponed until agreement has been
reached on a macroeconomic policy framework, the Bank has extended a Project
Preparation Advance (US$1.5 million) to the Government. This advance would
finance the TLTS management contract, which has been effective since October
1985.
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
A. ProJect Cost
4.01       The total project cost over the six-year-project implementation
period (fiscal years 1988-1993) is estiuated at approximately US$47.1
million, exclusive of import duties, including a foreign exchaige cost of
US$37.1 million, or 79% of the total. All cost tables and financial
projections are presented in US dollars, given the predominance of foreign
costs.
4.02      Contingencies have been calculated as follows:
(a) physical contingencies - a flat rate of 8% was applied to all
baseline capital costs, with the exception of the base and
incentive fees of the management contract, the working capital
and the Project Preparation Advance; and
(b) price contingencies - 1% for fiscal years 1988 to 1990, 3.5%
for years 1991 to 1993 for all capital costs, with the
exceptions noted in (a) above, based on forecasts for
international inflation. For local costs, 6% for fiscal years
1988 and 1989; 5% for 1990; and 4S between 1991 and 1993.

B. Financing
4.04     Of the total project cost of US$47.1 million, the Bank loan would
cover US$34.0 million (72% of total project costs). About US$5.1 million
(112) would be provided by external suppliers' credits and US$8.0 million
(17%) by the Government. The Bank financing would cover US$27.8 million
(852) of the foreign exchange costs and US$2.3 million (23%) of the local
costs. The foreign exchange not covered by the Bank loan would be met by
suppliers' credits and by about US$0.9 million in down payments from JSH to
foreign suppliers.6/   A sum of US$1.5 million has been allocated to the
Government as a Project Preparation Advance to finance the costs of the
management contract during JSH's 1985/86 fiscal year.
4.05      The Government's cash equity contribution to JSR of US$6.0
million would include US$3.0 million for permanent working capital. MINAG
would make available the counterpart funds (about US$0.8 million) for the
implementation of the irrigation rehabilitation and project coordination
components; the sugar industry would provide local counterpart funds for
SIRI.
4.06      A detailed financing plan is presented in Annex 5, and is
sumarized as follows:

- 16 -
4.07      To implement the project, MINAG would:  (a) on-lend loan funds to
JSH on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan; and (b) transfer loan
funds as grants to SIA for the SIRI part of the project. JSH would allocate
Bank resources and other forms of borrowing to its subsidiaries as equity
participation, at no additional cost. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by JSH.
C. Procurement
4.08     Civil works for irrigation rehabilitation, estimated to cost about
US$2.0 million, would be executed by contracts awarded through Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Because of the
diverse nature of rehabilitation works and the small size of the respective
contracts, foreign bidders are not expected to bid; however, they would not
be excluded from doing so. Minor rehatilitation works would be carried out
under force account.
4.09     All executing agencies would procure equipment, vehicles and
miscellaneous goods with individual contracts of less than US$100,000 through
International/Local Shopping (ILS), after obtaining at least three quotations
from local or international suppliers. Contracts estimated to cost more than
US$100,000 would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB),
in accordance with Bank guidelines. The aggregate of the amount for ILS
should not exceed US$8.3 million for JSH and US$2.8 million for MINAG. These
procedures would be employed because a large variety of equipment and spare
parts cannot be grouped and would have to be procured separately for factory
and irrigation rehabilitation. Procurement of goods financed under the
suppliers' credits would be carried out through procedures required by the
financing agents, provided the Bank is satisfied that they lead to efficient
and timely implementation of the project.
4.10     Civil works contracts, estimated to cost over US$200,000, and goods
and services contracts over US$100,000 would be subject to Bank review of
procurement documentation. The Bank would review at least 50 contracts,
which would cover about 50% of civil works and goods procured. During
supervision, the Bank would randomly check smaller contracts. During
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that procurement procedures
described in paras. 4.08 to 4.10 would be followed.
4.11      The management agreement between JSH and TLTS was finalized before
project appraisal. The Bank approved the terms and conditions of the
contract negotiated between the Government and TLTS.

D. Disbursement
4.13     The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported goods and
services for agroindustrial investment In the sugar industry
(US$13.5 million);
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for the management and technical
assistance to the sugar industry (US$9.0 million);
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment and 70% of local
expenditures for civil works for the irrigation rehabilitation
program (US$4.5 million); and
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures for coordination and research,
including equipment, operation and maintenance and staff training
for the sugar industry (US$1.3 million).
In addition, there would be an unallocated amount of US$4.2 million to cover
physical and price contingencies, and an amount of US$1.5 million to recover
the Project Preparation Advance.
4.14      In order to reduce its prefinancing requirements, the Government
would open a Special Account in the Bank of Jamaica, with an initial deposit
of US$2.0 million. This amount would cover about four months of the
anticipated expenditures. To the extent possible, all eligible individual
expenditures would be paid from the Special Account. All disbursements would
be fully documented except those against contracts valued at the equivalent
of US$20,000 or less; disbursement against these contracts, which would also
include contracts for minor rehabilitation works under force account, would
be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure.
4.15      The estimated schedule of loan disbursements is based on a six-year
period (Annex 6). There is good reason to believe that most of the project
would be implemented in the four years during which the TLTS management team
would be financed under the loan. TLTS, which would have been at work for
more than two years before the loan becomes effective, has already started
the rehabilitadion program, and procurement documentation is well advanced.
However, the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems has not yet been
started and may require the full six-year project period. Disbursements for
retroactive financing up to US$3.4 million would be permitted for
expenditures made for technical assistance to JSH after August 1, 1985, and
for urgent rehabilitation work at Frome and Monymtsk during the 1985 and 1986
maintenance periods.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Management and Coordination
5.01     The day-to-day management of the Frome and Monymusk rehabilitation
component would be in the hands of JSH using TLTS services; the Underground
Water Authority (UWA), under the direct control of MINAG, would manage the
irrigation component. SIRI, under the control of SIA, would be responsible
for research. The Bank is satisfied with the capabilities of these
agencies. A unit already established for the Export Crops Project
(para. 2.16) within MINAG would be strengthened and used for the coordination
of the proposed project. This unit would: (a) liaise wlth the Bank in the
disbursement of loan funds to the various entities benefiting from the
project; (b) oversee the activities of UWA and the local water authorities
related to the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems; and (c) administer
the procurement of goods and services, except for JSH.
B. Monitoring and Reporting
5.02     MINAG would establish a project monitoring system.  It would collect
and analyze information on project achievements for comparison with targets,
alert management to problems, and provide a basis for the annual and medium-
term planning exercises. Initial indicators and time-phased targets
established prior to project execution would provide a benchmark for compari-
son of targets and actual results. The project coordinator would be respon-
sible for project monitoring and would consolidate all information into a
semi-annual progress report, a copy of which would be sent to the Bank. Key
indicators for monitoring work are presented in Annex 7. The data generated
under the project would provide information for preparing the Project
Completion Report. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that
MINAG would prepare: (a) the semi-annual progress reports, to be sent to the
lank not later than three months after the end of each period; and (b) the
Project Completion Report, to be sent to the Bank within six months after the
Project Closing Date (para. 9.01).
C. Accounts and Auditing
5.03     The accounts for all project expenditures, except for JSH, under the
responsibility of the project coordination unit in MINAG, would be maintained
separately in the accounting section of MINAG. The accounts would be audited
annually according to standard Government practice, which is satisfactory to
the Bank. The audit reports would include specific reference to the adequacy
of procedures used to verify and prepare statements of expenditure for dis-
bursement requests. JSH's accounts would be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and according to standard business practices and
specific TLTS management contract obligations. During negotiations, the
Government gave assurances that it would follow the procedures described in
this paragraph and forward the project's and JSH's audited accounts to the
Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 9.01).

D. Financial Performance Covenants Concerning JSH
5.04      In order to ensure adequate funds from retained earnings to finance
future capital expenditures and working capital requirements, during
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that:
(a)  the payment of dividends would be prohibited during the first and
second project years; and
(b)  except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, JSH would not incur any
debt or pay out any dividends unless the net revenues of JSH shall
be at least 1.5 times the estimated maximum debt service
requiremencs (para. 9.01).
5.05      The net book value of the fixed assets of Frome and Monymusk, as of
September 30, 1984, is estimated at US$9.9 million. Much of it represents
the value of trh equipment provided under the first loan. During
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that a revaluation of JSH's
fixed assets would be undertaken by December 31, 1988 (para. 9.01).
VI. PRODUCTION, DEMAND, MARKET AND PRICES
A. Production and Demand
6.01     Sugar production at Frome and Monymusk is projected to increase from
about 100,000 tons in the first project year to about 160,000 tons in the
fourth year of the project. Frome is expected to reach peak production by
the end of the third year. However, a possible lag in the installation of
irrigation infrastructure in the Monymusk region could delay the achievement
of peak production at the Monymusk factory until the fourth year of the
project. Sugar output from the four private factories is expected to
increase only slightly due to plant capacity limitations and restricted cane
supply. The Long Pond factory is expected to continue its operations without
Government financial support under a lease arrangement with local producers
and factory staff, and produce about 12,000 tons per year. The Government
has confirmed to the Bank that the Bernard Lodge and Duckenfield factories
will go out of sugar production as soon as the installation of equipment for
ethanol production has been completed in these factories. On the basis of
these assumptions, total national production is projected as follows:

6.02     The above projections assume that all cane acreage envisaged under
the project would be maintained in cane cultivation and not diverted to other
crops or uses. Any diminution of estate cane supply destined under the
project for Frome and Monymusk would adversely affect the financial viability
of these factories, particularly Monymusk. Consequently, during
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that no public land envisaged
under the project as a source of cane supply would be diverted to other uses
unless an economic analysis, satisfactory to the Bank, demonotrated their
comparative economic advantage for other agricultural production (para.
9.01).
6.03      Overall local demand for sugar at present Is estimated at between
95,000 and 105,000 tons per annum, including about 35,000 tons of refined
sugar. Presently, all refined sugar consumed in the country is imported.
Uinder the proposed project, Nonymusk would start to refine sugar In the first
year and reach peak production in the third year of operation. At that time,
refined sugar production would have reached 40,000 tons per annum, sufficient
to satisfy projected local demand. The projected overseas demand for raw
sugar is based entirely on the privileged import quotas established in the
EEC (mainly UK) and US markets for Jamaican sugar, under the Lome Convention
and the US sugar quota. Under present quotas, this market demand amounts to
about 135,000 tons per annum, of which 125,000 tons go to the EEC.
6.04     Production of molasses at Frome and Honymusk would rise,
in proportion to sugar output from 45,000 tons in the first year to 65,000
tons in the last year of the project. With the exception of small amounts
sold directly for use in livestock feeding, all molasses produced in the
country is used for rum production.



- 22-
B. Market and Prices
6.05     There are three principal markets for Jamaican sugar:  (a) the local
market; (b) the EEC (mainly the UK); and (c) the US. The present sizes of
these markets are as follows:
Table 6.2:   Sugar Markets
(tons raw sugar equivalent/year)
Local-ref ined      45,000
-raw           65,000
Export-EEC quota   125,000
-USA quota    10,000
Total              245,000
In the final year of the project, the total annual factory-gate value of
sugar production in Jamaica would come to about US$88 million, including
total sales from JSH of about US$58 million.
6.06      Export Prices.  During the 1984 Lome III negotiations, the Jamaican
quota of 125,000 tons remained unchanged. However, the EEC has strongly
intimated that Jamaica may lose part of this quota if it continues to import
offsetting quantities for the local market. The present selling price for
Jamaica raw sugar in the UK is equivalent to J$ 2,170/metric ton (US$395)
ex-factory Jamaica. The proposed project would permit Jamaica to increase
production to satisfy the local market and hence to comply with Lome III
requirements. In the US, Jamaica has an annual quota, presently 0.6% of the
'declared off-shore demand for sugar." In light of the lobbying effort in
the US by in&dstrial users, and the continuing decline in sugar consumption,
it is reasonable to assume that the overall level of raw sugar imports and
the amount allocated to Jamaica on the US market will at best remain at its
low level in the near future. The present selling price for Jamaica raw
sugar in the US is equivalent to J$ 2,400/metric ton (US$436) ex-factory
Jamaica.
6.07     Domestic Market Prices.  The Government, through SIA or another
designated agency, would continue to import sugar until local production
builds up to meet both domestic and export requirements; it would also
maintain the authority to establish both wholesale and retail prices for the
local market. It is expected that the Government would continue its policy
of maintaining local wholesale and retail prices substantially higher than
export prices (and world market prices for imported sugar) as a means of
securing needed revenue for debt servicing of SIA accounts and other
purposes. The sugar industry would have no claims to these profits. During
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the industry's ex-factory



- 23 -
price for sugar destined for the local market would not be less than the
average es-factory price for sugar sold on the export market (para. 9.01).
6.08      Traditionally, about two-thirds of the price received for raw sugar
goes to cane farmers and one-third to the factories. During the period from
1978 to the present, although the guaranteed price remained in the
proportions of two-thirds and one-third, the final price paid to the industry
became distorted through ad hoc grants and subsidies to factories and farmers
alike. The split in 1985/86 was approximately 61.92 for the farmers and
38.1% for the factories. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that it would inform the Bank of the ratio for the distribution of the sugar
sales proceeds between the factories and the farmers not later than July 31
of each year and request Bank's approval (para. 9.01). The Bank has approved
the ratio for 1987/88 crop (62%:38%).
6.09      Economic prices for sugsr sold on the domestic market are based on
import parity prices for raw st'gdr produced in the Caribbean region, plus
appropriate margins for refining, transport and handling to the main points
of wholesaling; prices used in the financial analysis are based on the
weighted average of sugar sold on the export markets.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF JSH
A. Introduction
7.01      Accumulated losses of the public sector sugar industry of
US$84 million equivalent (para. 7.02) were written off by the Government in
1985 when JSK was created. Losses of approximately US$2.8 million incurred
between 1985/1987 (Annex 9B) would be fully recovered by 1990, after which
date cumulative profits will accrue (para. 7.06). A key factor contributing
to the financial viability of JSH has been the deregulation of the marketing
function from SIA to the industry itself. The impact of this change has
considerably improved the financial outlook for JSH, the private sector sugar
factories and the cane farmers. To illustrate, in 1983/84, the industry
received sugar payments from SIA equal to about 85% of the proceeds from
export sales. In 1984/85, the ratio was even less. In 1986/87, it is
projected that the industry will gain about J$ 72.0 million from full
recovery of sales proceeds. Indeed, the substantial projected additional
inflow of reve.ues to the factories and farmers would more than compensate
for the effects of any required adjustments in cane quality standards and the
sugar price split, and lessen any concerns over the elimination of present
explicit or implicit finaacial support to the industry as Government
regulation and involvement are reduced.
B. Past Performance and Present Financial Position
7.02      Financial data indicate a cumulative loss of J$ 130 million in the
operations of Frome and Monyuusk by the end of 1984, out of a total of
J$ 502 million (US$84 million) incurred by the entire public sector
industry. The auditors in Jamsica have prepared audited statements through
September 30, 1985, for the Frome and Monymusk factories. The two crop
seasons (1985/86 and 1986/87) under the TLTS management have been profitable



- 24 -
for the From  factory, with an expected profit of about JS 9.4 million for
fiscal year 1986/87. For the Monymusk factory, the level of annual losses
has been reduced from JS 63.0 million In 1984 (before takeover) to JS 13.2
million for fiscal year 1986/87.
C. Future Financial Performance
Financing Plan
7.03      In addition to Bank financing, the financing plan for JSH Includes
suppliers' credits of about US$5.1 million.9/ The financing plan also calls
for the Government's cash equity contribution of US$6.0 million. The
Government has (a) transferred the fixed assets of Frome and Monymusk to JSR,
as part of equityL'/; and (b) waived all statutory debts and assumed all
outstanding debt obligations incurred prior to inception of project
implementation.
Financial Projections II/
7.04      The projected profitability for JSH under the project is
satisfactory, although better for From than Monymusk. The major reasons for
the higher profitability of Frome are:
(a) sugar production at Frome would reach its peak of 91,000 tons in the
third year of the project, whereas Monymusk would reach its peak
production of 69,000 tons only during the fourth year of the project
(molasses productioni would differ proportionately);
(b) projected cane yield per acre is higher in the Froze region. At
Monyuusk, salinity problems and lack of sufficient irrigation water
are limiting factors in cane production. In the 'ast year of the
project, cane production delivered to the Frome fictory would be
914,000 tons. At Monymosk, cane production in :he last year is
estimated at 740,000 tons;
(c) in the last year of the project, the tons cane/ton sugar (TC/TS) ratio
would be more favorable at Frome for agronomic reasons, reaching a
figure of 10.0 in comparison to 10.5 for Monymusk;
9/ JSR's subsidiaries would cover the costs of JSH's overall operations;
their contributions to JSU would be in a proportion to their earning
capacities.
1O/ This has been done through the transfer to JSH of the outstanding
shares of Prone and Nonymusk formerly held by NSC.
llt Assumptions for financial projections are in Annex 12.



- 25 -
(d) cane in the Frome area is produced under rainfed conditions, whereas
in the Monymusk area irrigation Is a prerequisite; additional
expenditures for water charges and for pumping water from a network of
boreholes significantly impact on Monymusk's profitability; and
(e) capital expenditure for the rehabilitation of Monymusk is slightly
higher than Frome.
7.05      It is clear that Frome is operating under higher economies of scale
and superior efficiencies in field operations. Over a 20-year project life,
the financial rate of return on the incremental investment plus assets at
current book value has been estimated at over 1002 for Frome and 16% for
Monymusk. On a consolidated basis for JSH, the financial rate of return is
63%. In the case of Frome, the book value of the assets is clearly
underestimated at the present time and would have :o be revalued (para.
5.05). Despite Monymusk's less profitable performance, the "without project'
scenario of little alternative employment in the area argues for the
continuation of Monymusk under enhanced factory operating and field
conditions.
7.06      The projected consolidated results of Frome and Monymusk show a net
profit of about US$3.7 million at the end of the first project year (Annex
15). With growing sugar output and improvements in factory and field
efficiencies, JSH is projected to present a net profit of about US$7.0
million in the following years. However, because of prior losses incurred
by JSH during the two crop seasons (1985/86 and 1986/87), after taking over
from NSC but b^fore Year 1 of the project, the cumulative cash surplus will
only become positive by Year 3 (US$6.7 million); from there on, the net flow
of funds would be adequate to meet future capital expenditures, including the
costs of the TLTS management contract (Annexes 10 and 15).
7.07      The calculation of sugar prices and the net return to the industry
are shown in Annex 8. The prices indicated for the EEC and US market are
present-day prices. The present effective quota for Jamaican sugar in the US
has been discounted from 20,000 tons to 10,000 tons throughout the project
life. The weighted average ex-factory return from export sales, before fixed
expenses for the JCPS, is calculated at approximately US$381/ton at the start
of the project. Other fixed expenses reduce the net average return to the
industry (factories and farmers). to US$360/ton (about US$0.16/lb).
7.08      These financial projections assume that the Government will not
remove current import and stamp duties on purchases of certain equipment
(Annex 12).
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
A.  Benefits and Justification
8.01     A major benefit of the project would be the increase in national
sugar production from its current low level (210,000 tons) to a level which
would cover both local demand and privileged export quotas (245,000 tons).
This increase would be achieved after allowing for the closure of the two
non-assisted public sector sugar factories (Bernard Lodge and Duckenfield).



- 26 -
The incremental production would substitute for all sugar imports, including
refined sugar.
8.02      The following benefits would be derived from the project:
(a) rationalization of the sugar industry by narrowing production to the
two largest public sector factories and five smaller factories,
resulting in a higher level of utilization of installed capacity and
higher efficiency;
(b) strengthening of SIRI;
(c) reintroduction of more efficient management practices and training
of Jamaican staff;
(d) stabilization of the employment levels in the sugar industry;
(e) increase of irrigation water resources leading sugar farmers and
potential investors to explore alternative crops, especially in areas
where cane transport and production are particularly expensive
(Innswood, St. Catherine and Mid-Clarendon Plains);
(f) elimination of public subsidies, contributing to a reduction in the
Government's budgetary deficit; and
(g) improvement of balance of payments.
B. Economic Rate of Return
8.03      The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project has been
estimated at 30% (Annex 16).
Without Project Situation
8.04      In the absence of the project, production at both Frome and
Monymusk factories would have stopped entirely by the end of the 1985/86
milling season.12/ Without the extensive maintenance undertaken by the TLTS
task force during the 1984 off-season, not even the Froze factory would have
been in condition to mill the curre_t cane crop. In addition, without the
managerial assistance of TLTS during the 1984/85 and 1985/86 crop seasons,
combined with some Government financial support, the factories would not have
been able to raise the necessary short-term financinp from the local banking
system. "Without project' benefits are based on 50% of the book value of the
residual equipment and machinery plus the revenue that could be diverted from
leasing the land; there are assumed to be no 'without project" costs.
12/ Without the TLTS task force, production would have continued in both
factories, during the 1984/85 and presulably the 1985/86 milling
seasons. However, because of poor operational efficiency, the very high
level of financial losses would have become unsustainable for the
Government.



- 27 -
Costs
8.05      All project costs, including contingencies, have been included in
the ERR calculation. Sugar production costs are based on projections made by
JSH for its budgetary planning assessment; they include the full operational
and maintenance cost of providing irrigation water. Labor has not been
shadow-rated.
Prices
8.06     The analysis assumes that 56% of the raw sugar produced by the
public sector factories would be exported at the prices prevailing for the
privileged export quotas. Indeed, EEC's sugar quota prices from its African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries are linked to sugar prices paid to EEC beet
producers. Based on the continuity of EEC policy towards its farmers and the
overall support demonstrated towards ACP countries, these prices are not
expected to change substantially over the next decade. In estimating the
value of the raw and refined sugar to be produced and consumed locally (44Z
of the total production), the import parity prices for raw sugar have been
used; these prices were derived from the projected international raw sugar
prices in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1995, as presented in the IBRD Commodity
Projections (August 1986); values for the intervening years were
interpolated. Current low prices of about US$0.07/lb are expected to improve
tV USSO.11/lb in 1988/89 and reach US$0.13/lb for the next three years; then,
Laey would decrzase to US$0.12/lb. A surcharge of US$17 per ton covering
handling and local transport costs was added to these prices to determine the
economic price of imported sugar delivered to the wholesale local market.
Molasses were valued on the basis of US$9.5 per ton of sugar produced. An
extra allowance of US$45 for the production of refined sugar was adopted to
reflect the market price differential between refined and raw sugar.
Project Life
8.07      Rates of return of the project have been calculated over a 20-year
period.   The costs of replacement of project investments with economic lives
shorter than 20 years have been included in the calculation.
Sensitivity Analysis
8.08      To measure the impact of possible changes in the assumptions
underlying the project's stream of costs and benefits, sensitivity tests were
made. Should the world market prices for raw sugar fall 202 below IBRD
projections, the ERR would still be an acceptable 20%. Total project
henefits should decrease by 14Z (switching value), corresponding to world
market prices 40% below projections, before the ERR would reach the value of
the opportunity cost of capital (10%); a 16% increase of the project costs
would have the same effect. Should the price paid under the EEC quota fall
by 10% because of current improving efficiency and rationalization in the
beet sugar industry, the ERR would decrease to 21%. Finally, a two-year lag
in achieving project benefits would bring the ERR below the opportunity cost
of capital; this assumption can be ruled out because the project is already
under implementation and loan effectiveness is unlikely to be delayed. The
ERR appears adequate for a sugar rehabilitation pro,ect, despite the current
uncertainties which could affect the future of that commodity.



- 28 -
C. Employment
8.09      The project would prevent considerable losses in employment which
may be expected should the public sector sugar factories be closed or
operated far below capacity. Most of the production increase would be the
consequence of improved efficiency in the field and factory operations and
would not entail additional employment. Consequently, the project would help
safeguard the employment of the 45,000 Jamaicans now deriving their income
from the industry.
D. Project Risks
8.10      The principal risks facing the project are related to three major
issues: (a) Jamaica's continued access to the EEC market; (b) sustained
Government commitment to appropriate sectoral policies as well as good
management in Government-owned industry; and (c) the Government's ability to
supply the initial cash required to get the industry back on its feet. A
major change in Lome provislons would imply a restructuring of world
agriculture trade, which seems unlikely in the medium term. While a fall in
the EEC price of sugar is possible, it is not expected to exceed 10%, thus
allowing the ERR to remain satisfactory. The degree of the Government's
commitment to policy and institutional reform is already being demonstrated
in its closing of financially unviable factories, the installation of
high-quality professional management in the remaining public sector
factories, and the creation of a new privately managed sugar marketing
company. Continued fiscal constraints are inevitable, but the Government has
already provided JSH with sufficient funding for its initial years of
operations; within three years, the project should be self-financing.  On a
larger scale, the project would create stability in an industry whose foreign
exchange earnings are vital to the country's balance of payments, and
safeguard the incomes of 45,000 workers and farmers who depend on the
industry.
IX. SUMMARY OF ASSURANCES PROVIDED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01     During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a) appointments to key managerial positions in 3SH under the management
contract would be subject to Bank's approval (para. 3.07);
(b) it would Introduce the program to reduce the level of water subsidy
and improve collection of charges from agricultural users, within
the first year of project imulementation (para. 3.10);
(c) it would implement an administrative reorganization of SIRI before
October 31, 1987 (para. 3.12);
(d) it would adequately staff and maintain the Project Coordination Unit
in MINAG until the end of the project (para. 3.13);



- 29 -
(e)  it would follow procurement procedures outlined in paras. 4.08-4.10;
(f)  MINAG would prepare and send to the Bank semi-annual progress
reports and the Project Completion Report (para. 5.02);
(g)  it would follow the audit procedures outlined in para. 5.03 and
forward the project's and JSH's audited accounts to the Bank within
six months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.03);
(h)  it would comply with the financial covenants outlined in
paras. 5.04 and 5.05;
(i)  no public land envisaged under the project as a source of cane
supply would be diverted to other uses unless an economic analysis,
satisfactory to the Bank, demonstrated its comparative advantage
(para. 6.02);
(j)  the industry's ex-factory price for sugar destined for the local
market would not be less than the average ex-factory price for sugar
sold on the export market (para. 6.07); and
(k)  it would inform the Bank of the ratio for the distribution of sugar
sales proceeds by July 31 of each year, such ratio to be satis-
factory to the Bank (para. 6.08).
9.02     With the above assurances, the proposed project would constitute a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$34 million to the Government of
Jamaica. The loan would have a term of 17 years, with a grace period of 4
years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rates.

SECOND SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
RehablitatiLo  of the          al
General
1.        Irrigation is an important factor in cane agriculture on the
Southern plains, west of Kingston, which contains about 40% of sugarcane
acreage on the island. Sugarcane producers need to irrigate their lands
because of the low rainfall and its irregular distribution in this part of
the island. Considerable investments have been made to set up irrigation
systems, but these systems have become obsolete, with some dating from the
last century, and are ineffective. Furthermore, there has not been any
significant investment to improve or rehabilitate these systems. Therefore,
there is a need to develop water resources in the main agricultural region of
the island, in order to increase agricultural production.
Institutional Arrangements
2.        The Underground Water Authority (UWA) of the Ministry of
Agriculture, controls the allocation of irrigation water resources and is
responsible for all administrative and budgetary functions. UWA, jointly
with the Division of Agricultural Engineering and Irrigation in HINAG, has
the technical capability to rehabilitate or develop the infrastructure.
Normal operation and maintenance responsibilities are executed by the
Mid-Clarendon and the St. Dorothy irrigation authorities, and by the Rio
Cobre Irrigation Water (RCIW) system, all of which are under UWA's direct
control. These entities have little technical competency and insufficient
budgetary resources. Their budget is funded by the Ministry of Agriculture,
while all the charges collected from the water users are turned over to a
consolidated fund in the national Treasury. Charges currently correspond to
a fraction of real operations and maintenance costs (less than 10% for the
Mid-Clareudon Irrigation Authority), which means that the cost of water Is
heavily subsidized. High tariffs for electricity, low efficiency of the
power and pump networks and general waste of water are the main causes for
the excessive production cost of irrigation water.

Irrigation Resources in the St. Catherine Plains
2.      In the close surroundings of the Kingston-Spanish Town-Old Harbour
urban centers, where 45% of the island population is concentrated, about
50,000 acres of land could be irrigated; only 30,000 acres are so far covered
by the RCID. While most of this acreage is presently under cane,
less than 12,000 acres would remain under cane after the closure of the
Bernard Lodge factory. Cane cultivation would be concentrated in the areas
west of Spanish Town; at the Innswood Estates (plus some of the west Bernard
Lodge Estate); at the St. Dorothy Plains, around Old Harbour; and in some
neighboring farms. The Central and Eastern sections of the St. Catherine
Plains would stop growing cane after 1985, and alternative irrigated crops
would have to be developed (pastures, winter vegetables, soybeans, sorghum,
etc.).
3.      The main water resources in the St. Catherine Plains are diverted
from the Rio Cobre river by a gravity maiA canal and a system of secondary
branches and distributors; most of the system is over one century old.
Total flow, originally designed for 25,000 cubic yds/hr (5.0 cubic m/sec), is
down to 12,000 cubic yds/hr, or half its normal capacity. Lower discharge
from the river, coupled with poor condition of the canals (due to siltation
and weed growth in the unlined canals) are the main reasons for the reduced
availability of water resources. To improve the water flow along the canal,
the following works would be required:
(a) the replacement of the wooden flashboards at the Rio Cobre headworks
by a more effective device for limiting the losses and raising the
level of water upstream;
(b) the repair of the main canal and branch embankments;
(c) the regular maintenance of the main canal and branches by mechanical
weedcutting and silt dredging; and
(d) the lining of some sections of branch canals where seepage accounts
for serious losses.
Total costs for these improvements are detailed in the attached table.
4.      In addition to the water resources supplied under gravity by the RCIW
system, the St. Catherine Plains have an extensive network of deep wells
which pump groundwater to supplement the above resources. Total nominal
capacity of well production is about 18,000 cubic yds/hr (3.6 cubic mfsec),
with over 100 wells in operation. This capacity is not permanently
exploited, but it supplements the RCIW resources during the dry season.
Groundwater resources appear to have been overexploited, which has resulted
in the salinization of the aquifer; no more than 12,000 cubic yds/hr (2.4



- 35 -
ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 7
cubic o/sec) should be drawn from the aquifer under current conditions if
further deterioration is to be avoided. To improve groundwater production
and water quality, the following works are necessary:
(a) the relocation of well fields where excessive salinization has
developed as a consequence of overpumping the aquifer; and
(b) the replacement of well equipment where heavy sand pumping occurs.
Total costs for these improvements are detailed in the attached table.
5.        Rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure in the St. Catherine
Plains is likely to restore total water availability to about 30,000 cubic
yds/hr (6.0 cubic m/sec); however, this quantity is still insufficient to
irrigate the 30,000 acres already equipped, or the 50,000 acres ultimately
available. Increased water resources would require major investment
programs, such as: (a) the development of groundwater resources of the
Linstead Basin in the Central region of the island; (b) the systematic
recharge of the aquifers during the high discharge periods of the Rio Cobre
river; and (c) the construction of small dams downstream on the Rio Cobre
river to allow pumping of the small flow currently lost intc the sea. These
developments are beyond the scope of this project.
Irrigation Resources in the Clarendon Plains
6.        With 67,000 acres of irrigable agricultural land, the Clareadon
Plains represent the major agricultural region in the country; currently
40,000 acres of land are under irrigated sugarcane which is supplied to the
Monymusk (project-assisted) and the New Yarmouth (private) factories.
Irrigation water resources are derived from a complex system of rivers and
springs plus groundwater abstraction; its main components are the following:
(a) the Rio Minho River: despite the considerable flow of the river
during the wet season, discharge during the dry mounthe is very
small; only the Monymusk estate is recovering some water
downstream (4,000 cubic yds/hr, or 0.80 cubic m/-ec). Without the
construction of a major storage dam in the upper mountainous
reaches of the river basin (Pindars dam), most Rio Minbo water
will continue being lost into the sea;
(b) the Milk River: this river is presently dry inost of the year, but
since it constitutes the head of the Mid-Clarendon Irrigation canal
system, its intermittent flow can be diverted into the main canal
to recharge the aquifer or to supplement abstraction from the deep
wells;
(c)   the Cockpit Springs (about 11,000 cubic yds/hr or 2.2 cubic mlsec):
the discharge of a series of springs into a coastal swamp has been
channelled through a canal and subsequently lifted by a pumping



- 36 -
ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 7
station to feed the main irrigation system of the Monymusk Estate;
because of the intrusion of sea water into the swamp and the
seepage through the low banks of the canal, water quality from the
Cockpit Springs is poor. In addition, almost half of the above
flow is lost through gaps in the canal embankment; and
(d) the aquifer: a series of 167 deep wells (boreholes), with a total
capacity of 40,000 cubic yds/hr (8.0 cubic m/sec), supplies the
major part of irrigation water to the estates (Monymusk, New
Yarmouth) and to the farms in the Clarendon Plains. The aquifer is
locally overdeveloped with consequent intrusion of saline water and
overall reduction in the quality of the groundwater.
7.        The rehabilitation of the existing irrigation infrastructure in the
Clarendon Plains would require the following:
(a) the upgrading of the canal system of the Mid-Clarendon Irrigation
Authority, i.e., by raising the banks and lining some sections of
the canals;
(b) the repair of the embankment of the Cockpit Springs canal, the
regular maintenance of the low Cockpit canal by weedeutting and
dredging, the overhaul of the antiquated pumps and the repair of
the upper lined canal; and
(c) the redesign of the well fields by replacing those wells producing
highly saline water with new wells to be installed in less depleted
sections of the aquifer; the drilling of new wells to replace
those with deteriorated casing and high levels of sand pumping.
Total costs for these works are detailed in the attached table.
8.        Rehabilitating the existing irrigation infrastructure in the
Clarendon Plains would restore the available resources to a level consistent
with irrigated crops requirements (mostly sugarcane). However, increased
salinization of the water resources and the excessive cost of electrical
pumping (because of high electricity tariffs) are serious constraints which
will have to be addressed. In order to ease these constraints, the
Government should develop additional water resources and utilize the less
costly surface irrigation water.
Irrigation Resources in the St. Dorothy Plains
9.        The St. Dorothy Irrigation System covers an area of 5,000 acres out
of a total area of 14,000 acres situated between the St. Catherine and the
Clarendon Plains. Since only 2,000 acres are in cane, the area contributes
marginally to the cane supply of the Monymusk factory. No permanent river

Page 5 of 7
flows through the area; pumping from the aquifer (about 3,000 cubic yds/hr.)
delivers water to a network of lined canals and pipelines. The aquifer Is
currently totally developed, and water quality is poor. Total costs for the
improvement of the system are detailed in the attached table.

Aasuoptions for JSN Fftnwuial Prolectiona
Roundings
1.          Discrepancies in calculations are due to roundings.
Transfer of Operations
2.          NSC owns 100% of the outstanding shares of the West Indies Sugar
Company Limited (Frome) and the Clarendon Sugar Company (Monymusk).  These
shares will be transferred to Jamaica Sugar Holdings Limited (JSH). JSH took
over the operations of Frome and Monymusk on or about October 1, 1985, free
of ali debts, except as noted herein. Historically, the fiscal accounting
period for the sugar industry la Jamaica begins on October 1, 1985, but the
crop season may generally start about December 1.
Assets and Liabilities Taken 0xe
3.          At the end of September 30, 1984, and based on the exchange rate
then in effect, the net book value of Frome and Monymusk fixed assets were
US$5,755 million and US$4,178 million, respectively. These assets (in the
form of the shares in the two operating subsidiaries mentioned in para. 2)
will be contributed to JSH as part of Government equity, and are incladed
under "grose fixed assets' in JSH's projected balance sheets.
4.          All statutory debts of NSC, Frome and Monymusk have been waived
by the Government, and all other debt obligations to other parties, including
commercial banks, incurred prior to the transfer of shares to JSH on or about
October 1, 1985 will be assumed by the Government. It is expected that all
statutory or other debt obligations have been waived or transferred to the
Ministry of Finance.

Project Costs and Contingencies
6.        Project costs for Frome and Monymusk's rehabilitation were
estimated in 1984 US dollars and carried up to the end of JSH's
rehabilitatien period, September 30, 1991, by adding the following annual
conting2ncic s (calculated cumulatively):
1984/85   1985/86   1986/87   1987/88   1988/89   1989/90
Foreign         5%       7.5%       3.0%      1.0%       1.0%     3.5%
Local         20%        7.5%      7.0%       6.0%       6.0%     5.0%
7.        Since management fees are fixed throughout the contract period, no
price contingencies have been added. Reimbursable costs under the management
agreement are subject to yearly adjustment based on inflation.  Costs were
calculated in 1985 US dollars and carried up to the end of the JSH
rehabilitation period, September 30, 1991, by adding the contingencies
indicated above, starting with the 1986/87 fiscal year.
8.        Phvsical contingency factor is 8%.  Price contingencies are
calculated on baseline costs plus physical contingency. The price
contingency factor for the 5th through the 20th year is held constant at the
same cumulative rate obtained at the end of the 4th year-namely, 10% for
foreign costs and 23Z for local costs.
Operating Costs and Contingencies
9.        A physical contingency factor of 5% has been added to all operating
costs. All costs have been estimated in constant dollars at September 1984
prices and carried up to September 1986 with the following adjustments:
a. labor increase of 25% for the 1984/85 crop; and
b. local inflation from September 1984 to December 1985
estimated at 15%.

ANNEX 12
Page 3 of 5
10.        The following labor increases went into effect:  20% in January
1985, 17.5Z in January 1986, and 15% in January 1987. Since labor costs
constitute the bulk of operating costs, no provision has been made for local
inflation from January 1985 to September 1987 on non-labor costs.
Sugar Price
11.       The sugar price to be remitted to the sugar factories and farmers
is calculated by taking the average weighted export price, ex-factory, less
fixed expenses for the operation of the industry's marketing entity
and other miscellane~ous costs (research, pension fund, etc.) (Annex 8).
12.       Sales by the sugar factories to the local market, both browu and
refined, have been set at a level not less than the average weighted export
price, plus costs for bagging, handling, storage and other miscellaneous
expenses.
Import Duties
13.       Import duties generally vary from 5 to 15% except for vehicles
assessed at a 45% rate. Most agricultural equipment is fully exempt.
Additionally, there is a stamp duty, presently 30Z of the CIF duty-paid cost,
on capital goods. The financial projections assume that only 50% of the
value of all foreign expenditures will be dutiable at a rate of 15% of the
CIF value, and no stamp duties will be imposed.
Corporate Income Tax
14.         Agricultural production activities are exempt from corporate
income tax. For factory operations, the maximum tax would be 33.3%. Since
JSH may be able to utilize carry-forward losses from the Frome and Monymusk
operations, no provision has been made for corporate tax in the financial
projections.
Water Charges
15.         Water charges in the Monymusk and Innswood estates resulting from
the project are:

US$243,000   267,000    328,000    328,000    328,000   328,000
The charges have been included in Monymusk agricultural costs.
Management Contract
16.       The base and incentive fees are US$5.3 million, and reimbursable
costs are estimated at US$3.8 million equivalent over a four-year period
(Annex 4).
Depreciation
17.       Project fixed assets have been depreciated on a straight line over
the estimated useful life of each category of equipment. Existing assets
have been depreciated on straight line over a ten-year period.
Sugar Price Split
18.       It is assumed that the net average return to the factories (and
estates) will be split approximately 62% for farmers and 38% for the
factory. This ratio equates approximately to the split in effect for the
1985/86 and 1986/87 seasons.
Suppliers' Credit
19.       The following assumptions have been made with respect to Suppliers'
Credit: 15% down payment with each order; semi-annual loan repayments after
a six-mnth grace period, payable over five years; interest at 10% per annum
(plus 1Z Government on-lending charge), paid semi-annually.
Working Capital Equity
20.         The Government's cash equity of US$3.0 million plus some limited
SIA's overdraft facilities for working capital were expected to cover working
capital needs from August 1, 1985 until the proceeds of sugar sales begin to
be received. In fact, the Gov,ernment and SIA have extended to JSH additional
resources, to be ultimately transformed into equity, to (a) cover the losses;
(b) finance a share .of the management contract during this period; and (c)
finance extensive cane replanting operations. Although the Government and
SIA were initially committed to contribute only US$6.0 million to JSH's
equity and working capital, because of the delays in loan processing, they
would have contributed to about US$9.6 million by the start of Year 1.

World Bank Loan
21.         The following assumptions have been made with respect to
World Bank loan: 17 years, including four years grace on repayment of
principal; interest at 7.9% per annum, paid semi-annually; commitment fee 0.75%. The
Government's on-lending charge to JSH is 1%.
