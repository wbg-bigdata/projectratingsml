1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01       Zaire is a vast country (2.4 million km2), the third largest in
Africa.   It lies astride the Equator in the heart of the continent.   The
geography includes the dry savannah region in the southeast, dense rain
forest in the central and northern regions and mountains in the east.
Nearly the entire country lies within the watershed of the Zaire River.
The main economic activities, mining and agriculture, are situated in the
peripheral areas of the country sometimes as much as 2,000 km from the
capital or the nearest seaport. These conditions contribute to making in-
ternal surface transport difficult and expensive except for the areas ser-
ved by navigable rivers.
1.02        The population, about 28 million, is growing at 2.7% annually.
The urban population, however, is growing at about 7%  due to rural migra-
tion to the cities. As a result, about a third of the population now lives
in cities.  The population density, about 12 inhabitants per square kilo-
meter, is very unevenly distributed.
1.03        Zaire possesses large mineral resources and great agricultural
potential, yet it is one of the poorest countries in Africa; the GNP per
capita was only US$260 in 1980.  Agriculture normally accounts for 25% of
the GDP and supports three-quarters of the population.   The principal food
crops are manioc and maize; the most important cash crops are coffee and
palm oil followed by cotton.   Despite its potential for food production,
Zaire is no longer able to feed itself and must import food.
1.04       The mining industry is the mainstay of the economy.  Mining and
metal processing normally account for about 24% of GDP and provide about
70% of Zaire's export earnings. Zaire is the world's largest producer of
cobalt and industrial diamonds and the seventh largest producer of copper.
But the economy of Zaire has suffered over the past several years from its
overdependence on minerals.   During the early 1970s mineral prices were
high and the Zairan economy grew at about 7% p.a. until 1974. Based on the
growing revenues from mineral extraction, the Government borrowed heavily
abroad at strictly commercial terms and for projects with long gestation
periods or uncertain economic benefits.   During this time investments in
agriculture were neglected and ill-prepared economic measures were tamn.
With the fall of the price of copper, Zaire was left with a burdensome ex-
ternal debt and a weakened agricultural sector. Between 1975 and 1979 GDP
contracted by 3.5% p.a.; inflation, fueled by deficit financing, ran high,
and areas on repayment of external debt mounted. As foreign exchange be-
came scarcer, imports had to be curtailed resulting in acute shortages of
materials and spare parts.   This in turn has led to deterioration of min-
ing, manufacturing and transport facilities and to their underutilization.



- 2 -
Moreover, as the Government's revenues shrank, its ability to fund recur-
rent operations and investments also diminished. This unfavorable economic
environment has severely hampered the transport sector.
1.05      Since 1979 Zaire has been taking measures to halt the contraction
of its economy and to bring it backc on the path of recovery.   These mea-
sures include a stabilization program (with the support of a standby
arrangement with the IMF), external assistance from several donors, resche-
duling of debt, devaluation of the currency, increasing fiscal revenues
while curtailing expenditures, strengthening key government institutions
and agencies (the central bank, Ministry of Finance, and customs), increas-
ing producer prices and improving the allocation of foreign exchange. Des-
pite some improvements in the past two years, the economy remains in a pre-
carious state. Among the Government's immediate goals are the strengthen-
ing of the economy by rehliabilitating and renewing the infrastructure and
productive capacity and by encouraging the recovery of the agricultural
sector.
B. The Transport System
1.06       Zaire's transport system is an interconnected network of rivers,
railways and roads linked at strategic points. The dominant element in the
system is the Zaire River and its tributaries which provide some 15,000 km
of navigable waterways for relatively cheap water transport over a large
area.  This network of rivers has been complemented by railways to make a
rail/river system for interregional and external transport.   Most of the
145,000 km of roads were constructed to provide local access and as feeders
to the river/rail arteries.   Matadi, the only seaport,  is in the Zaire
estuary, about 150 km from the ocean; it is open to ships with a maximum
draft of 9 m. Owing to Zaire's size, air transport plays an important role
in long-distance movement of passengers and high-value freight. There are
about 150 airfields and airstrips in Zaire of which 30 are served by the
national airline.   An international airport is located at Kinshasa;  the
airports of Kisangani and Lubumbashi can also handle wide-bodied aircraft.
Two pipelines, one four-inch and the other six-inch diameter, transport re-
fined petroleum products between Matadi and Kinshasa. While for all modes,
the basic infrastructure to meet current transport demand is available,
prolonged insufficient maintenance and modernization have resulted in old
and unreliable equipment and facilities thereby reducing the quality of
services and increasing transport costs. The Government's investment stra-
tegy as stated in the Public Investment Plan rightly assigns priority to
the rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing facilities and equip-
ment.
Major Traffic Patterns
1.07      The main traffic corridor in Zaire is the Voie Nationale (VN), a
multimodal chain of transport comprised of the railway line from the Shaba
mining area to Ilebo port on the Kasai River, barge transport from Ilebo to
Kinshasa on the Zaire River, rail transport from Kinshasa to Matadi, and
maritime transport from Matadi port through the Zaire estuary to the sea.
One of the main items of traffic on the VN is copper which moves from the
Shaba region to Matadi; it amounted to 200,000 tons in 1980.   The second
transport artery is on the Zaire River from Kinshasa to the northeast



- 3 -
region.   Important down-river traffic includes palm oil and kernels; logs
and lumber; and manioc, rice, rubber and coffee.  Up-river traffic on both
corridors is composed of mostly imported goods.   Imports and, to a lesser
extent, exports are increasingly containerized necessitating investments in
handling equipment and storage facilities at transshipment points.
1.08       While Zaire uses the VN for about 50% of its mining-related ex-
ternal transport, it has been using two other routes via foreign countries
for the remainder: the Zambia/Zimbabwe railway to Indian Ocean ports and
the Kalemi-Kigoma route to Dar-es-Salaam.   Until its closure in 1975 the
Benguela railway through Angola to the Port of Lobito was the main foreign
route used by Zaire.  Because of the uncertainty on these routes Zaire is
committed to preserving the capacity and operational efficiency of the VN.
1.09           Road transport in general is complementary to rail and river
transport but it is assuming an increasingly important role in supplying
the urban centers with food from their agricultural hinterland. Details of
the road network and road transport are presented in Chapter II.
C. Organization of the Transport Sector
1.10      The transport sector is dominated by three large parastatal agen-
cies: (i) the Office des Routes (OR), the national agency under the Minis-
try of Public Works (MPW), responsible for road construction and mainte-
nance; (ii) the Office National des Transports (ONATRA), operating river
aad rail transport; and (iii) the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Zairois (SNCZ) the national railway company.   In addition five transport
agencies or public companies all under the general control of Ministry of
Transport and Communicatons (MTC) have the following functions: (i) Regie
es Voie Fluviales (RVF) charged with maintaining navigational channels and
controlling services on navigable inland waterways except the Zaire
estuary; (ii) Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM) responsible for maintaining
the Zaire estuary navigational channels and providing pilot services bet-
ween Matadi and the sea; (iii) Regie des Voies Aeriennes which builds,
maintains and operates airports; (iv) Air Zaire, the state-owned airline
with scheduled domestic and international services using a fleet of two DC
10s, three DC8s, three Boeings 737s and five F27s; and (v) Compagnie Mari-
time Zairoise (CMZ), the national shipping company which operates five
general cargo ships.
1.11      OR is discussed in detail in Chapter II.
1.12      ONATRA, an autonomous Government agency, provides transport ser-
vices on the Zaire river and its tributaries,  railway services between
Matadi and Kinshasa and operates the ports in the Zaire river estuary and
most of the river ports in the interior.   It has a staff of about 20,000
and has four operating divisions,  Ports,  Railways,  River  Transport  and
Shipyards. ONATRA's performance has been adversely affected by the deter-
ioration of its facilities, weaknesses in management and operations, and
declining  transport  demand.    However,  since  the appointment  of  a new



-4-
General Manager in 1977 and additional technical assistance, its operations
and finances have significantly improved.   The decline in overall traffic
which occurred after 1974 ceased in 1980 and ONATRA's financial situation
has become healthier. IDA has contributed to these improvements by financ-
ing technical assistance and equipment.   The performance of RVM and espe-
cially RVF, which are support agencies for sea and river transport and
therefore essential for ONATRA's operations, has been unsatisfactory.
1.13        SNCZ was formed in 1974 by merging the five railway companies
then existing.  Two of the lines in the west, the Kinshasa-Matadi line and
the Boina-Tshela line, however, continue to be administered by ONATRA. The
remaining three lines, some 4,627 km of track, are located in the interior
of the country and 1,021 km of line in the northeast are not connected with
the rest.   The most important line, which carries heavy mineral traffic,
extends from Ilebo to Lubumbashi and Sakania at the border with Zambia.
Much of the track on this line has deteriorated, substantially reducing
line capacity. Ilebo port, the important transshipment point which is the
responsibility of SNCZ, needs new facilities and cargo-handling equipment.
In addition to these physical constraints, SNCZ's operations have been ham-
pered by deficiencies in management and operations and shortages of spare
parts and materials. Again after a steady decline in traffic after 1974, a
small recovery has taken place since 1980.
1.14      In spite of the predominance of the above agencies, the number of
private operators in the transport sector is increasing.   Road transport
has traditionally been handled by the private sector with some degree of
competition between professional truckers on the one hand and traders and
large companies transporting on their own account on the other.                In
recent years, however, truckers have also begun competing more actively
with rail and river transport on some selected routes. Moreover, although
private river and air carriers have existed for many years and ONATRA and
Air Zaire never had an actual monopoly, they lost their de jure monopoly in
1978. On the river system, private river carriers have eroded ONATRA's po-
sition in the transport of high-value freight; ONATRA's share has declined
to some 75% but appears to have stabilized at this level.   In air trans-
port, about one third of total air cargo is handled by private air
carriers.  The competition from private carriers has provided a useful sti-
mulus to the agencies to improve their services and should not be hampered
by regulations. At the same time, the agencies should be given more flexi-
bility in their operations and policies to be able to compete more effect-
ively.
1.15      The organizational structure in the transport sector is basically
sound and the size of its infrastructure generally adequate. However, the
effectiveness of the transport agencies in meeting transport demand remains
unsatisfactory.  Even though weak management contributes to this situation
the difficult economic environment plays a significant role. Overall, ser-
vices have improved in recent years but need further improvement if trans-
port is to support the country's economic recovery.



D. Transport Policy, Needs, Planning and Coordination
1.16      Transport has been assigned a key role in the recovery of Zaire's
agriculture and mining sectors.   For agricultural development the Govern-
aent attaches great importance to road upgrading and to the proper mainte-
nance of not only the 40,900 km already under OR but also of a rapidly
growing proportion of the secondary and feeder road network.  The objective
of extending OR's responsibilities, however, is unrealistic (para. 1.21).
Likewise the Government considers improvement of the efficiency and effec-
tive capacity of the rail/river system a prerequisite for a viable mining
sector.   In view of the constrairts affecting the transport agencies, an
effective strategy to improve the performance of the transport sector
should comprise three essential elements: (i) investments which focus on
the rehabilitation and replacement needs of the infrastructure; (ii) con-
tinued strengthening of management, operations and training activities ind
(iii) concrete measures to alleviate the shortages of foreign and I -al
funds available to the sector.   The Government in principle agrees  ith
this strategy which constituted the thrust of the transport sector disis-
sions at the June 1981 Consultative Group Meeting in Paris.   Short- and
medium-term Bank Group assistance to the sector is being fashioned along
the above lines.
1.17         Responsibilities  for policy formulation and planning in the
transport sector are divided among three ministries: the Ministry of Public
Works (MPW), which is responsible for the roads infrastructure; the Minis-
try of Transport and Communications (MTC), which is responsible for the in-
frastructure of the other subsectors and for transport operations; the
Ministry of Planning (MP) which coordinates transport investments with the
needs in other sectors and draws up the overall transport plan.   The two
technical ministries have had a planning capability for over five years --
the Groupe d'Etudes, Economie et Planification (GEEP) at the MTC and the
Economic Unit at OR under MPW.   Both units were set up with the aid of
technical assistance provided by France (for GEEP) and by IDA under succes-
sive Highway Credits (for OR).   GEEP recently increased its staff to 20
professionals including four expatriates while the Economic Unit at OR has
four economists including one expatriate. These planning groups have built
up a valuable body of data and knowledge on the transport sector. They are
increasingly in a position to provide the essential inputs and the anlyses
for the formulation of policies and investment plans for their respective
subsectors.
1.18      Systematic national planning started in 1977 when the Mobutu Plan
covering the period 1979-81 was prepared.   For the roads subsector, the
preparatory work for the national plan is carried out by OR; MP becomes in-
volved during the final stages. For the other modes the transport agencies
prepare the basic inputs while GEEP provides guidance and coordination.
While this general procedure is adequate, the depth of analysis and quality
of the agencies' inputs are uneven.   The strenghtening of the agencies'
project preparation and planning capabilities is, therefore, of high prior-
ity. A first step in this direction would be the adoption of uniform pro-



- 6 -
ject preparation methods and formats across  the whole sector.   For the
agencies under MTC, GEEP, with its in-depth subsector knowledge, should
play a leading role in this regard.   In addition, since in recent years
operations of most transport agencies have more often been hampered by lack
of foreign exchange for spare parts and supplies than by lack of nominal
capacity, improvement of the agencies' planning function should include
more careful budgeting of foreign exchange requirements for current opera-
tions.
1.19      The current plan (1981-83), which provided the basis for the June
1981 Consultative Group Meeting discussions in Paris, allocates 27% of to-
tal investments to transport, making it second in importance after mining
(31%). Rehabilitation investments to increase the efficiency and effective
capacity of existing facilities constitute the bulk of the plan.  Replace-
ment and modernization are only included when, as in the case of container
traffic, existing facilities have become totally inadequate.   These ele-
ments of the plan are justified and are supported by current IDA projects
in the highways, railways and river transport subsectors.   The plan also
includes a number of transport projects based on preliminary data and ana-
lyses for which more in-depth evaluation needs to be undertaken, e.g. the
electrification of the Kinshasa-Mlatadi rail line. Moreover, even if finan-
cing were available for the entire plan, its physical implementation sche-
dule is too optimistic.   Despite these weaknesses, the plan has already
provided a useful basis for improving the preparation and the monitoring of
investments.   For the highway subsector, OR has reviewed and revised the
investment plan taking into account resources likely to be available.
Moreover, OR will annually review its highway sector plan for the following
five years and will submit any revisions to the Association for its com-
ments by October 1.  Taking into account the Association's comments, the
Government will adjust its Public Investment Program accordingly.
1.20      While in the short- and medium-term emphasis should remain on re-
habilitation and maintenance, sight should not be lost of the longer-term
development options of the sector.   Three areas deserve particular atten-
tion and the expertise presently available is sufficiently varied that lit-
tle additional manpower would be required to carry out the necessary ana-
lyses.   A first area concerns the Voie Nationale.   The modernization and
development needs of the links in this chain will require substantial in-
vestments over the next decade to enable it to transport its proper share
of the mining traffic. This calls for an overall investment approach which
focusses on avoiding costly imbalances in the capacity of any one link and
eliminating existing or potential bottlenecks. This approach, successfully
used in 1978 by the Working Group for the Voie Nationale under the aegis of
GEEP, should be repeated.   This kind of pragmatic planning would guard
against premature investments which fail to increase the overall capacity
of the Voie Nationale.



- 7 -
1.21       The second area concerns the medium- to long-term priorities in
the roads subsector namely the allocatio-.i of resources among the three
major activities: paving, upgrading of earth roads, and extension of regu-
lar maintenance to secondary and local roads.   Notswithstanding its man-
power and financial constraints, there are strong demands on OR to rapidly
expand its activities beyond the 40,900 km currently under its responsibi-
lity and to embark on large road paving and upgrading programs.   Even
though the needs in all three areas are vast, in view of the economic and
financial condition of Zaire, in the foreseeable future most of the avail-
able resources will be needed for the continuation of the ongoing programs
of maintenance and rehabilitation of the basic network of 40,900 km.  The
resources in excess of those needed for these programs are expected to be
small and to grow slowly. Road development planning should therefore focus
on the relative merits of the allocation of these discretionary resources
to each of the three possible areas of expansion.   However, even if all
additional resources becoming available were allocated to the extension of
the network under maintenance, the scope for rapid progress in this one
area would still be limited.
1.22       A third analysis should be on the potential role for air trans-
port.   Zaire's  surface  transport  modes are basically complementary and
there is little scope for intermodal competition.  However, in view of the
large distances between centers of activity, air transport may have great
potential as an alternative to all three surface nodes for high-value com-
modities.  Zaire has made and continues to make substantial investments in
air transport infrastructure and aircraft but lacks an overall view of the
potential  role of air  tranport.   The clarification  of  the  comparative
advantage of air transport, therefore, deserves more attention. This is
particularly relevant since the improvement of the road network to permit
efficient interregional transport will take many years.   Such an analysis
would have to focus on the type of aircraft and airfields appropriate to
Zaire's needs, taking into consideration the nature and localization of
potential transport demand, and comparative infrastructure and operating
costs of the various modes.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Road Network
2.01       Zaire's road network comprises about 145,500 km of roads of which
2,360 km are paved,  2,800 km are gravel,  and the rest earth roads.   Road
density is low at 6Gm/lk2 but in terms of kilometres per 1,000 inhabitants
Zaire's network is above the average for the East African countries (5.4 km
per 1,000 inhabitants). Table 2.1 shows the total lengths of the national
and regional roads and their distribution in each of Zaire's eight regions
and the district of Kinshasa.

2.02         The network is adequate in length for current needs but  is in
poor conditioa.   It consists  mainly  of narrow,  unengineered  earth  roads
with pavement widths ranging from 4 to 6 meters, bad drainage and deterior-
ated surface  courses.   Better engineered  roads  and the repaving of many
worn-out asphaltic pavements will be required in the future to reduce vehi-
cle operating costs and to prevent excessive maintenance.   However, given
the shortage of funds, emphasis in the short-term will be given to improv-
ing the maintenance of the existing network.

2.03       Owing to the large number of rivers, ferries are needed to keep
road connections open when bridges have not or cannot be built for economic
reasons.   There are somae 250 ferries at 224 established river crossings.
About 100 of these crossings have motor ferries; the remainder are operated
by cable.  Many of the ferries and bridges are old and require heavy main-
tenance; many are beyond their service life and must be replaced.
B. Road Use
Vehicle Fleet
2.04       Vehicle fleet statistics have not been published since 1976 and
accurate data on the size of the fleet and its composition are not avail-
able.    The  most  recent  and  reliable  estimate  by  GEEP  in  1978  was
110,0001/. Registration is concentrated in the important centers of acti-
vity; Kinshasa and Shaba regions probably account for 58% and 20% of the
total, respectively, followed by Kivu Region with 7%. Table 2.2 shows the
estimated breakdown between categories of vehicles.

Import statistics and estimated annual removals from service indicate that
the fleet has probably not increased much since 19782!.   This is to be ex-
pected considering the depressed state of the economy and the scarcity of
foreign exchange which has kept imports of both vehicles and spare parts
low. This scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to an excessive diver-
sity in the composition of the fleet as most imports are tied to supplier
countries through aid programs or supplier credits with little regard to
standardization.
Fuel Consumption
2.05      Fuel supplies in recent times have been insufficient to neet de-
mand because the national bank has allocated too little foreign exchange
for this purpose. Fuel consumption by the road transport sector increased
steadily until 1975, but has remained stationary since, except in 1979 when
there was a somewhat sharp decline due to acute shortages.   Gasoline con-
sumption by road transport has declined consistently whereas diesel fuel
consumption has been erratic.

2/  At the end of 1980 the total number of vehicles insured with the
National Insurance Company was some 20% higher than at the end of
1977. It is not clear however to what extent this was due to a rise in
the fleet and/or a higher rate of compliance with the obligation to
insure.

2.06        Overall, the Government is not subsidizing fuel products but it
has followed a policy of cross-subsidization of diesel fuel by gasoline.
Even though the extent of cross-subsidization has been reduced significant-
ly in recent years, the price of diesel fuel (Z 2.80/litre) does not cover
its estimated resource costs (between Z 3.2 and Z 4/liter). Government is
now preparing new legislation to introduce higher fuel taxes which would
virtually bring the price of diesel fuel to :he level of its estimated re-
source cost. The introduction of the revised taxes on fuels is a condition
of effectiveness (para. 2.29). Even with the new prices considerable dif-
ferential will exist between gasoline and diesel fuel. Since the effect of
the lower diesel price on resource allocation in the economy, and in trans-
port in particular, has not been reviewed in detail, the Government will by
March 31, 1983 carry out a study to evaluate the resource cost of fuel pro-
ducts and the effect on the economy of alternative pricing policies.   The
Government will adjust fuel prices in the light of the findings of the
study and ensure that prices for all types of fuel products cover at least
the resource costs.
Traffic
2.07       Statistics on traffic volumes c-nd growth are scanty.  OR is re-
sponsible for making traffic counts but has not yet introduced a country-
wide system for doing so.  Under the general guidance of its Economic Unit,
OR intends to introduce systematic traffic counts, initially on a small
scale, but gradually to expand the coverage. The Government will submit to
the Association by October 1, 1982 the scope and organizational set-up for
a system of traffic counts, including a schedule for its implementation.
Upon receipt of the Association's comments, the Government shall promptly
take appropriate steps to put the system into effect.
2.08       Selective traffic counts have been carried out by consultants or
by OR as part of feasibility studies. Traffic data are also available from
the Bas Zaire and Bandundu regions where counts have been conducted as part
of the pilot maintenance and rehabilitation programs and from the records
of ferries at river crossings. OR's estimates of cumulative total traffic
by road category (Table 2.4) indicate that the national and priority re-
gional roads under OR's responsibility carry 96% of the country's traffic.
The greatest impact of OR's limited resources can therefore be obtained by
deploying them on these roads.

2.09      Traffic volumes on the heavily trafficked sections of the network
such as the Kinshasa-Matadi and the Kinshasa-Kikwit roads range up to 1,000
vpd.  Most of the network, however, carries between 10 and 50 vpd.   Truck
traffic predominates with between 60% and 90% of total traffic.  Overall,
traffic has not grown in recent years except where roads have been improved
or reopened, in which case it has increased substantially.
Road Transport Industry
2.10         The roaco cransport industry is composed of a large number of
traders/truckers and three private regional transport companies3/, each
with more than 40 trucks.   The former usually do not own more than three
vehicles and are engaged principally in trading with trucking as a second-
ary activity. Transport for own account is widely used by the large plan-
tation companies and the agro-industries.
2.11      There are no restrictive Government regulations limiting competi-
tion in the road transport industry. Entry into the industry requires only
registration in the trade register and a permit issued by the Ministry of
Transport after payment of an annual fee of Z 600 per vehicle. Indications
are that only a few truckers beside the larger transport companies comply
3/ The three companies operating a fleet of more than 40 vehicles are:
TRANSMAC in Bas Zaire, TMK in Kivu, and MAS in the Kasai.



- 13 -
with this requirement.  Tariffs are subject to Government approval, though
they are not enforced in the case of the small traders/truckers. Transport
routes are not regulated.
2.12       The trucking industry, particularly in the interior, is severely
hampered by shortages of vehicles, spare parts4/ and fuel resulting from
the scarcity of foreign exchange.    There is also a lack of ancillary ser-
vices, and truckers are forced to be highly self-sufficient in mechanical
back-up and parts supplies. Transport costs and transport rates are there-
fore very high, due not only to road conditions but also to the difficult
economic environiaent in which truckers operate. The situation is unlikely
to change without an overall improvement of the country's foreign exchange
difficulties.
2.13       Passenger transport in the interior is almost exclusively in the
form of mixed transport of goods and passengers by the traders/truckers.
In the large cities passenger transport is provided by private and publicly
owned transport companies whose tariffs and routes are regulated by the
city administrations.
Road User Revenues
2.14          Road-users  contribute to Government  revenues  through import
duties and taxes on vehicles, spare parts, fuel and lubricants and through
vehicle registration and licensing fees. Import duties on vehicles, which
range from 75% of the CIF value for trucks to 120% for luxury cars, are
aimed at import restriction as well as a means for raising revenue. Road-
user revenue and its sources are shown in Table 2.5.
4/ This leads to artificially high prices for spare parts which can be as
high as six times a typical price paid in Europe.

7/7 Estimate.
Introduced in 1979.
Source: OR, March 1982.
2.15      In 1979 there was a marked increase in revenues following the in-
troduction of special fuel taxes in addition to the then-existing road fund
tax. The increase in 1981 was mostly due to the establishment of an auto-
nomous customs administration in 1980 which greatly reduced the extent of
undercollection but also to an exchange rate adjustment in mid-1981.   At
about Z 314 million in 1981, the revenues raised from road users more than
covered the allocations to OR under its recurrent budget and road fund
(Z 178.4 million). The Government will prepare by December 31, 1983 a re-
view of the level and structure of its road user duties and taxes (with
particular attention to the duties and taxes levied on fuel) in the light
of such considerations as energy conservation, recovery of road user costs
and resource mobilization and will take such measures as may be appropriate
following this review.

C. Administration
2.16       The Office des Routes (OR), an operationally and financially au-
tonomous agency under MPW, is responsible for the administration of the
main road network (40,900 km).  Local authorities and various road-users
are responsible in principle for the rest.  OR's management structure com-
prises a Board of Directors which decides on policy and a Managing Commit-
tee which is in charge of day-to-day management.   OR is subdivided into
four administrative and five technical departments (Chart 1).
2.17        After successful pilot programs in two regions, Bas Zaire and
Bandundu, OR decentralized its services to the country's eight regions.
Each region now operates as a miniature OR headed by a Zairan director
assisted by technical and administrative staff.  The regional offices are
resposible for initiating road programs and budgets which are consolidated
into OR's overall program, submitted to OR's Board of Directors and the
Ministry of Planning for approval, and then sent back to the regions for
execution.   This organizational set-up is justified given the country's
size and diversity. OR, however, is under heavy pressure to expand its ac-
tivities both in terms of the size of the network it should maintain and
the amount of work it should carry out with its own forces.  In order to
help clarify this issue of OR's role, the project includes a study on the
administration of Zaire's highway sector focussing on the scope of the re-
sponsibilities to be assigned to OR and the appropriate organizational and
management structure.
2.18      Equipment management is the responsibility of the Service de Ges-
tion du Materiel des Travaux Publics (SGMTP), a functionally and financial-
ly independent agency within OR.   SGMTP works  through SGMTP/Roads and
SGMTP/Ferries and operates nine workshops for road maintenance equipment,
eleven ferry maintenance units and three shipyards. SGMTP headquarters at
Kinshasa monitors regional operations through inspection missions and cen-
tralized auditing.
2.19       OR's operational autonomy was affected by a law of February 25,
1982 on decentralization of the Government administration which gives the
regional authorities the power to requisition OR's maintenance brigades.
Without proper control this would imply a serious loss of autonomy for OR.
A similar threat was posed during appraisal of the Fourth Highway Project
and was resolved satisfactorily by amending legislation and an arrangement
under which OR consults with these authorities in preparing its program but
retains full control over its execution.   Additional legislation satis-
factory to the Association (decret portant mesures d'application) has been
enacted which clearly defines the conditions under which the regional
authorities can call upon the services of OR and specifying that the imple-
mentation of OR's work program should not be prejudiced and that the ser-
vices of OR can only be requested for road works against payment by the re-
gional authorities.



- 16 -
D. Personnel, Technical Assistance and Training
2.20       OR has 8,650 employees, of whom 4,750 are permanent and the re-
mainder are contract laborers working for OR or the local authorities under
agreements with OR. Of these, some 250 are engineers and 40 are high level
technicians.  OR, faced with the problem of attracting and retaining good
local staff because of low salaries, has instituted a comprehensive compen-
sation package with such fringe benefits as transportation, medical and
dental assistance, a commisssary and schooling for dependents.
2.21         Sixty expatriate experts provide technical assistance to OR
(Annex 1, Table 1), a decline from 100 in 1974 as more qualified and ex-
perienced Zairan engineers have become available. The relatively small de-
crease in expatriate staff, notwithstanding a large increase in higher
level Zairan staff, is explained by the fact that OR's responsibilities
have also increased. Expatriate assistance will continue to be necessary
for several years until Zairan professionals, mostly recruited from the en-
gineering college, have gained sufficient experience.   Under the proposed
project, the number of expatriates will be reduced further to 54 experts.
Progress in recruiting and training professional staff has been encouraging
and it is expected that with the continuation of that effort, by the end of
the 1980's only a skeletal group of expatriates in the high level positions
and the mechanical field will be needed.
2.22      OR's training program has, since 1974, provided courses for about
1,000 employees in highway administration and engineering and on-the-job
training for drivers, equipment operators and mechanics. A mechanized road
maintenance training unit (brigade ecole) created in 1975 has been an
important element in OR training.  This unit, supervised by three foreign
experts and two local trainers, has provided on-the-job training for engi-
neers (three-month sessions), formal instruction and on-the-job training
for technical staff (nine-month sessions) and training courses for drivers,
equipment operators and mechanics (12 to 18-week sessions). Although the
program has been quite successful, the numbers which have been trained are
still inadequate for OR's needs.   Additional staff need to be trained to
man the new equipment as well as old equipment being repaired under the
ongoing Fourth Highway Project. With the assistance of the nine expatriate
training experts, about 2,000 road employees, 260 ferry employees and 50
Zairan instructors will be trained under the proposed project.
2.23       The Training Department is concentrating its activities in three
road maintenance training centers at Kasangulu, Bukavu and Lubumbashi.
There are also three training units located at Bandundu, Mbandaka and
Kisangani for ferry personnel.   The proposed  project  provides  training
equipment for the Lubumbashi center and for the three training units for
ferry personnel which are already partially operational.
2.24      OR's training efforts have faced two major problems.  First, the
educational level of the trainees sent to the centers is frequently too low
and they are unable to achieve the required levels of competence; second,



- 17 -
OR's overall shortage of equipment and tools leaves little for the trairLig
centers.   The first problem is being solved through better screening of
future trainees, with particular attention to their background, education
and age; the second will be reduced with the equipment, tools and spares
received under the ongoing and proposed projects.
E. Planning
2.25         Highway planning is the responsibility of the Economic Unit
(Cellule economique) in OR's New Construction Department.   The unit is
staffed by four economists including an expatriate financed under the on-
going Fourth Highway Project. Since its creation with assistance provided
under IDA's Third Highway Project, the unit has carried out a considerable
work program including planning road construction, maintenance and improve-
ment activities; elaborating road components for agricultural projects;
carrying out feasibility studies and selecting the priority network of
roads to be maintained by OR. The Economic Unit also played a leading role
in the preparation of the highway subsector plan as part of the 1979-81 and
1981-83 national plans.
2.'6       Planning of maintenance/rehabilitation for local roads is on an
ad hoc basis -- mostly carried out as part of agricultural projects --
since there is neither sufficient capacity nor funds to carry out extensive
programs.  OR, in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the
regional authorities, is studying possible institutional and funding ar-
rangements to meet the needs of local roads.   A decision on any long-term
arrangements, however, would have to await the results of Government's re-
view of its medium- to long-term road sector development options (paras.
1.21 and 1.22).   In the meantime, the pragmatic approach of limited and
selective assistance from OR to the regional authorities mainly for agri-
cultural roads is appropriate.
F. Financing
2.27      Road maintenance and rehabilitation are financed from the Govern-
ment's recurrent budget, a fuel tax-based Road Fund and by funds from ex-
ternal development agencies. Road construction is financed by the invest-
ment budget and by external development agencies; the latter have provided
the largest share in recent years. Zaire's fiscal year corresponds to the
calendar year. OR, in consultation with MP, prepares proposals for the re-
current and capital budgets during the third quarter. The budgets are dis-
cussed with the Ministry of Finance (MF) during the fourth quarter and,
following revision, are generally approved by the start of the fiscal
year. Funds under the recurrent budget are disbursed directly to OR by the
MF in 12 equal monthly tranches. The fuel tax is collected by the petro-
leum companies and paid directly to OR on a quarterly basis.   The invest-
ment budget on the other hand is disbursed by the MF to suppliers or con-
tractors on the basis of contractual payments approved and certified by

2.28       The amounts proposed by OR, those officially approved, and those
actually paid under OR's 1975-81 recurrent and investment budgets are shown
in Table 2.6. The years from 1976 through 1978 were particularly difficult
with regard to its recurrent budget.   Actual disbursements not only de-
clined dramatically in real terms but were also significantly below ap-
proved budgets. By 1981, the real value of OR's budget had recovered some-
what but was still below its level in 1975; over this period the reduction
in real wages of OR's personnel was substantial.  The erratic pattern of
payments has hurt OR's maintenance activities by necessitating frequent
changes in the work program and hindering work in progress.   The payment
record under the investment budget was even worse and has shown no improve-
ment; it has led to work stoppages on major construction contracts with
consequent cost escalation and litigation.

2.29        To avoid the problems of untimely allocation and insufficient
funds, OR proposed that the existing funding mechanism through the Road
Fund and based on the special fuel tax be revised and expanded so that it
would substantially cover OR's expenditures.   Considering the volume of
sales and the pump price of fuel in recent years, OR estimated that a fuel
tax equivalent to 20% of the pump price would meet all its budgetary re-
quirements. The Government has accordingly decided to revise the mechanism
of the Road Fund and to increase the fuel tax allocated to it for the pur-
poses  of  financing  OR's  programs.    Agreement  has  been  reached  that



- 19 -
(i) as a condition of effectiveness of the credit the increased tax and a
revised funding mechanism satisfactory to the Association shall have been
introduced and; (ii) the fuel tax will gradually be increased so that by
December 31, 1984 it reaches, together with other revenues of OR, a level
sufficient to finance OR's recurrent expenditures and a reasonable part of
its investment requirements.
2.30        Since its creation in 1971, OR has received a total of US$320
million (in current prices) of credits and grants from external sources
mostly FED, IDA, Federal Republic of Germany, Saudi Fund and CIDA.   About
US$200 million financed road construction, bridges, ferries and studies
while the remaining US$120 million supported road maintenance and rehabili-
tation activities by financing equipment, spare parts, fuel and technical
assistance.   External  financing of the foreign currency costs of spare
parts and fuel has been essential to OR's operations in recent years and
will have to continue in the near future.
G. Engineering
2.31      OR's New Construction Department is responsible for road design.
The department is headed by a Zairan engineer and employs 15 engineers,
technicians and surveyors out of a staff of 80, including one expatriate
engineer. Due to a shortage of skilled technicians the design and supervi-
sory capacity of the department is limited to small and medium-scale pro-
jects and expatriate consultants carry out the design studies for the few
major projects.
2.32       The National Public Works Laboratory (Laboratoire National des
Travaux Publics, LNTP) assists in materials and soils testing. An indepen-
dent department within OR, LNTP caters to all public and semi-public agen-
cies, mining and construction companies and consulting firms, even though
most of its present work (70%) is for OR.  The director is a Zairan aided
by an expatriate engineer financed by the Association under the Fourth
Highway Project. Both the Third and Fourth Highway Projects helped finance
needed equipment and technical assistance for LNTP.   The proposed project
will provide some additional equipment but will eliminate the post of expa-
triate technical advisor to the director. Within LNTP is the Road Research
Unit (Cellule des Recherches Routieres, CRR) which sets nationwide stan-
dards for the construction and maintenance of roads. Its staff consists of
three expatriates (financed by FAC under the Fourth Highway Project) and
three Zairan engineers. FAC has advised that it will continue financing of
the three experts under the proposed project.
H. Construction
2.33       Minor road construction projects are carried out by local con-
tractors selected after local competitive bidding procedures. When no lo-
cal contractor is available or prices tendered are uncompetitive, OR car-
ries out the work by force account using its mechanized units. For large
road construction projects, OR employs contractors following suitable



- 20 -
prequalification and tendering procedures.   Contracts are let on a unit-
price basis after international competitive bidding. While the quality of
construction has been satisfactory, execution of works has often been dela-
yed due to shortages of local funds. To minimize this risk, the Government
will annually review its investment plan taking into account available re-
sources (para. 1.19).
2.34      There are about ten foreign-owned road construction firms, all of
them locally registered.   The few domestic road builders lack the experi-
ence, skilled staff, equipment and capital to execute even medium works and
are limited to working as sub-contractors for the other firms. Because of
a shortage of funds, there have been few major construction projects and
this situation will likely continue for some time.   There is an apparent
surplus of contracting capacity in Zaire, which would normally result in
low unit prices.   This is not the case, however, since contractors must
often hedge to compensate for late payments and frequent shortages of spare
parts and materials.
2.35       Supervision of minor road works is carried out directly by OR's
New Construction Department staff and is satisfactory. For major works, OR
employs expatriate consultants.
I. Road Maintenance
2.36        OR is responsible for maintenance of the 40,900 km of national
and priority regional roads (Annex 1, Table 2) including 8,000 m of bridges
and 150 ferries. OR also participates in the maintenance of about 4,800 km
of secondary regional and local roads by supplying funds and technical
assistance to communities  to keep these roads passable.   The remaining
99,800 km of roads and tracks are the responsibility of regional and local
authorities.
2.37       At independence in 1960 the highway organization, faced with a
scarcity of equipment, spare parts, tools, and trained personnel, was
unable to do maintenance work itself and had to contract this work to agri-
cultural and industrial enterprises and to private contractors. This pro-
ved unsatisfactory except in a few cases. Under the First Highway Project
(1969), the Government prepared a program to improve highway administration
and maintenance. The Second Highway Project (1972) provided technical and
financial assistance to implement this program and to rebuild the mainte-
nance  force.   Under  the Third Highway Project  (1975),  OR successfully
launched pilot maintenance projects in Bas Zaire and Bandundu aimed at
decentralizing maintenance. The ongoing Fourth Highway Pro- ject (1979) is
also contributing to making OR an effective and decentralized maintenance
organization. Most of OR's organizational difficulties have now been over-
come and nationwide decentralization has been achieved.   Henceforth, the
emphasis should be on strengthening OR's manpower and material resources.



- 21 -
2.38      OR's 57 autonomous brigades and maintenance units (42 and 15, re-
spectively) are distributed throughout the country.  They use road mainte-
nance and ferry equipment supplied by SGMTP (para. 2.18).   Rehabilitation
and periodic maintenance activities on the national and priority regional
roads are equipment intensive.   In view of the low population density in
most of Zaire, this is justifiable. For routine maintenance, considerable
labor is involved. OR contracts out routine maintenance for some roads un-
der unit price contracts to companies or local authorities who in turn hire
contract labor for execution of the work.  Their work is monitored by the
brigades responsible  for the areas where the roads are  located.   This
labor-intensive system is working satisfactorily.
2.39       Despite the progress it has made, OR is still hampered by insuf-
ficient equipment, material and skilled manpower in meeting the basic main-
tenance needs of its large road network.  This problem has been compounded
by chronic shortages of spare parts and fuel. Consequently, except for Bas
Zaire, OR has not been able to follow a well-defined maintenance program
and most operations have been on an ad hoc, emergency basis.   Periodic
maintenance has been generally neglected. Further, because of OR's limita-
tions, maintenance and rehabilitation programs under the Fourth Highway
Project are confined to routine and periodic maintenance, and the most
urgent rehabilitation needs.  The Fourth Highway Project will nevertheless
go a significant way to solving OR's problems.   Financing of spare parts
will increase equipment availability to 75% by completion of the project in
1982 while adequate fuel supplies will lead to higher utilization rates.
Moreover, with technical assistance and training under past and ongoing
projects, OR is reaching the stage when it should have the skilled person-
nel to carry out adequately the necessary maintenance operations.
2.40      Tne proposed project will consolidate these achievements by con-
centrating operations on OR's 40,900 km road network. Adequate countrywide
routine and periodic maintenance as well as rehabilitation will be stressed
and equipment availability and utilization rates will be improved. Speci-
fic targets and indicators for these activities have been agreed upon
(para. 3.21).
J. Ferry Maintenance and Operations
2.41      The operation and maintenance of ferries are an essential part of
the road program.   The Ferry Service was set up under the Third Highway
Project (as the Service Mhcanisation Bacs, SMB) to repair, maintain and
operate ferries as well as to build them. With the aim of sharing equip-
ment and facilities, SMB was incorporated into SGMTP as SGMTP/Ferries in
1980. The ferry units which operate and maintain a ferry crossing are part
of the maintenance brigade responsible for the road section where the
crossing is located.   Three shipyards build ferries and carry out over-
hauls, while repairs and periodic maintenance are done by 11 maintenance/
repair units.

K. Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Subsector
2.42        Since Zaire's independence in 1960, the Association has helped
finance four highway projects. In 1969, the First Highway Project (Credit
152-CK, US$6 million) assisted the Government in preparing a program to
improve the highway administration and in executing emergency maintenance
and rehabilitation.   The project cost of US$9.6 million was financed by
IDA, UNDP (US$1.6 million) and the Government (US$2 million).   The Credit
financed technical assistance, procurement of equipment, spare parts, and
tools, and some maintenance and rehabilitation work. According to the Pro-
ject Performance Audit Report for the project (1976), only some of the ob-
jectives were achieved.   Rehabilitation and maintenance work did not pro-
duce the expected results because of an overlyoptimistic project timetable,
the prevailing disorder of Zaire's administration,  and the Government's
lack of familiarity with Bank Group procedures.  The project was completed
in 1976, four years after the planned closing date.   Due to lack of reli-
able information, both at the time of appraisal and of completion no re-
evaluated ER was calculated. The project, however, was instrumental in the
creation of OR as an autonomous agency, a significant achievement.
2.43         The goal of the Second Highway Project (Credit 292-CK, US$19
million, 1972) was to help the Government to set up and strengthen OR, to
train local staff and to rehabilitate about 1,900 km of roads. The project
cost, originally estimated at US$46.4 million and later increased to
US$53.7 million, was co-financed by UNDP (US$2.2 million), USAID (US$9.8
million), and the Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA (US$4
million), Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation, FAC (US$1 million) and the
Government (US$17.7 million). The IDA Credit financed technical assistance
to OR and rehabilitation work.   The project completion report indicated
that notwithstanding weak performance of the consultants hired under the
project, OR began emerging as a viable organization. Rehabilitation work,
however, was hampered by cost overruns, shortage of Government funds, and
nationalization of contractors.   As a result, only about 1,000 km were
rehabilitated to planned standards, 600 km were rehabilitated to lower
standards and the remaining 300 km were deleted from the project.  Despite
these setbacks, the reevaluated ER of this component was estimated at 15%
since construction cost increases were more than compensated by VOC in-
zreases. The project was completed in 1979, five years after the original
closing date.
2.44         The aims of the Third Highway Project (Credit 536-ZR, US$26
million, 1975) were to continue strengthening OR, develop local expertise
in highway administration and to rehabilitate about 600 km of unpaved
roads.  The project also included the implementation of two pilot mainte-
nance schemes in the regions of Bas Zaire and Bandundu (para. 2.17). The
project cost, originally estimated at US$40.3 million, was later increased
to US$42.2 million. The project was co-financed by UNDP (US$0.9 million),
FAC (US$0.7 million), Belgium (US$0.2 million) and the Government (US$14.4
million). The IDA Credit financed (i) procurement of equipment, tools, and
spare parts, (ii) road rehabilitation including supervision, (iii) cons-



- 23 -
truction  of  workshops,  (iv)  technical  assistance  and  (v)  feasibility
studies for future road construction.   As a result of Zaire's financial
crisis, the road rehabilitation and feasibility studies components were
reduced in order to buy essential materials such as fuel for road mainte-
nance and to introduce a ferry maintenance program. The project completion
report concluded that the pilot maintenance and rehabilitation schemes in
Bas Zaire and Bandundu were satisfactorily completed and were a sound basis
for the present decentralized maintenance system. The project was complet-
ed in 1980, two years after the planned closing date.
2.45       The Fourth Highway Project (Credit 916-ZR, US$26 million, 1979),
scheduled to be effective by mid-1979, was intended to finance two and a
half years of OR's three-year (1979-1981) road maintenance and rehabilita-
tion program. Delays in credit effectiveness postponed the start of imple-
mentation to mid-1980 and consequently OR's three-year road maintenance and
rehabilitation program now covers the period 1980-82.   The project cost
estimated at US$143.3 million is being financed by IDA, a European Economic
Community (EEC) Special Action credit (US$15.5 million) administered by
IDA, and eight co-financers:   Saudi Fund (US$33.9 million); Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), Federal Republic of Germany (US$23.6 million); CIDA
(US$6.5 million); Overseas Development Ministry (ODM), United Kingdom
(US$2.2 million); USAID (US$0.7 million); FAC (US$0.2 million) and Adminis-
tration Generale de la Cooperation au Developpement (AGCD), Belgium,
(US$0.1 million). The Government's contribution amounts to US$34.6 million
equivalent. The project essentially carries on the objectives of the three
previous projects, strengthening OR's administration and improving mainte-
nance  and  rehabilitation operations.    It  consists  of  (i)  routine  and
periodic maintenance of 40,900 km of national and priority regional roads,
including construction and equipping of warehouses, procurement of equip-
ment, spare parts and fuel; (ii) rehabilitation and strengthening of about
400 km of paved roads; (iii) repair and maintenance of ferries; (iv)
strengthening or replacement of about 25 bridges; (v) equipment for the
LNTP; and (vi) technical assistance to OR.  After a year's delay, the pro-
ject is proceeding  satisfactorily.    Project  completion  is  expected  by
December 1982.
2.46      Throughout implementation of these four projects some significant
achievements have been made.  The most important is that a viable road ad-
ministration has been established, which, due to a substantial training
effort, can count on an increasingly competent staff.  Second, the deterio-
ration of the main road network, which had continued till the mid-1970s,
has been arrested and parts of this network, mainly in Bas Zaire and
Bandundu, have improved.   Third, Government has become more aware of the
benefits of improved maintenance and began to make sizable allocations for
road maintenance in 1979 and 1980.
2.47       These successes, however, will be temporary if OR cannot be pro-
tected from a number of exogenous factors and from the growth problems of a
young organisation faced with an enormous task.  The continuing depressed
state of the economy with persistant budgetary difficulties and shortages



- 24 -
of foreign exchange has severely affected OR's operations by causing fre-
quent interruptions in its work programs, delays in maintenance and low
utilization of equipment.   Overall maintenance performance has therefore
been below expectations.   Moreover, faced with the pressing maintenance
needs of the vast network under its responsibility OR has tended to operate
too much on an ad hoc basis switching its operations from one emergency to
another and has neglected systematic programming and execution of mainte-
nance works.
2.48      The proposed project has been designed and incorporates a number
of measures to overcome or alleviate the above problems. Under this pro-
ject OR's responsibilities will not be expanded but will permit consolida-
tion of past achievements. Also, the project has been scaled to match the
Government's funding capability as determined by past budgetary perfor-
mance, and the financing plan provides that 100% of the foreign exchange
cost of  the project  be provided by external  financiers.   Furthermore,
agreement has been reached with the Government that (i) minimum budgetary
allocations will be made for the project (para. 3.17); (ii) funding through
the fuel tax will be increased (para. 2.29); and (iii) the Association's
financing of spare parts, fuel and lubricants will be contingent on regular
payments to OR as agreed by the Government (para. 3.03).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed project supports the Government's objectives of
providing more efficient, cheaper and reliable connections between the
country's principal centers of economic activity and stimulating develop-
ment of the agricultural sector by facilitating transport and marketing of
agricultural products.  The project, in line with the four previous Asso-
ciation-financed highway projects, aims to (i) continue and consolidate the
country-wide road maintenance program begun under these projects, (ii) pre-
vent collapse of the deteriorating paved road network, (iii) preserve im-
portant river crossings, and (iv) continue strengthening OR's maintenance
capability. OR's relatively limited capacity and Zaire's difficult econo-
mic and financial situation have been taken into consideration in defining
the size and contents of the project.   The project therefore emphasizes
consolidation of OR's current activities and operations without further ex-
pansion during the project period.
B. Project Description
3.02        The proposed project covers OR's 1983-1985 work program5/ and
consists of the following:
(i) Continuation of the country-wide road maintenance/
rehabilitation program begun under the Fourth Highway
Project by providing funds for:
(a) procurement of equipment, spare parts, fuel and
lubricants, materials and radio equipment;
(b) technical assistance;
(ii) Resurfacing and strengthening of about 165 km of
paved roads;
(iii) Replacement of ferries and construction of ferry
approaches;
(iv) Reconstruction and reinforcement of bridges;
(v)  Procurement of equipment for LNTP; and
5/  The ongoing Fourth Highway Project was intended to cover two and a half
years of OR's three-year (1979-81) road program; its implementation,
however, had to be postponed to 1980-82 due to a one-year delay in Credit
effectiveness. Therefore, the proposed project will support OR's 1983-85
road program.



- 26 -
(vi) Studies on:
(a) the administration of Zaire's highway sector; and
(b) the evaluation of the resource cost of fuel products as
a basis for their pricing.
(i) Road Maintenance/Rehabilitation Program
3.03      The three-year maintenance/rehabilitation component has been
defined taking into account the Government's funding capability as deter-
mined by its budgetary performance in the recent past and the evolution of
OR's equipment and manpower over the next four years. The final program is
a synthesis, modified as necessary by the above constraints, of submissions
by OR's regional departments after consultation with local authorities and
road users.   The program has the following eight components: paved road
maintenance, rehabilitation, gravelling, grading, regravelling, culvert and
bridge maintenance, and manual maintenance (Annex 1, Table 3).  Agreement
has been reached with the Government on the first year's program.   The
Government (OR) will submit the annual work programs to the Association for
its review and approval at least three months before the start of each
year's program and will not modify work programs already agreed upon with-
out the Association's approval.   In the event of any shortfalls in the
monthly budgetary allocations to OR, the Association and OR would exchange
views on any modification to be made to the work program, and payments by
the Association from the credit account for the procurement of spare parts,
materials and fuel would be contingent on the work program being acceptable
to the Association.
3.04      To carry out the work program, the proposed project will provide
renewal of essential equipment, spare parts, fuel and lubricants, mater-
ials, technical assistance and training.
(a)  Equipment renewal.   By mid-1982 OR will have received all
the equipment and spare parts provided under the Fourth Highway
Project (para. 2.45). While no further expansion of OR's equip-
ment is foreseen during 1983-85 some of the older equipment and
vehicles will need replacing.   Vehicles,  which have a shorter
average life than the road maintenance equipment and which are
essential for proper monitoring of the various activities in the
field, are a high priority.  Equipment to be supplied under the
project will be procured in two phases, the second phase being
contingent upon satisfactory achievement of agreed output targets
(para. 3.21) during at least one year.  The list of replacements
(Annex 1, Table 4) and lot-packaging have been agreed upon.
(b)   Spare parts, tools and materials.   This element includes
spare parts mainly for road maintenance equipment acquired before
1981, since equipment being delivered under the Fourth Highway
Project includes 15% of its value in spare parts.   It also in-
cludes replacement motors, spare parts and tools for ferry reha-
bilitation and maintenance.   The principal materials to be fi-
nanced under the project are bitumen for maintenance of paved
roads and galvanized steel for drainage structures (Annex 1,
Tables 5 and 6).



- 27 -
(c) Fuel and lubricants. The pr)posed project will finance the
foreign exchange component of the fuel and lubricants needed for
rehabilitation work during the three-year program.   Since OR's
maintenance/rehabilitation activities have often been curtailed
by a shortage of foreign exchange to buy fuel, the external con-
tributions under (b) and (c) will greatly improve the availabi-
lity and utilization of OR's equipment.
(d)  Technical assistance and training.  In order to consolidate
the achievements already made in building an effective road ad-
ministration, the proposed project will finance the services of
54 experts (compared to the 60 experts currently employed by
OR).   Nine will be responsible exclusively for continuing the
training of OR staff. Training would extend to equipment opera-
tors, mechanics, foremen and drivers who are all urgently needed
to operate and maintain recently purchased equipment. Middle and
high level staff will attend courses in accounting, auditing,
storekeeping and management.  Ferry captains, pilots and naviga-
tion specialists will receive training in river navigation. Spe-
cial attention will be given to training Zairan instructors who
will take over from the experts at the end of the project.
Training courses for the above are already available and have
proved effective.
(e) Telex and radio equipment. The vast distances and poor com-
munications network within Zaire make it necessary for OR to have
its own communications system. The proposed project will augment
OR's existing system by financing additional, badly needed equip-
ment: telex machines, radio-telephones, generators and battery
chargers (Annex 1, Table 7).
(ii) Resurfacing program
3.05       Most of the asphalt courses of Zaire's paved roads (2,360 km)
have been designed for a service life of seven years.   OR has selected
about 330 km of paved road of primary importance which, if not resurfaced,
are very likely to fail in the near future and require costly recons-
truction.   Sections of these roads, totalling 165 km, will be resurfaced
and strengthened under the proposed project in order to protect the invest-
ment and to prolong their service life by another seven years.   The sec-
tions to be strengthened are on the Kinshasa-M4atadi (80 km out of a total
350 km), the Lubumbashi-Likasi (40 km out of 141 km), and the Mbuji Mayi-
M4wene Ditu (45 km of 130 km) roads.  Detailed engineering has been carried
out by OR.



- 28 -
3.06        The Kinshasa-Matadi road is the most important in the country,
connecting the capital with the port of Matadi. The narrow Kinshasa-Matadi
corridor serves as a vital lifeline along which a large portion of Zaire's
imports and exports flow.   This region (has Zaire and the Kinshasa dis-
trict) is also one of the most populous and economically active. About 80
km of the road, stretching over rolling terrain of laterite soils, are in
very poor condition due to the old age of the pavement, heavy traffic and
poor drainage.   Deterioration has reached the point where in many places
the base must be replaced. Traffic varies from 400 to 1,000 vpd depending
on the section.
3.07        The Lubumbashi-Likasi road joins the two most important mining
centers in the Shaba region. It passes through a generally rolling savanna
and crosses a considerable number of streams draining into the Lualaba
River. Soils are generally lateritic with some sandy stretches. On the 40
km to be resurfaced the extensively deteriorated pavement and drainage
structures have passed their service life.   Traffic on the road is about
400 vpd.
3.08       The Mbuji Mayi-Mwene Ditu road connects the capital of the dia-
mond producing area (Mbuji Mayi) to the Lubumbashi-Ilebo railway line at
Mwene Ditu.   The road is the shortest connection between the railway and
this region of Kasai Oriental.   In addition to diamond production, the
region is a potentially important maize and cotton-producing area.   The
road passes through generally flat to rolling savanna and crosses numerous
streams draining into the Kasai River. The soils are generally sandy. The
45 km to be resurfaced are in bad condition with inadequate drainage, de-
teriorated drainage structures, badly eroded shoulders and lack of any sig-
nalization. Traffic is about 400 vpd.
3.09       Resurfacing works for these three roads will include minor ir-
provements to the existing alignment, reinforcement of the base, improve-
ment of drainage structures, enlargement of shoulders, and road signs and
safety markings.  The surface courses will consist of a 4 cm layer of as-
phaltic concrete for the Kinshasa-Matadi road and a double surface treat-
ment for the other two roads.   The proposed design standards  for these
roads (Table 3.1) are consistent with the geometric highway design stan-
dards adopted by OR for other paved roads in Zaire and are appropriate for
the terrain, climate and forecast traffic. No private land acquisition is
needed as the minor improvements of existing alignments involve only state-
owned, non-agricultural land.

(iii) Ferries
3.10        Virtually the entire country forms the drainage basin of the
Zaire River whose tributaries  crisscross  Zaire.   These numerous water
courses require a system of ferries and ferry crossings throughout the
country where bridges are not economically justified. Many important road
links are dependent oa ferries, which are a vital and integral part of the
road network.  The proposed project will provide the materials which will
permit SGMTP/Ferries to construct nine 20-ton ferries as replacements for
those at or beyond the end of their service life. Ferry approaches at im-
portant river crossings will also be built using imported pontoon ele-
ments. This will provide additional safety for the vehicles and passengers
using the ferries, and prevent damage to vehicles and to the ferries them-
selves.   The list of ferries to be replaced (Annex 1, Table 8) and the
sites of the approaches have been agreed.
(iv) Bridge Reconstruction and Reinforcement
3.11       Like ferries, bridges are an integral part of the road network
and their maintenance and renewal is essential.  The proposed project in-
cludes the reconstruction of nine bridges and the reinforcement of four
(Annex 1, Table 9); these works and the sites where they will be carried
out have been agreed upon.   The thirteen bridges to be reconstructed or



- 30 -
reinforced will be semi-permanent steel structures (Bailey-Acrow type).
This type of bridge has been chosen instead of permanent structures for
four reasons:   (i) most of the roads served are earth roads and when they
are gravelled or paved, their alignments may be changed and the bridges can
then be disassembled and moved; (ii) construction is fairly easy and sim-
ple; (iii) it would be possible to build only one carriageway initially and
add another relatively easily and inexpensively when justified by traffic;
and (iv) the cost of the Bailey-Acrow type bridge likely to be used is
about US$6,000 per linear meter compared to about US$20,000 for a permanent
structure.  The wooden bridge solution was discarded because for spans of
more than 20 m they are more expensive to build than the Bailey-Acrow type
bridges, they are expensive and onerous to maintain, and safety standards
are lower.
(v) LNTP
3.12       LNTP is the only institution in Zaire capable of providing labo-
ratory support for road design and construction and, therefore, its effi-
cient operation is of the greatest importance to OR. The project will pro-
vide for the replacement of old and worn-out equipment, three complete
field laboratories and a drilling set, including compressor, pump and
accessory parts (Annex 1, Table 10).
(vi) Studies
3.13      The project provides US$300,000 for studies on:
(a) the administration of Zaire's highway sector (organization,
management, operations) in general and of OR in particular;
and
(b) the evaluation of the resource cost of fuel products as a
basis for their pricing and the effect on the economy of
alternative pricing policies.
C. Cost Estimates
3.14        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$121.1 million
equivalent (US$114.0 million net of taxes and duties) with a foreign compo-
nent of US$76.7 million, or 63% of the total cost.   Cost estimates are
given in January 1982 prices. A quantity contingency of 10% has been in-
cluded for the resurfacing, ferry and bridge components. Price contingen-
cies are based on recent estimates of inflation rates as follows: 1982 -
8.5%; 1983-85 - 7.5%.   The same percentages for local and foreign costs
have been used under the assumption that the differential inflation of the
zaire will be compensated by exchange rate adjustments.   Costs of the
various components of the project are given in Table 3.2 and their distri-
bution over the three-year program period in Table 3.3.

3.15       Cost estimates are based on data provided by OR, which have been
reviewed and found acceptable.  They have been derived as follows: (i) For
vehicles, spare parts, tools, fuel and materials, estimates are based on
recent actual CIF costs (Matadi) for these items plus a local component for
handling and transport. (ii) For technical assistance, estimates are based
on actual costs for the same services rendered under the Fourth Highway
Project and average about US$9,500 per man-month including salary, social
costs, overseas allowance and international travel but excludes firms'
overheads and profits as the experts would be hired individually. In addi-
tion to these personnel costs, the average rate includes the costs of ac-
commodation and local transportation.   (iii) For the resurfacing program
cost estimates are based on quantities resulting from a study carried out
by OR.   The estimated US$100,000 equivalent per km appears reasonable in
the light of bids recently received for similar works.   The foreign ex-
change component of these costs is estimated at 68% of the total cost.
(iv) Construction of the 9 ferries of 20 tons will be carried out at the
Bandundu shipyard emnploying local labor. The foreign component, estimated
at 36% of total construction costs, will include engines, steel plates and
angle iron for assembling.  Estimates are based on unit costs and quanti-
ties developed by SGMTP/Ferries, taking into consideration CIF prices at
Matadi.   (v) Estimates for ferry approaches are based on recent quota-
tions. (vi) Estimates for bridge elements are based on recent quotations.
The foreign cost element covers costs CIF Matadi; the local cost element
covers transport and assembly.   (vii) Estimates for bridge infrastructure
are based on approximate quantities and on unit prices received on recent
bids. (viii) Estimates for laboratory equipment are based on unit prices
quoted by suppliers in Kinshasa and on recent bids. The foreign component
is based on the cost CIF Matadi, and the local component includes local
handling and transport costs.
D. Financing
3.16       The cost of the project of US$121.1 million (including taxes and
duties) will be financed by external donors in the amount of US$76.7 mil-
lion representing the foreign exchange cost and by Government in the amount
of US$44.4 million equivalent representing local costs. The financing plan
for the project is -shown in table 3.4.   In addition to the proposed IDA
credit of US$43.5 million, cofinancing of US$10.5 million has been secured:
KFW (US$1.5 million), USAID (US$2.5 million), ODM (US$0.8 million), and
from ongoing bilateral technical assistance programs (US$5.7 million).
AfDF has agreed in principle to provide US$20.6 million and US$2.1 million
is potentially available from Belgium.   The formalization of the AfDF fi-
nancing will be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.

cal cost of US$104.4 million (Annex 1, Table 11), will be financed entirely
by Government. The total contribution required from the Government includ-
ing contingencies is estimated at US$177.9 million equivalent (US$44.4 mil-
lion of local project costs and US$133.5 million of recurrent costs). The
Government has agreed to provide each year, as a minimum, the amounts shown
in Table 3.5 for the implementation of the project.

E.  Iplementation and Monitoring
3.18      OR will be responsible for carrying out the project.  Routine and
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation operations will be carried out by
OR's maintenance brigades. Resurfacing of paved roads will be carried out
by contractors under the supervision of OR engineers.   SGMTP/Ferries will
build the 9 ferries at its shipyard in Bandundu, using imported materials
and techniques already perfected. It will also build the ferry approaches
at important river crossings using imported pontoon elements.  The bridge
abutments and small civil works at the sites where the ferry approaches
will be installed will be carried out by contractors or by OR by force ac-
count in cases where contractors' bids are unresponsive.   The technical
assistance experts will assist in the development and execution of all pro-
grams and in the supervision of contractors.
3.19       A work program will be established for each year of project im-
plementation.   The program will list the type of maintenance activity on
each part of the network, the paved road sections chosen for resurfacing,
the ferries to be replaced and the bridges to be reconstructed or rein-
forced.   Agreement on the maintenance/rehabilitation component  for  the
first year of the three-year program has been reached with the Government;
it has also been agreed that the Government will submit to the Association
for its approval the proposed annual work programs by October 1 of the pre-
ceding years.
3.20       The maintenance/rehabilitation program will start in 1983 as an
uninterrupted continuation of the Fourth Highway Project and will last
three years. The paved road resurfacing program and related supervision by
OR will start in the first quarter of 1983 and take about 30 months to com-
plete, with about 30% of the work carried out in 1983, 40% in 1984 and 30%
in 1985. The ferry and bridge programs will be spread over a period of two
years starting by the end of 1983. Procurement of equipment will be con-
ducted in two phases; the bulk of the equipment will arrive in the course
of 1984. The project implementation schedule is shown as Chart 2.



- 36-
3.21       Until now it has been difficult to measure OR's effectiveness in
carrying out maintenance operations.   The proposed project will overcome
this difficulty by monitoring progress through output indicators devised
for each of the eight activities of the maintenance program (para. 3.03).
Targets for these indicators have been set in accordance with network needs
and OR's capacity.  Country-wide targets are based on OR's staff, existing
equipment and spare parts and technical assistance to be financed under the
proposed project.   Regional targets (Annex 1, Table 13) are based on the
length and type of road of the region (Annex 1, Table 2) and the number and
composition of the working units assigned to the region (Annex 1, Table
12).   Agreement has been reached with the Government that output indi-
cators, including equipment availability rates, will be monitored following
methods satisfactory to the Association and reported quarterly to the Asso-
ciation by OR as part of the progress reporting requirements (para. 3.31).
F. Procurement
3.22        The procurement procedures below will govern those project ele-
ments financed by IDA.   Equipment (US$3.3 million equivalent,  excluding
contingencies) will be grouped into suitable lots and procured by interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Spare parts, shipyard tools, materials for road rehabilitation and for fer-
ry construction, radio and telex equipment, and laboratory equipment
(US$22.4 million total excluding contingencies) will be procured through
ICB for those items that can be combined in lots exceeding US$100,000;
other items will be procured under limited international tendering or di-
rectly from the dealer or manufacturer. When ICB procedures are used, do-
mestic manufacturers would be accorded a preference of 15%, or the existing
applicable rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price
of competing foreign supplies.
3.23      Fuel and lubricants (US$16.7 million equivalent excluding contin-
gencies) will be procured from fuel distributors at the official price.
This is standard procedure in Zaire and is being used successfully for the
Fourth Highway Project.   Technical assistance  experts  financed  by  IDA
(US$7.5 million excluding contingencies) will be engaged through renewal of
contracts with experts already engaged under the ongoing credit or the re-
cruitment of new experts. Terms and conditions of these contracts shall be
satisfactory to the Association and in accordance with the procedures des-
cribed in the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants" published by the
World Bank in August 1981.
3.24       Award of contracts for paved road resurfacing (US$16.5 million
equivalent excluding contingencies) cofinanced by IDA will be subject to
ICB in accordance with Bank Group guidelines after suitable prequalifica-
tion of contractors.  Qualified domestic civil works contractors would be
allowed a preferential margin of 7% over the bid price of competing for-
eign contractors. Particular preference will be given to contractors with
experience in areas with similar conditions.   For bidding purposes the 80
km to be resurfaced on the Kinshasa-Matadi road will be divided into two



- 37-
sections with bidders allowed to bid for one or two sections. The works on
the 4buji Mayi-Mwene Ditu and Lubumbashi-Likasi roads will be packaged as a
single lot each.
3.25         Because the small civil works at ferry approaches and bridge
abutments are widely dispersed throughout Zaire and contract costs would
not exceed US$150,000 each (US$1.8 million total), foreign contractors are
unlikely to show interest in these works.   They will, therefore, be pro-
cured following local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the
Association.  Where no responsive bids are obtained, OR will carry out the
works itself after approval by the Association. In this case disbursements
of credit funds shall be made for the purchase of construction materials
against satisfactory documentation. These materials shall be procured fol-
lowing local limited tendering procedures satisfactory to the Association.
3.26        Consulting firms or individual consultants will be engaged to
carry out the two studies (US$300,000); the terms of reference and condi-
tions of employment of consultants will be satisfactory to the Association
and in accordance with 1981 Bank guidelines for use of consultants.
G. Disbursements
3.27      IDA credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 100% of foreign cost (CIF) of directly imported equipment,
materials, spare parts and shipyard tools, fuel and lubri-
cants;
(b) 70% of the cost of road resurfacing works;
(c) Civil works for ferry approaches and bridge abutments:
(i) 65% of the cost for work carried out by contractors;
(ii) 80% of the cost of locally purchased materials for work
carried out by OR.
(d) Expert services:
Mi) 100% of the foreign cost for foreign experts;
(ii) 80% of the total cost for local experts.
All disbursements will be fully documented.
3.28       Using the disbursement percentages outlined above and taking in-
to consideration the disbursement profile for the Third Highway Project,
disbursements would be as shown in Table 3.6.

R. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.29       OR is a public sector enterprise and as such is required to prepare
accounts according to the Zairan general commercial accounting plan.  In recent
years OR has considerably strengthened its accounting function, both at the cen-
tral office in Kinshasa and in the regions.  In addition, during 1980 and 1981
OR introduced various internal physical and accounting controls, including an
internal audit the results of which are reported directly to the managing com-
mittee. OR's current system of cost accounting permits the assessment of aver-
age unit costs of specific activities.  OR will expand its cost accounting to
calculate unit costs by brigade.



- 39-
3.30       The Fourth Highway Project requires auditing of OR's accounts by
an independent auditor. An auditor was appointed in 1980 and has completed
an extensive review of OR's accounting system. His report, indicates that
the accounting system and the controls are generally adequate.   The audi-
tor, however, has made a number of recommendations aimed at further imr-
provements of the system and the internal controls.   During the project
period OR's annual accounts and financial statements will be audited by in-
dependent auditors acceptable to the Association and that the audit report
will be submitted to the Association not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year.
3.31      OR will prepare quarterly progress reports which will include the
output indicators (Annex 1, Table 14); the reports should be submitted to
the Association not later than one month after the end of each quarter. OR
will also prepare a project completion report in a form acceptable to the
Association not later than six months after the closing date of the pro-
ject.
I. Environmental Aspects
3.32      None of the project's elements will adversely affect the environ-
ment.   Minor improvements to the alignment under the resurfacing program
will require the use of very small amounts of nonagricultural state-owned
land. All other project roads follow the existing alignment and no distur-
bance to land use should occur.  Furthermore the new or improved drainage
facilities and accesses to bridges and ferries will benefit adjacent areas,
and the improvement of geometric standards will contribute to road safety.

IV. ECONOKIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01       Zaire's general transport policy is to give priority to invest-
ments which will contribute to more efficient utilization of the existing
transport infrastructure and facilities. The specific goals for the roads
subsector as stated in the National Plan are (a) to ensure that roads do
not hamper the transport of agricultural inputs to the rural areas and of
produce to the urban areas, and (b) to carry out road works which have a
high rate of return in the short term.   This policy and these goals are
sound.
4.02      The proposed project will support OR's 1983-85 work program which
has  been  designed  in  accordance  with  these  goals.    The maintenance/
rehabilitation component of the program will concentrate on the basic net-
work of 40,900 km thereby maximizing the productivity of the available
equipment and manpower.   Moreover, the program ensures that the transport
needs of that part of the network which carries over 95% of total traffic
and which is esential for the transport between the urban and rural areas
will  be  satisfied.    The  rate  of  return  of  the  entire  maintenance/
rehabilitation program is conservatively estimated at 48%.
4.03       The resurfacing of deteriorated paved roads will reduce vehicle
operating costs (VOC) as well as prevent the loss of valuable infrastruc-
ture capital.  The rate of return of this component is 66%.  The rehabili-
tation and replacement of ferries and bridges, which form an integral part
of the network, will ensure that important roads can be kept open with a
relatively small investment.   The ER for the ferry and bridge components
are 79% and over 100%, respectively.
4.04       The overall ER for the above four components, which account for
92% of the project costs, is over 55%. No economic return has been calcu-
lated for the institution-building and training elements of the technical
assistance component nor for the laboratory component.  These activities,
however, are well justified.
B. Area of Influence of the Project and Beneficiaries
4.05       The maintenance/rehabilitation component covers the 40,900 km of
National and Priority Regional roads. This network comprises the most im-
portant roads in the country, linking centers of activity to each other and
to their agricultural hinterland.  Even though it does not include feeder
roads per se this network facilitates the integration of the rural economy
into the modern economy by ensuring all-weather access from the economic
centers to the rural areas and vice-versa.



- 41 -
4.06       The resurfacing of paved roads will have a direct impact on the
areas in which they are located.  The three roads to be resurfaced play a
vital role in the three most important economic areas of the country. The
project will help to prevent closure of these roads which would lead to the
economic collapse of these areas. The ferries and bridges included for re-
placement under the project are dispersed throughout the network and the
closing of any one would result in a considerable disruption of traffic.
4.07       The direct benefits of the overall program will arise primarily
in the form of VOC savings. These will result from an improved riding sur-
face on the roads to be maintained, rehabilitated and resurfaced and from
avoiding costly detours which would result from ferries being inoperative
and bridges being closed. These benefits will accrue in the first instance
to the traders/truckers and the transport companies.  On the more traffic-
ked routes where competition is keener the larger share of the benefits
will most likely be passed on to the producers and/or consumers.   It has
been shown in a number of cases that where roads leading to potentially
rich areas had been reopened or made passable year-round, competition be-
tween traders/truckers has increased and prices of products have been re-
duced. Even on those parts of the network where there is at present little
or no competition, it is expected that some of the benefits will even-
tually, albeit slowly, be passed on to consumers and producers.
4.08       For certain areas, the program, if sustained in the long-term,
will also yield benefits of better integration in the market economy. In
these areas, some roads which are part of the basic network have at times
been impassable and transport availability has been very unreliable. This
has discouraged the production of marketable surpluses by the rural popula-
tion affected and has contributed to the general decline in marketed agri-
cultural production. Therefore by ensuring transport reliability, agricul-
tural production will be stimulated in the long run. The increased produc-
tion will benefit both producers, by providing income, and consumers, by
lowering prices. Neither these beneficial effects nor those generally as-
sociated with generated traffic have been included in the calculation of
the benefits.  They are of a long-term nature requiring that improvements
in transport reliability be sustained beyond the project period, and their
quantification is very unreliable.
C. Economic Analysis 6/
Maintenance/Rehabilitation Program
4.09      The economic analysis for this program is done separately for the
8 principal maintenance/rehabilitation activities.  The underlying assump-
tion in the analysis is that without the project, the output levels of
these activities will be reduced (Annex 2, Table 1) and that they will be
curtailed first on those parts of the network where the impact of the
6/ The economic analysis is expressed in early 1981 zaires.
(US$1.00 = Z 3.00)



- 42 -
reduction would be minimal, i.e. those carrying lower traffic. Curtailment
of these activities will lead to increased VOC and/or higher maintenance
costs when the activities are resumed.   Since there is little empirical
information in Zaire on the increase in VOC and in future maintenance costs
as a result of curtailments in road maintenance activities, estimates have
been based on available information in other countries.   They are in line
with generally accepted differentials in VOCs as between different road
conditions.
4.10      Two of the eight activites, paved road maintenance and grading of
gravel/earth roads, have a direct impact on vehicle operating costs.  For
the former, it is estimated that vehicle operating costs will increase by
10% annually on the roads on which no maintenance is done.  The postpone-
ment of paved road maintenance is also estimated to lead to an annual
increase in future maintenance costs of 20%.  Similarly, for gravel/earth
roads, postponement of surface grading is estimated to increase vehicle
operating costs by 5% annually.
4.11        The reduction in three other activities, culvert maintenance,
bridge maintenance and manual road maintenance, has no immediate effect on
vehicle operating costs.   VOCs are expected to rise only in negligible
amounts during the three years of the project in direct response to the re-
duction in output. However, every year the needed maintenance and rehabi-
litation is postponed will result in higher maintenance/rehabilitation
costs for the following year and/or the need to reconstruct the structure
earlier.   In general, it is estimated that for each part of the network
which does not receive the needed maintenance, future costs will increase
by 20% every year the maintenance is postponed. The benefits of this part
of the program are therefore the savings in future maintenance and repair
costs.
4.12      Finally, there are the activities such as rehabilitation, gravel-
ling and regravelling which not only lower vehicle operating costs in the
year they are carried out but also during a number of subsequent years. In
the case of gravelling, vehicle operating costs are estimated to be reduced
by 25% during five years; for rehabilitation, the reduction is estimated to
be 25% during four years, while regravelling would bring about a 15% reduc-
tion during two years.
4.13       The incremental costs of the program over and above the costs
which would be incurred without the project are composed of vehicle rene-
wal, spare parts and tools, fuel and lubricants, materials, salaries and
part of the technical assistance, a total of Z184 million.   These costs
were apportioned over the three-year period according to the project's imr
plementation schedule.   The traffic on the road sections affected by the
reductions is of the order of 10 vehicles per day (vpd) and is assumed to
increase at a rate of 2% p.a. VOCs are shown in Annex 2, Table 2 and the
streams of costs and benefits are set out in Annex 2, Table 3.  They indi-
cate that the component has a very high rate of return estimated at 48%.
In addition, if unit benefits were 20% lower, the ER would still be 33%.



- 43 -
Resurfacing Program
4.14      The road sections to be resurfaced have wearing courses well past
their service life, and costly reconstruction will be required if they are
not resurfaced soon.   The proposed works will therefore have a favorable
impact on future VOC and on road maintenance and repair costs.
4.15      The economic analysis of this investment is based on the follow-
ing: (a) the economic cost of resurfacing is Z270,000/km; (b) the life of
the investment is 7 years; (c) with the project, annual maintenance costs
are Z10,750/km; (d) the Kinshasa-Matadi road has 45% heavy vehicles and 55%
light vehicles; the Lubumbashi Likasi road has 50% heavy and 50% light ve-
hicles; and the Mbuyi Mayi-Mwene Ditu road has 65% heavy and 35% light ve-
hicles; (e) traffic is growing at 2% per year; (f) with-the-project VOC are
those of a paved road of Category I (Annex 2, Table 2); (g) without the
project VOC are the average of those of a paved road of Category I and of
Category II increasing annually to reach the level of an earth road of
category I after five years; (h) without the project, essential emergency
repair works will be needed of Z12,000/km in the first year growing to
Z25,000/km the fifth year to prevent surface deterioration from reaching a
point where the road condition will have a severely adverse impact on eco-
nomic activity in the area of influence of the road.
4.16       The streams of costs and benefits are set out in Annex 2, Table
4.  They indicate an ER of 73% for the Kinshasa-Matadi road, 62% for the
Mbuji Mayi-Mwene Ditu road and of 56% for the Lubumbashi-Likasi road.  The
weighted average ER for this component is 66%.
3. Ferry Component
4.17      The ferry component has 3 subcomponents which are evaluated sepa-
rately: (a) replacement of 9 ferries; (b) construction of ferry approaches;
and (c) materials and tools for ferry maintenance and repair.
(i) Replacement of 9 ferries
4.18       The ferries to be replaced have passed their service life.  They
often break down, which results in traffic interruptions.   OR has esta-
blished from a detailed study that the average cost, including deprecia-
tion, of providing river passage is lower with new ferries than with keep-
ing existing ferries in operation with costly overhauls and repairs.  The
analysis can therefore be limited to assessing the economic feasibility of
replacing the ferries. The benefits of replacement were considered as the
VOC savings obtained from avoiding a traffic detour; in all 17 cases the
distance of the detour was determined and the associated total veh/km were
calculated. In this calculation allowance has been made for deterred traf-
fic by assuming that with a detour of less than 50 km no traffic is deter-
red; when the detour is between 50 and 100 km 25% of the traffic would be
deterred; with a detour of between 100 km and 300 km 50% would be deterred
while with a detour in excess of 300 km all traffic is deterred.  In addi-



- 44 -
of the benefits of the traffic which makes the detour as an approximation
of the value of the economic activity that is lost due to the impact of the
higher transport costs. Traffic is estimated to grow at 2% p.a.
4.19      After verification that each of the ferries has an ER of at least
15%, the ER was calculated for the 9 ferries as a group by comparing the
aggregated installation and fixed operating costs with the total flow of
VOC savings.  Assuming a 20 year service life for the investment, the ER is
86% (Annex 2, Table 5).
(ii) Construction of Approaches
4.20      The larger ferries with a capacity of 30 tons and heavier require
approaches to provide better protection to both the ferries and the road
vehicles.  In the absence of an appropriate approach, damages incurred to
the structure of the ferry and its mechanical parts are much more frequent
and severe than with an approach. There is also a higher incidence of damr
age to vehicles and their cargo where there are uneven surfaces at the
point of landing. Moreover, vehicles will more often get stuck and immobi-
lize traffic at the ferry landing.
4.21      The ER of the investment in ferry approaches has been calculated,
however, taking into consideration only the benefits associated with re-
ductions in ferry repair costs and in ferry downtime.  Based on available
maintenance and repair records and on conditions at the ferry locations in-
cluded in the project, it is estimated that: (a) without the approach the
average maintenance and repair costs for the hull will be 30% higher than
with an approach and 20% higher for mechanical parts; and (b) due to a
higher repair frequency, without the approach the ferry will be out of ser-
vice, on average, 25 days more per year than with the approach.
4.22          The average economic cost of an approach is estimated at
Z 620,000 and has an economic life of 25 years. Average annual maintenance
and repair costs are Z 19,400 for the hull and Z 124,000 for the mechanical
parts. The additional VOC incurred annually by the users of the ferry dur-
ing the periods that it is out of service are derived from those establish-
ed in the analysis of the replacement of ferries by assuming that at these
important crossings, traffic volume is double the average.   The cost and
benefit streams are shown in Annex 2, Table 6.  The ER is 13%.  This esti-
mate, however, does not take into consideration less quantifiable factors
such as the likelihood of traffic immobilization and of higher damage to
vehicle and cargo without an access ramp, and the greater inconvenience
caused to pedestrians.   If these various factors are taken into account,
the investment appears well justified.

(iii) Materials and Tools for Periodic Ferry Maintenance and Repair
4.23        This subcomponent will permit SGMTP/Ferries to rehabilitate and
carry out the periodic overhauls of its fleet of 150 ferries at the three
ferry shipyards. Equipment for these shipyards has been financed under the
two previous projects but some additional tools as well as materials and
supplies are required for both the shipyyards and mobile repair units. If
these activities were to be curtailed and eventually discontinued due to
shortages of materials, tools and spare parts, the rate of ferry breakdowns
would rapidly increase and a growing number of ferries would become inope-
rative.   There is little empirical information to estimate the rate at
which ferries would become permanently inoperative, but in view of the cri-
tical importance of spares and materials for the operation of the ferries,
the following assumptions appear conservative:   at the end of the first
year 15% of the ferries would be permanently out of operation increasing to
27% and 45% at the end of the second and third years, respectively.   The
benefits of this subcomponent are therefore the savings in VOC obtained by
avoiding traffic detours at 15% of the ferry locations in the first year,
at 27% of the ferry locations in the second year and at 45% of the ferry
locations  in the  third year.   In subsequent  years,  the difference  in
ferries out of operation between the with and without project cases decrea-
ses rapidly and is estimated to become insignificant by the seventh year.
4.24      For the calculation of the ER, only the effects of the disconti-
nuation of service are taken into consideration and the higher incidence of
detours resulting from more frequent breakdowns prior to the discontinua-
tion of service are ignored. It is further conservatively assumed that the
average length of the detour as established under the ferry replacement
subcomponent remains stable despite an increasing number of ferries per-
manently out of service.  The initial capital cost and the annual costs of
supplies and materials for the program are shown in Annex 2 Table 7. The
ER of the program is 95%.
Bridges Component
(i) Reconstruction of Bridges
4.25        The nine bridges to be reconstructed have passed their design
life and will be unsafe if kept open to traffic. The question whether they
should be reconstructed and the ER of their replacement has been examined
along  the  same  lines  as  the  ferry  replacement.    The  benefits  of
reconstruction are the VOC savings obtained from avoiding a traffic
detour.   As in the case of ferry replacement, allowance has been made for
deterred traffic by assuming that with a detour of less than 50 km no
traffic is deterred; with a detour of between 50 km and 100 km 25% of
traffic is deterred; with a detour of between 100 km and 300 km 50% of
traffic is deterred and with a larger detour, all traffic is deterred.
Furthermore, if the increase in total VOC is 25% or less, no traffic is



- 46 -
deterred. Benefits for the deterred traffic are counted at 50% of those
for the detouring traffic as an approximation of the value of the economic
activity that is lost due to the impact of the higher transport costs.
Traffic is estimated to grow at 2% p.a.
4.26      After verification that each of the bridges has an ER of at least
15%, the ER was calculated for the nine bridges as a group by comparing the
aggregated installation and maintenance costs for the nine bridges with the
aggregated VOC  savings.   Assuming a service life of 25 years,  the ER
exceeds 100% (Annex 2 Table 8). This high ER is explained by the fact that
the investment in bridges represents only a marginal cost when compared to
the existing road infrastructure which is implicitly considered as a sunk
cost.
(ii) Reinforcement of Bridges
4.27       Under this subcomponent four existing bridges are to be reinfor-
ced to extend their useful life.  The analysis and the assumptions are si-
milar to those of subcomponent (a) above except that the service life of
the investment is 15 years. Each of the investments was found to be justi-
fied and the aggregate ER for this subcomponent exceeds 100% (Annex 2,
Table 9). As in the above sub-component, this high ER is explained by the
fact that the existing road infrastructure can be considered a sunk cost.
D. Sensitivity
4.28       Although the various components and subcomponents of the project
have a high rate of return, in the range of 48% to over 100% (except for
access ramps: 13%), the extent to which these ERs could be adversely affec-
ted by certain critical factors has also been assessed.  Benefits could be
markedly influenced by (i) lower than projected traffic, and (ii) by a re-
duction in unit VOCs due to an improvement in the supply of vehicles,
spares and ancillary services (para. 2.12).   These two factors, however,
are very unlikely to act simultaneously since improved economic conditions
leading to a reduction in VOC and the reduction itself would both provide a
stimulus to traffic.   Therefore, a lower base line traffic volume is the
only factor which could conceivably adversely affect the benefits of the
project components. The sensitivity analyses, however, indicated that with
a 20% reduction in the base year traffic, the ERs would still be in the
range of 33% to over 100%.
4.29       For those components involving construction (resurfacing, bridge
and ferry construction) the ERs could be affected by higher construction
costs owing to the uncertain situation in many areas in Zaire.   The ER of
those components was recalculated with a 20% cost increase and their ERs
range between 44% and over 100%.
4.30       For the other components -- the road and ferry maintenance and
rehabilitation -- project implementation could be delayed or hampered by
external factors such as inadequate local or external funds or delays in
the effectiveness of the cofinancing arrangements.   This would lead to a
reduction in the road network (or ferries) receiving adequate maintenance



- 47 -
during the project period. Accordingly, the ER was calculated assuming a
reduction in output levels of these two components of 40%; the ER is 17% in
the case of the road maintenance/rehabilitation component and 52% for the
ferry maintenance/rehabilitation component.
E. Risks
Institution-Building
4.31       One of the main objectives of the project is to consolidate OR's
achievements in institution-building.   OR's organizational  structure  is
adequate, and its autonomous status enables it to carry out its tasks as
required.   Two factors,  however,  remain critical  for determining  OR's
effectiveness: (i) a qualified, motivated staff, and (ii) operational auto-
nomy.  The number of qualified Zairans working for OR increases yearly.  A
part of the increase is attributable to OR's own training programs. In re-
cognition of the importance of these training programs for institution-
building, the proposed project will help finance technical assistance and
equipment for training activities.   Moreover for OR to retain qualified
staff, it must be able to provide adequate salaries on time.  Frequently
the Government has been unable to allocate sufficient funds to OR resulting
in late salary payments and a lowering of morale.   The proposed project
calls for specific measures to help ensure an adequate and regular flow of
funds to OR.
4.32       OR's operational autonomy was affected by a recent decree on de-
centralization of the Government administration to the effect that the
maintenance units of OR can be requisitioned by local and regional authori-
ties. Since this could seriously jeopardize the efficacy of OR as a main-
tenance organization, additional legislation, satisfactory to the Associa-
tion, has been enacted guaranteeing that OR will be protected from requests
for services which are in conflict will the orderly implementation of its
work program.
Local Funds
4.33      As a result of insufficient allocations of budgetary funds by the
Government, OR has frequently had to face interruptions of work, delayed
and inefficient maintenance operations, and low utilization rates for
equipment.   To address  the problem,  the proposed project  requires the
Government to allocate to OR's recurrent and investment budgets the neces-
sary funds on a timely basis and the following measures have been agreed
upon: (i) the Government will make mimimum budgetary contributions for the
implementation of the project (para. 3.17); (ii) funding through the fuel
tax will be increased (para. 2.29); (iii) the Association's financing of
spare parts, fuel and lubricants will be contingent upon the Government's
making its agreed payments to OR (para. 3.03).



- 48 -
External Funds
4.34        Zaire's poor economic and financial condition makes it chroni-
cally short of foreign exchange and therefore OR has been unable to buy all
the spare parts, fuel and materials it needs.  In order that shortages of
these items do not impede the execution of the three-year road maintenance
and rehabilitation program, the Association and the other codonors will
finance 100% of the foreign exchange needed under the project.



- 49 -
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOHMENDATION
5.01      The following major items were discussed and agreed upon at nego-
tiations and are included as special covenants in the Credit Agreement:
(a) OR will annually review its highway sector plan
for the following five-year period and submit any
revisions made to the Association for its com-
ments; the Government will then adjust its Public
Investment   Program  accordingly,   taking   into
account the Association's comments (para. 1.19);
(b) by March 31, 1983 the Government will carry out a
study on the resource cost of fuel products and
ensure that the pump price of fuel products covers
at a minimum their resource cost (para. 2.06);
(c) by October 1, 1982 the Government will submit to
the Association the scope and organizatonal set-up
for a system of traffic counts, including a sched-
ule  for its implementation;  upon receipt of the
Association's  comments,   the  Government  shall.
promptly take steps to put the system into effect
(para. 2.07);
(d)  by December 31, 1983 the Government will review
and make recommendations on the level and struc-
ture of road-user duties and taxes (with partic-
ular attention to those levied on fuel); after
submission of the review and recommendations to
the Association, the Government shall take appro-
priate action resulting from the review, taking
into account the Association's comments (para.
2.15);
(e) the funding of OR through the fuel tax will be in-
creased so that by December 31, 1984 it, together
with other revenues of OR, is sufficient to fi-
nance OR's recurrent expenditures and a reasonable
part of its investment requirements (para. 2.29);
(f) the Government (OR) will submit the annual work
programs to the Association for its review and ap-
proval at least three months before the start of
each year's program and will not modify work pro-
grams already agreed upon without the Asso-
ciation's approval (para. 3.03);



- 50 -
(g) in the event of any shortfalls in the monthly bud-
getary allocations to OR, the Association and OR
would exchange views on modifications to the work
program; payments by the Association from the
Credit  Account for procurement  of spare parts,
materials and fuel would be contingent on the work
program  being  acceptable  to  the  Association
(para. 3.03);
(h) equipment to be supplied under the proposed pro-
ject will be procured in two phases, the second
phase being contingent upon satisfactory achieve-
ment of agreed output targets (para. 3.04(a));
(i) the sites for ferry replacement and approaches and
for   bridge   reconstruction   and   reinforcement
(para. 3.10 and 3.11);
(j) the Government will exchange views with the Asso-
ciation by October 1 each year during project
implementation on the adequacy of the proposed
budget allocations for the coming year; in no
event should the amounts allocated be less than
the following: 1983, US$52.5 million; 1984,
US$59.9 million; and 1985, US$65.5 million (para.
3.17); and
(k) output indicators, including equipment availa-
bility rates, will be monitored following methods
satisfactory to the Association and reported
quarterly to the Association by OR as part of the
progress reporting requirements (para. 3.21).
5.02       Conditions of Credit effectiveness would be the following:  (a)
the Government has increased the fuel tax and revised the mechanism for the
Road Fund (para. 2.29); and (b) the signing of the AfDF credit agreement
(para. 3.16).
5.03       Agreement having been reached on the items listed in para. 5.01,
the proposed project is suitable for a Credit of SDR 38,600,000 (US$43.5
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms.

Telex and Radio Equipment
The vast distances and the poor communication network within Zaire
make it necessary that OR have its own telecommunication system. It is
indispensable that operating units keep contact with their regional
headquarters.
OR's current telecommunication network is composed of the following
sets:
10 telex
10 fixed radio-phones (150W)
78 fixed radio-phones (10OW); and
24 portable radio-phones (10OW).
To have an adequate communication system at least 15 more telex and 60
radio-phone sets with ancillary equipment are needed.

Output/Year For Maintenance Activities
1.   The outputs for the eight maintenance activities in the first year of the
project's implementation (1983) shown in Annex 1, Table 13 have been converted
in km, respectively m equivalent in the table below by applying the factors in
parenthesis after each maintenance activity.
2.   Case with Project:  the proposed project will make operational 25% of
existing equipment now idle by providing adequate fuel, spares, materials and
technical assistance. These factors combined will produce a minimum increase in
output of 10% in 1984 and 5% in 1985 for every maintenance activity except paved
roads (5% each year) and culverts and bridges (3% each year). The constraints
affecting output of the last three activities are easier to resolve at local
level,and the proposed project will affect output less than in other activities.
3.   Case without project:  In this case, 25% of the existing equipment will
remain idle in 1983; an additional 10% of equipment will become inoperative in
each of the following years 1984 and 1985. Therefore, following the reductions
in spare parts, fuel, technical assistance and training, output will be reduced
25% in 1983 and an additional 10% in 1984 and 1985. Culverts and bridges will
suffer a 3% decrease for each 1984 and 1985.
