REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI FOR A
BLANTYRE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi for the equivalent of US$7.0 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a Water Supply Project for the City of
Blantyre. The Government will relend the proceeds of the proposed credit
to the Blantyre Water Board for 24 years, including a grace period of 4
years, at an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum. The project is ex-
pected to be cofinanced by the African Development Fund and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation in an aggregate amount of up to about US$6.7 million
equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Development and Prospects of
Malawi" (Report No. 560a-MAI) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
January 14, 1975. An updating economic mission visited Malawi in November/
December 1975. The following paragraphs are based on the mission's findings
and on additional information recently received from the Government. Country
data sheets are provided in Annex I.
3.        At Independence in 1964, Malawi was the poorest of the three terri-
tories of the former Central African Flderation. With a population of about
5 million and a land area of 93,000 km , its population density is among the
highest of African countries. Its main assets are moderately fertile soils,
good water resources and a climate favorable for crop production. Unlike its
neighbors, Malawi has no substantial mineral resources. Forests constitute
the main, essentially untapped, resource which could be exploited on a signi-
ficant scale in the future. At Independence, the tax base was very narrow,
government revenues had to be supplemented with British budgetary aid to
support the administration, and prospects for economic development were
generally regarded as bleak.
4.        Measured against the country's natural endowment, progress since
1964 has been remarkable. Between 1964 and 1975, GDP at constant prices grew
at an average annual rate of 7.5 percent, domestic investment and savings
increased rapidly, and government finances have improved sufficiently to
eliminate the need for budgetary aid. Agriculture, which dominates the
economy and contributed 45 percent of GDP in 1975, has been directed towards
export markets by encouraging cash crop estates production and integrated
rural development schemes. Diversification has also been promoted. In
addition, rapid industrial development (the share of industry rose from 9
percent of GDP in 1964 to 14 percent in 1975) has significantly broadened
the economic base. Despite this economic improvement, however, Malawi still
has a GNP per capita of only US$150 and is listed by the United Nations among
the world's poorest countries.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. It contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



5.        Malawi's success has been the result of realistic and purposeful
planning by the Government. In 1971, a Statement of Development Policies
(DEVPOL) was published, which provides a general framework within which the
Government operates a three-year rolling plan. DEVPOL contains guidelines
for major economic indicators up to 1980 and states the main socio-economic
objectives, among which are: (a) to raise living standards and productivity
in rural areas; (b) to achieve an average annual growth of GDP of 8 percent
through the parallel development of smallholder output, estate agriculture
and industry; (c) to promote a more balanced regional development; and (d)
to develop local initiatives and a gradual increase of local participation
in the economy.
6.        DEVPOL recognizes the important role of private investment in
development which, it is anticipated, will account for about half of total
fixed capital formation over the 1971-1980 period. The Government also recog-
nizes the role of a healthy private sector in generating foreign exchange and
savings needed to sustain other elements of the development strategy, and
has adopted policies which are intended to attract foreign investors and
to ensure a continued high growth of the private sector. Trade and pay-
ments policies are liberal, profits moderately taxed and wages are held
down to favor labor-intensive estates and industries. The modern private
sector has been the leader in economic growth. The output of estate agri-
culture increased by 10 percent a year in real terms over the past decade,
and industrial production rose by 13 percent annually.
7.        Within the public sector investment program, agriculture will
receive 19 percent, public utilities 17 percent, and social services 15
percent during the 1971-1980 period. Government investment in transport
infrastructure will be reduced from 37 percent in the late 1960s to less
than 30 percent of total public investment. Malawi has an effective admin-
istration which has been remarkably successful in preparing and implementing
development projects.
8.        Firm information on which reliable estimates of income distribution
could be based dates back to 1969. At that time, income distribution was
relatively favorable. The poorest 40 percent of households received 15
percent of incomes; the highest 20 percent received 53 percent and the high-
est 5 percent received 30 percent. These figures compared well with those
of other developing countries. Since then, the rapid development of estate
agriculture and industry has undoubtedly led to a greater concentration of
incomes.
9.        To offset the adverse distributional effect of the growth of the
modern private sector, the Government has directed its agricultural invest-
ment program towards the smallholders. It is true, however, that for a long
time, agricultural producer prices have been kept at a level which was low
as compared to international levels, and which was probably also too low to
provide a sufficient incentive to higher production. Only recently has the



- 3 -
Government recognized the importance of sufficiently remunerative producer
prices, and it has increased them substantially. Indirectly, wage and
price policies have reduced the gap between wage earners and subsistence
farmers. Over the past seven years, real wages have fallen somewhat, while
the real earnings of smallholders have risen. Keeping a firm check on wage
increases has also had a beneficial effect on wage employment. Total wage
employment has increased by 10 percent a year on the average. About 20
percent of Malawai's labor force is now engaged in wage employment as
compared to 12 percent in 1968.
10.       Owing to its fast rate of population increase, estimated at 2.6
percent annually, population pressure is heavy in relation to arable land.
While recognizing the existence of this problem, the Government has been
reluctant to introduce population control policies and intends to rely in-
stead on balanced regional development policies that would encourage the
movement of population to the less densely populated areas. In mid-1975,
Malawi's urban population represented only 10 percent of the total popula-
tion. However, because of the diversification of the economy, urban popu-
lation is rapidly increasing by more than 10 percent per annum, in line
with the expansion of wage employment opportunities in the non-agricultural
sectors. The construction of the new capital city at Lilongwe has also
contributed to spreading more evenly the newly urbanized population among
the different cities. Nevertheless, this fast urban growth, coupled with
Government's higher priority for rural development and infrastructure in the
use of public funds, has caused urban infrastructure to somewhat lag beh;
the needs of the city dwellers.
11.       Since almost 90 percent of the population live in rural areas,
rural development is a primary social and economic objective. At the moment,
the majority of farmers are smallholders on the fringe of the market economy.
Their staple crop is almost exclusively maize and their principal cash crops
are tobacco and groundnuts. Until now, the principal instrument for increas-
ing smallholder productivity has been relatively intensive integrated develop-
ment projects in specific areas, which at the moment reach about 25 percent
of the rural population.
12.       In spite of the Government's efforts, however, the production from
the traditional agricultural sector has lagged behind that of the estate
sector. Although firm figures are lacking, indications are that produc-
tion from the traditional sector has not increased by much more than 3 per-
cent a year over the past decade. The Government is concerned about this
relatively slow growth and is preparing a country-wide approach to rural
development, which would be a departure from the previous approach in that
it would primarily concentrate on the provision of farm inputs and extension
services. This new approach -: the National Rural Development Program - is
to become the Government's chief vehicle for smallholder development.
13.       In the past, the generation and use of domestic resources have been
good. Investments grew from 8 percent of GDP in 1964 to 27 percent in 1974.
Domestic savings, which were virtually nil in 1964, financed 42 percent of



- 4 -
total investment in 1975. The Government's budget has been skillfully
managed in order to put government finances on a firmer footing. From
1964 to 1974/75, recurrent revenues grew by 14 percent a year on the
average, while the increase in recurrent expenditures was kept down to
8 percent a year. British budgetary support - which financed MK 10 mil-
lion, or about one third of the current budget in 1964 - was gradually
reduced and was eliminated entirely in 1972/73. In 1973/74 and 1974/75,
small recurrent budget surpluses of MK 1.5 million and MK 5 million were
achieved. At the same time, the Government's domestic medium- and long-
term borrowing was also stepped up from MK 0.1 million in 1964 to MK 13.5
million in 1974/75. The financial situation of public corporations is
generally healthy, and part of their surpluses is used to finance govern-
ment investments. As a result of the factors mentioned above, the domestic
contribution to the financing of development expenditures, which was nega-
tive in 1964, increased to 45 percent in 1974/75.
14.       Up to 1974, Malawi's balance of payments had shown a healthy de-
velopment. Since 1967, exports have increased by about 7 percent a year in
real terms, while imports have increased by about 6 percent a year in real
terms. The terms of trade, however, have moved somewhat against Malawi.
Payments for services increased substantially but they were partly offset
by increases in workers' remittances from South Africa. The balance of pay-
ments current account deficit increased from US$18 million in 1967 to US$45
million in 1974. This deterioration, however, was more than compensated
for by increasing private and public capital inflows. As a result, official
international reserves increased from US$22.5 million at the end of 1967
to US$81.5 million (4.5 months of imports) at the end of 1974.
15.       In 1975, Malawi's balance of payments deteriorated.    The current
account deficit is estimated to have increased from US$45 million in 1974
to about US$100 million. Private and public capital inflow did not increase
correspondingly, as a result of which international reserves declined to
US$61 million (3 months of imports) at the end of 1975. A number of factors
have contributed to the deterioration in Malawai's balance of payments posi-
tion in 1975. While merchandise exports increased by 12 percent in real terms
over 1974, imports increased by 15 percent. As a result, the trade deficit
increased from US$77 million in 1974 to an estimated US$115 million in 1975,
which explains most of the increase in the current account deficit in that
year.
16.       The sharp increase in the volume of imports in 1975 was, to some
extent, due to the political uncertainties in Malawi's neighboring countries,
which led Malawian importers to accelerate their imports in order to build
up precautionary stocks. Among domestic factors which may have adversely
affected the balance of payments, is the large expansion of credit, which
amounted to 85 percent in 1975. Mainly as a result of a sharp decline in
receipts from migrant labor after the Malawian Government suspended offi-
cial recruitment, international reserves continued to decline, in the first
half of 1976, to a level of US$30 million in June (since then they have
remained stable). The development of the trade balance, however, was much



- 5 -
more favorable than in 1975. In the first nine months of 1976, merchandise
exports were 20 percent higher than in the corresponding period of 1975,
while imports of goods were 14 percent lower, which would suggest that the
balance of payments problems are being overcome.
17.       Notwithstanding the recent balance of payments difficulties,
Malawi's longer term prospects for growth, external trade and payments are
good. Its agricultural products have generally found ready markets, par-
ticularly in the UK, and more recently in the USA. Traditional outlets and
Malawi's associate membership in the EEC offer good prospects of expanded
markets for Malawi's exports. With the substantial expansion of sugar pro-
duction that is about to get under way, total exports in real terms can
realistically be expected to grow even faster in the future (more than 9
percent a year) than in the past (about 8 percent a year). However, Malawi's
terms of trade are likely to show a further deterioration of about 8 percent
over the next five years. On these assumptions, the current account deficit
is projected to increase from US$100 million in 1975 to some US$150 million
by 1980.
18.       With the increase in the Government's investment program, net long-
term public capital inflow also increased substantially from US$17 million
in 1967 to US$47 million in 1975. The sources of public capital inflow have
gradually been diversified. At Independence, the UK was virtually the only
source, but by 1974, the British contribution had declined to less than 50
percent. International organizations, especially IDA, provided 20 percent
and the remainder came from a variety of bilateral sources. Development
grants amounted to about 25 percent of total public capital inflow. Loan
capital was generally made available on concessionary terms. From 1971
through 1974, total commitments of public loans and grants averaged US$60
million a year. The average grant element of these commitments was 77 per-
cent.
19.       At the end of 1975, Malawi's external public debt totalled US$322
million, of which US$239 million had been disbursed. Debt service in 1975
amounted to US$12.7 million, equivalent to about 6 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. At the end of 1975, IDA's share in Malawi's disbursed debt was
25.8 percent and servicing of IDA credits accounted for 3.0 percent of total
debt service. As Malawi's need for external capital is expected to grow over
the next years, the Government may encounter greater difficulty in borrowing
on terms as soft as those it has received in the past. Debt service is likely
to increase, but even if the average grant element of external assistance
declines from almost 80 percent in the recent past to some 60 percent by 1980,
the debt service ratio would not increase to more than 10 percent by 1985.
The past record of good economic management and high growth, together with
continued favorable prospects for exports and a relatively low debt service,
makes Malawi creditworthy for limited amounts of lending on conventional
terms. External capital requirements will continue to be in excess of the
foreign exchange component of project costs and external assistance should,
therefore, also cover some local costs in appropriate cases.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAWI
20.       To date IDA has made thirteen development credits to Malawi amount-
ing to US$96.7 million equivalent. Six of these credits, totaling US$42.5
million, financed agricultural projects. The remaining credits were allo-
cated as follows: two credits totaling US$21.5 million for highways in 1968
and 1974; two credits totaling US$12.8 million for power projects in 1970 and
1973; two other credits amounting to US$17.9 million for education projects
in 1967 and 1975; and a US$2 million credit in 1974 to finance the preparation
of a planned pulp mill at Viphya. The first Bank loan (US$9.2 million) to
Malawi was made on Third Window terms in June 1976 to help finance the Karonga
Rural Development Scheme. A Bank Group contribution of US$25.0 million
consisting of a standard Bank loan of US$9.0 million, a US$8.0 million Bank
loan on Third Window terms and a US$8.0 million IDA credit to help finance a
Third Power Project was approved by the Executive Directors in March 1977.
IFC's first investment in the country was made in February 1976 with US$6
million for a textile mill. A second IFC loan of US$9.0 million for a sugar
development scheme was approved by its Board of Directors early in April. A
summary statement of Bank Group operations in Malawi as of March 31, 1977, is
given in Annex II which also contains notes on the execution of ongoing
projects. Project implementation is generally very satisfactory.
21.        Bank Group operations in Malawi will continue to emphasize rural
development but importance will also be attached to infrastructure develop-
ment (power, water supply and roads) and education. In agriculture, we are
presently assisting the Government in devising a National Rural Development
Program, for which we expect to recommend Bank Group financial assistance
in FY78. Other external agencies are likely to participate in the financing
of this program. We are also considering further assistance to help consoli-
date two previously IDA-financed agriculture schemes in the Shire Valley.
A third highway project, which was appraised last February, is expected to
include construction of the main road from Kasungu to Jenda as well as the
expansion of the district roads maintenance program initiated under the Second
Highway Project. In education, a sector study, to be carried out jointly by
UNESCO and the Bank, is scheduled for May/June 1977, and we would expect it to
lead to further Bank Group financing. Finally, the Bank Group is also assist-
ing the Government in the preparation of a major pulp development project,
whose total cost has been estimated at over US$300 million equivalent.
Bank financial assistance for this project would be considered if suitable
external guarantees can be obtained.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
General
22.       Malawi is rich in water resources.   The level of precipitation,
though varying significantly according to location and season, ranges from
25 inches (63.5 cm) to 114 inches (290 cm) annually, and is more than adequate.



- 7 -
Lake Malawi, the third largest lake in Africa, forms a gigantic reservoir
which discharges at its southern end into the Shire river, the country's
principal river. Good records of precipitation exist due to the existence
of 475 monitoring stations located throughout the country, and substantial
information is available on surface water and ground water resources.
Because of the importance of Lake Malawi and of the Shire river, surface
water has so far been the country's largest source of supply. Ground
water is widely available from shallow wells, dugwells and boreholes,
but individual yields are low and water quality varies from fair to poor.
Organization
23.       Though most technical matters related to water resources fall under
the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, several
other ministries share the responsibility for water management and operation.
The Ministry of Local Government has jurisdiction over municipalities which
provide water supply and sewer service, with the exception of the Blantyre
Water Board which is supervised by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tour-
ism. Assistance in planning and engineering is provided to Lilongwe by the
Ministry of Works and Supplies which, in addition, is responsible for design,
construction and operation of water supply systems in two cities (Zomba and
Mzuzu), 35 districts and 20 smaller towns. Finally, the Ministry of Community
Development and Social Welfare is responsible for planning, constructing and
operating small, self-help type schemes providing potable water supply from
public standposts in rural areas. Although the Government, through the Water
Resources Act of 1969, has considerable power to control water development,
difficulties in coordinating action by the various ministries and authori-
ties concerned, as well as budget and staffing constraints, have resulted in
relatively ineffective operations within the sector as a whole. The crea-
tion of a single national water authority has been considered, but in the
immediate future only relatively minor organizational changes are being
envisaged. An IBRD/WHO Cooperative Program sector mission, which has been
tentatively scheduled for late 1977, would examine ways to bring about im-
provements, particularly in the field of planning.
24.       Capital and recurrent expenditures of nearly all water supply
authorities are in general financed through the budgetary appropriations of
the ministries concerned, except for the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards
which are autonomous and self-financing for recurrent expenses. The capital
costs of improvements by the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards have been met
mainly from external assistance and from Government grants and loans. Other
water supply development works in urban areas and in small towns have been
financed from Government funds, bilateral assistance and grants from chari-
table organizations.
Urban Water Supply
25.       About 240,000 persons or 70 percent of Malawi's urban population
(living in the cities of Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Zomba) presently have
access to piped water supplies. The level of service varies, with about



-8-
two thirds of the customers .aving indivi_:ual conne.z- ons and the balance
being serviced from kiosks. All connections are metered. Improvement
programs are underway or about to be undertaken to increase the level of
supply for Blantyre and Lilongwe. In Blantyre, works under execution with
financing from the British Government and the Commonwealth Development Cor-
poration will enable the Blantyre Water Board (BWB) to expand its service so
as to reach approximately 220,000 persons. The proposed project would enable
BWB to satisfy the demand through the mid-1980s, and would include an expan-
sion of service to residents of unplanned, low-income areas. With regard to
Lilongwe, the European Development Fund has been approached to finance a
doubling of the existing system that should enable the Lilongwe Water Board
to serve a population increase through the mid-1980s.
Small Town and Rural Water Supply
26.       In 1975, an estimated 1.2 million persons (about one fourth of
Malawi's rural population), had access to potable water. Of these, some
60,000 persons living in 38 small towns had piped water supply from systems
constructed since 1971. An additional 150,000 persons living in rural vil-
lages benefited from simple, untreated water supplies using high elevation
streams as sources. Within the context of large comprehensive rural develop-
ment projects, such as the Shire Valley, Lilongwe, and Karonga schemes, which
are assisted by IDA, water supply, generally consisting of manually-operated
tubewells, now serve approximately one million persons. The remainder of the
population use traditional "dambos" (swamps) or dugwells, which provide water
of questionable quality. Various schemes to improve water supply in rural
areas are being prepared, which may lead to assistance by the World Bank Group.
Sewage and Drainage
27.       Community wastewater systems exist only in Blantyre and Lilongwe,
and provide service to about 10 percent of the population of these two cities.
Both systems provide secondary treatment prior to disposal. Elsewhere in ur-
ban areas, sanitation service consists mainly of septic tanks and pit privies,
the latter generally restricted to traditional housing areas. In Blantyre, a
wastewater improvement scheme is currently underway with financial and tech-
nical assistance from Germany.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
28.       A report entitled "Malawi - Appraisal of Blantyre Water Supply
Project" (No. 1328a-MAI, dated April 19, 1977) is being circulated sepa-
rately. A credit and project summary is given in Annex III and a supple-
mentary project data sheet is given in Annex IV. The project was appraised
in May/June 1976.   Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from March
21 to March 30, 1977. The Malawi delegation was headed by Mr. Kukada,
Secretary of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism.



-9-
Project Description
29.       The project is the fifth phase of BWB's water supply expansion
program, and would constitute the Bank Group's first operation in Malawi's
water supply sector. It would increase the capacity of the supply facilities
at Walker's Ferry on the Shire River from 10 to 14 imperial gallons per day,
the maximum economic capacity attainable from the existing single pipeline,
and would provide other major system improvements. It will include the
following principal elements:
(a) Improvements and extensions to existing facilities at
Walker's Ferry including raw water pumping plant
and water treatment plant;
(b) Addition to Walker's Ferry supply system, consisting of
about 15,000 feet of treated water supply main generally
parallel to the existing Walker's Ferry pipeline; balancing
tanks and pumping plant provided at Walker's Ferry, Chileka
and at a new, intermediate site; and a new terminus of the
pipeline in the Blantyre area;
(c) Distribution system changes including the creation of
seven new pressure zones, the modification or reloca-
tion of two existing pump stations, and the construc-
tion of the following additional elements: nine service
reservoirs, a pump station, and approximately 35 miles
(56 km) of transmission and distribution mains ranging from
2 inches (50 mm) to 24 inches (600 mm) in size;
(d) Construction of general plant including staff housing
and workshop; procurement of vehicles, maintenance
equipment, spare parts, accounting machines and miscel-
laneous; equipment for laboratory and workshop;
(e) Consulting services for engineering design and super-
vision of construction; for management services to
evaluate and improve BWB's accounting practices; for
engineering services to determine the most economic
mode of future operation of the Walker's Ferry supply
system; and
(f) Training of BWB staff in engineering and accountancy.
Project Cost and Financing
30.       The total financing requirements for the proposed project (includ-
ing an amount for taxes and duties which is insignificant, since duties on all
directly imported goods and services are expected to be waived) are estimated
at US$16.6 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$11.2 million or
about 67 percent. This amount includes US$1.1 million for interest during
construction, of which US$0.3 million would be in foreign exchange. A summary
of the project cost estimates is given below:

31.       The proposed IDA credit of US$7 million would help finance the
foreign cost of the civil works contract for reservoirs, pumping plant in the
Blantyre area, trunk mains, laboratory, workshop and general plant and to
cover the foreign cost of equipment for pumping plant, vehicles, spare parts,
workshop equipment and engineering services. This contribution would cover
about 42 percent of the project total financing requirements, with about
US$6.5 million applied towards foreign expenditures and US$0.5 million towards
local expenditures. Up to US$6.0 million representing 36 percent of the
project's total financing requirements, would be financed by the African
Development Fund (AfDF) on a parallel basis. The AfDF loan would be used to
finance the cost of civil works of the Walker's Ferry supply and treatment
works, additions to the Blantyre reticulation system, staff housing as well as
training. About 26 percent of the loan would be applied towards local costs.
About US$0.7 million, representing 4 percent of the project's total financing
requirements, would be financed by the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC). CDC funds would be available to the project without any restriction as
to their use and would be applied towards foreign exchange as well as local
currency components. The balance, or about 18 percent of the project's total
financing requirements, is expected to be provided by the Blantyre Water
Board through internal cash generation.
32.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be relent by the Government
to BWB for a period of 24 years, including a grace period of 4 years, and
would carry interest at a rate of 8.5 percent per annum. The proposed
AfDF contribution is expected to be made available to the Republic of Malawi

on IDA terms with the proceeds to be relent to BWB for a period of 25 years,
including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 8 percent per annum. 1/
The AfDF contribution is expected to be submitted for consideration by its
Board in June 1977. The CDC contribution, which would be lent directly to
the Blantyre Water Board for about 20 years, including a grace period of
about 4 years, at an interest rate of about 8.5 percent per annum, is also
expected to be presented to the CDC's Board for consideration in June. The
effectiveness of the AfDB and CDC Loan Agreements would be a condition of
effectiveness of the IDA credit (draft Credit Agreement, section 5.01 (c)).
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       All construction and supply contracts to be financed by the proposed
IDA credit would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Foreign contractors are expected
to win all major construction contracts, and foreign manufacturers are
expected to furnish all pipes required for the project. Major mechanical
and electrical equipment required for pumping and treatment plant is not
expected to be available from local manufacturers. Nevertheless, should
local manufacturers bid for supply contracts, a preference of 15 percent or
the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower, would be applied to such
bids. A preference of 7.5 percent would be applied to bids by domestic firms
for construction contracts. Items to be financed by AfDF would be procured
in accordance with AfDF's procurement procedures. CDC may agree to finance
items jointly with IDA or with AfDF, in which case CDC would accept the
procurement rules followed by IDA or AfDF. Land required for the project,
particularly for the intermediate pumping station and for reservoirs in
Blantyre, would be acquired by the Government. No difficulties are expected
in this respect.
34.       The IDA credit would be disbursed on the basis of 65 percent of
the total cost of civil works, 100 percent of foreign expenditures for di-
rectly imported pumping equipment, spare parts, vehicles and workshop equip-
ment, 90 percent of local expenditures for locally purchased items and 100
percent of foreign expenditures for consultants.
Project Implementation
35.       The project would be carried out by the Blantyre Water Board (BWB),
a government-owned entity created under the Blantyre Water Works Act of
October 1975, responsible for the supply of water to Blantyre and certain
areas adjacent to the city. The Board consists of a Chairman and ten members
1/   Although this rate of interest would be higher than that assumed in
making financial projections in this report as well as in the Appraisal
Report (3.5 percent), BWB would have no difficulty in meeting this
higher charge from internal cash generation.

appointed by the Minister of Trade, Industry and Tourism. The present Chair-
man of the Board is the General Manager of the Malawi Housing Corporation, an
institution responsible for the execution of urban development projects and
whose activities are primarily concentrated in Blantyre. The Board includes
representatives of private industry, the Blantyre City Council, banking in-
stitutions, the academic world, and the CDC representative in Blantyre. BWB
has a long history of efficient management. The senior position of Engineer/
Manager has been filled since December 30, 1976 with an expatriate engineer
who had formerly been associated with the Public Utilities Board of Singapore.
His Deputy Engineer is a Malawian, who has assumed increased responsibility
with BWB and who served as Acting Engineer/Manager during 1976. Financial
operations are supervised by a Clerk/Treasurer with many years of experience
with BWB. To ensure a continuation of BWB's management capability, BWB would
consult with the Association regarding future appointments to the posts of
Engineer/Manager and Clerk/Treasurer (draft Project Agreement, Section 3.03).
In order to cope with the growing size of the Board's activities, and to
improve the accounting information system and help introduce tariff reforms,
BWB has recently appointed a Chief Accountant.
36.       To assist in the execution of the project, BWB will retain engi-
neering consultants for detailed design, preparation of tender documents,
evaluation of tenders and construction supervision (draft Project Agreement,
Section 2.02). BWB has engaged the firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners
which has assisted in carrying out preinvestment studies and is supervising
the execution of BWB's ongoing development program. BWB will also, by 1980,
retain engineering consultants to carry out studies to determine the most
economic mode of future operation of the Walker's Ferry supply system (draft
Project Agreement, Section 2.02). In addition, BWB would retain for a short
term the services of management consultants to assist in the selection and
introduction of data processing equipment to improve BWB's capability to
collect financial and statistical information for planning purposes, and to
increase the efficiency of its accounting operations (draft Project Agreement,
Section 2.02).
37.       In the past, there have been frequent breakdowns at BWB's pumping
plant. BWB has taken steps to determine the cause of these failures and
will, by December 31, 1977, submit to the Association for comments a plan
of action to evaluate and upgrade its maintenance and operation practices
(draft Project Agreement, Section 3.05).
BWB's Finances
38.       Until now BWB's policy has been to set tariffs at a level adequate
to meet annual operating expenditures and debt service, with only minor
capital expenditures being financed from internal cash generation. BWB has
met these financial objectives, but has not been in a position to accumulate
liquid resources to help finance capital expenditures. The effect of this
financial policy has been that water has generally been priced substantially
below its economic cost. BWB's tariff presently includes a fixed monthly
fee varying according to the type of consumer and assessed value of property,
as well as a monthly consumption charge for use of water above certain
amounts. This system is unnecessarily complex and results in pricing



- 13 -
inconsistencies, which are both uneconomic and inequitable. BWB recognizes
the need to modify its tariff structure, but actual implementation will
require some time and structural changes will be made in consultation with
the Association (draft Project Agreement, Section 4.05). BWB's future tariff
policy will include raising tariff levels close to long-run marginal cost by
1981. BWB, effective January 1, 1977, increased charges to a level expected
to yield average revenues of MK 1.12 per thousand imperial gallons (US$1.03
per thousand US gallons). During the next four years, tariffs will be ad-
justed periodically so as to yield a rate of return of not less than 8 percent
in 1978 and 1979, 10 percent in 1980 and 1981, and 9 percent thereafter on
BWB's average revalued net fixed assets in operation (draft Project Agreement,
Section 4.03). To achieve these rates of return, it has been estimated that,
expressed in constant prices, it would be necessary to increase the average
revenue per thousand imperial gallons by about 45 percent to MK 1.62 per
thousand imperial gallons (US$1.48 per thousand US gallons) by 1981. BWB
is currently preparing a proposal for revaluing its assets, and will, by
December 31, 1977, submit to the Association the methods to be used to carry
out annual revaluations (draft Project Agreement, Section 4.06).
39.       With the proposed increase in tariff levels, BWB should be able
to strengthen its financial position. To ensure that BWB maintains a sound
financial structure, future borrowings should be related to its ability to
service debt. Further debt would not be incurred by BWB without the Associa-
tion's consent, unless future debt service is covered at least 1.5 times by
net internal cash generation (draft Project Agreement, Section 4.04).
40.       Meter readings are made monthly and bills are usually sent by BWB
within one week thereafter. Service is discontinued if payments are not
received within thirty days of billing. BWB's collection record is good.
41.       BWB's accounting system is adequate for recording and preparing
financial statements and annual budgets. There is a need, however, to improve
the system to provide information for project and tariff planning. To assist
BWB in this task, the project would include the provision of equipment and,
as indicated in paragraph 36 above, consulting assistance in the selection of
equipment and the development of appropriate procedures. BWB will continue
to have its accounts audited by independent accountants, and will submit the
audited accounts to the Association within six months of the end of the fiscal
year (draft Project Agreement,-Section 4.02).
Justification
42.       The population of Blantyre, which in 1975 was about 210,000 persons,
is growing at an annual rate of 6.5 percent, or about 2-1/2 times the national
rate. Water demand, however, has grown at approximately twice the rate of
population increase, due to increases in industrial needs and in domestic per
capita water usage and to the extension of water supply service to parts of
the city not previously served. The proposed project, which constitutes the
least-cost scheme for supplying treated water to the Blantyre area would help
satisfy future growth in demand and, by the mid-1980s, would serve a popula-
tion of about 360,000. Improvements in the distribution system should help
to reduce current interruptions in supply or delivery at inadequate pressure.



- 14 -
If benefits are valued at the tariff levels to be attained by the time the
project is completed, the rate of return would be about 7 percent. However,
the tariffs do not recapture all benefits, including the intangible ones
related to health and environmental improvement. In particular, the project
would reduce health hazards and improve public health standards through
the extension of piped water service to people now relying on local streams
and other water supplies of doubtful quality. At present, about 50,000
persons live in unplanned, low-income areas without piped water service. The
project would include improvements through the provision of water kiosks in
such areas to be selected from time to time by BWB, beginning December 31,
1977 (draft Project Agreement, Section 2.04). The project by itself would not
prevent or reduce pollution in the Blantyre area, but where direct water con-
nections to buildings are proposed, BWB requires sewer connections or septic
tanks as a prerequisite. This requirement, in effect, will result in improved
sanitation service to that part of Blantyre not now receiving water service.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and the Blantyre Water Board, the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       Features of the Credit Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 32, 35 - 39, 41 and 42 of this Report. An additional con-
dition of effectiveness of the credit is that cofinancing agreements with
the African Development Fund and the Commonwealth Development Corporation
have been signed and conditions, if any, precedent to first disbursement
thereunder have been fulfilled.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 102-MAI First Education Project; US$6.3 million credit of
May 4, 1967; Date of Effectiveness: July 3, 1967;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project consists of the construction and equipping of one
national primary teacher training college and the provision of technical
instruction facilities in 12 secondary schools. The project has been
implemented satisfactorily and school premises have been in use for about
two years. A request from the Government to use savings under the credit,
amounting to about US$420,000, for the construction of a post and telecom-
munications school to be jointly used by Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland was agreed to by the Executive Directors on December 4, 1973.
The Closing Date has consequently been postponed to June 30, 1977. Con-
struction of the post and telecommunications school has been completed and
the credit is expected to be fully disbursed shortly.
Credit No. 282-MAI Agriculture - Karonga Development Project; US$6.6 million
credit of January 26, 1971; Date of Effectiveness:
August 14, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Due to cost escalation the project period has been reduced from
five to four years. Only minor reductions of physical targets have occurred.
Completion of the irrigated double cropped rice scheme, reduced from 1,500 ac
to 1,000 ac, was delayed due to exceptional flooding. Extension and Research
are working satisfactorily. All necessary staff for the health component are
in post and bilharzia control is now a continuous program. Lake transporta-
tion has been generally improved, but the barge purchased under the credit
and put in operation in early 1976 proved defective. Corrective measures
are expected to be undertaken shortly. In addition, the Government has
requested, and IDA has agreed, to use project funds to raise the Chilumba
jetty by 2 feet to avoid flooding caused by high tides.
Credit No. 363-MAI Agriculture - Shire Valley Development Project Phase II;
US$10.5 million credit of March 28, 1973; Date of Effective-
ness: April 27, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is a continuation and an expansion of the program com-
pleted under Phase I and includes extension services, credit and marketing
facilities, a livestock component, health facilities, fisheries development,
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

feeder road construction, research on irrigated and rainfed crops, land
registration and wildlife protection. Due to a combination of technical
and social factors, crop output may be lower than envisaged at appraisal.
During 1976 IDA assisted the Government in reviewing the cropping program
in detail and a revision of the production targets has been made. The road
construction program is making satisfactory progress. A senior health
officer for the health component assumed duties recently and is now working
on the urgently needed operational health program.
Credit No. S-17-MAI Transport Engineering and Services Project; US$2.0 million
credit of June 13, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 28,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project would help determine the infrastructural requirements
and provide technical assistance for the exploitation of the Viphya forest
resources. Necessary transportation studies and the design of the required
transport facilities have been completed. VIPCOR, the Malawi organization
which is in charge of the Viphya project, is in the process of seeking financ-
ing and technical partners for the Viphya project.
Credit No. 523-MAI   Second Highway Project; US$10.0 million credit of
December 19, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: February 21,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The construction works for the main road from Lilongwe to Kasungu,
although some months behind the original schedule, are about 45 percent
complete. The first results from the maintenance pilot program indicate
satisfactory progress. The present cost estimates indicate that the final
project costs will be well within the appraisal estimates and savings of at
least US$2.0 million can be expected.
Credit No. 550-MAI Agriculture - Lilongwe Land Development Project Phase III;
US$8.5 million credit of May 27, 1975; Date of Effective-
ness: August 12, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The Phase III project of the Lilongwe Land Development Program has
made good progress. Construction of project infrastructure is now almost
on schedule. Due to reduced input use as a consequence of last season's
high fertilizer prices and adverse weather conditions, average maize and
groundnut yields were lower in 1976 than in the preceding year. However,
overall production of high value crops such as tobacco and groundnuts has
increased considerably. The stall feeder and poultry programs are expanding
rapidly, contributing to sizeable income increases of small farmers. Credit
administration and loan repayments continue to be outstanding.

Credit No. 590-MAI Second Education Project; US$11.6 million credit of
November 24, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: February 24,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The project would provide prototype construction models of primary
schools, strengthen the program of rural education, establish a new primary
teacher training college, and add facilities for the teaching of practical
subjects in selected secondary schools, with emphasis on facilities for girls.
Prior to becoming effective on February 24, 1976, the project had made a good
start by early appointment of consultant architects. Key personnel for the
Project Implementation Unit had been hired, including a Malawian Project
Director an expatriate Project Architect. The United Kingdom has provided
two architects and a quantity surveyor to assist the Project Architect in
the design of the primary schools and the supervision of other construction.
Due to lack of skilled manpower, difficulties have arisen in finding Malawian
counterparts to Project Unit draftsmen. However, efforts are being made
to recruit them.
Loan No. 1286-T-MAI Second Karonga Rural Development Project; US$9.2 Million
loan of June 3, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 18,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The project, financed on Third Window terms, consists of the
provision of seasonal and medium-term credit to farmers, extension service,
market complexes, health facilities, boreholders and other infrastructural
facilities, agricultural and hydrological research, preparatory investments
for the National Rural Development Program, and rehabilitation of berthing
facilities at Chipoka Lake Terminal. Project implementation has begun.
