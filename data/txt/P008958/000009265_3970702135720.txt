INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE "'ECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE t PUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL SCHIOOLS PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Kepublic of Tttrkey for the equivalent of US$57.7 million to help
finance the foreign exchange cost of an Industrial Schools Project.  The loan
would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at
the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Tv .rey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and MediumrTerm Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Gczernment's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1985-89) in
August/September 1984 and its findings are reflected in this section.
3.       lurkey is about as large as France and Germany coubined, with a
population of around 48 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1230 in
1983. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 47 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1.970s as well as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about 19 percent. There is, however,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
*            disparities.  Recent data indicate a probable worsening ini income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings. Educational enrollments have expanded greatly, but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.
background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the conse4uert de'erioration of its terns of external trade.



- 2 -
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the
share of public investment in GDP. This was financed initially by workers'
remittances and, following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by
short-term borrowings. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as
the massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in
creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial
production with a rise in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic
inflation had also become an issue of critical importance.
5.       The Turkish authorities' response to the crisis of the late 1970s was
a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces.  Policies were
adopted to expand exports and increase workers' remittances which, together
with liberalization of imports, encouragement of foreign investment and
prudent external debt management, were aimed at alleviating the balance of
payments constraint and import shortages. On the domestic front, the
objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource n:obilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
pubiic sector.
6.       The adjustment program, wihich has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes in attitudes,
institutiors, and the legal and policy framework, all of which require time to
put in place. Major structural changes have been made in the exchange rate
system, tl;e export and import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and
selective credit policies and the public investment program. Implementation
of Ut.e adjustment program was carried out under a military regime during
September 1980 - November 1983 and since then by an elected government.
The Structural Adjustment Program -- 1980-84
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual performance met or exceeded the
Goverunment's ownI targets through 1982. By contrast, results in 1983 and 1984
proved to be mixed, due in part to adverse economic development; on the
external front, slippages in the monetary program, a persistent shortfall in
Government revenues and the renewal of inflationary pressures.
8.       Real GNP expanded by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982.  In
1983, GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent, due in large part to the effects
of a bad harvest and a decline in the contribution of the foreign balance.
The growth rate rebounded in 1984 to an estimated 5.7 percent, supported by
favorable performance in the productive sectors witlh agricultural value added
growing at 3.6 percent and industrial value added at 9.b percent. Capacity
utiLiz-tion rates in private industry in 1984 are estimated to have risen by
about 5 percent to an average rate of 72 percent. On the expenditure side,
the average annual real rate of growtlh of public fixed investment has been
contained to 3.1 percent over the 1980-84 period while the growth rate of
private investment has improved systematically from -17.3 percent in 1980 to
4.8 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.4 percent in 1984. Private
consumption, which had actually fallen by 5 percent in 1980, grew at
4.9 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.0 percent in 1984. On the othier hand,
helped by strict budgetary discipline, the rate of growth of public
consumption declined from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 1983.
Estimates for 1984 suggest a modest growth of 2.4 percent.



9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the annual average
rate of increase in the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981
and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. This rise was fueled by an expansion of
Central Bank credits to firms and commercial banks in difficulty during the
second half of 1983 as well as an unexpected increase in the budget deficit.
The resulting liquidity expansion, in conjunction with a lowering of nominal
deposit interest rates, encouraged consumption at the expense of savings.
10.      Inflation accelerated further in the first half of 1984, although it
moderated in the second half. The average inflation for 1984 is estimated at
a little over 50 percent. The major factors that contributed to the worsening
of the inflationary situation were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant
increase in agriculture product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization and higher export market
prices. Other important inflationary factors included substantial "catch up"
increases of SEE prices and higher import prices resulting from the nominal
depreciation of the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues. Given the tight monetary and fiscal
programs likely to be agreed upon with the IMF as part of a new standby
agreemenc (para. 25), the expectations are that inflation will decline this
year.
11.      Commercial bank interest rates, which were deregulated in July 1980,
have increased substantially and are now positive in real terms. As a result,
total bank deposits increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981
this trend accelerated, with total deposits growing by 103 percent and time
deposits by 274 percent. Growth in total deposits slowed after 1982, and in
1983 and 1984 they grew at 53 percent and 42 percent respectively. The
bankruptcy in late June 1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shook
depositor confidence and was followed by a shift of funds into the larger
banks. The Government averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector and
undertook actions to reform and strengthen the financial sector as a whole. A
new banking law was enacted in June 1983 which covered many of the
recommendations made in the Bank's report on the Financial Sector
(No. 4459-TU). These included measures to reduce the undercapitalization of
banks, place limits on the real assets and investments of banks, link the
establishment of branches to the level of a bank's equity, reduce the
interlocking between banks and corporations, introduce a deposit insurance
scheme, and increase the role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the
banking sector. A new law is currently before Parliament which will further
the banking reform process by introducing standardized accounting for banks
and improved procedures for handling non-performing loans. The Government
also took a major step towards reducing the cost of intermediation by reducing
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Separately, the
Governiment has reduced the level of withholding tax applicable to interest
payments on deposits and bonds from 20 percent to 10 percent. Other important
developments in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge).



- 4 -
12.      The Government is committed to maintaining an interest rate structure
for deposits which is positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding more or less positive real returns since end-1983, with interest
rates ranging from 45 to 53 percent depending upon the term of the depo'it.
While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to save, they
have also meant high borrowing costs. Nominal interest rates range from 60 to
80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because of the high
intermediation costs of the commercial banks and their widely prevalent
practice of requiring compensating balances. The interest rate differentials
between preferential and non-preferential credits and among preferential
credits are large and need to be reduced. The Government has reaffirmed its
determination to achieve positive real rates on all lending by a combination
of bringing down inflation and phasing out interest rate subsidies on
preferential credits. In January 1985, it eliminated preferential interest
rates on short-term export credits. High market interest rates, together with
the limited availability of credit, have led to considerable liquidity
problems for the private business sector, particularly for businesses
supplying the domestic rarket. Measures are also needed to lower the
operating costs of banks, which are well above prevailing levels in comparable
countries.
13.      In the fiscal area, progress was evident from 1980 to 1982 but there
have been slippages in 1983 and 1984. The budget deficit to GNP ratio was
reduced from 5.3 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent in 1982, and the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) dropped sharply from 12.6 percent of GNP to
6.9 percent over the same period. However, the revenue to GNP ratio has been
declining over the past three years. From a high of 20.3 percent in 1981, it
has fallen sharply to an estimated 15.6 percent in 1984. Largely because of
this significant shortfall in revenues, overall fiscal perforiance has
worsened since 1983 even though government expenditures have been considerably
curtailed (from 24.2 percent of GNP in 1980 to an estimated 20.8 percent in
1984) and budgetary transfers to SEEs as a percentage of GNP have fallen
steadily (from 4.8 percent in 1980 to an estimated 1.6 percent in 1984). l'ie
budget deficit is estimated at 5.2 percent of GNP in 1984 and the PSBR at
8.8 percent. The downward trend in the Government revenue to GNP ratio
highlights the urgency of mobilizing additional public resources. As a step
in this direction, the Government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) in
January 1985.
11L_     Improvements in the balance of payments were systematic through 1982
with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion (5.7 percent of
GNP) in 1980 to gl.2 billion (2.2 percent of GNP) in 1982. However, in 1983
the current account deficit widened to about $2.1 billion (4.2 percent of GNP)
as merchandise exports and workers' remittances fell short of targets.
Exports rebounded strongly in 1984, growing by 25 percent in dollar terms to
$7.1 billion.  Remittances, too, registered a higher than expected increase,
reaching $1.9 billion (up by 24 percent).  Concurrently, there was a continued
large inflow of deposits through the Dresdner scheme ($550 millioia in 1984).
Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish workers in
Gernany and automatLcally places these funds at the disposition of the Central
Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits and pays an interest rate
commensurate with the Euro-market rate.  However, these increases were offset
by a sharp rise in merchandise imports to $1U.8 billion (up by 16 percent in
dollar terms). As a result, the current account deficit in 1984 was
considerably higher than projected, reaching $2.1 billion (4.3 percent of
GNP), or about the same level as il 1983.



15.      On balance, merchandise export performance has been impressive over
the 1980-84 period, growing at an average annual rate of about 26 percent in
dollar terms. This growth has been led by the manufacturing sector and has
involved a rise in the share of exports to the Middle Eastern countries.
Industrial exports, comprised primarily of processed foods and textiles, have
risen from 36 percent of total exports in 1980 to 72 percent in 1984. These
results were achieved by a combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate
policy and import liberalization) and direct (tax rebates, preferential
credits) measures to enhance the relative profitability of exports and offset
the traditional bias towards producing for the domestic market. The flexible
exchange rate policy was one of the most important factors contributing to the
growth of exports, together with the penetration of Turkish products in Middle
East markets.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, mostly due to exogenous
factors. Imports fell by 1.0 percent in dollar terms in 1982 and rose by only
4.4 percent in 1983. This reflected price decreases in both oil and non-oil
imports. Merchandise imports, however, increased substantially in value in
1984. The increase has been most significant in some of the groups (e.g. raw
materials and consumer goods) that have been subjected to major liberalization
in terms of both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of
quantitative restrictions.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Government's Fifth Five Year Plan (1985-89) was approved by the
Grand National Assembly in July 1984. The Plan reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its ir.vestments in infrastructure rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
(i)   an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)   an average annual real rate of growtn of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)   an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise imports of
8.2 percent;
(iv)   an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investmaent and b.8 percent in public investment; and
(v)   a declining external debt service ratio, from 2t percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989.



- 6 -
18.             While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, certain targets seem optimistic in view of
both past performance and the immediate prospects for the economy. The Bank's
projections indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
well into 1987, implying a lower growth rate in GDP for the early years of the
Plan and a return to a higher growth path only in 1988. Key economic
variables in the Bank's latest projections for the period 1985-89 are
presented in Table 1:

19.      Bank projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.6 percent per annum on
average for the Plan period, with a low of 4.9 percent in the initial year of
the Plan (stabilization period) and a high of 6.3 percent for the final year
(growth period).  Ach_evement of these growth rates will depend on the
performance of the productive sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing.
This in turn will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination
to constrain the growth of the public sector in line with public resources and
to create a more favorable investment climate for the private sector. This
translates itself into a projected real growth per annum in public fixed
investment of about 5.0 percent on average for the Plan period, starting with
a modest increase in the early years. The comparable figure for private fixed
investment is 10.6 percent or a little more than twice the growth rate for
public fixed investment. These figures are consistent with the need to meet
the infrastructure requirements of the economy through the public investment
program, while providing for the capacity expansion of the private sector
necessary to meet the export and growth targets.
20.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average 9.4 percent
per annum in real terms. Merchandise imports, on the othier hand, are
projected to grow more slowly in real terms through 1986 and then pick up to
an average 7.5 percent per annum in the terminal years of the Plan. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1986
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher growth rates set in during the middle of the Plan period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through the end of the Plan. The terminal year 1989 would show a deficit of
approximately $2.0 billion as compared to a 1985 figure of ¢1.7 billion. The
projected capital account is seen to remain manageable throughout the period
even in the face of some sharp increases in the amortization payments in
1985-87 arising from the debts rescheduled during the 1978-80 period and an
imposed constraint on foreign exchange reserves equivalent to at least two
months' imports. Consistent with the above is an average debt service ratio
for medium and long-term credits for the Plan period of 21.7 percent.
Including short-term debt the average debt service ratio for the Plan period
is 23.7 percent. Gross capital inflows required in 1989, on these
assumptions, would be about $5.9 billion, or about 38 percent higher than the
amount in 1984. Such an inflow is consistent with a decreasing debt service
ratio from 1986 onwards.
21.      The mediumrterm scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community and the present
view of future resources and export market possibilities, the Government's
somewhat more ambitious Plan targets would be feasible provided they are
supported by slightly higher export growth rates and greater success in the
mobilization of public resources. This may be more difficult to achieve in
the early (stabilization) phase of the Plan.
22.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions of
export and import growth rates, a downside risk case has also been developed.
With Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such



as the world economic outlook and movements in international prices, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of 6.9 percent over the Plan period)
would lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments
situation, more external borrowing, a lower GDP growth (averaging about
4.8 percent per annum) and a higher debt service ratio (22-24 percent per
annum). In such a situation the Government would have little chance of
absorbing the unemployed and imp-oving tangibly the average standard of
living.  However, given the Government's emphasis on export promotion and the
determined efforts to counter the bias towards producing for the domestic
market, there is good reason to support the perspective set out in the
mediumrterm scenario presented in paragraphs 18 to 21.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
23.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Approximately $6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in
convertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers' credits and $1.2 billion of
non-guaranteed suppliers' credits, were consolidated into medium-term loans or
partially converted into Turkish lira obligations. Following the resolution
of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official sources -- major
creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the
estimated total debt outstanding of $22.7 billion at end-1984, 81 percent
constituted medium and long-term debt (including IMF). Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
18 percent in 1984. Much of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme (para. 14). At
end-1984 the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme are
estimated to amount to $1.8 billion, which would represent about 45 percent of
Turkey's short-term external obligations and 8 percent of its total
outstanding debt. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an
estimated 41 percent in 1984 to 32 percent in 1989. This translates into a
total debt outstanding forecast for 1989 of $30.6 billion, with short-term
debt constituting about 23 percent of that total. Dresdner scheme inflows are
projected to be around $600 million per annum throughout this period and to
account for a large part of the rise in the ratio of short-term debt to total
debt outstanding.
24.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits (in relation
to exports of goods and non-factor services and workers' remittances)
increased from about 14.6 percent in 1981 to a peak of 28 percent in 1983 as a
result of a large repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier
OECD agreements. Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the
coming years and would average about $3.8 billion per year in 1985-89.
However, the debt service ratio is seen to decrease from an estimated
25 percent in 1984 to 19.8 percent in 1989. The debt burden should remain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive further support fr m
international commercial and official sources. There have been -ricouraging



signs of Turkey's ability to enter the market for commercial borrowings. From
December 1983 to November 1984, Turkey had secured a little over $500 million
from commercial credits, constituting about 23 percent of the total external
credits received during this period. The Central Bank of Turkey recently
completed the syndication of a $500 million multi-component medium-term (seven
years) facility involving a large number of U.S., European, Japanese and
Middle Eastern commercial banks as lead managers.
25.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1250 million was approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. The Government purchased the full amount
authorized under the arrangement. The Government also purchased
three-quarters of a SDR 225 million one-year standby arrangement which was
approved by the LMF in April 1984 and replaced an earlier one-year arrangement
terminated at the request of the Government. Discussions are presently under
way on a further one-year standby arrangement.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
26.      Through March 31, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent $5383.5 million l/
to Turkey, through 81 projects. Agriculture accounts for 19 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 24 percent, power for 13 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 32 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined (excluding structural
adjustment loans) average 49 percent of appraisal estimates, as compared to
50 percent for Tunisia and 49 percent for Morocco. As of March 31, 1985, IFV
commitments to Turkey totalled about $239 million, of which about $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1985.
27.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
*        adjustment lending (SAL) program.  SAL V, which was approved in June 1984,
completed the series of five loans which the Bank had indicated would be the
maximum to a country. Significant progress has been achieved in the past five
years, but the task of restructuring is by no means over.  The next phase will
involve the broadening and deepening of the adjustment process at the sectoral
level. Recent economic developments have underlined the need for a
continuation of the stabilization program without giving up the goals of
1/ Net of cancellations.



- 10 -
sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank lending in the post-SAL
period would be on striking an appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment
lending designed to be quick disbursing and support.ve of policy reforms in
the major sectors, and carefully formulated project lending focussing on high
priority projects principally in the agriculture, energy and transport sectors.
28.      Efforts have already been initiated to develop a series of sectcoral
aGjustment loans for the major sectors over the next few years, starting with
agriculture. The loans for the agriculture sector would help to support a
mediumrterm action program aimed at increasing the growth of primary
production and exports, rationalizing public investment and strengthening                    a
sectoral institutions. Sectoral adjustment lending would also support
measures to address the structural problems of the financial sector and
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral
adjustment loans could be developed include energy and transport.
29.      Project lending, which will continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, will be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. A portion of project lending would be earmarked for the construction
or rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would
be guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
30.      The close macroeconor%ic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued.  The econoi--    i sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the five-year development
plan and studies of housing finance, telecommunications and electronics.
Topics to be covered in the future include a review of the public investment
program, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustment, a review of
transport investments and studies of engineering and agro-industries.
31.      In addition to this loan to Turkey, other projects being presented to
the Executive Directors this fiscal year include a loan for pulp ard paper
rehabilitation, an engineering loan for urban developmenc, a proposed
agricultural sector adjustment loan, and loans for a fourth power transmission
project, a power system operations assistance project and a ports project.
32.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1985-89 (paras. 23 and 24). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 12.4 percent in 1983, is estimated at 13 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.4 billion in 1984 to $14.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.7 billion in 1984 to $8.8 billion in 1989. The Bank group's sh_-e of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 17 percent in 1989.



- 11 -
33.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL TRAINING
34.      Turkey's economic strategy adopted in 1980 entails giving an
increased role to market forces and promoting export-oriented industries,
particularly in the private sector. This strategy implies an emphasis on the
development of industries where Turkey possesses a comparative advantage.  The
Bank's report on industrialization and trade strategy 1/ identified
skill-intensive industries as those in which Turkey should specialize.
However, the low level of industrial productivity has been affected by the
scarcity of skilled and technical manpower and inadequate training programs.
Insufficient industrial and vocational training facilities at the secondary
school level, the absence of formal technician training programs at the
post-secondary level, inadequate in-service industrial training programLs and
the lack of an integrated national industrial training system are important
factors contributing to the low level of labor productivity. The proposed
project would assist the Goveriment to improve the quality and increase the
number of skilled workers and junior technicians and strengthen the management
and planning capacity of the Ministry of Education. The other areas mentioned
above are being addressed through ongoing Bank lending at the post-secondary
level (para 39).
35.      The responsibility for pre-service training of skilled manpower and
junior technicians rests almost entirely with the Ministry of Education
(MOE). The Department of Technical and Vocational Education under the MOE
oversees 316 secondary-level industrial schools where some 142,000 students
are enrolled in three and four year training programs. During the evenings,
these schools also provide adult training programs for upgrading industrial
skills, and some schools are used as apprenticeship training centers.
36.      Manpower demand projections over the next decade indicate that there
will be an annual shortage of about 10,000 skilled workers and junior
technicians (about 14 percent of the total annual demand). The main
objectives of the Government for the industrial schools system are to expand
the capacity of these schools to meet the country's manpower requirements,
particularly in the manufacturing and exporting sectors, and to upgrade
existing and develop new training programs. The Fifth Five-Year Development
Plan (1985-89) estimates an increase in total enrollment in the industrial
schools from 142,000 to 220,000, or an expansion of its share of total
secondary school enrollment from 17 to 24 percent, over the Plan period.
1/ "Turkey: Industrialization and Trade Strategy" (No. 3641-TU), dated
February 18, 1982.



- 12 -
37.      A number of areas for improvement in the efficiency of the secondary
industrial schools system have been identified during the dialogue with the
Government. These include curriculum development and upgrading, coordination
between schools and le-al industries, and cost control and cost recovery.
Although the present curricula are basically sound, curricula for some trade
specializations require upgrading and new programs have to be developed to
meet current industrial manpower needs. The Government is introducing
necessary reforms in the curricula, one result of which is a shortened
teaching week. This would facilitate better programming of classroom time
without reducing the utilization of equipment. Instructor training is also
required for the new and upgraded training programs.  In addition, the
industrial schools system lacks access to modern technical textbooks, and the
general availability of modern reference textbooks is limited.
The Bank's Role in Education and Industrial Training
38.      Bank lending in the education and training sector supports the
Government's objective of improving industrial labor productivity, a key input
into Turkey's economic development strategy. Bank participation in the sector
began in 1971 with a $13.5 million loan to the Government for an Education
Project (Loan 748-TU). This project provided equipment to 32 technical
secondary four-year schools, a technical teacher training college, the
Educational Science Equipment Production Center, and the Education, Film,
Radio and Television Center. It also included the construction and provision
of equipment for twelve trade schools, six adult training centers and a
Management fraining InstiEute. The Project Performance Audit Report (No.
4018) dated June 28, 1982 aoted that the educational impact of the project on
secondary technical schools was considerable, with project equipment well used
and maintained and with enrollments in these schools close to the projected
levels. However, there were delays in the construction of new buildings. The
reports highlighted a number of problems such as poor design and construction
of school buildings and the lack of an effective project implementation unit.
The experience gained from the Education Project has been taken into account
in the design of the proposed project by establishment of a Project
Implementation Unit with well-defined terms of reference; furthermore, the
project does not call for the construction of new facilities.
39.      The Bank also made a loan of $36.8 million in 1984 for an Industrial
Training Project (Loan 2399-TU), which aims at establishing post-secondary
technician training under the Council of Higher Education and providing
in-service training for technicians and professionals through the Industrial
Training and Development Center. It also includes fellowship training for
staff of the State Institute of Statistics responsible for the compilation and
analysis of data. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. In
addition to these loans, the Bank has supported industrial training indirectly
through loans to specific industrial sub-sectors and to branches of industry
which have included project or sector-related training. Bank lending
operations in the past few years having a component of this type include loans
for the textile, sugar, steel and copper industries, as well as power
generation and small- and mediunr-scale industries.



-- 13 -
PART IV - THE PROJECT
40.      The proposed project was identified during a July 1984 mission and
appraised in December 1984. Loan negotiations took place in Washington, D.C.
from April 9 to April 15, 1985 with a Turkish delegation headed by Mr. Tunc
Bilget, Chief Financial and Economic Counselor of the Embassy of the Republic
of Turkey, and including representatives of HOE, the State Planning
Organization and the Undersecretariat for the Treasury and Foreign Trade.  A
report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Turkey: Industrial Schools Project"
(No. 5482-TU) dated April 15, 1985 is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors.  A summary of the proposed project is provided at the
beginning of this rep.art and Annex III contains supplementary project data.
Project Objectives
41.      The scarcity of skilled and technical manpower and the poor quality
of industrial training programs have been major factors contributing to the
low level of labor productivity in Turkish industry. A key objective for the
Government is to improve labor productivity, with particular emphasis on
manufacturing and expcrt industries. The proposed project is consistent with
this strategy and complements initiatives taken under the Bank's Industrial
Training Project (Loan 2399-TU) to establish technician training programs at
the post-secondary level. It aims at improving the quality and increasing the
supply of skilled manpower and junior technicians. It would also strengthen
the management and planning capacity of the Ministry of Education and would
help to develop, on a national level, appropriate curricula and new training
programs for industrial training at the secondary school level.
Project Description
42.      The project consists of the following main components:
(i)   provision of equipment and refurbishment for 39 industrial
schools;
(ii)  technical assistance for curriculum and program development,
including a specialist to assist in project management and
overseas fellowship training for instructors;
(iii) translation and production of educational materials and
technical assistance for textbook translation, design and
production; and
(iv)  special studies in program development as well as for cost
control and recovery in the industrial schools system.
These components are described further below.



- 14 -
43.      Industrial Schools Facilities.  The project would provide equipment,
furniture and minor refurbishment for 39 industrial schools, selected on the
basis of support received from local industry and the adequacy of existing
school facilities. The project would include re-equipping more than 3,600
student places and would create close to the same number of new training
places. As a result of the project, total enrollment in these schools would
increase by about 9,000, producing some 2,500 additional graduates annually
from 1991.
44.      Curriculum and Program Development.  The project would include about
66 man-months of expert services to improve curricula and training materials
for three existing trade specializations (electronics, machine tools and
computer science) including introducing these specializations to schools not
presently providing this type of training; to develop curricula and training
materials in four trade specializations new to the industrial schools program
(pneumatics and industrial hydraulics, control and instrumentation,
telecommunications and marine electronics); and to develop in-service training
programs in these specializations. The project would also provide 680
man-months of fellowship training for 75 instructors required for these new
and upgraded training programs. An additional six months of fellowship
training for one instructor in curriculum development would also be included
under the project. Assurances have been obtained that consultants would be
employed and arrangements made for the fellowship training program by
March 31, 1986, in accordance with a program and timetable acceptable to the
Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03).
45.      Strong links with industry have been developed at most project
schools through active School Advisory Committees which include
representatives from the MOE and local industries. In addition, five national
Trade Advisory Committees have already been established to advise the MOE on
appropriate curricula and program development. In order to improve industrial
links and to sharpen the focus of industrial training programs, School
Advisory Committees, with terms of reference and representation acceptable to
the Bank, would be established at all project supported schools by
September 30, 1986 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(a)). Trade Advisory
Committees, with terms of reference and representation acceptable to the Bank,
would be created by September 30, 1986 for the new trade specializations
included under the project (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(b)). In addition, in
order to ensure the relevance of training programs to industrial manpower
requirements, the Government would complete, by December 31, 1989, an
employment follow-up study of graduates from a number of selected industrial
schools (Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
46.      The proposed project would also include one specialist in project
management, equipment procurement and program planning for a period of two
years. This specialist would work with the Undersecretary of the Department
of Technical and Vocational Education and the Director of the Project
Implementation Unit (para. 49). An additional 24 man-months of fellowship
training would be distributed amongst nine staff of the Directorate of
Technical and Vocational Education (DTVE) to improve their abilities in
project management, school management and equipment planning.



- 15 -
47.      Textbook Translation and Producrion.  In order to provide the
industrial schools system with current reterence and training materials, about
fifty international technical textbooks would be translated into Turkiqh and
printed for distribution using MOE printing faciiities. The project would
cover copyright acquisition fees and WO1ld include about six man-months of
specialist services to assist the Goverament with copyright acquisition and
textbook production.  In addition, fellowship training of six months' duration
in textbook translation, design and printing for one DTVE staff member would
be provided to strengthen the DTVE's inEtitutional capacity in these areas.
48.      Special Studies.  Approximately lb man-months of expert services
would be provided to carry out studies on such areas as future program
development, computer-aided learning and commercial and adult training
programs. The project would also include four man-months of expert services
for a study on cost control and cost recovery for the industrial schools
system.
Project Implementation
49.      A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been established under the
Department of Technical and Vocational Education. A Project Director has been
appointed and a procurement officer, accountant, educational adviser and data
processor are being hired. The PIU would coordinate the work of the three
Directorates responsible for technical and vocational education programs,
refurbishment of industrial schools and equipment procurement. Assurances
have been obtained that the Project Implementation Unit would be maintained
with terms of reference and staffing acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.01(b)).
Project Costs and Financing
50.      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at $72.7
million. The proposed loan of $57.7 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component or 79 percent of total project costs. The
Goverrment would finance the balance of project costs.  Equipment and goods
imported for use by government ministries are exempt from taxes and duties. A
physical contingency allowance of 10 percent ($5.4 million) has been added to
the cost of all project items. Price contingencies, amounting to $13.7
million or about 23 percent of the base cost plus physical contingencies,
assume international inflation rates of 5 percent in 1985, 7.5 percent in
1986, 8 percent in 1987 through 1990, and 5 percent thereafter. Total
contingencies are $19.1 million or about 36 percent of the base cost.
Technical assistance costs for specialist services include salaries, housing,
relDcation and international travel costs as well as the costs of local
services such as local travel, subsistence, recruitment and overhead.
51.      The incremental recurrent costs generated by the additional
recruitment of training instructors over the life of the project is estimated
at $3.3 million equivalent, or about four percent of the 1984 recurrent budget
for industrial schools, and 0.25 percent of the 1984 MOE budget. These
incremental costs would be offset, in whole or in part, by the savings



- 16 -
resulting from the MOE's plans for curriculum reform which include a reduction
in the teaching week from fifty to forty hours. The overall impact of the
project on the recurrent budget would likely be neutral or favorable as a
result of these measures.
Procurement and Disbursement
52.      Procurenment would be carried out on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB) except:
(i)   refurbishment of existing buildings (totalling $0.7 million)
and the provision of furniture (totalling t1.2 million), which
are not to be financed by the Bank, would be carried out under
local contracts in accordance with local procedures;
(ii)  equipment bid packages estimated to cost less than $100,000
equivalent and aggregating to a maximum of $5.0 million, which
are not expected to interest foreign suppliers because of Lhe
variety of the contents of each package, would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally, in
accordance with local procurement procedures acceptable to the
Bank;
(iii) sundry itemr not exceeding $50,000 in each contract and
aggregating a maximum of $1.0 million equivalent would be
purchased on the basis of a minimum of three quotations;
(iv)  books and copyright privileges, estimated to cost less than
$0.8 million, would be obtained through negotiations with
publishers; and
(v)   translation and printing of educational materials, totalling
about $3.5 million, which would not be financed by the Bank,
would be carried out by the MOE.
Technical assistance for consultants would be obtained in accordance with Bank
guidelines.

a/  Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts, in $ million
equivalent, to be financed by the Bank. Total costs include contingencies.
53.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against:  100 percent of
foreign expenditures and 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory prices)
for equipment and materials (excluding furniture); 65 percent of local
expenditures for off-the-shelf equipment and educational materials (excluding
furniture); 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of foreign consultant
services and overseas fellowships; and 85 percent of the total cost of local
consultants. The disbursement percentage for local consultants is calculated
to be approximately equivalent to the percentage resulting from covering the
foreign exchange costs of foreign consultancy contracts. The proposed loan
would include retroactive financing of up to $0.4 million to cover costs
incurred after January 1, 1985 for office equipment and specialist services
4         necessary for expediting start-up of the project.  Because the proposed
project is in an advanced stage of preparation and involves virtually no civil
works, the implementation period would be seven years with disbursements
expected to be completed by December 31, 1992. In order to ensure that Turkey
would have ready access to foreign exchange, a Special Account would be
established in the Central Bank of Turkey into which an initial deposit of
$2.0 million would be paid. The Special Account would be replenished against
withdrawal applications as appropriate or when the undisbursed balance of the
Account is equal to 50 percent or less of the amount of the initial deposit.
Withdrawal applications would be supported by appropriate documentation.
Accounting and Audit
54.       The Government would maintain adequate records and accounts of
expenditure under the project and would prepare a detailed report of financial
activities of the project on a quarterly basis, in an agreed format, to be



- 18 -
submitted to the Bank within 45 days after the end of each quarter. An
external audit would be carried out and annual audit reports would be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year (Loan
Agreement, Section 4.01). For this purpose, the Bank's guidelines on
financial reporting would be followed.
Benefits and Risks
55.       The proposed project would improve the quality and increase the
supply of skilled manpower and junior technicians, and would produce some
2,500 additional graduates annually from 1991. It would increase access to
training for low income-level groups in outlying provinces and is expected to
result in an increase in the enrollment of women in the indusCrial schools
system from the present four percent to twelve percent. It would also
strengthen the management and planning capacity of the MOE and would help
develop appropriate curricula and new training programs in the industrial
schools.
56.       There are no significant risks attached to the project.  In order to
ensure that quality is maintained in the industrial schools program, School
Advisory Committees and Trade Advisory Committees would be strengthened.
Special attention would be given to the in-service training of instructors,
and a follow-up study of graduates would be undertaken. From the perspective
of project implementation, the Government has established a PIU and appointed
a well qualified director. Early preparation work undertaken by the PIU has
been of a high standard, and implementation is well advanced for a project at
this stage.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMAENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of special interest are listed in Annex III of this
Report. There are no special conditions of loan effectiveness.
58.       1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
