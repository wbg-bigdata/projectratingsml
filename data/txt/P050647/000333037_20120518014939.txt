H. Restructuring

The project was extended three times for a total of four years. There was no other formal
restructuring.




I. Disbursement Profile
1.           Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project (UPWSRP) was designed to initiate a
comprehensive, integrated, reform-based and sequenced investment program of support to
effectively develop and manage the water sector and irrigation and drainage subsector. The
design was consistent with the World Bank’s India Country Strategy (CAS) discussed by the
Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on April 5, 2001. A principle of the CAS was to focus on
states that were implementing wide-ranging reform programs. Uttar Pradesh (UP), one of the
poorest states in India, had embarked on an extensive program of overall fiscal, governance and
sector reforms. The UPWSRP was to be the first phase of a long-term program (12-15 years) for
socially and environmentally sustainable development of the water resources of the state in
general and of irrigation and drainage management in particular. Of the many reform programs
initiated at the time of appraisal, this program in the water sector is the only operation that
remains in Uttar Pradesh.

Given the enormous size of the water sector in UP, any effective program to reform the sector and
modernize the irrigation and drainage systems would have to be large to have an impact. The
magnitude of the investment program is indicated by the fact that the "piloting" reform options in
UPWSRP cover an area of more than 300,000 ha, which was only 3% of the entire irrigated area
in the state.

UPWSRP was to contribute directly to and strengthen the overall fiscal and governance reform
program in UP through measures designed for institutional restructuring and right-sizing and
improving performance of the UP Irrigation Department (UPID) together with pricing reforms in
the water sector. Such measures were to be complemented by user participation, agricultural
linkages and private-sector participation in the irrigated agriculture sector. Reforms in the
irrigation sector were considered crucial for the success of the overall reform program in UP,
given the fiscal burden imposed by irrigation on the exchequer. The main water sector issues at
appraisal were:

     (i)        Lack of effective institutional coordination
     (ii)       Inadequate mechanisms and knowledge base for planning, allocating, developing,
                and managing water resources in each river basin taking into account social and
                environmental issues
     (iii)      Lack of an appropriate legal, regulatory and administrative framework for a
                financially sustainable water sector

The main irrigation and drainage sub-sector issues were:

     (i)        Lack of effective user participation and private sector involvement leading to poor
                services, heavy subsidies and lack of accountability
     (ii)       Low productivity of water due to the unreliable irrigation supply and inadequate
                extension services
     (iii)      Lack of critical management skills, particularly in the technical organizations that are
                expected to manage water and provide improved water services in the future
     (iv)       Large establishment costs in the sub-sector that take up a substantial portion of the
                state budget leaving only a small and inadequate amount for maintenance



                                                     1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original PDO is (i) to set up an enabling institutional and policy framework for water sector
reform in the State for integrated water resources management; and (ii) to initiate irrigation and
drainage sub-sector reforms in the State to increase and sustain water and agricultural
productivity.
The key performance indicators of UPWSRP, as described on page 2 of the PAD, are:
1. Establishment and operationalization of the following institutions for integrated water
   resources planning and management:

        a. State level: State Water Resources Agency (SWaRA), State Water Resources Data
           and Analysis Center (SWaRDAC), State Water Tariff Regulatory Commission
           (SWaTReC);
        b. Basin level: Ghagra-Gomti Basin Entity;
        c. Sub-basin level: Development and Management boards in two selected sub-basins.

    Operationalization would be indicated by the preparation and use of environmentally
    sustainable basin/sub-basin development plans to guide future investments, rationalized tariff
    setting and community-led management of village water resources in the selected sub-basins.
2. Business process re-engineering including right-sizing of the UPID and establishment and
   effective use of modern information management systems (MIS). Right-sizing would be
   indicated by elimination of redundant staff and introduction of modern skills and tools.
3. Modernized operation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure covering about 300,000 ha in
   selected sub-basins with agricultural intensification and diversification.
4. Operation and management of irrigation system of at least one distributary in the selected
   sub-basins by the private sector including the formation and operationalization of 600 water
   user associations for participatory irrigation management.
5. Increases in stakeholder income levels with improved equity in distribution of incomes in the
   selected sub-basins.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The PDO and key indicators were not formally revised during implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The PAD (p13) identified a primary target group of 47,000 farm families, who would be moved
above the poverty line by increasing agricultural production. In addition, all other farmers in the
project area (about 498,000) would be direct beneficiaries. Landless agricultural labor households
would gain employment opportunities in the irrigated farm holdings.

1.5 Original Components

The components, which remained substantially unchanged during the project, were:




                                                2
Component A: Creation of Apex Water Institutions and Strengthening Social and
Environmentally Sustainable Multi-sectoral Water Resources Planning, Allocation and
Management Capacity (US$12.27 million, including contingencies). This component was the
first PDO and supported the setting up and putting into operation of SWaRA, SWaRDAC,
SWaTReC and the Ghagra-Gomti Basin Development and Management Entity (GGBDME).

Component B: Irrigation Department Reform, Capacity Building and Business Process Re-
engineering (US$38.52 million). This component was to initiate measures required to rationalize
and streamline the manner in which irrigation and drainage investments are planned,
implemented, managed, operated and monitored. This was to involve institutional reform, UPID
capacity-building and business process re-engineering, including the introduction of a
computerised management information system (MIS).

Component C: Piloting Reform Options in Water Resources Management (US$9.35
million). This component sought to operationalize the concept of integrated water resources
management in a basin framework with decentralized basin development and management
institutions. Given the large number of river basins in UP, it was considered appropriate to begin
in selected sub-basins supported by demonstration pilots, involving the creation and strengthening
of the Jaunpur Branch Sub-basin Development and Management Board (JBSDMB) and the
Imamganj Branch Sub-basin Development and Management Board (IBSDMB), development of
Decision Support Systems (DSS) through information systems and modelling for socially and
environmentally sustainable optimal water resources management in the JBS and IBS, rainwater
harvesting and piloting canal-based small hydro development.

Component D: Piloting Reform Options in Irrigation and Drainage Operations (US$100.19
million). This component was to put into operation the concepts and provide the necessary
investments for (i) reliable delivery of water, measured and supplied on an appropriate volumetric
basis to improve system performance, cost-recovery and the accountability of the service
provider, (ii) effective drainage network operation and management and conjunctive use to assist
in effective water management, (iii) an outcome-oriented approach with integrated sustainable
agricultural intensification and diversification and private sector participation to complement
effective water management, and (iv) unbundled operational management of the irrigation and
drainage systems, including participatory user management and private sector participation. The
component was to involve rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigation and drainage systems
in about 300,000 ha, agricultural intensification and diversification, piloting replicable
management options for irrigation and drainage systems operations and agricultural
diversification.

Component E: Feasibility Studies and Preparation Activities for the Next Phase (US$6.12
million).

Component F: Project Activities Coordination (US$7.25 million). The project activities were
to be coordinated by a multi-disciplinary Project Activities Core Team (PACT). This component
was designed to assist the PACT with its role in facilitating and guiding the implementation and
monitoring of all project activities, ensuring synergy and coordination amongst activities and
agencies implementing these activities, preparing consolidated reports and facilitating training.

The proposed components are described in more detail in Annex 2, which also describes the
outputs from each component.

1.7 Significant Changes

Following an Indian Ocean tsunami on December 26, 2004, the Bank developed an emergency
rehabilitation project for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, financed from forecast savings from 15
active lending operations in India. The UPWSRP reallocated SDR26.53 million (US$40 million
equivalent) to the new emergency project, based on forecasted savings while maintaining the
original project targets. Despite this reallocation, a formal restructuring of the project was not
needed due to depreciation of the USD against the SDR. The closing date was extended three
times for a total of four years to October 31, 2011, along with minor reallocation of funds across
components. At closure, the remaining undisbursed IDA credit of US$5.1 million was cancelled.
During project implementation the objectives and components remained relevant. However,
there were minor changes in the subcomponents, e.g. the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)
was not adopted by the Government of Uttar Pradesh and the canal-based hydro-electric
development (small investments of less than US$1M) was not taken up. Rehabilitation of the
Haidergarh branch canal (0 to 23 km) (CCA 20,287 ha) was added after the Imamganj Branch
canal (CCA 22,000 ha) was omitted due to the restriction from the Government of India to do
survey and design work in an area that is close to the border with Nepal.


2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The rationale for Bank involvement was strong and the PAD comprehensively analyzed the
background issues to justify the Bank’s intervention. At the time of preparation, the GoUP was
implementing wide-ranging reform programs and the project was designed to leverage this
reform-minded government. The PAD drew well on lessons from earlier projects and
incorporated a wide range of activities to take advantage of this reform-minded government with
the hope of making large gains in one of the poorest states in India. However, the design
overestimated the speed with which contracts for critical aspects such as survey and design could
be awarded.
Assessment of Project Design. The PDOs were reasonably clear (see 2.3), realistic and important
for the sector and focused on outcomes for which the project could reasonably be held
accountable. The project had four main components, divided into 15 sub-components, almost
entirely in the UPID. There was a comparatively large construction component (Component D,
58% of project costs) providing an incentive to the Government of UP (GoUP) and UPID to
adopt the project and therefore implement the non-structural components such as Apex Water
Institutions and UPID reforms (e.g. business process re-engineering). The project was intended as
the first phase in a long-term (12 to 15 years) program to allow time for water planning and
management on the basis of river basins to become fully rooted.
Government commitment was demonstrated during project preparation by the adoption by GoUP
in 1999 of the State Water Policy, which gives the framework for much of the institutional
aspects of the project, some initial UPID reforms, including some computerization, an Executive
Order for WUAs in January 2001 and an Executive Order setting up SWaRA, a body to act as the
technical secretariat to State Water Board (established 1996).
Risks identified at appraisal were substantial: waning political commitment by GoUP, overall
reforms in UP being derailed and impacting on UPWSRP, political instability in the state, reforms
not penetrating throughout UPID, inability to unbundle ID operations, failure of operationalizing
integrated water resources management, inadequate operating funds for the MIS component,



                                                4
inadequate funds for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation and drainage
infrastructure, failure to mainstream intensification and diversification of agriculture, failure to
establish adequate incentives for long term viability of WUAs, weak institutional commitments to
the change process, failure to maintain adequate coordination arrangements, GoUP failing to meet
timely and adequate counterpart funding obligations, VRS-related risks, lack of willingness of
stakeholders to participate. These risks were well identified and the mitigation measures put in
place were executed as effectively as possible. However, many of the pre-identified risks have
impacted the project implementation.
Quality at entry was not measured by the Quality Assurance Group. The ICR rating is
Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

a) Factors outside the control of Government and the Implementing Agency
Following the tsunami in December 2004, $40 million (SDR26.53 million) was released from the
Credit.
b) Factors generally subject to Government control
There was considerable political uncertainty in the early years of the project following state
elections in April 2002 and six months of President’s Rule from Delhi. There were frequent
changes during implementation of the Chairman of PACT, resulting in delay in making important
decisions. There have been 19 Chairmen (Project Director) during the project. This lack of
continuity in leadership has been a major reason for the substantial delays observed during the
implementation of the project.
c) Factors generally subject to implementing agency control.
Construction was delayed by awarding the contract for topographical survey about eight months
after the dated planned for the start of construction. There were substantial delays in the
procurement of civil works, aggravated by a lack of suitable contractors to bid for large contracts,
resulting in contracts having to be rebid and/or broken down into smaller contracts. Although
some work started in 2006, most of the construction contracts did not start until 2007, shortly
before the original closing date of the Credit. Work on the retendered contract for branch canals
did not start till 2008. Though construction was substantially complete by 2010, some works (at
Haidergarh head regulator and new gates for heads of minors) will continue beyond the end of the
project. Some institutional milestones were only reached after the original closing date of the
Credit.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation - Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: There are few quantitative targets in the PAD. For instance, in the PAD (pg 20-22) it
states that baseline data collected during preparation and implementation prior to beginning work
on each intervention would be used to assess project impacts. Considerable attention was paid in
the PAD (pg 30) to monitoring social development outcomes.

Implementation: Monitoring physical and financial progress was generally satisfactory. The
monitoring of agricultural benefits during the project was not satisfactory. To improve the
project’s ability to measure results, during implementation the project initiated an impact
assessment in 2009. The PACT organized baseline, initial and final impact assessment studies of
the project benefits. However, these studies lacked proper guidance, supervision and monitoring
to ensure a project-specific approach to objectively assess the project impacts. The baseline and


                                                 5
impact assessments had some limitation regarding data coverage, quality and analysis. For ICR
analysis, project benefits are quantified based on PACT in-house data covering irrigated area,
cropping intensity, crop yields and technology adoption with 2008/09 as the end-of-project
reference year for agriculture-related impacts. For the control area, administrative block level data
was used for the period covering the baseline and end of project to assess the productivity
changes (See Annex 3). A key feature of the modernization of the irrigation system was to have
been the reliable delivery of water, measured and supplied on a volumetric basis. The
introduction of new measuring gates at the heads of minor canals is an important step towards this
but measurements in some branch canals are not satisfactory. While there is no reason to doubt
the measurements at the head of the Jaunpur branch canal, those at the head of the Haidergarh
branch canal appear to have failed to take account of the changing cross-sectional area due to
siltation in the branch canal.

Utilization: Monitoring of physical and financial progress was used in regular project reports.
Monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the project area has been carried out since 2005 and
all automatic piezometers were functioning up to 2010. Only 134 of the 500 were reported
working in October 2011. Much of the information collected by the MIS is used for regular
management but much, such as that collected by the irrigation and water management module, is
not used. The MIS has the capability to collect a large amount of data, which could be, but has
not been, used to evaluate project performance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

At appraisal, the safeguard policies triggered by the project were Environmental Assessment, Pest
Management and Project on International Waters. A waiver for notification of riparian states was
provided by the regional vice-president. Only compliance with the environmental safeguard has
raised concerns during project implementation, mainly having to do with the removal of silt
deposited in canals. Suitable clauses were inserted in contracts to ensure satisfactory disposal of
the silt. The Social and Environmental Management Plan (SEMP) was undertaken at the time of
preparation and, in conjunction with the Basin Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA), laid
out the issues and targets for the project as described in the PAD. The project made significant
progress on the key issues through building awareness of environmental issues and improving the
knowledge base and institutional capacity within the department and through the water user
associations (WUAs) among the farmers. For irrigation and drainage reform, the SEA and SEMP
outlined issues related to limited knowledge of integrated pest management, soil fertility and
nutrient management, lack of attention to drainage, lack of diversification and little modernization
of tools and techniques. Consultation and rehabilitation issues were also identified. Generally
most of these aspects were adequately covered within the project with numerous studies, plans,
demonstrations and training materials being developed (see Annex 2; Outputs by component).
There were no issues of resettlement in the project.

Procurement: Throughout the project there were substantial delays due to slow procurement. The
procurement post review found that contract management and understanding of Bank
procurement procedures were weak at the PACT and UPID division levels. Follow-up actions
relating to procurement post-review findings were slow with regard to major issues relating to
inappropriate application of post-qualification criteria and bad quality road construction. The
project did not publish award decisions on its web site. The quality of construction, particularly
concrete and brick lining of canals, despite the presence of third party consultants, has been called
into question. The Bank withheld expenditure on substandard work until it was brought to a
standard acceptable to the Bank.



                                                 6
Financial Management: The financial management (FM) rating on the project ranged from
Satisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory for most of the period of the credit. Receipt of audit
reports was usually delayed by one to four months. The FM arrangements resulted in timely
availability of funds, but variation in the arrangements were partially responsible for the
following systemic issues: (a) persistent weaknesses in internal controls (advances to WUAs
remained unadjusted for long periods of time; weak contract management; senior management
not paying adequate attention to audit findings; weak monitoring of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) etc.); (b) resolution of FM weaknesses was very mechanical and paper
based and thus ineffective; (c) responses to FM weaknesses pointed out by the Bank were delayed
in many instances.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

As the project was designed as part of a long term development program, one component was to
prepare Phase 2, for which a detailed project report and implementation plan (PIP) have been
prepared. Contracts have been let for a social and environmental assessment for the Phase 2 area
and for survey and design of the works for the first year of the proposed Phase 2 project. UPID
and WUAs will continue operating and maintaining the irrigation system. Despite the success in
the first phase of initiating the irrigation sub-sector reform of participatory irrigation management,
there is still need for improvement and strengthening of both UPID and WUAs. The UPID
operation of the branch and distributary canals encourages the deposition of silt in the system.
This is expensive to remove. WUAs need strengthening to gain experience in estimating their
water requirements and requesting water by volume 2, dealing with shortfalls in water supply,
maintaining minor canals and constructing field channels. They will require assistance in the
future, and sustainability is more likely with continued support from a Phase 2 project (as was
conceived in the original design and discussed in the PAD e.g. 15 year reform program).

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project objectives of setting up an enabling institutional and policy framework for water
sector reforms and initiating irrigation and drainage subsector reforms continue to be highly
relevant and are aligned with the six priority reforms3 of the water sector in the CAS of FY 2009-
12. Agriculture will continue to play an important role in alleviating poverty in UP and given the
strong impact that irrigation has on agricultural productivity and growth, the continued reform


2 This will be helped by orifice modules, acoustic flow measuring equipment and other modernization
provided by the project.
3 These six reforms on page 15 of the CAS include: 1) enabling water policies and institutional and legal
frameworks to improve stewardship of the resource; 2) inter-sectoral approaches at the basin level that
integrate surface water with groundwater; 3) restructuring of public sector institutions (including through
capacity building and the strategic realignment of incentive structures and skills mixes) and the
establishment of new institutions (including regulatory authorities, water users associations, river basin
agencies, and public private partnerships); 4) decentralized and participatory service delivery mechanisms,
with a particular focus on improving customer/user service, enhancing accountability and transparency, and
extending service to the poor; 5) modern management practices and technology applications, including
improved operations and maintenance through asset management planning, and the development of a
comprehensive knowledge base and decision support tools; and 6) financial sustainability of resource
management and service delivery through rational charges and tariffs and improved financial management,
including removing distorting subsidies and moving towards user charges that reflect at least O&M costs.


                                                    7
and investment in the sector remains a priority. The core design principles of policy reforms and
investments in infrastructure are important to bring about the modernized irrigation systems that
the project set out to achieve. The project implementation was improved by the role of PACT,
which was originally designed to function as a coordinating agency but took on some of the roles
of an implementing agency during implementation due to reporting structures that were not
functioning properly. This improved the implementation of the project; however, the ownership
of UPID was affected.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The key performance indicators are shown on page 2 of the PAD.

PDO (1): To set up an enabling institutional policy framework for water sector reform in
the state for integrated water resources management

By encouraging GoUP to (i) adopt the State Water Policy (during project preparation), (ii) pass
the UP Water Management Regulatory Commission (UPWaMReC) Act 2008 and (iii) the
Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) Act 2009 and (iv) establish SWaRA and SWaRDAC,
the project has successfully assisted in establishing an institutional and policy framework for
water sector reform and water resources management in the state. This is a significant
achievement. SWaRA and SWaRDAC collect surface water, groundwater and water-use data
amongst other information and generate specific studies and knowledge products requested by the
State. Some of this analysis will be used for basin planning in the GGB and other basins. In
addition, SWaRDAC maintains and updates a comprehensive database on the project areas to
fulfill its mandate as the institution to collate, verify, analyze and disseminate information for all
aspects of integrated water resources management and to provide assistance in basin planning.
The professionals in these institutions come from a wide range of sector disciplines. Currently
SWaRA and SWaRDAC reside within UPID. In order to operate successfully as the state apex
water institutions for knowledge and analysis on integrated water resources management, they
should eventually become independent. When UPWaMReC becomes operational, SWaRA and
SWaRDAC will operate as independent organizations under the jurisdiction of, and be the
technical secretariat for, UPWaMReC. UPWaMReC has been established in principle with the
appointment of the Chairman but it has not yet begun to function as a regulatory commission with
the requisite staff and resources. The GGBDME has not yet been formed, though a social and
environmental assessment report and an environmental management plan for the GG basin have
been prepared as part of a decision support system tool and were used in a GG Basin
Development and Management Plan by SWaRA in 2009. The Jaunpur Branch Sub-basin
Development and Management Board (JBSDMB) was constituted by Government Order in
October 2003 and is working. There has been no progress on rationalized tariff setting. Bearing in
mind the success of SWaRA and SWaRDAC, the establishment of UPWaMREC and JBSDMB,
the achievement of this objective is Moderately Satisfactory.

PDO (2): To initiate irrigation and drainage sub-sector reforms in the state to increase and
sustain water and agricultural productivity

The introduction of modern information management systems in UPID has been fairly successful
with 2157 desktop computers and 153 laptops supplied to UPID. The establishment and effective
use of modern MIS have been successful in some respects (see Annex 2). Local area and wide
area networks and e-mail systems are operational connecting 189 locations throughout UP. The
irrigation and water management MIS module relies on input material from divisional offices,
only one of which so far is doing this fully. Most of the other project divisional offices make


                                                  8
some returns but most non-project divisions do not. Moreover, the reduction in UPID staff by
natural attrition is 22% of planned. The rightsizing that was expected to take place under the
government run Voluntary Retirement Scheme was less than expected because the government
never went forward with its own program. The project put in place modernized management
systems to encourage the continued reduction of staff. This is a minor shortcoming in light of the
overall modernization of UPID under the project. In total, these may be considered moderate
shortcomings, so the rating for this sub-component is Moderately Satisfactory.

Modern topographical survey equipment (including 56 total survey stations) and other modern
equipment and software have been supplied to UPID, including 884 groundwater monitoring
wells (piezometers), 26 automatic weather stations, five acoustic flow measurement devices, and
extensive training on all of these devices (See Annex 2). Exposure to new approaches to
measurement has been a positive experience. However, the need for maintenance and
replacement of ageing equipment has not been fully taken into account. Computers purchased in
2006 are now getting to the end of their useful life. A shortcoming is that appreciable numbers of
automatic piezometers, weather stations and acoustic flow-measuring devices are non-functional
in some places and contracts for their maintenance are not in place. As a result, the rating for this
sub-component is Moderately Satisfactory.

The modernization of irrigation and drainage has been only partially successful. The introduction
of 41 duckbill weirs, four rebuilt cross-regulators on the Jaunpur branch canal and a new cross
regulator on a distributary and other structures have significantly improved the water delivery in
some places but there is still need for much more improvement to the system. An ongoing
contract for the supply and installation of flow control and measuring gates (“orifice modules?) at
the heads of 150 minors should help with the control and measurement of the flow in minors. The
large amount of silt entering the system is a cause for concern. There is a major management
issue in maintaining flow rates, removing silt and finding disposal sites for the silt removed 4. This
was identified as a concern at project preparation and a study to find a way to improve the
situation was included in the project. However, this study never materialized. Minor canals are
often in poor condition, particularly in their lower reaches. Maintenance remains of concern.
These are significant shortcomings. The rating for this sub-component is therefore Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

The project has improved drainage by rehabilitating 2369 km of old drains in the Sarda Sahayak
Command area, including the masonry works. Using the land use information (LANDSAT) from
2004/05 and 2008/09, the PACT commissioned study (see Annex 3) calculated the water logged
area and conversion of water logged area into cropped area in the project command area. No
agriculture cropped areas was observed in an area of 28,905 ha which remained water logged
during 2004/05. Water logging persisted in about 7973 ha during 2008/09. Hence, improved
drainage area is estimated at 20932 ha, which is 40% of the PAD projected area. Kharif paddy is
observed in 19770 ha and rabi wheat in 15,020 ha following improved drainage interventions.
Incremental benefits due to improved drainage is conservatively estimated at Rs 19,700 per ha of
drained area. The rating for this sub-component is therefore Satisfactory.




4 The feeder canal at the head of the system is closed whenever the silt content of the water exceeds 4,000
parts per million. Since the start of construction in 2006, the number of days that the Jaunpur branch canal
has been closed due to excessive silt or for construction and maintenance needs has increased from an
average of 97 days (2002 to 2005) to 166 days (2007 to 2010).


                                                      9
The passing of the PIM Act in 2009 and the issue of PIM Rules in 2010 have successfully
established a legal framework to enable user participation in irrigation and drainage operation and
maintenance. PIM cells have been established in divisional offices of UPID. The establishment of
WUAs and the changed attitude of many UPID staff to PIM have initiated irrigation and drainage
subsector reforms in the state. There have been considerable achievements in the establishing of
8858 outlet committees, 805 WUAs (407 for minor canals and 398 for grouped outlets from
distributaries) as well as 28 WUAs at distributary level. Experienced NGOs were deployed at
each division for the task of WUA formation and farmer mobilization and facilitated strong
partnerships between farmers and the UPID. UPID engineers are now considered to be more
accountable for water service delivery to their client farmers and the farmers and their
organizations feel more empowered than they were at project inception. Focus on farmer
mobilization and emphasis on equitable water distribution, inclusion of the disadvantaged and
accountability of the management committees strengthened WUAs. Although many of these
WUAs have been in existence since 2005 or earlier, they have all very recently been reconstituted
under the PIM Act 2009 (formalizing these arrangements). All outlet committees, minor WUAs,
and distributary WUAs have been elected in accordance with the PIM Act 2009 and therefore
most of them have not had the benefit of earlier trainings. Most WUAs do not have the skills or
resources to operate and maintain canals adequately and construct field channels and require
continued support from UPID and any future project. If this support is lacking, there is a risk that
WUAs would wither and the canals continue to deteriorate. For these reasons, the rating for this
sub-component is Moderately Satisfactory.

It is estimated that basin stakeholder income levels in areas where reforms have been piloted have
increased by 78% at 2011 prices due to project interventions. See Annex 3. Irrigation coverage
has not increased as much as originally expected in the PAD. Cropping intensity has increased by
15%, mainly due to the introduction of the zaid5 pulse crops. Double and triple cropped area in
the command area has gone up by 21% after project implementation. Crop productivities of
cereals, oilseed and pulses have also increased by 29% to 54%. The agriculture interventions
included covering 16955 demo farmers for rice and wheat, 7945 demo farmers for zaid green
gram and 800 demo farmers for mustard covering the period/seasons 2006 rabi to 2009 zaid. The
formalized linkage between the agriculture and water sectors has not been successful. Although a
MOU was signed by the project with UP Diversified Agriculture Support Project (DASP) to build
synergies between these departments this was eventually not implemented due to delays in
improving the irrigation infrastructure under WSRP. Moreover, the World Bank withdrew
support to DASP due to a disagreement between the GoUP and the Bank on agriculture
marketing reforms. An attempt to involve the private sector in growing sugar cane resulted in
some pilots but did not succeed in the long term with full private-public partnerships on the
management of irrigation infrastructure. The rating for this sub-component is therefore
Satisfactory.

Equity in distribution of incomes and the breadth of stakeholder participation have improved as
evidenced by the in-house studies. For instance, double-cropped area has increased across head,
middle and tail locations, accounting for 38%, 57% and 5% of the incremental double-cropped
area as documented in the impact assessment conducted by the project in the Jaunpur branch. The
rating for this sub-component is therefore Satisfactory.

    Zaid: third season crop (March to June).




                                                10
Water productivity has increased substantially from an average of 68 ha per million cubic meters
of water (Mm3) at the outlet from the minor canals in kharif in 2002 (0.14 kg of rice per m3) to
324 ha/Mm3 in 2010 (1.3 kg/m3) and from 129 ha/Mm3 in rabi in 2002 (0.33 kg of wheat per m3)
to 292 ha/Mm3 in 2010 (1.1 kg/m3). See Annex 2. Agricultural yields with the project are
estimated to be 29% higher than without the project for paddy, 30% higher for wheat, 40% higher
for pulses and 54% higher for mustard. There has been negligible crop diversification. Cropping
intensity in the project area has increased by about 10% more than outside the project. The
drainage improvements added almost an additional 20,000 ha of previously un-productive lands.
The rating for this sub-component is therefore Moderately Satisfactory.

Taking account of the range of ratings above but giving some extra weight to the legal framework,
the achievement of the second PDO is rated as Moderately Satisfactory and the overall rating for
achievement of the PDO is also Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The estimated overall economic rate of return (ERR) is 17.6% somewhat lower than the PAD
projected ERR of 24.8%. Similarly, the project’s estimated overall financial rate of return (FRR)
is 16.6%, lower than the PAD estimated FRR of 21.9% The estimated economic net present value
(NPV) is Rs. 2,158 M at a discount rate of 12% (same discount rate as in PAD), which is 68%
less than the PAD estimated NPV of Rs. 6,722 M, after adjusting to 2011 constant prices using
price index based inflators. Despite achieving (i) 4% to 18% higher crop productivity for crops
like paddy and pulses, (ii) adoption of improved technologies in 36% of the cropped area and (iii)
increased cropping intensity due to the introduction of zaid pulse crops in the project area, missed
targets in irrigated area (37% less than estimated), crop area diversification (40% less than target)
and wheat and mustard productivity less than target, coupled with delayed implementation of
project interventions, pulled down the rate of return to the project investments. Farm financial
income showed 78% increase in the project benefited farms, which is 26% more than the PAD
target, but the spread of benefits was limited to about 60% of the PAD targeted farmer
beneficiaries. Annex 3 provides more details. Although the ERR is less than estimated at
appraisal, it is appreciably above 12%. Efficiency has therefore been rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

While the relevance is Satisfactory and the achievement of PDO is Moderately Satisfactory the
efficiency rating of Moderately Satisfactory results in an overall outcome rating of Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts: The project benefited about 401,000 farm households by enhancing their
average annual financial income by about Rs 11,325 (in 2011 prices) per ha due to project
interventions. The project has generated about 16,600 jobs, providing sustainable on-farm
employment for about 10% of the landless agricultural laborers in the project area through
irrigated area expansion and agricultural intensification. At 2011 prices, about 40,100 farms with
holding sizes greater than 1.9 ha have moved above the poverty line due to the project
interventions. This is about 15% less than the PAD projected target.




                                                 11
Gender Aspects: Beyond forming self-help groups (SHGs) of women and men who do not own
land and getting them to provide agriculture and allied activity, it has not been possible to involve
such people intensively in WUA and PIM activities under the project. In the neighboring State of
Madhya Pradesh, the PIM Act has been amended to include one man and one woman from every
household as a member of the WUA with equal voting rights. It is proposed to suggest a similar
amendment to the UP PIM Act in due course. With such an amendment, there would be much
enhanced space for women to become active voters, participants and managers of the WUAs and
provide the WUAs the benefit of their practical decision making capability.

Social Development: Since membership of WUAs is constrained by land ownership in the
command area, the project simultaneously focused on formation of men and women SHGs of
those without land in the project command area. Many of these SHGs already existed in the area
formed under other projects including the UP Sodic Land Reclamation Project and the Rural
Women's Development and Empowerment Project. Under this project they were further
strengthened, in many cases with a view to providing input supply, fertilizer and agriculture
equipment to support the farmer members of the WUAs.

Institutional Change/Strengthening: The overall strategy of the project was to link the hydraulic-
boundary-based WUAs effectively with the existing administrative-boundary-based local
government institutions, Gram Panchayats, using the Water Management Committees (WMCs) of
the Gram Panchayats as the lowest basin level equivalents of the Basin Board organization for
integrated water resources management. This linkage between third tier local government
institutions (Gram Panchayats) and the WUAs is and will be the key focus of attention in the
years to come as without a collaborative approach amongst local organizations little will be
achieved. As it is, there is scope for misunderstandings between WUAs, whose role is described
in the PIM Act, and panchayats. In 2004 it was reported that in some minors the District
Magistrate had undertaken maintenance. The ICR mission noted a field channel constructed by a
panchayat without reference to UPID and the WUA. The responsibility for maintenance of drains
is an issue identified in the PAD but not yet resolved in practice.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: Monitoring of groundwater levels in the project area
has been augmented by a network of 884 piezometers (500 with automatic recorders). Analysis of
the data from some of these piezometers by SWaRA (see Annex 2) indicates that there has, in
general, been a lowering of the groundwater level in the project area. Further checking and
analysis would be needed to fully determine whether these impacts were due to improved
drainage, less rainfall, less irrigation, more pumping of groundwater or a combination of these.


4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Many of the risks identified at appraisal could endanger the continued development outcomes,
including:

(i)     WUAs lose their enthusiasm and lack resources for operation and maintenance of canals
        and construction of field channels. Substantial support and assistance is needed for some
        time to come to alleviate this risk. This risk is Moderate.
(ii)    SWaRA, SWaRDAC and UPWaMReC have all been established under the water
        legislation passed in the state. There is, however, a risk to the effectiveness of their
        regulatory and monitoring roles due to the uncertainty of contracted staff and vacancies
        that remain unfilled. This risk is Moderate.



                                                 12
(iii)   Continued siltation in the system unless properly dealt with may undermine the
        performance of the rehabilitated system. Improved operation of canals, including
        corrective measures at the head of the Feeder Canal, could go some way to alleviating
        this risk. The risk of water supply being further curtailed due to continued silt is
        Moderate.
(iv)    Proper operation and maintenance of the improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure
        by UPID continues to be inadequate. This risk is Moderate.
(v)     Computers and other sophisticated equipment are not adequately maintained and updated
        due to scarcity of funds. This seems to be a fact, rather than a risk so it is important that
        funds are made available and equipment is maintained. This risk is Significant.

Overall Rating: Moderate.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The Bank identified, facilitated the preparation of and appraised the project in such a way that the
project was quite likely to achieve the planned development outcomes and was consistent with
the Bank’s fiduciary role. However, 15 critical risks were identified in the PAD (pp32 to 35),
about half of which came to pass and had considerable effect on the project. It is difficult to see
how better these risks could have been avoided, other than by not having the project. The Bank
seriously underestimated the time required for the award of critical contracts, such as for
topographical survey. The Bank performance rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
There are 19 implementation supervision reports (ISRs) recorded in the archives before the ICR
mission, compiled by three different task team leaders. The Bank’s supervision was largely
affected by the high turnover of the PACT Chairman and caused many unforeseen delays along
with the issues that come from this lack of consistency in leadership. The Bank carried out many
missions and had frequent consultation with their PACT counterparts to mitigate these delays.
During implementation the Bank recommended the utilization of a consultancy to carry out an
impact assessment to measure the results of the project. By extending the Credit closing date by
four years the Bank enabled the development objectives to be achieved during the project. The
Bank performance rating for supervision is Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Taking account of the two ratings above the overall Bank performance rating is Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Good features of Government performance included the promulgation of the State Water Policy
during project preparation and the passing of the UPWaMReC Act (2008) and the Participatory
Irrigation Management Act (2009). A sub-basin board has been formed but the basin entity has
not. GOUP failed to ensure continuity of employment of the Chairman of PACT: there were 19




                                                13
during the project. There was a lapse in Government commitment during the early years of the
project. . The rating is therefore Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
The performance of the implementing agency was most affected by the frequent changes of the
Chairman of PACT, resulting in delay in making important decisions. Despite this challenge,
PACT was able to accomplish a significant amount of success with the establishment of WUAs,
implementing the MIS, irrigation and drainage rehabilitation and modernization, and improving
crop yields, among others. The delays seen under the project can be attributed to very slow
procurement, both by PACT and by UPID field staff, aggravated by frequent transfers of staff,
dual charges and unfilled vacancies. The procurement post review found that contract
management and understanding of Bank procurement procedures were weak at the PACT and
division levels. Follow-up actions relating to procurement post review findings were slow with
regard to major issues relating to inappropriate application of post-qualification criteria and bad
quality road construction. The project did not publish award decisions on its web site. Moreover,
even now, claims submitted by a contractor on a contract that was stopped due to lack of progress
in 2007 have not been resolved, despite arbitration and ongoing court proceedings. The quality of
construction, particularly concrete and brick lining of canals, although supervised by UPID and
an international consultant, came in for some criticism. The Bank disallowed expenditure on
substandard work until it was brought up to a standard acceptable to the Bank. Although the
design consultants made recommendations concerning exclusion of silt from the head of the
feeder canal, UPID did nothing.

The FM arrangements on the project extended to the PACT at Lucknow and eight Divisional
Offices in nearby districts. An audit of some 400 WUAs found instances where 1) advances to
WUAs remained unadjusted in accounts at division level: 2) Supporting documents could not be
found and 3) WUAs were not maintaining independent books of accounts. Irregularities were also
found in the accounts of NGOs. Internal audit arrangements suffered from delay in receipt of
audit reports, recurrent audit findings and a lack of attention to audit observations, which were
considered solely as financial management matters rather than being dealt with at the correct level
of management. In light of the overall positive achievements of the project, and despite these
relatively minor shortcomings, the implementing agency’s performance has been Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Taking account of the two ratings above the overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.


6.      Lessons Learned

The project achieved considerable results against what are still very relevant and challenging
objectives to set up an enabling institutional and policy framework for water sector reforms and
initiate irrigation and drainage subsector reforms. The project was to be the first phase of a long-
term program for socially and environmentally sustainable development of the water resources of
the state. Therefore, the lessons learned from this phase should be applied to the design of the
second phase. Some of these lessons generated include:

Rehabilitation and Modernization of the Irrigation and Drainage System
   (a) The sequence of investments for rehabilitation and modernization are important to
        deliver results. The infrastructure investments to introduce control structures (e.g.


                                                14
        duckbill weirs, cross regulators, etc.) and water saving works (e.g. essential canal lining)
        were effective to improve the delivery of water to the minor heads. In interviews with
        farmers during the ICR mission they agreed that more water was being delivered to the
        minor heads, however, supplying water to minor canal left the job half done. Properly
        designed field channels are also necessary for the water to reach the crop. The lesson here
        is that interest to build field channels will be generated at the farm level only once the
        farmer sees that there is more water to utilize. This will increase the willingness for the
        farmer to contribute in-kind to the development of field channels and increase the
        sustainability of the field channel, as opposed to the fully funded government schemes
        (i.e. CADA) which are often plowed over after a season by the farmers.
    (b) The lack of reliability of service delivery from the canals begins with the high
        siltation rates and must be addressed. Due to the high sedimentation it is not possible
        to operate the system at full design flow, particularly during rainy weather when silt loads
        are high, to minimize the deposition of silt in the canals. Operation at full supply level
        would enable canals and field channels with inlets at comparatively high levels to receive
        their designed flow rate. This issue of sedimentation begins at the head of the feeder
        canal and a solution must be taken up, along with the other investments if the problem is
        to be systemically fixed.
    (c) Integration of water and agriculture investments. Good linkages between agriculture
        investments (often carried out by the Department of Agriculture) and irrigation and
        drainage investments (by UPID) would improve agricultural productivity. One way of
        improving this would be to have at least one agricultural officer in each PIM cell in UPID
        district offices.

Participatory Irrigation Management
   (d) Strengthening WUAs. It is critical to include water users in the design and
        implementation of system rehabilitation, to strengthen ownership and impart management
        skills and conflict resolution. This technical know-how for the WUAs will improve the
        formal handover process of fully rehabilitated canals to WUAs before they assume
        responsibility for O&M. This requires substantial long-term effort, much more than the
        limited training that was provided under the project. Democracy being what it is, new
        officers will be elected who have not previously been educated in the requirements of
        their position. It is therefore necessary to have provision for continued strengthening of
        WUA members and officers.
   (e) Consultation during design phase at the outlet level. During the design stage it is
        critical to get the input of farmers to understand the current system of both formal and
        informal outlets within a minor. The technical designs should be discussed by outlet
        committees and the farmers should debate the trade-offs in order to come to agreement
        for how the minor will be operated. This will decrease the risk that illegal cuts will be
        made after the designs are implemented, which in turn compromise the ability of the
        system to deliver the proper allocation of water to all the outlets.
   (f) O&M contract management by WUAs to increase transparency and accountability.
        The management of contracts at the minor level by the WUAs will both strengthen them
        in their roles, in addition to holding the contractors accountable to the clients of their
        services. These O&M contracts are typically small by their nature but essential to the
        operation of the minor and would be best handled by WUAs who know their minor best
        and the way it is supposed to operate.

Project Management
   (g) Designs ready at appraisal. In a phased program such as UPWSRP, where before
        appraisal of follow-on phases, the risk to the Borrower of the project not going ahead is


                                                15
        comparatively slight, contracts that are needed at the outset, such as those for survey and
        design, should be tendered and adjudication completed and submitted to the Bank before
        the project is presented to the Board.
    (h) Consistent leadership at chairman level. Frequent changes of senior management and
        key staff can hinder efficient implementation. The more consistency that can be achieved
        at this chairman level, the better performance the project will likely achieve.

Monitoring and Evaluation
   (i) Remote sensing to monitor agricultural production. A key linkage can be made with
       the UP Remote Sensing Agency to set up a third party monitoring for the project impacts
       on cropping patterns.
   (j) Year 5 M&E for ICR. Monitoring and evaluation of project benefits for the
       implementation completion report should be carried out during the last year of the project
       and should ensure that a suitable “without project? area is included in the survey to act as
       a control.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower has requested that all ratings related to the project performance and the Borrower’s
performance be upgraded. The Borrower argues that UPWSRP was a “pilot? project with
amongst other things, new concepts being introduced involving multi-sector activities, new
procurement procedures for the Irrigation Department, and major institutional reforms. It is from
this context and what has been achieved that the Borrower argues that the overall rating for
achievement of the PDO and outcome rating should be Satisfactory and that the Borrower’s
performance should also be Satisfactory. Bank team feels that more diligence in avoiding costly
delays, the challenges with financial management, and lack of continuity of leadership all
severely impacted the performance of the project. The ratings remain as is.

Summary
                Output Indicator                                       Output
(i) Creation of State Water Resources Agency      SWaRA was established in 2003 and functions
(SWaRA) and fully staffing it                     well but some posts are vacant (since the ICR
                                                  mission) and most technical staff employed
                                                  under contract.
(ii) Creation of a State Water Resources Data     SWaRDAC was established in 2003 and
and Analysis Center (SWaRDAC) and fully           functions well but some posts are vacant (since
staffing it.                                      the ICR mission) and most technical staff
                                                  employed under contract.
(iii) Preparation of Ghaghra-Gomti River Basin    A basin plan, including a social and
Plan, including the preparation of integrated     environmental assessment, has been completed.
social and environmental management plan for
the basin.
iv) Creation of a State Water Tariffs             UP Water Management & Regulatory
Regulatory Commission (SWaTReC)                   Commission Act 2008 authorizes
                                                  UPWaMReC, which has similar powers, but
                                                  only the Chairman and two of four members
                                                  have been appointed so far. The establishment
                                                  of this Act is a major achievement. Though, it
                                                  is yet to be fully functional
(v) Creation of Ghagra-Gomti Basin                No progress on the Ghagra-Gomti Entity but a
Development and Management Entity.                sub-basin board exists as a model
(vi) Downsizing methodologies developed for       Proposed Voluntary Retirement Scheme has
reducing establishment costs of the irrigation    been dropped. Natural wastage is having scant
department.                                       effect.
(vii) Formation and operationalization of two     Jaunpur Branch Sub-basin Development &
sub-basin development and management              Management Board functions well. Imamganj
boards                                            Branch has been omitted from the project, but
                                                  Haidergarh was taken instead (similar size
                                                  area)
(viii) Holistic development and management of     Canal based hydro was proposed for the
water resources in the two selected sub-basins    Imamganj Branch and has been omitted.
including development of canal-based hydros,      Construction of check, dams and ponds and
conservation and development of water bodies      pond rehabilitation may have helped to
and rainwater harvesting                          recharge groundwater
(ix) Formation of WUAs on all minors in the       8858 outlet committees, 805 WUAs at minor
irrigation commands of the two sub-basins         level and 28 distributary committees have been
(about 600 WUAs)                                  formed under the UP PIM Act. WUAs need
                                                  much strengthening.
(x) Participatory rehabilitation and              The Imamganj sub-basin has been omitted. The
modernization of the irrigation and drainage      Jaunpur sub-basin irrigation and drainage have
systems of the two sub-basins                     been partially rehabilitated with limited
                                                  modernization. Minor canals are often in poor
                                                  condition and field channels are often lacking.

(xii) Increase in irrigation and cropping         There have been some increases in irrigation
intensities and diversification to cash crops     and cropping intensity and limited crop
                                                  diversification. 180,400 ha irrigated by canal.
                                                  Crop yields: Rice 2.75 t/ha, Wheat 3.39 t/ha
(xiii) Project Implementation Plan and Project    A PIP has been prepared but not the PAD. PIP
Appraisal Document for the next phase             submitted to GoUP on 2 December 2011.
(xiv) Implementation of the project on-time       The project has been implemented in
and according to IDA procedures.                  accordance with IDA procedures but took four
                                                  years longer than planned

Component A: Creation of Apex Water Institutions and Strengthening Socially and
Environmentally Sustainable Multi-sectoral Water Resources Planning, Allocation and
Management Capacity

SWaRA and SWaRDAC have been created and are functional. UPWaMReC has been created but
is not yet functional. GoUP has been funding these institutions since November 2010 and given
their permanent nature, they will likely continue after the UPWSRP program.

Component A1.State Water Resources Agency (SWaRA)

SWaRA was created by Government Order (GO) in June, 2001 to develop environmentally and
socially sustainable inter-sectoral water allocation plans and optimal water resources management
in a basin context throughout the State. It also serves as the technical secretariat to the State
Water Board and to UPWaMReC.

SwaRA has been functional since 2003 and generally successful in achieving its objectives which
include:
    i) A plan for optimum utilization of water resources for Ghagra-Gomti (GG) Basin has been
         prepared.
    ii) Development of water use allocation potential.
    iii) Implementation of the State Water Policy.
    iv) Development of the Decision Support Systems (included in component C2) for the GG
         Basin and the Jaunpur Branch Sub-basin.
    v) An Environmental Cell has been established in SWaRA with a proposal to create an
         Environmental Cell in UPID for monitoring and follow-up actions on environmental
         issues on the canal and drainage networks.

The project provided support for SWaRA in the form of buildings, equipment, transport,
consultants, staff salaries and operating costs (on a declining basis). On November 8, 2011,
twenty of the 59 sanctioned posts in SWaRA were vacant and15 out of 20 technical staff posts in
SWaRA were employed on a contract basis. Currently, SWaRA resides within UPID and in order
to become the technical body for UPWaMReC it should become independent of the department.
Component A2. State Water Resources Data and Analysis Centre

SWaRDAC was also created in June, 2001 and has been fully functional since 2003. Its mandate
is to collect all surface water, groundwater, and water use data in a standard electronic format.
This data is intended for registered and approved users, to analyze in basin planning at in SWaRA.




                                                 19
SWaRDAC has a Confidential Data Unit and maintains and updates a GIS-based database on
climate, hydrology, geomorphology, topography, infrastructure, demography, socio-economic,
irrigation & drainage networks, water demand, agriculture, soil, land use, wetlands, groundwater
and surface water quality and quantity. Other activities on going at SWaRA/SWaRDAC include:

   a) Compiling daily rainfall and climate data for all UP;
   b) A website of monthly agricultural activities for farmers and crop calendars are available
      with a Gauge Discharge Site Atlas;
   c) GIS maps in seven layers for WUAs in the project area in a Cadastral Information
      System;
   d) Generated sub-basin-wise land-use statistics in the State including LISS III sensor data of
      23.6 m resolution, CARTOSAT sensor data of 2.5 m resolution, block and district
      statistics of UP Planning Department:
   e) Collected flow quantity and quality data from CWC, UPID, UP Pollution Control Board,
      SGWD, CGWB ,Jal Nigam, and Minor Irrigation to use in river flow data analysis for all
      the basins of UP and sub-basin-wise water availability estimates for seven sub-basins;
   f) A groundwater status map of U.P. showing groundwater quality, minor irrigation, private
      tubewells and state tubewells;
   g) Prepared and distributed a Water Resources Planning Atlas for JBSB, Land Use and Wet
      Land Atlas for JBSB at Block Level and Land Use Atlas for GG Basin at District Level
      with a River Basin Planning Atlas for UP is in progress.
   h) Generated time series data on groundwater levels, rainfall and discharges as well as basin
      features such as administrative boundaries (districts & block), roads, canal & drainage
      networks, micro-basin delineation, geomorphic map, soil map (National Bureau of Soil
      Survey & Land Use Planning) in GIS environment.
   i) Regularly updates a website of SWaRA/ SWaRDAC with news, vacancies, achievements
      and quarterly e-bulletin;
   j) Estimated crop water requirements for field crops and vegetable crops for agro-climatic
      zones and specific locations;
   k) Completed work on drinking water data and land use mapping in Gomti with cost
      calculations of water supply from shallow and deep tubewells;
   l) Published a book on crop management and nutrition security in Hindi in SWaRA for use
      by farmers and WUAs;
   m) Prepared reports on: Public Private Partnership in Irrigation and Drainage Sector of U.P.,
      Ground Water Scenario (2004) of UP, Concept document for Bundelkhand Region of
      Uttar Pradesh, Arsenic Toxicity in UP, Hydro geomorphology for Lalitpur
      (Bundelkhand); an Approach Paper for preparation of Basin Plans has been prepared and
      circulated to the related Departments for necessary inputs; and
   n) Provided technical support and data to various consulting agencies of the project.



Component A3 UP Water Management and Regulatory Commission (UPWaMReC)

A State Water Management Regulatory Commission was created in 2005 but its duties were
taken over by UPWaMReC when the UPWaMReC Act was passed in 2008. The Chairman of the
commission is in place with recent appointments for the members of water resources engineering
and drinking and wastewater. The members for agriculture and water resources economy have yet
to be appointed. The UPWaMReC Rules are being formulated but with only one executive
engineer as staff, progress is slow. Otherwise, UPWaMReC is not yet functional.

Component A4 Ghagra-Gomti Basin Development and Management Entity (GGBDME)

A Ghaghra-Gomti basin development and management entity was to be created to implement
environmentally and socially sustainable water resources development and management of water
resources of the Ghaghra-Gomti basin. Although this entity has not yet been established the
Jaunpur Branch Sub-basin Development and Management Board (JBSDMB) (Component C1)
was constituted by G.O. in October 2003 and is working. This example will provide good
experience for GGBDME, which is proposed to be taken up in Phase-II.

Component B: Irrigation Department Reform, Capacity Building and Business Process
Re-engineering

Component B1 Institutional Reform

The downsizing of UPID has not been successful. Only about 22% of the target reduction in staff
has been achieved and the proposed Voluntary Retirement Scheme has not been adopted. The
normal retirement age was increased in 2004 from 58 to 60 years old and downsizing is now to be
achieved by natural attrition.
An international consultancy was appointed to study and prepare proposals for restructuring of
the department both from the considerations of making it effective to meet the present day
challenges and carry out its functions to improve fiscal performance. The final report of Study on
Institutional Strengthening and Restructuring of Irrigation Department Uttar Pradesh was
approved and sent to U.P. Government, through Engineer-in-chief, ID UP, Lucknow in December
2008 and Chairman, PACT Lucknow in January 2009. It is now understood that any staffing
reduction required will be achieved by judicious planning and natural attrition as a result of
retirement. The implementation of PIM and the corresponding transfer of responsibilities to
WUAs will occur over a period of time and may eventually reduce the work load of UPID.

Component B2 UPID Capacity Building
A report on a study conducted by Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow, for Assessment of
the Training Needs and Training Plan Development was submitted in March, 2008. A framework
was developed to present the training needs across all levels and different functional area of
management and a number of training programs were suggested with institutional arrangements
for in-house training at WALMI. Zonal training centers have been established at Aligarh and
Gorkhpur. The details of training given to the UPID officials are given in the table below:

Component B3. Business Process Re-engineering

The Business Process Reengineering activities involved setting up an extensive management
information system and supporting administration and water resource databases with associated
analytical and communication facilities to modernize and streamline UPID business processes.
One of the main project achievements has been development of 26 application modules for the
three distinct functions of the department i.e. executive, technical and support applications. The
executive function application modules include financial accounting, budgeting, revenue, project
monitoring, human resource management, knowledge management, contract, litigation
management and Decision Support Systems (DSS). Technical modules include development of
GIS-based Integrated Water Resource Management Information System (IWRMIS), and
computer aided design (CAD) applications for project planning and designing of structures.
Support function modules include information technology (IT) management, document
management system, internal communications network and systems for faster sharing of
information such as messaging and workflow management. These modules provide organization-
wide Intranet facilities to implement a transparent and cost-effective approach in government
operations.. The functionality of the application modules has been integrated with the main Data
Centre for channelizing the entire information system of the department.

The entire UP Irrigation Department offices have been divided into 11 zonal MIS locations
throughout the State. These locations are Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi, Aligarh, Meerut, Allahabad,
Varanasi, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Gonda and Moradabad. They are connected to the Data Center in
Lucknow with a 2Mbps dedicated lease line. All offices within the zone are connected via a zonal
MIS location with 64 Kbps leased lines. 1000 desktop computers, UPS along with laserjet
printers have been installed in various offices of UPID during 2004-05 and 1000 desktop
computers, 1000 UPS, 550 dot matrix printers and 275 laserjet printers have been installed in
various offices of UPID during 2006-07. 137 desktop computers, UPS and printers have been
installed in PACT offices, 153 laptop computers have been made available to officers, experts
and field engineers for smooth and fast working of project work. UPID has the facility of an
integrated solution for Wide Area Network (WAN). Under the MIS system the basic data
generated at divisional offices can be transmitted up along the hierarchical departmental ladder to

S.Es, C.Es, and E-in-C. The set of queries and data related to the application need both way
transmissions along this existing organizational ladder. This network is used for data connectivity
for intranet, internet, mail and messaging, work flow solutions and module application. Out of
188 WAN sites 187 WAN sites have been connected through BSNL lease line converging to
zonal MIS locations at the Data Centre in the Lucknow WALMI Campus, shared with 4 Mbps
internet lease line. There are 159 WAN sites connected with a 64kbps lease line, 13 WAN sites
connected with two 64kbps lease lines and 1 WAN site is connected with three 64kbps lease lines.
All 11 zonal MIS centers are connected to the Data Center with dedicated 2 mbps lease line
provided by BSNL.

The connection of different computers in various offices of UPID falling under 188 WAN sides
for efficient and fast communication has been achieved through a Local Area Network, which has
been established in the divisional offices/unit of UPID. The LAN established in the designated
sites of UPID will be extended to terminate on the WAN. Training to more than 426 users has
been given at the respective sites. Video conferencing equipment has been installed and is
functioning at the headquarters of divisional offices at Haidergarh, Raebareli, Sultanpur,
Pratapgarh and Jaunpur in UPWSRP Pilot Area. Three ISDN lines are installed through BSNL
for smooth video conferencing with PACT office and World Bank office. Video conferencing
between Lucknow, New Delhi and Washington (U.S.A) has been successful several times.

The database for the application systems developed, will act as a technical data library for UPID,
which will not only consist of all the transaction details associated with technical functions but
also contain records that will aid effective decision making. The records will also act as major
inputs for generation of information for periodic reports. MIS equipment provided is summarized
below.

Public Private Partnership
Haidergarh Chini Mills (HCM), situated in the Haidergarh branch command in Barabanki district
was associated in a limited way for implementation of one PPP pilot scheme. A MOU between
PACT and HCM described the specific duties and responsibilities of both partners. PACT was to
support the sugarcane demonstration input cost and HCM was to orient the farmers willing to
participate in implementation of the activity and build the capacity of farmers through trainings,
field days etc. In the end, 179 sugarcane demonstrations were conducted on farmers’ fields by
HCM with an average yield of 61 t/ha, compared to the State’s average yield of 52 t/ha. However,
after a short time the cooperation with HCM was discontinued and HCM did not take over O&M
of the canal.

Component C: Piloting Reform Options in Water Resources Management

Component C1. Creation and Strengthening of Jaunpur Branch Sub-basin Development
and Management Board (JBSDMB).

JBSDMB has been established for taking decisions regarding planning and management of water
resources in the sub-basin area. Creation and functioning of JBSDMB has created awareness
among the users through meetings held at division level providing a platform for interaction
between the user and service provider. The Imamganj Branch and therefore its Sub-basin
Development and Management Board were omitted from the project.

The JBSDMB was created by GO in October 2003 defining JBSDMB responsibilities. Public
representatives have been nominated by GO dated 15th February, 2007, and later revised by GO
dated 29 September, 2008, which also includes water users/stake holders/ citizens. A 15 member
Management Committee is authorized to take all decisions on behalf of the Board and to prepare
Perspective Plans and Annual Plans for all uses of water, development and management for the
sub-basin. SWaRA provides assistance in formulating the sub-basin water plans. A permanent
office building of JBSDMB has been constructed at Sultanpur. The technical and administrative
support to the board is provided by Superintending Engineer, Sultanpur. District level committees
have been formed to support JBSDMB under the chairmanship of District Magistrates. District
level officers of different departments, stakeholders and NGO’s are the members of the
committees. The main objective of the committee is to prepare a water plan at district level,
taking account of different aspects, such as irrigation, soil conservation, rainwater harvesting,
fisheries, ponds, drinking, industries, sewerage and effluent disposal, flood and drainage,
including water quality and environmental flow aspects under the prevailing guide lines of the
central and state government. First round of meetings of district sub-basin water management and
development committees were organized at Sultanpur, Jaunpur, Raebareli and Pratapgarh.
Officers from different departments and other members showed their keen interest in water
management issues and alternative remedial measures.

Component C2 Development of Decision Support Systems (DSSs)

DSS uses appropriate tools to organize information on climate, agriculture, surface and
groundwater hydrology, irrigation and drainage network, water demands (irrigation, domestic,
industrial, hydropower, and environment), socio-economic and demographic details, topography,
water quality and wetlands. DSS uses optimization and decision support modeling tools to arrive



                                                 28
at optimal water allocations and investment strategies under a variety of hydrological, technical,
policy, infrastructure and other constraints and scenarios in an inclusive and participatory setting.
DSSs have been prepared:
        To develop spatial knowledge base for integrated water resources management in the GG
   basin;
        To identify “Issues and Options? for water resources development and management in
   the GG basin.
        To evaluate the major related issues for the entire GG basin, micro sub-basins (MSBs)
   and develop the basin DSS, which includes the knowledge base developed as well as various
   linked models to assist in decision making relating to the planning and management of water
   resources in the basin.
        To prepare the “Basin Water Resources Master Plan? for GG basin.

A Basin Social and Environmental Assessment (BSEA) has been undertaken for the GG basin as
part of the DSS to mainstream social and environmental issues through the entire program
through the Social and Environmental Management Plan (SEMP). It was anticipated that the
BSEA and SEMP would provide the essential inputs into the preparation of the overall basin
development plans, which would guide investment decisions in the basin. Under BSEA, a sector
knowledge and information base has been developed for multi-sectoral planning, priority setting
and to give a framework for project preparation.

Component C3 Rainwater Harvesting

Rainwater Harvesting is the technique of collection and storage of rainwater at the surface or in
sub-surface aquifers, before it is lost as surface run off. The augmented resource can be harvested
in time of need. Due to uncontrolled development of groundwater and heavy withdrawal for
irrigation and other purposes in certain areas, especially in tail portions of the canal system and a
reduction in the supply of water in the Jaunpur branch canal and several dry years, groundwater
levels show a declining trend (as shown in the table below), particularly in Pratapgarh, Jaunpur
and Sultanpur districts where water levels were found to be declining over the years to lower than
10 m below ground level even during post monsoon periods. To improve the monitoring of
groundwater levels, 884 piezometers have been installed, of which 500 are fitted with automatic
water level recorders and 384 piezometers are manual type. However, data collection has
discontinued, due to the expiry of annual maintenance contracts causing insufficient automatic
recorders to be operating. Action is being taken to ensure that there is continuous operation and
data collection from the DWLRs.

In severely affected areas, rehabilitation and improvement of village ponds owned by Gram
Panchayats and construction of check dams on drains have been undertaken. Construction of 18
check dams and rehabilitation of ponds in Sultanpur Pratapgarh and Jaunpur districts have been
completed in areas with declining and low groundwater levels. These structures will not only
conserve the rainwater and recharge groundwater in the long term but also supply water for the
local population and livestock in lean periods. The main activities of this sub-component are
summarized below.

Fish culture in small ponds was initiated under the project in 94 small ponds of varying sizes
with a combined area of 67 hectares during the years 2007-08 and 2008-09. The demonstrations
and the training provided to the fishing community have not resulted in the sustained benefits
envisaged, due mainly to the failure of the link to the Fishery Department through UPDASP. The
fisheries development in the project area should have been tied with UP Department of Fisheries
(DOF) to not only improve and control the process but also to ensure its sustainability.

Six wetland areas, covering a total of 107 ha were selected in the project area. There were joint
walkthroughs with Dept of Fisheries /PACT at Hallor, Bariyarpur, Tamolia, Bhuwalpur,
Moongtal, and Hardoiya Tal. Feasibility reports of all six wetland were prepared with the EMP

and submitted to the World Bank. However, due to lack of required documentation they were
dropped by the Bank mission in August 2009. Rehabilitation of ponds and construction of check
dams may be carried out in the future for conservation of rainwater and ground water recharge. A
block level wetland atlas in GIS format has been prepared and water quality has been assessed for
three wetlands of JBS (two at Pratapgarh and one at Rae-Barely).
Component C4 Small Hydro-electric Development in Imamganj Branch Canal

This component did not materialize due to lack of assured water supply in Imamganj Branch
canal, which was omitted from the project.

Component D: Piloting Reform Options in Irrigation and Drainage Operations (PROIDO)

Component D1 Rehabilitation and Modernization of the Irrigation and Drainage System

The PAD recognized that in order to provide reliable water delivery, the irrigation system would
have to be brought back to design conditions and modernized to install necessary devices to
measure water delivered and to monitor performance of the system. The revised project area
comprises the areas commanded by the first 23 km of the Haidergarh branch canal (cultivable
command area 20,287 ha) and the entire command of the Jaunpur branch canal (CCA 322,753 ha)
and associated drainage areas. The gross command area is nearly 600,000 ha.

Siltation. The system is fed from the feeder canal, which takes water from Sarda Barrage across
the Sarda River. The sarda Sahayak feeder canal supplies water to entire Sarda Sahayak canal
system. A silt ejector at km. 0.300 of S.S. Feeder channel was constructed to release the
excessive silt load, this became non functional due to hydraulic and other problems. A model
study of the silt ejector was conducted by Irrigation Research Institute, Roorkee in year 2005-06
which suggested remedial measures to restore existing silt ejector for an optimal functional
efficiency. However, remedial measures could not be taken up. The Haidergarh branch canal
takes off from the feeder canal at km 171.6 and the Jaunpur branch canal takes off from km.
22.980 (right bank) of the Haidergarh branch canal. During wet weather large quantities of silt
enter the feeder canal and Haidergarh branch canal and thence into the project area. Much silt is
deposited in the beds of canals and at present the capacity of the Haidergarh branch canal is only
about 40% to 65% of its designed capacity due to siltation. The PAD recognized this problem,
and proposed that studies and analyses would be conducted to arrive at appropriate technical
solutions for the siltation problem. The international consultant for the design of the rehabilitation
and modernization of the irrigation and drainage systems studied the siltation problem and made
recommendations for further study of silt exclusion works for the head of the feeder canal. Some
modifications were made in left wing wall of the existing head regulator to reduce the siltation
problem. No decision was made by UPID to go ahead with further studies of the siltation problem.

Survey. The award of the contact for topographical survey was awarded about 18 months late and
some nine months after the planned start date of the design consultancy, which had to rely on the
survey data

Design, Design of the rehabilitation and modernization of the project area has been carried out
involving the farmers. Joint walk through surveys were carried out by the irrigation department,
the international design consultant and water users. All rehabilitation and modernization designs
were reviewed and approved by a high level Review Committee of the project.
Rehabilitation of Canal & Drainage Systems



                                                 31
In addition to the siltation problems described above, the canal banks and structures were in bad
condition, with canal banks as much as one meter lower than the designed levels. The distibutary
and minor canals had numerous cuts and large-scale formation of berms. Many outlets had been
tampered with. The drainage systems were inefficient and poorly maintained, being heavily silted
with extensive weed growth and obstructions by farmers. The following main activities were
carried out under rehabilitation of the canal and drainage systems.
i)      Restoration of canal and drainage system physical profile as per the designs by re-
        sectioning and making bank profiles to be able to carry the design discharges.
ii)     Re-evaluation of the outlet command area, based on land use data and mapping in GIS
        format.
iii)    Improved communication facilities by way of providing metalled road on left bank and
        brick on edge soling on right bank of Haidergarh and Jaunpur branch canals and selected
        reaches of distributary canals. This provides not only all-weather communication but also
        easy and fast access to the market for the farming community and their produce.
iv)     Construction of new canal head regulators, road bridges on canals and drains for
        facilitation of local communication and cross drainage works. In addition, bed profiles
        have been constructed at every 500m in branch and distributary canals and drains. Bed
        bars at 200m intervals have been constructed in minor canals. These define the bed
        profile.

Modernization
In some places branch canals provided irrigation through direct outlets, which used to run
uncontrolled thereby, not only wasting water, but also causing land degradation. A new concept
of clubbing the direct outlets on branch canals into a single outlet delivering water through a
parallel minor canal alongside the bank of the branch canal has been implemented. The total
length of such parallel minors is 110 km. The clubbing of outlets facilitates formation of WUAs.
Direct outlets on distributaries could not be clubbed for want of land. The water delivery through
parallel channel arrangement can be seen in the following photograph.




                        Jaunpur branch, parallel minor at km 73.500, L/B
Control of water levels in canals is of paramount importance to ensure proper and equitable
distribution of water. A number of structures, some conventional and some new have been
introduced in the project. Four cross regulators on Jaunpur branch were rebuilt with new designs.
One additional cross regulator was built on Deeh distributary. Forty-one duckbill weirs for


                                               32
control of water levels in distributary canals have been constructed. A special feature has been
added by providing free flow gate arrangement to avoid siltation, as shown in the picture below.
These weirs have significantly improved the water delivery to connected systems and are
generally appreciated and acknowledged by the farmer community.




                            Duck bill weir at km 14.300 on Tikri Dy,U/S

A number of checks, drops and crest walls on distributaries and minor canals have been
constructed to control canal water levels and new or modified gates have been provided.

A special feature has been to install flow regulation and measurement devices at the heads of
minor canals. These devices in various sizes and design features matching the specific
requirements are being procured from Spain and are being installed by the joint venture
contractors. They are designed to allow the passage of an almost constant flow from a distributary,
in which the variation of the water level is restricted. They also serve as a metering device and
would be suitable when water is supplied on a volumetric basis, as intended in the future. Five
fixed velocity profilers, one on Haidergarh branch, three on Jaunpur branch and one at the head of
Deeh distributary, have been installed for canal flow measurement. In addition two portable
profilers have been procured for measurements and calibration at any location.

The existing configurations of the right upstream wing wall of the Deeh distributary. and left
upstream return wing wall of the head regulator of Haidergarh branch were causing adverse flow
conditions resulting in varied discharge into the different bays of the head regulator. Model
studies were undertaken by the Department of Water Resources Design & Management, Indian
Institute of Technology, Roorkee, to verify the flow conditions and suggest modifications. Based
on the observations in the model it was found that the upstream left return wing wall of
Haidergarh branch head regulator in its present geometric configuration is causing variable flow
velocities across the width of the regulator through the different bays and excessive siltation is
attracted towards the first two bays from the left side. The Haidergarh branch regulator left wing
wall has been remodeled according to the findings of the model study. The model study has also
revealed that only 145 cumec flow can pass the head regulator under the present running
parameters as against the design discharge of 165 cumec. Construction of an auxiliary head
regulator and a channel to increase the capacity is about 80% complete but has stopped due to
lack of funds. 7,603 redesigned semi-modular pipe outlets with head and tail walls have been
provided on distributaries and minors of the command. This type of outlet is suitable to distribute
more or less equitably with variations in the canal water level within their range of operation and
also draw their share of silt. The lead-in pipe is set at or near the bed level and it opens into a tank


                                                  33
on the downstream side to which an open flume is fitted. The discharge of the semi-module is
independent of the water level in the field channel, but dependent on the water level in the supply
canal so long as a minimum working head is available for the outlet. Quality control was ensured
by subjecting all the construction work to third party supervision through a reputed international
consulting agency. Bi-monthly and tri-monthly (during closure period) reports were submitted by
the consultants for facilitating concurrent quality assurance and defect management issues for all
rehabilitation and modernization activities under the project. Construction works are summarized
in the table below.

Jaunpur Branch Canal Operation

The water delivered by the Jaunpur branch canal has changed over the project period as shown
below. This table indicates that there was considerable over-irrigation in early years of the project



                                                 35
(over 10,000 m3/ha for a crop of kharif paddy) but more reasonable amounts are being applied in
recent years. These lower irrigation duties may also have contributed to the lowering of the
groundwater table.

Component D3 Agriculture Intensification and Diversification (AID)

Overall, this sub-component has been moderately satisfactory: There appears to have been a
significant increase in the crops (mostly pulses) grown in the zaid season, which has improved the
cropping intensity and soil fertility. Productivity appears to have improved but very little
diversification appears to have taken place. There is now no linkage with the DoA for ongoing
agricultural support to farmers, the project failed to capture data to support increases in
productivity, adoption of techniques, or increase diversity and the interventions were poorly
linked to the irrigation investments.

Background: The AID sub-component was designed to ensure that the investments in the
irrigation assets would be realized through increased agriculture production and productivity. The
project was to provide support for extension, study tours and other training, and on-farm trials for
agriculture and horticulture and promotion of environmentally sustainable techniques (including



                                                36
integrated pest management and organic farming), improvements in livestock management and
knowledge dissemination through village kiosks. Initially the component was designed to be
implemented by the DoA through the UPDASP (whose mission is closely aligned with the
projects and covers the same area). However in 2006 due to various reasons PACT took over
implementation of the sub-component, hired three agriculture experts, developed a strategy
covering the following priority topics; (i) quality seeds and seed replacement (ii) balanced use of
fertilizer (iii) timely sowings/transplanting, (iv) proper plant spacing (v) proper placement of seed
& fertilizer, (vi) timely irrigation through conjunctive use of water and (viii) eco-friendly pest
management. The activities were implemented using NGOs who conducted 2 demonstrations in
the head, mid and tail of each minor. These activities were initiated in the rabi crop of 2006 and
by kharif 2007 this approach had been scaled up to cover all 421 minors, and was supported by a
training and exposure program.

Outputs: The project reports that approximately 36,000 demonstrations (on rice, wheat, pulses,
vermi-compost, fodder, etc) have been conducted and touched approximately 169,071, 23,277
and 2,325 farmers through field days, trainings and exposure visits respectively. This accounts for
almost half the project beneficiaries. The final costs of the sub-component was approximately
USD 2.8 million, more or less in line with the post tsunami revised costs of approximately USD
2.5 million (the original allocation was USD 6.9 million). This represents less than 2% of the
overall project costs.

Outcomes: The ICRR outcomes of this subcomponent are linked to the PDO indicator
“Modernized operation of irrigation and drainage systems in about 280,000 ha gross command
area? with a target of “diversification, (incl. IPM/IPNM) in 75,000 ha. Strangely there was no
intermediate outcome indicator linked to this. The PAD outcome indicators (Annex 1) referred to
“formalized linkages between agriculture and water sectors, public and private sector institutions?
and “sustainable improvements in irrigation intensities and crop yields (intensification)? and
“substitution of higher value crops (diversification)?, with the output indicator for the sub-
component of “increase in irrigation and cropping intensities and diversification into cash crops?.
Despite these indicators, actual targets were poorly defined during preparation, nor were they
redefined when opportunities arose at MTR or during the extensions, which left the component
open to interpretation as to how to deliver. A list of indicators and results is presented in the table
below. The assumptions listed from the PAD are taken from the economic analysis and, while
these are not formal targets, they form the basis upon which many of the projects benefits will be
derived, hence they are included.

Increased productivity. As expected, yields recorded from demonstrations were considerably
better than those recorded in the control and from both the impact and adoption surveys (Table 1),
(with the exception of green gram; no explanation was provided as to why this is the case). The
adoption surveys conducted by the outlet level WUAs and the support NGOs covered a large
number 6 of farmers and these yields seem to be reasonably representative of the situation
observed in the field at ICR and from discussions with farmers; however this data lacks a
counterfactual and one should use caution when comparing with the control (as the control
included non-irrigated areas).

  A simple yes/no survey form was given to each president of the outlet level WUA, who collected information from
individual farmers. Support NGOs then collected and collated this information.

Impact surveys. Data provided on productivity improvements from the impact surveys are
inconclusive (when compared to the control areas). It would appear that for wheat the project
farmers yields increased at a marginally better rate than control farmers, while paddy farmers did
not perform so well. However it must be noted that the results presented used 2008/09 survey
data, it is possible that yields in the project area increased further in the subsequent crops. It is a
limitation that another survey was not conducted in 2011. This would have better captured the
projects performance, and better represented the ‘control’ or without project scenario (as it
included un-irrigated areas). A fairer comparison would have been selection of non-project
command areas.

Discussions with project farmers indicated that there was very little interaction with DoA
extension staff. While it is not confirmed it appears that the DoA may have not overlapped their
regular activities in the project areas. If this is the case it would account to some extent for the
similar performance in the project and control areas.

Diversification

Diversification: The project is reporting virtually no change in the crop diversification where the
index dropped slightly over the project period. Curiously, the index dropped significantly from
the baseline value of 0.75 in 2001/02, to less than 0.50 in both 2005/06 and 2006/07, 8 but
subsequently recovered to 0.72 at the end of the project. The reasons for this were not
investigated.

Cropping Intensity (including IPNM/IPM):

The impact assessment reports indicate that the cropping intensity increased over the project
period in both the control and project areas, however increased almost 10% more in the project
situation, this would appear to be largely due to an increase in the pulses grown in the zaid
(March to June) period (see below). This is a positive outcome, where the project has been able to
successfully leverage the increase in pulse prices in recent times. Other likely reasons for the

increased cropping intensities include the reduction in waterlogged areas and improved water
supply to increase the cropped area.

Nutrient management (IPNM) was highly promoted under the project and mainly consisted of
training and demonstrating the use of balanced fertilizers, through targeted soil testing and
subsequent recommendations. An appropriate indicator for the adoption of this technology is the
(regular) use of soil testing, however the impact survey data shows that in the project area in
2005/2006 approximately 9% and 8% of paddy and wheat farmers were undertaking soil tests
however in subsequent surveys (2006/2007 and 2009/2010) this has declined to approximately
3% for both paddy and wheat. This is a reason for concern, as without regular monitoring of soil
fertility and health the sustainability of this intervention would be under question. At the same
time the number of farmers growing pulse crops, particularly in the zaid season (March to June)
has increased significantly, largely due to the efforts of the project. The impact survey indicates
that the area sown in the zaid season has increased from less than 0.5% of the gross sown area in
the command in 2005/06 to more than 4.5% in 2008/09. This is an excellent intervention, both in
terms of increasing farmers’ incomes and also improving soil fertility.

The achievement of the PDO indicator target of 75,000 ha is not reported in the Borrowers ICR.
From the information at hand, the increase in cropping intensity of around 10% represents about
30,000 ha. The area under which split application of fertilizer (one aspect of IPNM) is being
practiced appears to be more than 50% of farmers (compared with 10% in the control)9 while the
adoption survey reports that 36 – 40% of paddy and wheat farmers (Table 2) are using a balanced
fertilizer application (another aspect if IPNM), while 34% of wheat farmers have adopted part of
the IPM package of practices. This represents a considerable portion of the project area, the sum
of which would cover more than the targeted area, however due to issues already discussed it
would be difficult to attribute most of these successes directly to the project.

Adoption

Surveys were conducted by the outlet level WUAs and the support NGOs to assess the adoption
of various packages such as use of quality seed, balanced fertilizer use, timely cultural practices,
improved irrigation management and eco-friendly pest control. Data was also collected regarding
yields and area planted. The project reports to have surveyed approximately 440,000 farmers for
this purpose, in the rabi, kharif and the zaid seasons covering the main crops grown in each,
paddy, wheat, black and green gram. Statistically this was a massive task, with the combined
collection of in the vicinity of 8 million data points! Unfortunately the data lacks time series and
counterfactuals for comparisons, and poorly differentiates technologies promoted by the project
and those promoted generally by the DoA (for example IPM has been promoted by the DoA for
many years and the DoA has large schemes/programs supporting improved seed replacement
rates, balanced use of fertilizer, IPM, etc). The surveys generally indicated that there was good
adoption of the technologies in most cases with the exception possibly of moong, which would go
some way to accounting for the lower productivity improvements in this crop. From the data
provided it would appear that approximately 60% the farmers adopted one or more of the
technologies surveyed in the case of wheat and paddy, however a much smaller percentage of
farmers (26%) adopted one or more of the technologies for green or black gram.

Of the five indicators monitored for adoption, most are promoted in one way or another through
regular DoA programs. For example, soil health and productivity are major areas of focus under
the RKVY10 scheme, which promotes balanced use of fertilizer. Two indicators that might be
unique to the project are line planting/transplanting and providing irrigation at critical times,
which respectively 22-24% and 40% of farmers report they have adopted (Table 2). In hindsight,
surveys should have either included a control or time series, or perhaps been more specific to the
technologies promoted by the project, for example for balanced fertilizer use where soil testing
was used, questions related to farmers continuing use of soil testing services, or the use of a
specific element known to be limiting within the project area, such as zinc. The statistics for urd
and moong (black and green gram)are misleading, as the survey was not limited to those growing
these crops. It is likely that the adoption rates were much higher and the data might better reflect
the number of farmers growing these crops, rather than the adoption of technologies related per se.
The data indicate that approximately 15% of farmers were growing these crops (which gives
some confidence in the impact survey data related to intensification).

Implementation

The AID component was designed to be implemented through the Bank-funded Utter Pradesh
Diversified Agriculture Project (UPDASP), which closed officially in 2004. Although a second
phase did not eventuate, the project management and structure continued to function with budget
support from the DoA. In 2005 DASP was still very much considered to be able to deliver the
component and was asked to initiate demonstrations in the sub-component. When DASP failed to
take action, the responsibility was taken over by PACT and implemented by NGOs, the number
of which varied over the remaining period of the project. It would appear that in terms of delivery
this worked reasonably well, as the project reports that the targets set for various activities were
more or less met.

The project adopted an interesting implementation arrangement, whereby demonstration farmers
were reimbursed based upon actual expenditures. Although there was a condition that farmers
must complete a successful demonstration, it is reported that 100% were reimbursed. This
avoided many of the delays and problems associated with procurement of inputs by the project.
This is an innovative approach as it frees extension staff from the time consuming task of
procurement.

Risks to sustainability

The project is reporting considerable achievements in terms of raising awareness amongst farmers
of the dangers of over-irrigation. However, outlet committees and WUAs will need assistance in

USD 4.2 billion under the 11th plan)

planning for and ensuring equitable distribution of water. There is a risk that improvements in
productivity will be lost due to lack of maintenance of the canals.

Problems identified in the initial project scheme walks-through are different to what would be
found if walks-through were conducted today. From discussions held with farmers during the
ICRR, two issues that were not highlighted in the original walks-through became apparent: field
channels often do not exist and some outlets from minor canals give flow rates that are too low or
do not command the fields. Until water starts flowing, these issues are not apparent to farmers,
either because there is disbelief that the water will ever arrive or farmers do not appreciate the
detailed designs to understand water levels, flow rates etc. This would indicate that another walk-
through or similar consultative activity needs to occur at the outlet and minor levels.

Weed control in the minors and field channels, while underplayed as it is such an expected part of
irrigation, is a major issue. Weeds slow water velocity not only resulting in the depositing of silt,
that in theory is destined for the farmers fields, but also leads to reductions in efficiency and
increase accessions to the water tables. In theory weeds are controlled manually twice a season in
the minors (in some cases this is now undertaken by labor from the NREGA scheme) and more
often in the field channels. Without a systematic approach to controlling this problem, coupled
with adequate funding, this is likely to be a serious risk to system deterioration and sustainability.

Key observations from ICRR field visits.

       More water is available in the minors
       Farmers are often unable to distribute this water due to lack of field channels
       Most farmers now want (and require) field channels
       Some outlets cannot supply adjacent fields (survey of 6 minors visited had 49% of outlets
        where ground level is an average of 36 cm above the FSL)
            o Farmers adjacent to outlet not interested in field channel as it does not serve their
                field
            o These farmers pumping from minor (at a cost) - GoUP rates of irrigation per ha
                by lift irrigation are almost half as compared to canal irrigation
       Essential to promote conjunctive water use and sharing of this resource,
       Field channels should have a dual role of distribution of both canal and ground water
       Must remember that design of system is only ever going to cover 115% of the command
        (67% in Kharif and 48% in Rabi)
       Drainage is essential to ensure long-term sustainability of the irrigated area (salinization
        and sodicity are real threats).
       Many farmers who do not have field channels to supply them with water, pump
        groundwater at some expense. This indicates a willing ness to pay for a reliable supply of
        water.


Livestock and fisheries activities were envisaged in the PAD and fisheries activities were
reported to have been initiated in 94 small ponds (approximately 67 ha of pond area) during
2007-08 and 2008-09 combined with demonstrations and training to the fishing community.
However it was reported that these activities were not sustained. A Bank mission recommended
in 2003 that PACT employ a fishery officer and again at MTR. Subsequently, a wetlands officer
(from Central Institute of Fisheries) was recruited in 2006. In August of 2009, a Bank mission
recommended that, although the fisheries intervention appeared to be successful, it not be




                                                 42
continued in the extended project due to incomplete documentation and a lack of an
environmental and social assessment.

Also in August 2009 the Bank mission looked at the activities relating to Animal Husbandry
where it was agreed with the project that, if there was an extension of the credit closing date, a
pilot activity for the promotion of backyard quails/poultry in collaboration with KVK would be
supported. However this never came to fruition.

D4 Piloting Replicable Management Options

Legal Background
Government made a resolution to implement participatory irrigation management on canal
irrigation systems for efficient and optimum use of water and thereafter issued a government
order in 2001 for the formation of WUAs at minor level. 396 WUAs were formed under the said
government order on the basis of selection of public representatives like gram pradhan etc. in the
district of Raebareli, Pratapgarh, Sultanpur, Barabanki and Jaunpur in 2002. NGOs were
deployed in the project area with the aim to create awareness about participatory irrigation
management among farmers and WUAs and to bridge the existing gap between them and UPID.
On the basis of experience gained, it was decided that the lowest functional unit of water users’
associations should be an outlet committee (kulaba samiti). Keeping this in mind a new
government order was issued in 2006. According to this order the water users associations were
to be constituted on the basis of elections to be held at outlet level. WUAs at minor level were to
be constituted by a federation of presidents of outlet committees. UPID conducted elections at
outlet level with the assistance of NGOs. 4678 outlet committees and 421 WUAs at minor level
were constituted under the above government order and registered under Society Registration Act
1860.

Uttar Pradesh Participatory Irrigation Management Act 2009 was passed on 20th February 2009.
Uttar Pradesh Participatory Irrigation Management Rules 2010 were published on 30th March
2010. The Act has been implemented in project area since 5th March 2009 and in entire UP since
1st January 2011.

Establishment and Training of WUAs
During the project, 8858 outlet committees, 805 WUAs at minor level and 28 distributary
committees have been formed under the UP PIM Act 2009. Management of distributary and
minor systems have been transferred to the WUAs and distributary committees. The current
situation after a long process of forming WUAs is shown below.

NGOs and Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) were instrumental in building the
capacity of constituted WUAs in performing their day to day functions like water distribution,
irrigation recording, water budgeting, financial management etc. that was envisaged in the
government order. These water users associations were provided with command area maps as
well as other documents in order to equip them in familiarizing with the inventory and terrain of
command area so that they perform their functions with ease. Memoranda of understanding were
signed by WUAs and UPID to conduct operation and maintenance for a period of two years i.e.
2004-05, 2005-06. The WUAs operated and maintained the works for this period and the impact
of this activity was that the irrigation increased in the tail reaches of minors and the cost of
maintenance of the minor was reduced.

Exposure visits of farmers to other states made them realize that whatever they learnt during
capacity building programs can be practically executed. It also boosted their confidence for
execution of functions expected from WUAs.

PIM cells at divisions, circles and E-in-C level have been established to perform as a resource,
planning, facilitation, monitoring center for participatory irrigation management activities for
constituted WUAs as well as UPID. Five standard training modules have been prepared, covering
roles and responsibilities of WUAs & UPID, details about PIM cell, financial management, water
management and implementing civil works. Training on these modules has been given to the
WUAs by divisional officers/employees. WALMI has played an important role in disseminating
information regarding participatory irrigation management among WUAs and UPID. WUAs and
UPID have become aware of participatory irrigation management. An extensive capacity building
program for WUAs, including field training, sensitization workshop, field workshop, financial
training, technical training, training on water management and exposure visits has been conducted
by WALMI. A survey of office bearers of the water users’ associations during the course of their
training at WALMI found substantial increase in community participation. However, an auditor’s
report on water users’ associations found that there is no system of preparation of annual financial
statement i.e. receipts and payments accounts, which is required to be submitted to the Registrar
of Societies from time to time and preparation of periodical bank reconciliation is not satisfactory.
An audit of some 400 WUAs found instances where 1) advances to WUAs remained unadjusted
in accounts at division level: 2) Supporting documents could not be found and 3) WUAs were not
maintaining independent books of accounts. There is a need to identify local literate and numerate
persons in WUAs and train them in financial management. There is a lack of technical ability in
water users’ associations, which is largely due to there being no practical handing over of the
irrigation management to water users’ associations so that they have no hands on experience of
dealing with the technical issues. The non-participation of water users’ associations in
rehabilitation of irrigation systems was one major reason of creation of gap between theoretical
and practical knowledge in technical ability. It is also conclusive that lack of performing technical
works practically has caused the WUA to forget the technical training imparted theoretically. The
technical issues require skilled and literate persons to handle works like estimate preparation,
preparation of warabandi, preparation of water budget, preparation of annual work plan. Capacity
building of newly constituted WUAs under UP PIM Act 2009 through division level on the basis
of standard training modules is being carried out. A systematic time bound and low cost two days
training program is being followed by divisions.

WUA Buildings. UPID constructed four WUA offices in the project area as the registration of
old WUAs expired and new WUAs under the Act was not constituted at that time i.e. the absence
of legal body of WUAs. Land for these offices was provided by village panchayats to UPID.
These offices have been handed over to the respective WUAs. Since new WUAs have been


                                                45
established under the Act henceforth the responsibility of construction of WUA office should lie
on them. Land and funds for construction should be transferred to the WUAs. Establishment of
office for WUAs will give them identity of an institution and provide safe and fixed place for
maintenance of maps, records related to financial transactions, technical matters, revenue records,
matters related to judicial procedures etc.

GIS maps with eight layers, base map, kulaba command map, warabandi, khasra map, kharif and
rabi cropping pattern map, soil fertility map and cartosat map were prepared and provided to
WUAs. These maps help them to identify the location of their fields related to the outlets,
knowledge about soil condition. Kulaba command maps were extensively used for the
preparation of kulaba sub-command and voter list required for the election purpose. With the help
of kulaba command maps demarcation of sub-commands was completed in very short time.

Participation of WUAs in Rehabilitation
WUAs were involved in design and planning of rehabilitation works that created enthusiasm
among them regarding PIM. But later on during rehabilitation their participation was negative
resulting in lowering down of enthusiasm and dissipating their technical capacity gained during
capacity building programs. Taking this into view PIM Act 2009 has made provision that the
rehabilitation of minors shall be done by WUAs. In case of their inability to do so the department
shall execute the work on the satisfaction of concerned WUAs.

Capacity Building of UPID Officials
Capacity building program including sensitization workshops, exposure visits, shared vision
workshop and follow up programs were conducted for UPID officials. They came to understand
that PIM is a reality.

Guidelines regarding preparation of voter list, returning & presiding officers were issued for
conducting elections. These elections were conducted by UPID on the lines of panchayat
elections i.e. based on ballots.

Voter list was prepared by the officials and employees of division for outlet, minor and
distributary committees. Elections were conducted at outlet, minor and distributary level by UPID
itself with the assistance of district administration. The impact of election conducted on the basis
of ballot created a phenomenal awareness about PIM among the farmers. Out of 8978 outlets in
the project area 8858 outlet committees have been constituted by electing about 60,000
representatives. The other 120 outlet committee could not be formed because of unavailability of
land records as the records were sealed due to ongoing programme of land consolidation. Out of
421 minors, 407 minor committees have been constituted as well as 398 minor level committees
for outlets off-taking directly from distributary and branches. The elections for 14 minors were
not conducted because of land consolidation. Further, out of 31 distributaries in the project area
28 distributary committees were formed. 3 distributary committees could not be formed because
of non-formation of 14 minor committees. This provides WUAs as a legal entity and created
respect for them as an institution among the farmers. It also created a sense of ownership of
WUAs and thereby PIM by UPID.

Financial Sustainability of WUAs
Financial sustainability is a prerequisite for running any institution. Hence it is important that
sources of finance as per provision made in the Act must be materialized. These are:

       The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Program (MNREG). The
        Government has issued an order declaring WUAs as the implementing agency for the
        execution of works related to construction of field channels and drains, O&M of minors
        and distributaries under this program

       State Funds. WUAs are entitled to 40% of irrigation revenues from their area but so far
        few, if any, have received this. In lieu of this for 2011/12, the State Government has
        made budgetary provision (Financial Year 2011-12) of Rs 1 crore as financial assistance
        for WUAs to help WUAs perform their day-to-day works.

       A single payment of Rs1000 per hectare, processed by CADA, the interest from which
        may be used by WUAs for their expenses.

Future Assistance for WUAs
PIM Cells have been established at division, circle and E-in-C level in accordance with UP PIM
Rule 2010. These PIM cells played a vital role in conducting elections of WUAs. Training of
WUAs at divisional level has been successfully conducted under the guidance and facilitation of
PIM cell at very economical rate compared to earlier training given by WALMI.

Although many of the WUAs have been in existence since 2005 or earlier, they have all very
recently been reconstituted under the PIM Act 2009 and often have new leaders who have not had
the benefit of the earlier training. WUAs do not have the skills or resources to operate and
maintain canals adequately and construct field channels and require continued support from UPID
and any future project. If this support is lacking, there is a risk that WUAs would wither and the
canals continue to deteriorate.

Component-E- Feasibility Study for UPWSRP-Phase II
With the completion of the present project, the State has initiated the Phase II of the project.
Based on the guidelines given in Project Appraisal Document, a Concept Document has been
prepared. A Project Report and Implementation Plan for Phase II has been prepared. The


                                               47
Concept Document of Phase-II projects have been approved by the different nodal ministries and
Planning Commission, Govt. of India and have agreed with the proposal in principle with the
Concept Document. The D.E.A., Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India forwarded the said
document to the World Bank for consideration on a priority basis for credit assistance. The World
Bank approved the Concept Document in July 2011. A contract was signed in August 2011 for
Phase II Social and environmental assessment framework study in Bundelkhand area. The draft
final report is likely to be submitted in July 2012. This apart, survey and design consultancies
have already started the assignment for Haidergarh Branch (Km. 22.980 downstream) in Sarda
Sahayak project area and Rohini, Jamuni and Sajnam Dam canal system area in Bundelkhand
Region. The bill of Quantity and design of the works these areas are expected by September 2012.
Preparation of voters’ lists for WUAs in the Phase II area has begun. The proposed project area
would comprise 904,000 ha. in Sarda Sahayak (Ghaghra-Gomti Basin) and 735,000 ha. in
Bundelkhand Region.

Component-F- Project Coordination & Monitoring
A Project Activity Core Team (PACT), headed by secretary irrigation as Chairman and having a
Chief Engineer with experts and support staff drawn from UPID, line departments and from
outside on contractual basis, was established to implement the project. Consultants were engaged
for monitoring activities and quality assurance. For monitoring and evaluation, impact indicators
were developed. The consultant has also developed a Project Management and Monitoring
Information System (PMMIS) software for monitoring the components of the project. A web
enabled PMMIS application software has been developed to assist PACT to evaluate online
progress and performance monitoring of project activities. Procurement and financial
management tools, including a computerized financial management system, were developed
according to Bank guidelines and procedures. Two consultancies were assigned to evaluate
project impact. The first during calendar year 2007 and the second from August 2009 to March
2010. Sample household surveys on 43 representative minors were conducted by the consultants.
However the surveys were not suitable for use in this ICR.

Monitoring of ground water levels through water level recorders has helped to study and assess
water level fluctuations.

                        Annex 3 Economic and Financial Analysis

This project is the first phase of long term programmatic approach to support effective
development and management of the water sector and irrigation and drainage sub-sector in the
state. The PDO for the project was to set up an institutional and policy framework and to initiate
reforms in the irrigation and drainage sub-sector to sustainably increase water and agricultural
productivity. The project, while primarily focusing on enabling policy and institutional
framework in the water sector, has piloted reform options in irrigation and drainage operations
covering 343,040 ha of CCA in Jaunpur and Hydergarh branches.

A.      PAD Estimated Project Benefits and Rate of Return

Project cost benefit analysis in PAD focused on quantifying benefits from two major sources
namely; (i) irrigated area increased by 106,275 ha and (ii) crop productivity increased by 28 to
34% for rice and wheat and crop diversification increased by 25%. Both these sources together
accounted for 90% of the annual incremental benefits. Other sources accounting for about 10% of
the annual incremental benefits include canal hydros, drainage improvement, village pond
fisheries development, VRS and MIS benefits.

The analysis was done for a 25-year period at 2001 prices using 12% as the opportunity cost of
capital. All project costs including contingencies were used in the analysis except for the
following adjustments: Cost of institutions with statewide impact like Apex Institutions and
Irrigation Department Reforms and Capacity Building is limited to one-third in the analysis. Cost
of the preparation for phase-II is excluded. Associated annual recurrent costs are included in the
analysis.

PAD estimated that across projects and farm sizes, increase in net income per farm due to project
at constant 2001 prices would vary from 58 to 92% in the project benefitted farms. FRR varied
from 13% for irrigated area intensification to 22% for irrigated area intensification and
diversification, with the inclusion of all sources of income.

Economic analysis was done in the PAD by using a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 for
internationally non-tradable project inputs and outputs. Parity prices are used for tradable inputs
(fertilizer) and commodities (paddy and wheat). Project costs are converted to economic costs
using the SCF. The ERR varied from 14.2% for irrigated area intensification to 25% for irrigated
area intensification and diversification, with the inclusion of all sources of income. The difference
between ERR and FRR is due to parity prices being higher than financial prices for the major
commodities like rice and wheat. The PAD documentation of cost benefits analysis in Annex 4 is
not clear about the CCA and irrigated area intensities. This discrepancy is observed in the PAD
main text also, making it difficult to assess the irrigated area impacts which is discussed in the
following pages.

B.      ICRR Estimation methodology

1.    The project rehabilitation and modernization interventions in the selected branch canal
command has expanded the irrigation coverage taking the gross irrigated area up to 180,400 ha by
the end of the project (EOP), an increase of 82% over the without project (WOP) situation.
Successful introduction of zaid season pulse crop has expanded the zaid cropped area, accounting
for 15% of the cropped land area. Agricultural intensification and diversification (AID)
interventions extensively promoted the adoption of improved crop production technologies in
about 40% of the area under cereals and oilseeds and 13% of the area under zaid pulses, which it


                                                 49
is assumed would be fully realized by year 10. Adoption of demonstrated crop technologies
helped in realizing higher crop productivity by about 29 to 54% across crops by EOP as
compared to WOP. Following similar methodology as adopted in the economic and financial
analysis (EFA) at appraisal, project benefits due to irrigated area expansion/intensification and
diversification are quantified using crop budgets for major crops, namely rice, wheat, mustard and
green gram. Intensification benefits captured the impact of expanded gross irrigated area due to
improved irrigation service following the system’s rehabilitation and modernization investments.
Diversification benefits captured enhanced crop productivity levels realized due to the adoption
of improved technologies, increased gross cropped area due to expansion in area under zaid crop,
enhanced adoption rate of the demonstrated technologies in cereals, pulses and oilseeds due to
intensive coverage under AID prorammes organized through WUAs. Drainage investments
helped to convert about 20930 ha of water logged area into cropped land area, which is estimated
based on landuse information (LANDSAT) for BL (2004/05) and EOP (2008/09). Incremental
crop productivity and income due to improved drainage is quantified and used in the EFA. Other
benefit sources, considered in the PAD EFA analysis are not considered in ICR analysis, since
canal based small hydros and VRS interventions were not taken up. Fisheries development
interventions resulted in the development of 67 ha of effective water spread area converted to fish
production but was not monitored for adoption, yield and income levels.

2. For cost benefit analysis, data from multiple sources are considered. PACT has organized
following studies11: Baseline (BL) indicators for state level using the secondary published data
with 2000/01 as the data reference year, BL study for pilot project area level indicators with
2005/06 as the data reference year, Initial impact evaluation study with 2006/07 as the data
reference year and Impact evaluation study with 2008/09 as the data reference year. BL and
impact evaluation studies covered 1419 project farmers and 264 control farmers. 43 minors are
represented in the project sample. PACT data/documents generated through the above sources
suffer from lack of representativeness, poor data quality and data analysis. Continuous guidance,
supervision and monitoring of these studies would have ensured objective assessment of project
specific impacts. For instance; (i) state level indicators based on secondary data at district level
are used in the impact indicator table by PACT, (ii) control sample has no canal irrigation
network but depends only on shallow tubewell irrigation which is not comparable to the project
sample where, rehabilitation and modernization investments are taken up in the existing canal
irrigation system, (iii) due to delayed implementation of rehabilitation works, no impact in
2006/07 can be attributed to the project interventions, (iv) all analysis and documentation done
through the above studies clubbed cropped area, yield, production and income while the project
has specifically targeted to expand the irrigated area, irrigation intensity, irrigated yield and
income, (v) latest impact evaluation study used 2008/09 data, while actual project impacts have
started showing up only afterwards. This is more so due to the field observations of the mission
during 2011/12, clearly indicating increased trends in irrigated area, crop yields and area under
pulses in zaid season. The mission also observed, during its field visits in March. 2012,
significant discrepancy in the irrigated area recorded by the department staff at the field level12.

3. ICRR EFA has used the PACT data compiled through in-house studies to capture the
irrigated area expansion, irrigation intensity improvement, irrigated crop productivity, irrigated
crop technology adoption, and increase in gross cropped area for the EOP assessment. As we
have these data only for 2008/09 for agriculture; and 2011/12 for irrigated area, quantified project
benefits for the ICR EFA are likely to be conservative. For BL and control, PAD EFA data,
supplemented with administrative agriculture data representing 25 blocks spread over four
districts in similar agroclimatic region (fully falling outside the UPWSRP Phase-I area), which
are now proposed by the PACT for UPWSRP Phase-II are used to quantify the project led
impacts.

4. Total project cost at constant 2011 prices is estimated at INR 9070 M. For ICRR EFA, the
same approach as in the PAD EFA has been followed in apportioning the component wise costs
which accounted for 88% of the total project costs. The analysis is done for 25-year project life
using 12% as opportunity cost of capital. Parity prices are estimated for tradable inputs and
outputs by taking the projected prices in constant USD for the mid-year of the project life and
converted to 2011 constant prices by using MUV index. PAD estimated costs and benefits are
also converted to 2011 prices for comparing with ICR results.

              Fig.1 Irrigated area impact (% of CCA)



This is the most critical variable driving the ICR EFA. Hence, quantification of irrigated area
impact is discussed briefly below. Refer to Table 1 for more details on this.

Base Line: PAD estimated CCA varies from 270,000 to 275,000 ha for Jaunpur Branch and
22,600 ha for Imamganj Branch. PACT got the CCA reassessed at 322,750 ha by Tahal for the
Jaunpur Branch. Total CCA is taken at 345,355 ha for both these branches. As against this, PACT
data showed that 109,740 ha was irrigated (average of three years-1998 to 2001) in both kharif
and rabi seasons under Jaunpur Branch command. In the absence of data for Imamganj Branch,
area irrigated by Imamganj Branch is estimated at 7,685 ha based on the Jaunpur Branch




                                                       51
experience. Hence, total average area irrigated13 by both these branches is 117,430 ha, 34% of the
total CCA of 345,355 ha being the BL situation.

With Project: Imamganj Branch was dropped and Haidergarh Branch was taken up along with the
Jaunpur Branch. CCA of Haidergarh Branch is 20,290 ha. Hence, total CCA has become 343,040
ha for the project as a whole. PACT data showed that 180,400 ha are irrigated during 2011/12,
which is 53% of the total CCA of 343,040 ha, taken as the WP situation.

Without Project: PACT data showed that the average quantity of water delivered to the project
area has come down during the project implementation period. Three year moving average
analysis indicated that the quantity for the period ending 2011, is 20% less than the BL quantity
for the period ending 2001. PACT data show that the average irrigated area for the period ending
2001 was 116,64014. Using the observed average water use efficiency ratio based on BL data on
irrigated area and quantity of water, WOP irrigated area by 2011/12 is estimated to adjust for the
reduced flow in the system. Estimated total irrigated area for WOP situation is 93,630 ha, which
is 27% of the total CCA.

To Sum-up;

i)        BL gross irrigated area in kharif and rabi is 117,430 ha, 34% of the CCA

ii)       WP gross irrigated area in kharif and rabi is 180,400 ha, 53% of the CCA

iii)      WOP gross irrigated area in kharif and rabi is estimated at 93,630 ha, 27% of the CCA

iv)     PAD projected incremental irrigated area is 106,275 ha, by expanding the gross irrigated
area to cover up to a maximum of 75% of the CCA as against the designed command of 115%
and BL irrigation coverage of 34% of the CCA. By EOP, the project has increased the irrigation
coverage up to 53% as against the WOP irrigation coverage estimated at 27% of the CCA.

v)      Incremental irrigated area impact due to the project by EOP is 86,770 ha, which is 82%
of the PAD projected target. More importantly, this is realized only from the later years due to the
delayed project implementation.

vi)      Both the Jaunpur and Haidergarh Branches have performed better with reduced water
flow in the system during the project period than BL situation, emphasizing the improved water
use efficiency due to the project interventions.




13
   Gross irrigated area includes the area irrigated by surface water as well as area under conjunctive water use, since
area is considered irrigated even if only one irrigation is provided from the canal system.



14
   Minor difference between 116,640 ha quoted here and 117,430 ha quoted under base line para is due to the minor
variation in the CCA of Imamganj Branch (dropped) and Haidergarh Branch (substitued). This variation in total CCA is
only 0.7% and hence ignored.




                                                           52
The latest trend in the irrigated area is one of increasing irrigated area as the rehabilitation and
reform based investment results have just started showing up. Recent PACT data (Sep 201115)
show that irrigated area has been showing increasing trend over the past couple of years, and,
even though this is most likely scenario in future, the current analysis pegs the irrigated area
coverage at 53% of CCA as observed now.

2. Agriculture technology adoption impacts:

Quantification of adoption rates is as follows. The project has organized crop demonstrations
extensively covering head, middle and tail reaches with two demonstrations in each location in
each minor in the project area for two consecutive years. A total of 36,000 demos backed with
field days, trainings and exposure visits exposed the demonstrated technologies to about 194,700
farmers. The project’s performance is impressive in exposing the improved production
technologies to more than half of the project area farmers, which occurred only after the scaling
up of demonstrations coverage from 2007 onwards. Equal emphasis was given to enhancing the
crop productivity in paddy, wheat and
mustard besides popularizing the
greengram in zaid season as a third crop
in the sequence. Improved seeds,                         Line Sowing
balanced fertilizer application, line
sowing and irrigation scheduling at                Balanced Nutrients
critical stages are the major components
of demonstration package focused by the           Optimum Irrigation
project. Adoption study conducted by
PACT covered the demonstration plot
                                                     Improved Seeds
and the extent of adoption by other
farmers. Analysis of 2008/09 adoption
data covering 1234 demonstrations on              Overall Technology
rice, wheat and green gram revealed the
following:                                                            0% 20%      40%     60%


i)      Technology adoption by the              Fig.2 WP Techology adoption rates, 2008/09

farmers ranged from 27 to 59% across
the technology components among the
major cereal crops rice and wheat
occupying 78% of the gross irrigated area and 8 to 17% for the technology components
demonstrated for green gram cultivation.

ii)     Averaged across components, about 45% of the farmers adopted one or more critical
technology components demonstrated for cereals and 15% in case of zaid season green gram.

iii)    WOP, crop demonstrations are organized by the department in the state, which are thinly
spread across large areas, resulting in an average ratio of one demo for 700 ha of cropped area. As
against this, average ratio achieved by the project is one demo for 25 ha of cropped area in the
project area. Intensive coverage in the project area is about 28 times better than the WOP

situation. Hence, the observed adoption impact in the project area is predominantly due to the
intensive demonstration coverage through AID interventions.

iv)     Based on this, adoption rates of 40% for rice, wheat and mustard and 13% for green gram
are considered for this analysis. Since this is based on 2008/09 data, the adoption rate is expected
to improve further and stabilize at a level higher than the levels used in this as witnessed during
mission’s field visits.

v)      But the demonstrations were scaled up only in the later years, and rehabilitation and
modernization works were also delayed to the later years. Adoption of agriculture technology is a
gradual process following the project-led AID interventions and rehabilitation investments.
Similar Bank funded project experiences suggest a period of 4 to 5 years for the adoption process
to pick-up and stabilize following the exposure to the demonstration package. To capture this, an
adoption matrix was constructed using the progression in AID and rehabilitation expenditure with
appropriate time lag. Based on this, adoption started only from PY-6 and will take about ten years
to reach the full adoption levels in the project area. For the remaining project life, adoption rates
are frozen at 40% for cereal and oilseed crops and 13% for greengram in zaid season.

3. Cropping intensity impacts:

Quantification of cropping intensity in the irrigated command area under the project is discussed
below.

As per the PACT data, WP average irrigated area (2011/12) is 87,820 ha in kharif and 92,580 ha
in rabi. Paddy is the dominant crop in kharif (100%). Wheat is the major crop in rabi (78%), and
the rest coming under mustard. Area under minor crops is captured through these major crops as
their proxies. Furthermore, the project has successfully introduced green gram as zaid crop
through AID interventions, which has started
spreading in the project area. About 30% of the Table-1 UPWSRP: Cropped area impacts
demos are allocated for zaid crop covering all        Impacts                     ICR (2011)
minors. PACT data has documented that about                                     WOP     WP
6% of the gross cropped area in the command has       Gross irrigated area (Ha) 93629   180400

against negligible share in BL16. This works out
                                                             Paddy               55%       48%

Jaunpur Branch command. The study has shown that overall cropping intensity in the command
area has increased by 14%, more or less equitably under the existing system conditions; ranging
from 19% in head, 13% in middle and 10% in tail reaches. This analysis has also documented that
double and triple cropped area in the command area has gone up by 21% after project
implementation.

As observed during the mission’s field visits, the project’s efforts to introduce zaid green gram
crop in the cropping sequence is becoming popular among the project farmers. However, based
on the PACT data for 2008/09, area under green gram in zaid season is limited to only 27,060 ha,
by end of project in 2011/12. With this, total cropped area in the project area for EFA is arrived at
207,460 ha. Shift in crop area from cereals to oilseeds and pulses are limited to 12%
(incremental) as against the PAD target of 25% (incremenal). In PAD EFA, cropping intensity is
kept constant for both WP and WOP situations.

mustard covering the period/seasons 2006 rabi to 2009 zaid. Compared to PAD projected crop
productivity impacts, paddy and pulses (green gram) registered higher productivity by 4 to 18%,
but wheat and mustard registered lesser productivity change by 10 to 12%. Farm net income
increased by 78% as against 67% projected at the time of appraisal.

5. Drainage impacts:

The project has improved drainage by rehabilitating 2,369 km of old drains in the Sarda Sahayak
Command area, including the masonry works6. Using the landuse information (LANDSAT) from
2004/05 and 2008/097, the PACT commissioned study calculated the water logged area and
conversion of water logged area into cropped area in the project command area. No agriculture
cropped area was observed in an area of 28,905 ha which remained water logged during 2004/05.
Water logging persisted in about 7,973 ha during 2008/09. Hence, improved drainage area is
estimated at 20,932 ha, which is 40% of the PAD projected area. PAD estimation was based on
WB funded UPSLRP experience. Kharif paddy is observed in 19,770 ha and rabi wheat in 15,020
ha following improved drainage interventions. For the analysis, we have taken 2/3rd of the area to
be under sustained cropping in kharif and rabi with continued maintenance of the rehabilitated
drains. Using the WOP crop budgets, incremental benefits due to improved drainage is
conservatively estimated at Rs 19,700 per ha of drained area and included in the EFA.

The estimated overall economic rate of return (ERR) is 17.6%, lower than the PAD projected
ERR of 24.8%. Similarly, overall project’s financial rate of return (FRR) is 16.6%, lower than the
PAD estimated FRR of 21.9% The estimated economic net present value (NPV) is INR 2,158 M
at a discount rate of 12% (same discount rate as in PAD), which is less by 2/3rd than the PAD

inflators. Major reasons for the wide deviations in the rate of return to investments are; (i) actual
increase in irrigated area less by 18%, (ii) delayed realization of incremental project benefits due
to time over runs18, (iii) realized diversification less by 40%, (iv) achieved productivity increase
is less by 12% for wheat and 10% for mustard as compared to the PAD projected targets and (v)
small hydros, MIS and VRS benefits are not considered. On the positive side, the project has
achieved higher crop productivity levels by 4 to 18% than the targeted levels in case of paddy and
pulses; better adoption of improved technologies in 36% of the cropped area; and spread of zaid
pulse crops in 15% of the project benefitted area. But, prolonged delay in the implementation of
project interventions delaying the realization of agriculture benefits and missed targets in irrigated
area, crop diversification area and wheat productivity more than offset the positive impacts by
pulling down the rate of return to the project investments. Farm financial income showed 78%
increase in the project benefited farms, which is 16% more than the PAD target, but spread of
benefits was limited to about 80% of the PAD targeted farmer beneficiaries.

E.       Financial income, poverty alleviation and employment impacts
The project benefitted about 401,000 farm households by enhancing their average annual
financial income by Rs 11,325 per ha due to project interventions. This is aided by increased
irrigation coverage up to 47% of the CCA, cropping intensity by 15% mainly due to the
introduction of zaid pulse crops, and crop productivity by 29 to 54% in case of cereals, oilseed
and pulses. Equity in distribution of irrigation benefits and the breadth of stakeholder
participation have improved as evidenced by the inhouse studies. For instance, double cropped
area has increased across head, middle and tail locations, accounting for 38%, 57% and 5% of the
incremental double cropped area as documented in the special study conducted by the project in
the Jaunpur branch5. With an annual farm income of Rs 14,500 (WOP) per ha, only farms with a
holding size of more than 3.3 ha can support the entire family of six persons (depending only on
farm income), to be above poverty line19. With an annual farm income of Rs 25,820 (WP), farm

   Cumulative project expenditure on the rehabilitation of canals and drainage systems accounted for only 26% during
the first six years (2002/03 to 2007/08) as against 68% accounted during the next three years (2008/09 to 2010/11). But,
agriculture intensification and diversification interventions peaked in 2004/05. All these resulted in the delayed
realization of the agriculture benefits in the project area.

   Annual per capita income needed to be above poverty line is defined at Rs 7,990 at 2011 prices for rural U.P
families. (Ref: Report of the Expert Group to Review the Methodology for Estimation of Poverty, Planning

       holdings with more than 1.9 ha can support the entire family of six persons to be above poverty
       line. Among the total farms, about 10% are falling between the holding sizes 1.9 ha and 3.3 ha.
       Hence, project led improved farm income at 2011 prices has the potential of lifting about 40,100
       farms above the poverty line due to the project interventions. This is about 15% less than the
       PAD projected target. The project has generated 16,580 person jobs, providing sustainable on-
       farm employment for about one-tenth of landless agricultural laborers in the project area, through
       irrigated area expansion and agriculture intensification impacts.

      (a) SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND
             RESULTS REPORT ON UTTAR PRADESH WATER SECTOR
                      RESTRUCTURING PROJECT-PHASE-1
   1- General:
1.1 While recognizing water resource as a State subject, and addressing to its specific requirements,
     and need of it being in consonance with the "National Water Policy?, the U.P. State adopted a
     State Water Policy in year 1999 with a structured frame work for sectoral reforms. The broad
     objective of the policy is to ensure preservation and optimize the resources utilization,
     management system improvement, community and users’ participation, equity and social
     justice, basin/sub-basin as unit of development, built up effective MIS system and legal
     framework etc. To achieve the objectives of the State Water Policy, the G.O.U.P. have received
     a credit from IDA towards the cost of Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project
     (UPWSRP) through Government of India.
1.2 The project embedded in a 15 to 20 years programmatic framework focuses on (i) institutional
     and policy framework development for state-wide water sector reform; and (ii) the irrigation
     and drainage subsector reform among the various water-related sub-sectors. UPWSRP, Phase-I
     was initiated in year 2002 and completion extended up to October 2011. The project was
     implemented through various structured components in 3.43 lac hectares culturable command
     area of Haidergarh Branch (upto Km. 22.980) and Jaunpur Branch Canal Systems in Ghaghra-
     Gomti basin in Barabanki, Lucknow, Raebareli, Sultanpur, Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Nagar,
     Pratapgarh, and Jaunpur districts.
1.3 The mandates, implementation status and impacts are discussed component wise in the
     following para. Since UPWSRP Phase -1 was a pilot Project with new concepts involving
     multi-sectoral activity, new procurement procedures and approach, the Engineers and the Staff
     working in this project had to adopt in a new environment of involving the stake holder /
     farmers and new procedure of financial management and book keeping. It was a learning
     phase. The methodology was a novelty for most of the engineers and staff of this project.
     In spite of various constraints and limitations, the project was implemented successfully as is
     evident from the following summarized brief gist of achievements:-

2-    Financial Details:

    Application System requires priority.


3.8 Component C-1: Jaunpur Branch Sub-basin Development and Management Board
    (JBSDMB); Imamganj Branch              Sub-basin Development and Management Board
    (IBSDMB): JBSDMB has been established for taking decisions regarding planning and
    management of water resources in the sub basin area. The Imamganj Branch has been omitted
    from the project in June 2005. Creation and functioning of JBSDMB has created enough
    awareness among the users through meetings held at division level providing a platform for
    interaction between the user and service provider. Public representatives have been nominated



                                                     63
     and also includes water users/stake holders/ citizens. A 15 member Management Committee is
     authorized to take all decisions on behalf of the Board and to prepare Perspective Plans/Annual
     Plans for all uses of water, development and management for the sub-basin. SWaRA provides
     assistance in formulating the sub-basin water plans. A permanent office building of JBSDMB has
     been constructed at Sultanpur. The technical and administrative support to the board is provided
     by Superintending Engineer, Sultanpur. District level committee’s have also been formed under
     District Magistrate. District level officers of different departments, stake holders and NGO’s are
     the members of the committee. The main objective of the committee is to prepare water plan at
     district level.


3.9 Component C-2: Decision Support Systems; Identification of Issues and options for Water-
    related Development in these-two Sub-basins: This activity envisaged issues and option for
    optimal, socially and environmentally sustainable development of the water resources of the JBS
    and IBS to be identified through development of a decision support system for the JBS and IBS.
    Imamganj Branch Sub-basin had been excluded in June 2005 from this project. DSS has been
    developed to create spatial knowledge base for integrated water resources management; to
    identify “Issues and Options?; to evaluate the major related issues for the entire GG basin, micro
    sub-basins and develop the basin DSS.; to prepare the “Basin Water Resources Master Plan? for
    GG basin. A Basin Social and Environmental Assessment has been undertaken for the GG basin
    as part of the DSS to mainstream social and environmental issues through the Social and
    Environmental Management Plan. It was anticipated that the BSEA and SEMP would provide the
    essential inputs into the preparation of the overall basin development plans, which would guide
    investment decisions in the basin. Under BSEA, a sector knowledge and information base has
    been developed for multi-sectoral planning, priority setting and to give a framework for project
    preparation.


3.10 Component C-3: Canal Based Small Hydro: This activity envisaged development and setting
    up by UPID, a state of the art canal based small Hydros power station at Imamganj Branch
    canal in village Kakaraha, district Bahraich. However this could not materialize due to non
    availability of assured water and this work was not taken up.



3.11 Component C-4: Rainwater Harvesting and Conservation and Development of small water
     bodies: This activity envisaged improvement of village ponds to cater to drinking water needs of
     the population and livestock; promote aquaculture development; and provide additional irrigation
     water either directly or through recharge of groundwater. Rehabilitation and improvement of
     village ponds owned by Gram Panchayats and construction of check dams on drains have been
     undertaken. Construction of 18 check dams and rehabilitation of ponds in Sultanpur, Pratapgarh
     and Jaunpur districts have been completed in the areas showing continuous decline and deep
     water level over the years. These structures will not only conserve the rainwater and recharge the
     ground water in long-term but also cater the need of local population and livestock in the lean
     period and retain runoff of the catchment also. These structures will be handed over to groups of
     farmers, who will share available water, keep records and maintain the structures. Further, 884
     piezometers (500 automatic and 384 manual) have been installed. Data analysis has been done by
     SWaRA. 18 new ponds for fish-farming have been developed. Fish culture activities were
     initiated under the project in 94 small ponds of 67 hectares of pond area of varying sizes during
     the year 2007-08 and 2008-09. The demonstrations and the training provided to the fishing
     community have created a great scope of fisheries development in the fishing community in the


                                                    64
     project area through fish farmer groups. The fisheries development in the project area has now
     been tied with U.P. fisheries department. A total of 6 wetlands having 106.85 ha area were
     selected in the project area. Joint walkthrough with DOF/PACT was conducted at Hallor,
     Bariyarpur, Tamolia, Bhuwalpur, Moongtal, and Hardoiya for its feasibility status and reports and
     Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared. Block level wetland atlas on GIS
     format has been prepared and is being used. Water quality has been assessed for 3 wetlands of
     JBS (Two at Pratapgarh and One at Raebareli) for its general information and is being used.
3.12 Component D-1: Rehabilitation and Modernization of Irrigation System:
3.12.1 This activity envisaged bringing irrigation system to design condition, its modernization,
     volumetric dispensation on canals and monitoring performance of the system. The target area for
     project intervention was Jaunpur Branch, Haidergarh Branch (from head to Km.22.600) and
     Bahraich distributary off taking from Imamganj Branch canal (deleted later). All the conveyance
     channels were in dilapidated state. Rehabilitation work included re-sectioning of canals, repairs of
     masonry works, metalled road on service road, new masonry works as required. All construction
     work was subjected to third party supervision and quality control. Rehabilitation and
     modernization of the canals system in the project area has been carried out through community
     participation at all stages. In order to ensure that the benefits of the reform measures reach the
     poor masses, a Social and environmental Management Plan for GG Basin was finalized.
     Underprivileged section’s participation was ensured by inducting them into Kulaba Samitis and
     WUAs. Manual on construction and maintenance of minors was developed and distributed to
     each WUAs. 46 Orientation Workshops on this manual were conducted in all the Project
     divisions. Around 1949 WSHGs were adopted/ formed and nurtured under the project. Capacity
     building of WUAs, PTT and UPID were done through WALMI. Capacity Building of SHGs on
     Group functioning and group management were done along with their exposure trips to
     successful experiences of PIM. 40 Cluster level Convergence. Workshops with other line
     departments were organized. Further 81 Cluster level Convergence camps were also organized.
     Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation systems covering a gross command of nearly 6 lac
     hectares and CCA of about 3.43 lac hectares were chosen for piloting reform of irrigation systems.
     Haidergarh Branch command from Km. 0.00 to Km. 22.98 and Jaunpur Branch Canal Sub Basin
     were identified for piloting the reform programs. 22.98 Km length of Haidergarh Branch, 119.74
     Km. length of Jaunpur Branch was rehabilitated. Similarly 827 Km. long distributaries and 1584
     Km. long minors were also rehabilitated. Metalled road in 14.98 Km. length on H.G. Branch and
     in 119.02 Km. on Jaunpur Branch was provided. As modernization measure, 463 new/modified
     gates have been provided on the canals systems. 150 measuring structures on minors were
     constructed. A new concept, for the first time in the country, of clubbing the direct outlets on
     branch canals was implemented in 109.558 Km. length. Fixed type Velocity profilers, 1 no. on
     Haidergarh Branch, 3 Nos. on Jaunpur Branch and 1 No. on head of Deeh dy. has been installed
     for canal flow measurement. In addition 2 nos. portable profilers have been procured. Four X-
     regulators on Jaunpur branch were rebuilt with new design. One no. new (additional) cross
     regulator was built on Deeh dy. 41 Duckbill Weirs for control of water surface has been
     constructed. A number of checks drops and crest walls on dys. and minors were constructed to
     ensure water surface elevation control. A very special feature has been to install Orifice Module
     flow regulation and measurement system on the minor canals of the project area. The first lot (18
     no.) of these modules has been procured and are being installed. The existing faulty configuration
     of the wing of the Deeh Dy. H.R. and return wing of Haidergarh branch H.R. were also rectified
     after model studies. 7603 Nos. redesigned semi modular pipe outlets with head and tail walls
     have been provided on dys. and minors of the command for equitable water distribution.
3.12.2 Evaluation by independent consultant indicates that the construction of parallel canal, duckbill
     weirs, de-silting of the canals and improvising conditions of canal bed etc., helped in improving



                                                     65
     the distribution of water in all reaches of the canals / minors. An analysis of households data
     conducted for year 2008-09 was compared with the results of year 2005-06 in Jaunpur branch
     indicates that the project interventions including structural interventions with participation of
     farmers and their awareness in managing water through WUAs helped to succeed to a greater
     extent in bringing water equity distribution in all reaches and resolving various issues. The
     availability of canal water in Jaunpur Branch during this period has not only improved in all
     reaches but also benefitted even the farmers in tail reaches. Availability of water by percent
     households in Jaunpur Branch in head, mid and tail reaches has increased from 36%, 34%, 19%
     in year 2005-06 to 55%, 48%, 46% in year 2008-09 respectively. About 47% of the selected
     farmers are using the improved irrigation techniques. Gross irrigated area as percentage of GSA
     irrigated (canal only and canal & other sources) has been reported to have increased from 48.7%,
     52.7% in 2005-06 to 52.1%, 67.7% in year 2008-09 respectively.
3.13 Component D-2: Rehabilitation and Modernization of Drainage System:
3.13.1 The command was also having inefficient and poorly maintained drainage systems, heavily
     silted with extensive weed growth and obstructions. Rehabilitation and modernization of the
     drainage system under Haidergarh Branch and Jaunpur Branch Canal Command area has been
     carried out involving the farmers/stake holders. All rehabilitation and modernization designs of
     the drainage system were reviewed and approved by a high level Review Committee of the
     project. Quality control was ensured by subjecting all the construction work to third party
     supervision. 2369 Km. long drains were rehabilitated and 398 bridges were constructed.
3.13.2 Evaluation by independent Consultant indicates that the project interventions have successfully
     mitigated the natural distortion of the ecology like flooding, water logging, high water table and
     prolonged excessive soil moisture in the field after monsoon. There were indications of improved
     drainage of sub-surface water.
3.14 Component D-3: Agriculture Intensification and Diversification:
3.14.1 UPWSRP aims at alleviation of poverty by increasing productivity of irrigated agriculture.
     Conjunctive use of surface and ground water is the key for optimization of sustainable agriculture
     and environmental conservation. A modern agriculture plan for the project was prepared by the
     design consultants who brought out the broad features of agriculture intensification and
     diversifications along with crop rotation and cropping intensities. These proposals also included a
     detailed crop water requirement analysis. A detailed ground water availability and quality study
     in micro sub basins of the project was also carried out to facilitate planning of the conjunctive use
     of surface and ground water. Ground water level changes in the command area are being
     monitored through a total of 884 Piezometers (500 automatic and 384 manual) installed in the
     project command. Modest increase in yield has been contemplated which is closer to state
     average and is achievable in phases up to project completion. For rice and wheat, improvement in
     yields by 28% to 34% respectively by completion of the project was anticipated. Thus more area
     could be released for diversifying into fruits and vegetable cropping besides allocating more
     resources for livestock enterprises. PACT initiated the AIDP activities in year 2006-07 for one
     minor and expanded it gradually to 20 minors, then 396 and finally to 421 minors formulizing
     linkages between agriculture and water sector. The main activities were under taken to utilize the
     increased irrigation in enhancing the cropping intensification and diversification to cash crop and
     other activities. Improved package of agricultural practices has been practiced in the command
     area to increase the crop productivity focusing primarily on 1.Quality seeds and Seed
     Replacement, 2.Balance fertilizer, 3.Timely Sowings/Transplanting, 4.Proper Plant spacing,
     5.Proper Placement of Seed & Fertilizer, 6.Timely Irrigation through Conjunctive Use of Water,
     7. Eco-Friendly Pest Management. Demonstrations were conducted at farmer’s field in head,
     middle and tail reaches of minor canals, keeping average size of demonstrations plot as 0.4



                                                      66
     hectare. Capacity building of farmers was also undertaken through field days, trainings and
     exposure visits in which 169071, 23277 and 2325 farmers participated respectively. The Rice
     Intensification System, popular in South India has now been introduced for the first time in the
     project command area. The banana cultivation has been introduced in the project area for the first
     time which has emerged as a very remunerative horticultural crop for diversification. The
     improved package of practices included the cultivation of leguminous short duration crops during
     Zaid following with Paddy in Kharif and Wheat in Rabi seasons. For soil conditioning, an
     important aspect of soil improvement, the farmers have taken up the Vermi-Compost
     demonstrations. This sustainable package of practice has not only increased the productivity but
     also conditioned the soil. The demonstrations with suggested cropping pattern have been repeated
     on most of the minors for two consecutive years. Now from year 2009 Zaid the interventions are
     initiated on outlets off taking directly from distributaries / branch. The outcome of the agricultural
     interventions is very encouraging. Rice and Wheat demonstrations have shown that by adopting
     package of improved agricultural practices the yields have been doubled. With the help of NGO
     workers adoption status of improved practices demonstrated in Rice and Wheat have been carried
     out which shows satisfactory rate. The farmers obtained an average yield of Moong 6.28 q/ha
     against the project area average of 6.13 q/ha., Rice 26.26 q/ha against the project area average of
     18.91 q/ha; Wheat 39.03 q/ha against the project area average of 26.39 q/ha. The yield obtained in
     moong is 2.45% higher, rice is 38.87% higher and wheat is 47.86% higher than the project area
     average.
3.14.2 Survey conducted by the Consultants shows marked improvement in land put under cultivation
     i.e. increase from 87.8% (2005-06) to 91.1% (2008-09). Similarly 87.3 percent of the total owned
     land was cultivated during kharif, 81.2 percent during rabi and 10 percent in zaid in 2008 -09 as
     against 84.5, 74.6 and 0.01 percent of the total owned land by the farmers respectively during
     2005-06. The cropping intensity in the project area during 2008-09 was observed 194.4 percent as
     against 181.64 (2006-07) and 152.3 percent during the pre-project period (2001-02) thus showing
     42.2 percent increase in the cropping intensity over 2001-02 and 12.86 percent over 2006-07.
     There was a reorientation of the cropping in the project area which indicates farmers’ interest for
     other high value crops also. The comparison with the status of 2006-07 to 2008-09 indicates the
     reduction in the share of Paddy in the Gross Sown Area from 46 to 40 percent, with the
     replacement by pulses, oilseeds and other short duration crops with high yields. There was a
     reduction in the share of wheat also in the GSA from 45 to 37 percent. The area was replaced by
     oilseeds, pulses and other commercial crops. An increase in the coverage of net sown area was
     reported from 87.8 percent (2005-06) to 91.1 percent (2008-09). The coverage of kharif crops of
     CCA increased from 84.5 percent (2005-06) to 87.3 percent (2008-09) and Rabi crops from 74.6
     (2005-06) to 81.2 percent (2008-09) resulting in the improved cropping intensity from 189.5
     (2006-07) to 194.4 percent (2008-09). The factors responsible for bringing positive impact due to
     project activities were improved drainage of sub-surface water; better water delivery covering
     larger area; better water management including conjunctive use of canal and ground water;
     adoption of improved technology which may be the outcomes of trainings, exposure visits, crop
     demonstrations and other motivational programs; improved awareness of farmers. Consumption
     of chemical fertilizers worked out at 184.3 kg per hectare for GSA as against 168.3 during 2006-
     07. During 2000-01 the fertilizer consumption was only 110 kg per ha. As a result of project
     interventions the farmers are motivated to adopt more balanced nutrient application for better
     production. The project has succeeded in this direction and the ratio of N: P: K use has improved
     from the level of 7:2:1 (2005-06) to 6:3:1 (2008-09). It was reported from the impact assessment
     that there is significant increase in the productivity of all the crops grown in the area. The
     productivity of rice increased to 27.48 qtl/ha (2008-09) from the level of 20.88 qtl/ha (2006-07).
     Similarly, the productivity of wheat also increased from 27.47 qtl/ha to 33.9 qtl/ha. The average
     annual family income per farm or household in PPA works out to Rs. 67,286 as against Rs.



                                                      67
     47,068 during 2006-07 showing an increase of 43 percent. In the control area the corresponding
     figure is Rs. 42,402 which is about 37 percent less than the PPA. The average annual total cost
     per farm works out to about Rs. 63,000 on the basis survey in PPA. Between the two branch
     canals, the average cost per farm i.e. Rs.63,763 in Jaunpur branch was higher than that of
     Haidergarh branch (Rs. 61,161). Break up of total costs between fixed cost and variable cost in
     PPA shows that the annual fixed capital cost per farm in the PPA is Rs. 29,628 and total variable
     cost is Rs.33,954 during 2008-09. These figures are higher than that of 2006-07 due to increase in
     depreciation, maintenance and higher input prices and their increased utilization. The average
     annual net farm income per hectare (which includes gross crop income, income from milk income
     from rentals, etc) in the project area works out to Rs 26,464 as against Rs 21,161 during 2006-07,
     showing an increase of about 25 percent whereas it was about 50 percent more than that of
     control area in 2008-09. Gross value of the crops produced (Rs. per hectare) in the project area is
     Rs 59,451 as against Rs. 35,567 an increase of 67 percent. The gross farm crop production value
     is about 16 percent more in the project area compared to the control area.
3.15 Component D-4: MANAGEMENT OPTIONS: The State Water Policy and the Project as well,
     envisage Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM). Government made a resolution to
     implement PIM on canal irrigation system for efficient and optimum use of water and thereafter
     issued an order in Jan’2001 for the formation of WUAs at minor level. Accordingly 396 WUAs
     were formed in phase-I area. Again 4678 kulaba samitis at outlet level and 421 alpika samiti at
     minor level were constituted under the revised government order. These WUAs were provided
     with command area maps and other documents for familiarizing with the inventory and terrain of
     command area. MOU was signed between WUAs and UPID to conduct operation and
     maintenance. To reinforce the concept of PIM and WUAs, Participatory Irrigation Management
     Act was notified in February’2009 and subsequently rules were notified in March’2010. Election
     was conducted at outlet, minor and distributary level by UPID. The impact of election conducted
     created a phenomenal awareness about PIM among the farmers. Out of 8978 outlets in the project
     area 8858 outlet committees have been constituted. Out of 421 minors, 407 minor committees and
     398 federated minor level committees have been constituted. Further, out of 31 distributaries in
     the project area 28 distributary committees were formed. This provides WUAs as a legal entity
     and a sense of ownership of WUAs and thereby PIM by UPID.The management of all
     distributaries and minors has been handed over to the respective WUAs. PIM cells at divisions,
     circles and E.-in-C. level have been established Five standard training modules vis-a-vis roles and
     responsibilities of WUAs & UPID; details about PIM cell; financial management; water
     management; and execution of civil works were developed and training imparted to WUAs.
     Extensive capacity building program for WUAs was conducted by WALMI. Capacity building
     program were conducted for UPID officials also. 8 layer GIS maps vis-a-vis base map, kulaba
     command map, warabandi, khasra map, kharif and rabi cropping pattern map, soil fertility map
     and cartosat map were prepared and provided to WUAs.
3.16 Component E: Feasibility Study for UPWSRP-Phase II: With the completion of the UPWSRP
     Phase-1, the State has initiated the UPWSRP Phase-II. The Concept Document of UPWSRP
     Phase-II has been cleared by Ministry of Water Resources; D.E.A. Ministry of Finance; and
     Planning Commission, Govt. of India and also cleared by the World Bank for Credit assistance.
     Project Report & Implementation Plan of UPWSRP Phase-II costing approximately Rs. 4,944.53
     crores is under examination at Govt. of U.P. level. The CCA proposed for intervention is 9.04 lac
     ha. in GGBasin and 7.35 lac ha. in Bundelkhand Region. Survey of H.G. Branch (Km. 22.980
     D/s) and Rohini, Jamni, Sajnam dam canal systems are underway for making and floating bids in
     the first year of phase-II. TOR for SS Feeder study is also under preparation. Agreement for
     consultancy services for preparation of SEMP of Bundelkhand region and updation of SEMP of
     GG Basin has been drawn and work is under progress. 50 Piezometers are to be installed.
     Agriculture plan on 4 distributaries in phase-I area for proposed OFD works through WUAs to


                                                     68
     derive full benefits is under preparation. Preparation of Voter list for conducting elections for
     WUAs formation in Bundelkhand is in progress. Implementing agencies for activities of proposed
     Project (Chiefships, Circles, Divisions with jurisdictions), line departments have been identified.
3.17 Component F : Project Coordination & Monitoring: A Project Activity Core Team (PACT)
     headed by Chairman (Secretary, Irrigation rank) and having a Technical Advisor, Chief Engineer,
     with host of experts and support staff drawn from UPID, line departments and from out sourcing
     on contractual basis was established to implement the Project. As per the guidelines of the World
     Bank, consultants were engaged for monitoring the activities and quality assurance. For
     Monitoring and Evaluation, impact indicators were developed. The consultant has also developed
     web enabled Project Management and Monitoring Information System (PMMIS) software to
     assist PACT for monitoring the components of project; to evaluate progress online and
     performance monitoring of project activities. Cohesive integration of project officials, capacity
     building of stake holders, transparent working, constraint redressal, ensuring effective
     participation of stake holders in review meetings, creating congenial environment for better
     performance., weekly desk and field monitoring, corporate functioning with due logistic facilities,
     adherence to instructions issued by GOI, GOUP & WB, orientation of contractor with work
     culture of World Bank projects, ensuring timely release of payments against work done,
     maintaining punctuality and discipline with better motivation and mobilization at all levels were
     the strategies adopted during project period. Financial Management System (CPFMS) software
     has been installed at PACT office, in 08 Divisional office and in 03 offices (SWaRA, WALMI
     UPDASP) and the concerning staff trained (Year 2006-2008). CPFMS software is properly
     working for accounting and reporting purposes at head office.

4-   Lessons Learnt:
4.1 Since UPWSRP Phase -1 was a pilot Project with new concepts involving multi-sectoral activity,
    new procurement and financial management procedures and approach, the officers/officials
    working in this project had to adopt to a new environment. It was a learning phase. In spite of
    various constraints and limitations, the project was implemented successfully as is evident from
    the above summary. The assessment carried out by different independent agencies has reported
    strong positive impact of the project activities in the project implementation area. Marked
    improvement in majority of segments has encouraged to upscale and replicate the interventions in
    new areas of the State.
4.2 However, the project in initial stage was delayed. Engaging the contractor/consultancy for survey
     and design should have been done at the outset, which was delayed by more than two years.
     Rehabilitation of canal and drainage works was delayed by more than three years. Time lines
     could not be controlled. The cause of delay can be attributed to lack of monitoring, experienced
     and trained staff and experts, frequent changes at senior management level, attrition of engineers
     and staff, frequent transfers, dual charges, unfilled vacancies. There was initial delay in
     establishing and making institutional mechanism functional by filling the various posts in
     SWaRA and SWaRDAC. UPWaMReC ACT was passed in year 2008 and established but this
     entity remained non operational. SWaRA and SWaRDAC remained as a UPID establishment and
     still require recognition and importance. GIS based maps for WUAs were prepared but the basin
     plan could not be prepared and finalized in time. Although SWaRA and SWaRDAC are involved
     in identifying issues and putting proposal and specific impact assessment studies of ground water;
     but implementation of its assessment and suggestions based on studies at ground level are yet to
     start. GG Basin Development Board entity could not be established. JBSDMB was established
     but not yet functional. Motivation and initiative is required to make the Board functional. District
     Sub-basin Water Management and Development Committee in Districts under the Project area
     have been established but require motivation to take interest in water management issues, and



                                                     69
alternative cropping pattern based on water availability. DSS of distributaries and minors are to
be adequately implemented. The concept remained unimplemented. Although Social and
Environmental Management Plans were developed after assessment but significant identified
issues could not be effectively implemented. Capacity of IDUP’s trained officials remained under
utilized. Further, need based training and upgrading of survey and other equipment inventory
should be done in continuity. WALMI should be made Center of Excellence. Delay in initial 4-5
years in professional Financial Management of the project and related software and its training
were not desired. Implementation of developed MIS application system of UPID should be given
priority. Mechanism for real data collection and its entry into the modules should get priority.
Information System Organization of UPID should be strengthened. Voluntary Retirement Scheme
was not taken up. During initial stages, WUAs of 40 focus minors were formed and trained,
however, their work and responsibility was not clear, as such they could not progress up to year
2005. Handing over of canal management to new WUAs started after enactment of new PIM Act.
However, further training of WUAs is required. The delay in completion of UPWSRP Phase-1
was also due to initial delay in completion of Joint Walk-through survey. Two different
Consultants were engaged for Survey work and Design of civil works for rehabilitation of canal
and drainage systems. Under PPP activity in AIDP, Haidergarh Chini Mill was associated as
partner but the arrangement could not go a long way. Selection of potential partner and scope of
work are key to success for P.P.P. It is proposed to identify willing agencies with the help of local
administration in each district in phase-II for implementation of PPP on selected distributary
canals. AIDP was initially entrusted to UPDASP. However due to their exit, the above activities
were implemented by PACT, but experienced associate and support staff was not provided in
offices. The interventions in Animal Husbandry could not be taken up. Before initiating the
interventions, appropriate cadre of associates for agriculture, animal husbandry, economics and
horticulture at PACT and duly qualified support staff at divisional level along with experienced
workers at field level should have been created and trained to work in project mode. Continuity of
sustainable capacity building of farmers for adaption of better practices and efficient water use
are necessary. A host of under Ground Water Activities was carried out; however DSS
Implementation could not be done. The systematic implementation of conjunctive use of water in
the project area has great potential and need to be developed and promoted. Fish culture on some
selected ponds couldn’t sustain. The fisheries development in the project area should have been
tied with U.P. fisheries department to not only improve and control the process but also to ensure
its sustainability. Participation in conservation of rain water was lacking in Phase-I.

(b) PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUTURE OPERATION OF THE
    PROJECT:

     In UPWSRP Phase-2, it has been proposed to continue with the development of model
distributary plans of Phase-1 area endorsed by the WUAs and also with modernization of the
selected four distributaries namely Daulatpur Dy., Shahmau Dy., Gopalpur Dy. and Chilbila Dy.
Systems with installation of SCADA and telemetry systems and also saturating the command area
with development of On-Farm Activities.
     Also, rehabilitation and modernization works of Haidergarh Branch (Km. 22.980 D/s) system,
Dariyabad Branch system, Sultanpur Branch system, Azamgarh Branch system, and Shahganj
Branch system of Sarda Sahayak Command area and Ken canal system, Arjun canal system,
Chandrawal Dam canal system, Kabrai Dam canal system, Rohini Dam canal system, Jamini
Dam canal system, Sajnam Dam canal system, Barua Dam canal system of Bundelkhand region
and FMIS works in Rapti basin and MIS modernization and implementation of P.I.M. Act and
formation of WUAs in remaining area of U.P. state have been included in UPWSRP Phase-2.
     Regarding proposed arrangements for the future operation of the UPWSRP Phase-2, it has
been agreed that rehabilitation and modernization works will be executed under control of


                                                 70
concerning Chief Engineer (Sharda Sahayak) and Chief Engineer (Betwa) and the proposed
agricultural, horticultural, ground water, social /rural development, minor irrigation and On-Farm
activities will be executed through the concerned line departments of U.P. State. The
multidisciplinary Project Activity Core Team (PACT) headed by Chairman with technical and
subject matter experts constituted by the U.P. Govt. vide Govt. order no. 7263/2001-27-SI-4
dated 24-10-2010, for the UPWSRP will have the specific functions of coordination of
implementation of the project with project implementation units, monitoring and evaluation,
Procurement of consultancies, implementation of proposed trainings, arrangement of budget from
State Govt., allocation and all financial management along with processing all sanctions from the
Steering and Executive committees and line agencies, including coordinating with Govt. of India
and the World Bank and financial reimbursements. It is proposed that the project work related all
officers/offices will be under control of PACT. In Phase-1 an independent agency was procured
for quality control as per World Bank guidelines. In Phase-2, one Superintending engineer/Circle
and one division each for monitoring of quality control of works under Chief Engineer (Sharda
Sahayak) and Chief Engineer (Betwa) have been proposed.
