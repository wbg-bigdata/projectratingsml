MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEhDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR THE MAHAKALI IRRIGATION II PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed deve-
lopment credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for SDR 29.9 million (USS 41.3
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance
irrigation sector investments, flood rehabilitation and institutional
development support.
2.       Background.  Agriculture, largely rainfed, dominates Nepal's
economy. In 1986-87, it accounted for 59Z of GDP, contributed about 70Z
of total export earnings, and provided employment to 912 of the working
population. However, during the Fast decade, per capita food production
has fallen, as the production of foodgrains has grown at only 1.52 per
year compared to population growth of 2.6Z annually. For growth in
agricultural production to keep pace with population, irrigated area needs
to expand by an estimated additional 35,000 ha each year. Under Nepal
conditions, much of this development will consist of small groundwater and
surface schemes. Current HMGN and IDA irrigation subsector strategy
focuses on expansion or rehabilitation of existing systems, improvements
in the efficiency of existi.ig faciliti2s particularly through more
effective operation and maintenance (C&M), prcvision of adequate
agricultural support services and institutional development to strengthen
the capacities of key implementing agencies.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA assistance enables HMGN to
exploit irrigation potential more rapidly, facilitates coordination among
donors who support irrigation development in Nepal, and assists HMGN with
introduction of new concepts of design, planning and operation of
irrigation schemes. In line with HMGN's c'irrent strategy, a key concept
is increased farmer participation and responsibility in irrigation
development and management. This is essential to reduce HMGN budgetary
requirements for O&M and to enable concentration of limited budget
resources on activities that farmers cannot assume. However, the concept
is largely new to Nepal's irrigation establishment, and the proposed
project is designed to help establish farmer organization and
participation as an integral part of DOI irrigation development programs.
With regard t( the Mahakali Stage II component, IDA involvement would help
ensure that, in the transition from construction to full system operation,
these innovations are institutionalized by the project authority and made
permanent. The Line of Credit pilot project would also provide timely
support to develop HMGN's new strategy into an operating sector investment
program. For the Flood Rehabilitation component, the proposed project
provides a ready vehicle for IDA support of emergency repairs to recently
damaged river protection and irrigation works. The Institutional
evelopment Support component is designed to help DCJI develop th.e
necessary capabilities to implement a large scale subsector program, and
in particular establish farmer organization and participation as an
integral part of DOI operations.



-2-
4.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project aims to: (a) raise
agricultural production and farm income through expansion and management
improvement of a public irrigation system, through construction and
rehabilitation of private farmer-managed irrigation schem-s, and through
restoration of irrigation schemes and river protection works damaged by
August 1987 floods; (b) improve O&M and cost recovery in the project areas
through inter alia increased farmer participation; and (c) strengthen
Nepal's irrigation subsector.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed project would comprise four
components: the 6,800 ha Mahakali Stage II project; the Irrigation Line
of Credit pilot component sxpected to cover an estimated 9,000 ha, mainly
rehabilitation and improvement of existing farmer-managed schemes;
emergency Flood Rehabilitation of river protection and irrigation works
damaged in the August 1987 floods; and Institutional Development Support
for DOI. DOI would be the lead implementing agency.
6.       The Mahakali Stage II component would extend the existing main
canal and construct irrigation and drainage works for the 6,800 ha Stage
II area located some 20 km from Stage I. The component also includes
groundwater facilities, flood protection works, roads, offices and staff
houses, vehicles and equipment, incremental O&M, farmer organization,
agricultural intensification, and technical assistance. The Line of
Credit component would finance small and medium scale subprojects for
construction of new schemes, rehabilitation of existing schemes and
groundwater development. All Line of C-edit subprojects would be group-
operated and located in the Narayani basin portion of one Terai and three
Hill districts of the Western Region. Subproject identification,
preparation, appraisal and approval would be delegated to a local
institution and carried out under agreed guidelineb and procedures;
however, IDA confirmation/approval would be required for the first two
subprojects of each type. The Flood Rehabilitation component would
restore damaged flood protection and irrigation works. The Institutional
Development Support component would provide additional resources and
technical assistance required to strengthen DOI especially for
implementing the Line of Credit component.
7.       Riparian Issues.  Under IDA's policy, notification of India
regarding the use of water from the Mahakali river (international
waterway) for the Mahakali scheme is not required as the water supply is
assured under a 1920 agreement between Nepal and India. For the Mahakali
component flood protection works, under IDA's policy, the Government of
India was notified on January 15. 1988 and has raised no objection. For
the Line of Credit component, new surface subprojects would use waters
from streams and rivers which originate entirely within Nepal and form
part of the Narayani river basin for which an agreement between Nepal and
India (dated 1959 as amended in 1964) on water use exists; therefore,
under IDA's policy, notification to the riparian is not required.
Furthermore, under IDA's policy, other Line of Credit subprojects-
-rehabilitation of existing schemes and new groundwater schemes--woulld no-.
require riparian notification. The Flood Rehabilitation compo-,ent woul d
restore damaged facilities and therefore, under IDA's policy. woculd al-;o
not require riparian notification.
8.       A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Sd.Fdu1
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and thf-



-3-
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing, not
exceeding US$ 3.0 million, would be provided for expenditures made after
February 10, 1988, except for expenditures on construction of Irrigation
Line of Credit subprojects. A timetable of key processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Nepal is given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map, IBRD no. 19997, is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7174a-NEP, dated May 20, 1988, is distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached
regarding: (a) farmer organization support; (b) adequate budgets and
staffing to implement the project; (c) accounts and audits; (d) legal
recognition for water users organizations; (e) Mahakali scheme water user
organizations; (f) strengthening of DOI for implementation of the Line of
Credit component; (f) DOI Monitoring and Evaluation/Management Information
Systems; (g) establishment of the Line of Credit Regional Appraisal
Committee and A;,)roval and Coordination Committee; (h) criteria and
procedures for selection of Line of Credit subprojects; (i) suitable
arrangements for a new DOI headquarters building; (j) O&M plans and budget
for the Mahakali scheme; (k) environmental impacts and health risks; and
(1) water charges and cost recovery. A condition of effectiveness is th.
establishment of a Task Force on Water Charges.
10.      Benefits:  At full development, agricultural production is
expected to increase by some NRs 170 M annually. Some 100,000 people
would directly benefit. Under the Mahakali Stage II component, project
construction would create about 2,000 new jobs during the implementation
period and farm employment would expand by some 2,800 jobs following
completion. The economic rate of return (ERR) of the Mahakali Stage II
project is estimated at 16Z. For the Line of Credit component, t'.e
overall ERR is 35Z, and ERRs for the various subproject types range from
16Z to 66Z. Emergency flood rehabilitation benefits were not estimated.
11.      Risks.  Implementation risks for the major component, Mahekali
Stage II, are low due to good implementation performance under Stage I,
provided that the Stage I implementation management team is kept intact.
Risks for the Line of Credit component are somewhat higher, as DOI'S
farmer organization capability will have to be strengthened and expanded.
However, the project ircludes substantial support for DOI institutional
strengthening, particularly for farmer organization. Risks for the Flood
Rehabilitation component are low, as DOI has had substantial experience
with such works under its ongoing programs.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve it.
