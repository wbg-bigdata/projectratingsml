3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The project substantially met its stated objectives. The overall objective was to assist the government
develop an enabling environment for State-owned Enterprises (SOE) reforms to promote China's transition
to a market economy. The ultimate objective of the SOE reforms was the transfer, to be effected with
minimum social instability, of surplus labor from enterprises, where it was no longer demanded, to those
where it could be used more productively. The Labor Market Development Project (LMDP) was
envisioned as a pilot project wherein the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MOLSS), along with five
municipalities and one province selected through a competitive process during project preparation, would
institute legal reforms at the national level and introduce and test employment services, including in-service
training in the pilot jurisdictions.

Specifically, the project was designed to: (a) support policy and legal reforms to facilitate the development
of functioning labor markets and promote urban labor mobility; (b) improve the delivery of labor market
services and training to facilitate the redeployment of surplus workers in SOEs, the unemployed, and
rural-to-urban migrant labor and thus increase labor productivity and mobility; and (c) enhance the
institutional capacity of project implementing agencies with a view to promoting market-based services.

The objectives were ambitious and somewhat risky in the context of China's transition from a
central-command economy, but were in line with the government's aim of moving to a market economy
whose continued growth would depend upon labor market development, labor mobility and increasing the
pool of skilled workers. The objectives also reflected the Bank's experience in transition economies in
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but adapted to China's environment where gross domestic
product (GDP) growth averaged 9.6 % annually from 1980 and 1993, and skilled labor shortages prevailed
in urban areas and unskilled labor surpluses in other areas. Because the growth was not enjoyed equally by
all provinces and cities, labor mobility and vocational training were crucial aspects of the project's
objectives. A key feature of project design was the focus on components where the participating agencies'
commitment to labor reform was strong.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised. However, the project scope was expanded to accommodate the
government's request to redirect project financing from the vocational training component to the Labor
Market Services and Institutional Development Components, and implement the new Labor Market
Information System (LMIS) in five additional provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as
discussed below.

3.3 Original Components:
The original four project components were designed specifically to achieve the project objectives through
the following measures:

A.       Policy and Legal Reform. This component would finance the technical assistance to enable the
MOLSS develop the necessary labor legislation and regulations to implement the Labor Law and to
advance other reforms in employment promotion, vocational skill development, unemployment insurance,
vocational skill testing and certification, employment exchange, employment training and retraining, and
rural migration.

B.       Labor Market Services. This component would finance the development of computer software and
the acquisition of computer equipment to support the MOLSS, the Pilot Municipality (PMs) and Zhejiang



                                                       - 2 -

Province (ZP) to establish a computer-based system for matching job-seekers with job vacancies, for
collection of unemployment insurance (UI) contributions and payment of benefits, and for the collection of
labor market information and statistics.

C.       In-Service Vocational Training. This component would support the establishment of an
institutional capacity to effectively plan and manage a system of in-service vocational training through the
Vocational Training Coordination Commissions (VTCCs) created by the PMs. The Vocational Training
Funds (VTF) to finance the in-service training would be managed by the VTCCs.

D.       Institutional Development. This component would support institutional development through local
and overseas training and study tours for senior management and technical staff to establish and operate
computerized labor market services, including job brokerage, unemployment insurance and labor market
information.

3.4 Revised Components:
There was no revision to the original components. However, following the extension of the original Closing
Date of December 31, 1999, partly to accommodate delays in procurement, the project scope was
expanded. In April 2002, the Bank approved the government's request to use the credit/loan savings of
US$6,950,000 to replicate the labor market service and institutional development components in six
western provinces. (The savings were achieved through a combination of adjustment of original demands
for investment in training equipment, activities financed by counterpart financing, and competitive bidding
processes.) In June 2002, after the government complied with the legal requirements for the proposed
amendment to the Loan and Development Credit Agreements, the credit/loan: (a) was extended to provide
for the implementation of the LMIS in the provinces of Gansu, Henan, Hunan, Qinghai, and Shanxi, and
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; and (b) was adjusted to alter the financing to expand the LMIS
development and Institutional Development Components to accommodate project support of the new
project western provinces.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project was not reviewed by the World Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG) at appraisal. The
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) rates quality at entry as satisfactory. The assessment is based
on: (a) the consistency of project objectives with the Bank's other ongoing assistance to SOE reform; (b)
the commitment from the MOLSS and the beneficiary institutions as evidenced by their participation during
project preparation; and (c) the compatibility of the project objectives with the government's strategy to
move away from a state-administered system of labor allocation towards a market system. Of particular
significance is that the project was to implement several initiatives to which the government had been
committed since 1980, including replacing of the job-for-life policy with the establishment of employment
contracts, expanding and improving urban labor market services, allowing the market to determine wages,
removing barriers to labor mobility within the cities, and alleviating skill shortages.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The project has substantially achieved its overall objective of starting the process of modernizing China's
labor market with the necessary concomitant support services. This assessment is based on project
outputs as well as outcomes. Although the project took longer than originally planned (the original
three-year implementation plan was, in retrospect, too optimistic), the results in several areas far exceeded
expectations. However, some project elements, such as VTFs, fell short of the intended results, which



                                                      - 3 -

proved to be only temporarily useful. In the case where minimal results were achieved, valuable lessons
can be applied to future project design and implementation.

The overall project outputs are rated satisfactory. Details of outputs and outcomes by core indicators of
project components and by municipality/province and MOLSS -- comparing the 1996 baseline data with
the 2001 actual data -- are presented in Annex 1 (Monitoring and Evaluation Output Indicators ­ Phase I
and Phase II). The nine key core outcome indicators relating to the four components provide positive
evidence that the project achieved its objectives. Supplementary information on project outputs and
outcomes by component is summarized below.


4.2 Outputs by components:

A. Component 1 - Policy and Legal Reform (SAR - US$0.3 million; ICR - US$0.13 million)

Component 1 achieved its objective of supporting policy and legal reforms to facilitate the development of
efficiently functioning labor markets and the promotion of urban labor mobility. As a result, the policy and
legal framework in China has become much more conducive to SOE reform, facilitating the transition to a
market economy for redundant SOE workers. These policy and legal reforms supported a number of
reforms, including lifting constraints on labor mobility; strengthening unemployment insurance regulations
and coverage; improving the national regulatory framework for vocational skills accreditation; and
improving employment promotion and re-employment services.

This component is rated satisfactory. Between 1996 and 1999, there was significant activity at the
national, provincial and PM levels in promulgating the national policies. There were a total of 88 laws,
policies and regulations supporting SOE reform under the project.

The MOLSS enacted/promulgated 12 laws and regulations exceeding the target envisioned at project
appraisal by four.

Under the project, the PMs promulgated regulations directly associated with this component:

B. Component 2 - Labor Market Services (SAR - US$15 million; ICR - US$32.7million)

Component 2 achieved its objective of improving the delivery of labor market services through the
establishment of a network of computer applications software, computer equipment and procedures in the
MOLSS, ZP and the five pilot municipalities to automate the matching of job-seekers with job vacancies
and the UI benefits determinations and payments, and the collection and dissemination of labor market
information. The successful development and implementation of computer software and equipment went
well beyond the pilot nature of the system and has become the standard employment/unemployment system
throughout China. By 1999, the system had been implemented in 25 provinces and 174 municipalities.
Having automated nationally standardized information has contributed to data-sharing among various local
labor markets for labor demand and supply and produced standardized labor statistics based on uniform
definitions for use at the local and national levels.

This component is rated highly satisfactory. The establishment of the LMIS, the most challenging aspect
of the project, proved to be the most successful because the system was implemented not only in the
original pilot sites (MOLSS, ZP and the PMs) and in the six provinces under the extended project, but also
in 2,000 additional municipalities and provinces beyond the original project scope. The LMIS, originally
envisioned as a pilot, became known as "Labor `99". It was presented in a working demonstration in 2000

in Wuhan to President Jiang Zemin, who thereafter promoted it as the national standard computer system
for labor offices to support the employment services, unemployment insurance, and labor statistical
reporting. Originally developed by a Chinese institute in collaboration with a western computer firm, the
system continues to evolve, as successful systems do, and is now a part of the Jinbao system to be
implemented throughout China. Through this project, the concepts of the labor market reform elements
have been adopted by the project municipalities, provinces, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and are
being introduced to every jurisdiction in China.

Specific outputs, demonstrating the level of success of labor services provided in the project municipalities
during the project period, Phase I and Phase II, are shown in the tables below.

C. Component 3 - In-Service Vocational Training Component (SAR - US$32.9 million; ICR -
US$27.8 million)

Component 3 achieved its objective of widening the availability and raising the quality of vocational
training to facilitate the redeployment of surplus or unemployed SOE workers, and the migration of rural
workers to urban centers to increase labor mobility and productivity. Originally, the component envisioned
the establishment of institutional capacity in each PM to plan and manage a complete system of in-service
vocational training. The intended framework was to empower the VTCCs to plan and coordinate all
in-service training programs in their respective jurisdictions with initial funding from the loan/credit for the
VTF to support the VTCCs. At the national level, the project was to strengthen the National Vocational
Skill Testing and Guidance Center (VSTGC) and to provide coordination and guidance for the PMs to
set-up and strengthen Vocational Skill Testing Stations (VSTS). Whereas the VTCCs and VTFs did not
survive beyond the original project period (1996-1999), the establishment of the VSTS and the national
VSTGC proved to be valuable institutions. The original target of creating occupational standards for 20
skills was well surpassed with the registration of 104 vocational standards in the People's Republic of
China (PRC) dictionary of vocational classifications. Standardized tests, developed under the project, are
in use for 49 disciplines in the database of national test questions.

This component is rated satisfactory. The project supported the establishment of institutional capacity in
each jurisdiction to plan effectively, and manage efficiently, a complete system of in-service vocational
training through VTCCs and VTFs. Each PM successfully established and maintained the VTCCs and
VTFs for the duration of the project. Although the institutions were not continued beyond project closing,
as explained below, they fulfilled the project's expectations.

A key element of this component was to pilot-test demand-driven financing for more efficient planning,
investment and provision of training. It aimed at creating a level playing field by providing seed money
through the VTFs to both public and private providers, and to sustain the VTFs by pooling funds from
government enterprises and private sources beyond the project. During project implementation, the
investment decisions in upgrading training facilities and training programs were vetted through a
competitive process administered by the VTCCs as designed. The loan funds for the VTCC approved
expenditures were channeled through the VTFs. However, the VTFs were not able to co-mingle and/or
pool loan funds with government resources due to the government existing policy of separating external
funding from local resources. Private providers were not able to access the loan funds available through the
VTFs for the reason of the government policy and practice of on-lending of loan proceeds and their
repayment arrangements. Nevertheless, the two instruments piloted under the project created a good model
for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of training expenditures that are likely to be mainstreamed
once the existing policy restrictions are removed.

The following table lists the vocational training facilities that were established and equipped or
reconstructed in each jurisdiction, and the total number of trainees.

Finally, the project well exceeded appraisal expectations in strengthening the Occupational Skills Testing
Agency (OSTA), originally known as VSTGC, by establishing the first Occupational Classification Code
of China. Whereas the original target was to pilot the establishment of occupational standards for 20 skills,
the project as of 2002 had actually established 104 national occupational standards and test questions for
49 professions in the national question bank. The strategy developed under the project for establishing
occupational standards and developing test questions continues and is the national norm.

D. Component 4 - Institutional Development (SAR - US$3.6 million; ICR - US$3.9 million)

Component 4 achieved its objective of strengthening the institutional capacity of project implementing
agencies to promote market-based services. This was realized through the targeted development of selected
senior staff of the MOLSS and PMs who received local and/or overseas training and study tours to learn
technical and managerial skills for managing the LMIS and delivering employment services to the public,
based on the economy's needs and priorities of both the local and national labor markets. The program of
personnel training strengthened the capacities in the MOLSS and PMs for monitoring, evaluation and
dissemination of employment services.

This component is rated satisfactory. Under Phase I, the overseas and domestic training programs were
completed with: (a) three overseas technical training courses for labor exchange and occupational skills
covering 51 staff; (b) six overseas study tours on vocational training and policies on labor markets with 51
staff participating; and (c) domestic training of 928 staff.

Under Phase II, the overseas and domestic training programs were completed with: (a) five overseas
technical training programs and study tours for 91 staff; and (b) numerous domestic training sessions for
staff in each province.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
N/A

4.4 Financial rate of return:
N/A

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The overall institutional development impact has been substantial.

First, under the reform aspects of the project, the new and enhanced legislative/regulatory framework
continues to provide the basis for continuing SOE and SI reform.

Second, a significant transfer of knowledge and technology took place during project implementation. The
development and implementation of the LMIS helped to create a nationwide network of employment
services that provided vastly more information and improved services for job seekers. The adoption of
Labor '99, the LMIS created under the project helped establish a nationwide network of employment
services linked with skills training, testing and certification, and now the Jinbao system which incorporates
Labor '99 throughout China, is indicative of the project's impact on the provision of labor services
throughout China reflecting the likely long-term impact of the LMIS.

The establishment of the vocational skills training certification process has provided the basis for continued
use and expansion of the framework developed and implemented under the project. As mentioned above,
the original target of establishing testing criteria and occupational standards for 20 skills was surpassed;
presently, 104 national occupational standards and test questions for 49 professions have been established.
These standards and the testing scheme laid the foundation of a national qualifications framework for skills
development and provision of TVET.

However, two project elements had less than the expected development impact. First, the institutional
development impact of establishing the VTCCs and VTFs was not realized because both concepts fell into
disuse after the initial project investment for the reasons discussed in section C above. Second, the
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) envisioned by the project was not sustained after its development by the
contractor. It was due mainly to delays in finalizing the indicators by the contractor and advanced
completion of implementation by the pilot municipalities. The disappointing aspects of these two elements,
however, do not detract from the substantial positive impact of the In-service Vocational Training
Component (VTC) on the project as a whole.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There were no major factors affecting implementation and/or project outcome that were outside the control
of the government other than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 during
Phase II of the project. Some slowdown in the implementation start-up of the LMIS in the provinces under
Phase II was due to travel restrictions. However, this problem did not adversely affect the implementation
or the successful outcome of Phase II.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The enactment of the Employment Promotion Law by the People's Congress and the Regulations on
Vocational Skills Accreditation by the State Council were delayed. In the case of the former, the main
reasons were the scheduling difficulty at the People's Congress to review the proposed law and additional
time was needed for consultation; in the latter case, the various government agencies involved needed
further consultation.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
As a reform-focused pilot project, the LMDP needed a strong implementing agency to provide proactive
leadership and management to ensure consistent oversight and timely execution of the interlocking project
activities which had to be carried out by diverse sub-national entities. In this case, implementation was
periodically handicapped by the unusually high staff turnover at the World Bank Operations Office
(WBOO), particularly in the area of management and information technology. Insufficiency of technical
support was one of the reasons for the equipment procurement delay in Phase I. However, whatever
weaknesses the WBOO experienced were ameliorated by the dedication of contractors and subordinate
implementation institutions.

The closing date was extended twice. The first extension was necessary to accommodate the development
of technical specifications for the international competitive bidding (ICB) and national competitive bidding
(NCB) procurement of highly technical equipment. The second extension, which changed the closing date
to December 31, 2005, was to enable the government to complete the implementation of the expanded
project covering six western provinces (para. 4.5, above).

5.4 Costs and financing:
At appraisal, the project costs were projected at US$51.8 million. Savings in the projected cost of
equipment were achieved through the: (a) competitive procurement of equipment and consulting services;
(b) adjustment in demands for training equipment; and (c) actual price reductions/performance
improvements resulting from delays in the procurement plan. There was a US$6,950,000 surplus available
for expansion in the scope of the project. The government requested, and the Bank agreed, that the savings
should be used to expand the LMIS and the Institutional Development components into western regions of
China. The final project cost is estimated at US$64.50 million, or 124.52% of the appraisal estimate.
Details on project costs are shown in Annex 2.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The project's sustainability is rated as highly likely. The rationale for the rating is as follows:

    (a) The laws and regulations enacted under the project are expected to remain in effect and indeed
         become the basis for further reform.

    (b) The adoption of the LMIS Labor '99 as the basis for the government's SI system, Jinbao, to be
         used throughout China indicates a commitment on the part of the government to continue providing
         the resources, both human and financial, to continue using and enhancing the system as an
         officially sanctioned system. For these reasons, the system is likely to continue to provide
         uniformity and standardization for computerized employment systems.

    (c) The vocational skills certification program is likely to continue on a national scale primarily
         because the responsible institution - OSTA - is well established and continues to introduce new
         occupational standards and skills tests.




                                                     - 10 -

There are, however, two negative aspects: (a) the VTCCs and VTFs did not remain operational, and did
not become institutionalized following the acquisition of the project financed vocational training equipment;
and (b) the M&E framework designed under the project was not continued, but they nevertheless provided
useful lessons to inform policy and practice for investment in training.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The project financing did not cover ongoing maintenance of the institutions and systems produced under the
project. During the project, the maintenance costs for the LMIS were voluntarily contributed by the
beneficiary jurisdictions. Such a framework based on voluntary cost sharing is subject to high risk of
failure in the long term. Towards the end of project implementation, the government provided assurances
to the Bank that it would continue the ongoing maintenance of the LMIS. By closing date, the Labor '99
system and the government's SI system, both based on the Oracle database, were consolidated into a new
system known as Jinbao. The new Jinbao system is intended to be implemented throughout China as the
standard social protection system. Continuation of the project's Labor '99 system within Jinbao will
assure the sustainability of the system.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Project appraisal is rated satisfactory; the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was well-prepared. The Bank's
performance in both the identification and preparation stages is rated as satisfactory. The preparation team
consisted of local and headquarters-based staff and consultants with both local and world-wide experience
in SI and in labor and employment arenas. The range of the experts' skills was appropriate for the project.
The team ensured that the project objectives were consistent with the government's policy priorities and the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and was envisioned as one of a series of pilot projects in the
lending program to demonstrate key principles of SOE reform in various provinces. It was designed to
include lessons in labor market policy as documented in the World Development Report of 1995. Further,
the Bank team drew on three sector studies, namely: (a) the 1992 study on urban employment and wage
systems in China; (b) the 1993 study on employment, and training implications of enterprise reform; and
(c) the background papers for a policy conference in Beijing on SOE reform addressing corporate
governance, separation of social services and labor mobility. Finally, to assure beneficiary commitment to
the project, the government and the Bank staged a competition to select the participating
provinces/municipalities.

As noted above, the project was complex. The complexity, however, was significantly outweighed by the
high degree of commitment on the part of the government and PMs, as demonstrated by their dedicated
involvement in project preparation and implementation.

7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision of the project is rated satisfactory. The project design envisioned a collaborative
supervision effort between the WBOO and the Bank, for which considerable participation of all parties
concerned. The supervision focused on addressing key implementation issues and the assistance to enhance
the implementing agency's capacity. Delays in project procurement during the early period of
implementation were overcome by increased supervision and implementation assistance through field-based
procurement, financial management and disbursement teams to address the issues and respond to the needs
for advice in a more timely fashion though the provision of supervision resources commensurate with the
project's diversity could have further enhance the frequency and results.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:



                                                    - 11 -

Overall the Bank performance is rated as satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance in project preparation is rated as satisfactory.

The project was prepared by the MOLSS and the original five PMs (Deyang, Guangzhou, Shaoxing with
Zhejiang Province, Weifang and Wuhan) with Bank assistance. In each of the PMs, a Leading Project
Group was created to oversee project preparation. Since membership included senior municipal officials in
finance, planning, reform, industry, labor and education, the broad political base was ensured from the
onset.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance is rated as satisfactory. MOLSS was closely involved since the
early stage of project preparation, and remained committed to the reforms supported by the project during
implementation. The policy and legal reform component was primarily led by MOLSS and PMs with
technical assistance from the Bank. While the staff turnover in WBOO had some negative impact on the
implementation, MOLSS and PM maintained their Project Management Offices (PMOs) that were
instrumental to coordinated implementation and successful completion. The Borrower was in full
compliance with all loan/credit covenants.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Implementing agency performance is rated as satisfactory.

Phase I of the project suffered a number of delays. The primary cause was the inexperience of project
management staff in the MOLSS and the PMs. The LMDP was the first opportunity for the Phase I PMs
to participate in a Bank project. As the procurement requirements were new to those PMs, implementation
timeliness could have been improved with a more cohesive strategy on the part of the MOLSS. Stronger
guidance and more frequent supervision from the WBOO/MOLSS would have resulted in a more
streamlined implementation among the PMs.

A secondary factor in project delays was the high turnover rate of the staff of the MOLSS's WBOO, and
this was exacerbated by prolonged vacancies, resulting in periodic staff shortages and less than optimum
skill mix of competent staff during the project. However, despite the above difficulties, the project
achieved its overall development objectives. The project's success can be attributed to the project
participants' commitment to the project and their ability to apply the experience gained from Phase I to the
implementation tasks in Phase II.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

Several lessons have been learned from this pilot project in both policy and operational perspectives. A
broader set of lessons are, first, putting in place a rational and enabling labor market policy framework is
key to reducing labor market rigidity and segregation and increasing labor mobility and employment
flexibility. Second, when an economy continues to grow rapidly and jobs are being created, active labor
market policies, especially employment services and training including retraining could have a positive
impact on employment and reemployment if they were well targeted and integrated. Third, information is
essential to help equip workers in transition between jobs and to seize opportunities to acquire new skills.



                                                       - 12 -

Government has a critical role to play in providing that information, albeit in a cost-effective way. Fourth,
the trainability and employability of workers depend largely on their education background and vary
according to the level of education attainment before their first employment, as well as the effectiveness of
the education system in producing the right mix of the competencies and skills though very often the lower
educated workers are crowded out of the jobs by those with higher skills even when the job does not
demand higher skills.

More specifc lessons learned are:

Building a bridge between the labor market, service providers, job seekers, and employers can be facilitated
by a Labor Market Information System (component 2). The LMIS created under the project piloted a
network of employment services in the pilot municipalities, which was later replicated throughout China.
The LMIS, entitled Labor 99, helped shape a nationwide network of employment services linked with skills
training, testing and certification.

Integration of Employment Services and Training. Informed by the lessons learned from the transitional
economies, the project attempted to link enhanced employment services with the effort to provide training
opportunities for the unemployed, laid-off workers and support for job placement through integrated
services in pilot municipalities. The experience of implementation of the component 2 (employment
services) and component 3 (In-service training), has proven that such integration contributes to higher
placement/employment rate and increased relevance and effectiveness of the training provided.

Project Preparation and Design. The LMDP experience suggests that a complex pilot project that depends
upon the effective implementation of policy and legal reforms to achieve its objectives requires the
involvement of all key stakeholders at the outset of its preparation and design to ensure their commitment
to, and perseverance in, successfully completing the execution of all project activities. (Paras. 3.5; 7.4; and
7.5.)

Harmonization of Objectives, Strategy and Timing. The successful implementation of a project involving
complex policy and legal reforms aimed at changing the structure of a key sector of the economy is best
assured when the objectives are in line with the borrower's sector policies and the implementation timing
and strategies harmonize with the government's readiness for change to quicken economic and social
development. In this case, the project coincided with the critical need in China to develop a legal and
regulatory framework to support market reforms. (Paras. 3.5; 7.1)

Stable Implementation Agency. In a pilot project where the implementing agencies have little or no
experience in handling complex legal and organizational reforms aimed at restructuring the labor market,
project success would be better assured when the turnover of implementation staff is minimized and the
implementing agencies are provided strong guidance and management support through more frequent
supervision. (Paras. 5.3; 7.6.)

Technology Transfer and Institutional Development. Effective institutional development through
technology transfer can be realized when a foreign firm and a local enterprise are able to work
collaboratively to achieve an agreed objective within a given timeframe, as demonstrated by the
development and implementation of the LMIS and its impact on China's new Jinbao system. (Section B,
Component 2; para. 4.5.)

Staff and Institutional Development and Project Sustainability. The LMDP has reinforced the principle
that project implementation success and the sustainability of its investments in legal and policy reforms


                                                     - 13 -

depend crucially upon the integration of systematic staff training and its timing with key activities relating
to those reforms. In connection with the development of the LMIS, the advanced training of operational
staff of employment services, aligned to redefined business processes, was instrumental in the successful
development and operation of the automated employment services in the PMs. (Section B, Component 2;
Component 4.)


9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Note: Borrower's comments included are unedited.

We consider this Project is a successfully implemented one. Through the implementation, we completed the
designed contents satisfactorily, realized set goals, and achieved good results:

Firstly, the Project provided financial support to the development of labor and social security. During the
ninth-five-year plan, it was right the critical period for deepening SOE reform, driving the transition of
social market economy, and establishing social market economic system with Chinese characteristics. At
that time, it was urgent to develop the construction of labor market, but the limited national finance could
not ensure the development needs. The implementation of the Project made up the insufficient input from
public finance, pushed forward the process of vocational training and labor market construction, promoted
the development of labor and social security, and played a good role in maintaining the stable development
of economy and society.

Secondly, advanced management idea and operational mode were introduced. The process of equipment
procurement, on one hand, saved fund, reduced cost and improved efficiency; on the other hand, it provided
us experience for our government procurement. The World Bank's supervision and review on the Project
ensured the full amount arrival of fund and normal implementation.

Thirdly, the Project promoted the construction of our labor market information system, setting good base to
the construction of "Jinbao" Project. "Labor 99" developed by the Project regulated business operation,
and unified data standards. Now it has been used in 174 cities of 25 provinces, which promoted the
construction of labor market information system. Meanwhile, the consultation from the World Bank
experts made the system constructed along the development of information technology, and set up new
thoughts for "Jinbao" Project. The advanced computer network equipment procured formed the
groundwork for "Jinbao" Project.

Fourthly, the Project promoted the establishment of our vocational training mechanism, improved the labor
skills and re-employment rate of the laid off workers, and trained a group of staff who understood both
labor and social security business and project management as well.

We understand that behind the successful implementation is the World Bank's project management team.
Just as what the World Bank appraised above, the Project was a very complicated one. One is because of
long duration. It was twelve years from 1993 of project preparation to 2005 of project closing. The
second reason is too many project implementation entities. These entities included developed areas in the
east, and areas in the mid-west. The third reason is broad contents which involved research on vocational
training, and construction of labor market information system. The implementation of such a complicated
project, the World Bank provided technical support to project management. The team that includes
specialists, procurement and disbursement teams from both HQ and Beijing Office gave us advice and help



                                                       - 14 -

during the whole process of project implementation. Their religious work style gave us very deep
impression.

At the same time, we learned some experiences and lessons. As above mentioned, for some problems such
as the delay of Project implementation, long period for procurement and disbursement, there are some
subjective reasons like staff change and unfamiliar with World Bank management, and some objective
reasons as the broken of SARS in 2003. Meanwhile, we thought the World Bank also has some
disadvantages in project management, such as too many and too long exam and approval procedures which
influenced the implementation of the Project. We suggest that the World Bank simplify these procedures,
shorten approval period, improve work efficiency and reduce project management cost.
