MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR THE AL MUKALLA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) for SDR 8.7 million
(US$12.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance the Al
Mukalla Water Supply Project. The project would be cofinanced by the Kuwait
Fund for Arab Economic Development for SDR 7.0 million (US$9.7 million
equivalent) and by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development for SDR
7.0 million (US$9.7 million equivalent).
2.       Background.  Water is scarce in PDRY and many existing groundwater
resources are becoming exhausted or are deteriorating in quality as a result
of over-exploitation. New borefields are therefore developed at greater
distances to supply the larger cities. Widely distributed population and the
country's rugged topography also pose major constraints to the development of
the water supply sector. Of the 2.2 million inhabitants of the country, about
481 are served by piped water supply, while the remaining population relies on
individual wells or public outlets. Although access to piped water could be
technically extended to an additional 20S of the population, existing
facilities need rehabilitation and upgrading to reduce water losses and
improve the service. The Government gives the water supply sector one of the
highest priorities. About 8.51 of the investments in the third five-year
investment plan (1986-90) is allocated to the sector. Al Mukalla, with a
population of about 70,000 inhabitants suffers from discontinuous water
services and hence has a very low per capita consumption. Al Mukalla is the
second largest city of the country and the capital of the Hadramaut Province.
Under a previous IDA credit (1159-YDR), hydrological surveys identified an
adequate source of water about 50 km from the town. Sewerage services, which
have not kept pace with the development of water supply, also need remedial
attention throughout the country and are currently the subject of discussions
between the Government and the Association.
3.       Project Objectives  The main objectives of the proposed project are to
increase water production for Al Mukalla to meet effective demand up to the
year 2002 and to strengthen and expand the existing primary and secondary
distribution sys;-ems. Other objectives are to enhance the operational and
management capacity of the Public Water Corporation (PWC), to reduce
unaccounted-for water, increase productivity and improve construction
supervision and system management.

4.       ProJect Description. The project to be implemented over an eight-year
ptriod includes the following components: (i) drilling and equipping of a new
bcrefield at An Naga'ah; (ii) construction of a 50 km transmission pipeline to
Al Mukalla; (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading of existing production
facilities at Wadi Buwaysh; (iv) rehabilitation and expansion of primary and
secondary distribution system; (v) construction of additional storage
reservoirs with a total capacity of about 4,500 m3; (vi) provision of water
meters and operational and office equipment; and (vii) provision of technical
assistance to PWC for (a) detection and control of water losses; (b) system
analysis and operation; (c) construction supervision; (d) selection and
implementation of a computerized accounting system; (e) analysis of PWC
training needs and development of a five-year training program; and (f) a
study to improve PWC's overall financial performance.
5.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$34.7 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$31.4 million. It includes
taxes on services, which amount to 5S of the cost of civil works and
engineering service; customs duties are not levied on imported equipment for
development projects in PDRY. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in PDRY are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map covering the project area is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. P6995-YDR dated June 1, 1988 is
being distributed separately.
6.       Rationale for Assoeiation Involvement.  Since 1978, the Association has
been active in lending to PDRY to improve access to a safe water supply,
particularly for the low-income population in urban areas. Severe financial
constraints and scarcity of water sources have encouraged the Association to
orient sector lending towards optimization of existing water production and
distribution facilities and development of least cost additional water
resources. The Association has also helped PWC to reflect prior experience in
its current operations, in particular to carry out thorough investigations to
locate and assess the sustainable yield of groundwater resources early in the
project preparation cycle. The Association's involvement in the water supply
sector is also focussed on the strengthening of PWC's planning and execution
capabilities, and the promotion of sound cost recovery and financial
policies.  Finally, the Association is playing a catalytic role in mobilizing
cofinancing for the sector.
7.       Agreed Actions. The following agreements were reached with the
Government and PWC: (i) measures would be taken for PWC to generate net cash
equivalent to at least 10% of its annual average capital expenditures for the
current fiscal year and the next two following fiscal years in the years 1988
through 1991 and 12% in the years thereafter; (ii) PVC would not, without
prior consultation with IDA, incur debt other than for this and other ongoing
projects unless its projected net revenues are at least 1.2 times its
projected annual debt service; (iii) PWC would empley consultants by July 1,
1989 to assist in the development and execution of programs to improve system
analysis and operation, the water distribution system, and PWC's financial

performance and by December 31, 1989 to develop and implement a computerized
accounting system. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development will provide financial assistance to PWC in equal amounts
equivalent to US$9.7 million - signing of the financing Agreements between the
Government and the two cofinancing agencies would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit. The execution of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and PWC and the selection of consultants for
supervision of construction would also be conditions of effectiveness.
8.       Justification.  Benefits under the proposed Project are expected from:
(a) the prcvision of a reliable continuous water supply service to all the
residents of Al Mukalla including about 28,000 poor in lieu of present
intermittent service; (b) considerably improved quality of water; (c)
elimination of the present danger of back syphoning of contaminated water; (d)
provision of adequate water to properly utilize the sewerage systems presently
under construction and (e) meeting the projected demand of commercial and
industrial users thus removing a major obstacle to the development of these
sectors. Using incremental sales of water at current tariffs as a minimum
measure of benefits, the project has a 6.5X rate of return compared to 5.52
opportunity cost of capital in PDRY. The project represents the least-cost
solution to develop water supply facilities and improve efficiency of
operation, and has no adverse environmental effects. Each of PWC's branches
has its own tariff. These are progressive and adequate both as to structure
and level. Oniy modest increases would be required during project execution
for PWC to maintain its favorable financial position.
9.       Risks.  The project is a straightforward water supply project with no
unusual features. Furthermore, since PWC will be assisted by engineering and
management consultants, the risks associated with the project are considered
minimal.
10.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
