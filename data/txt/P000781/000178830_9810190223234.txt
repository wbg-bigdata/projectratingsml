REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
GABONESE REPUBLIC
FOR A
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Gabonese Republic, for the equivalent of US$ 5 million to
help finance a Second Education Project. The loan would have a term of
15 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report, "The Current Economic Situation and Prospects of
Gabon," (No. AW-29a) was distributed to the Executive Directors in
December 1971. An updating mission visited the country in November/
December 1972,and its findings, reviewed in the light of recent develop-
ments, are reflected in the following paragraphs. Annex I contains
country data.
Economic Potential
3.        Gabon, with an area nearly half that of France, has a small
and slowly growing population of somewhat more than 500,000 which is
becoming increasingly urban.  The country is well endowed with natural
resources such as timber, manganese, petroleum, natural gas, and uranium,
as well as untapped iron-ore. Three export-oriented industries--oil,
mining, and forestry--account for the bulk of modern sector production
and provide the basis for the economy's strong growth. While the main
opportunities for expansion lie in exploitation of natural resources,
Gabon also possesses valuable industrial potential for processing local
raw materials. Moreover, booming national and individual incomes are
creating a growing demand for commercial services, construction, and
transportation, making them important areas of economic activity.
4.        Although agriculture is hampered by structural problems and
prosDects for growth are modest comDared to other sectors, it supports
about 65 percent of the country's total population. The output of
traditional food crops could be expanded to meet the increasing demand
of the urban markets, and high value fruits and vegetables could be
cultivated to replace some of the rapidly growing imports. Presently,
food represents about 15 percent of the country's total import bill.



-2-
Past Performance
5.        At an annual rate of 8.0 percent in real terms, Gabon's eco-
nomic growth during the last ten years has been unusually good. The
single most important factor has been the rise in petroleum production
and prices, although the exploitation of other natural resources such
as natural gas, timber, manganese, and uranium has also made a signifi-
cant contribution.  In 1973 petroleum production reached 6.9 million tons
and accounted for 21 percent of GDP; manganese and timber outpuit
represented respectively 10 and 8 percent.  While timber production has
increased at a stable 7.5 percent annually, manganese production leveled
off in 1972, largely as a result of inadequate transport capacity.
The latest reliable estimates of the national accounts are for 1973,
when GDP per capita reached about US$ 1,240 but owing to large transfers
abroad, GNP per capita ranged around US$ 1,000 to 1,100. With the jump
in the price of oil and other Gabonese exports, GNP per capita will
probably exceed US$ 1,800 in 1974.
6.        Employment opportunities created by the rapid economic
expan3ion have increasingly attracted the rural population to coastal
cities and mining and logging centers. In fact, over one-third of the
population now depends on the modern sector for its livelihood, an
unusually high percentage for Africa. The population is heavily concen-
trated in two towns, Libreville, which has 90,000 inhabitants, and Port
Gentil with 45,000, causing shortages in housing and urban services.
Rapid development of the modern sector in contrast with the very slow
progress recorded in agriculture has created a sharp discrepancy between
rural and modern sector incomes. The Government is preoccupied with the
poverty of the rural population and is planning to upgrade nutrition,
health, and the general standard of living by increasing investment in
the services and facilities needed to support the rural sector. It is
now engaged in improving the training of agricultural extension and
rural development staff.
7.        Gabonts economic centers -- Libreville/Port Gentil on the
west coast, Franceville/Moanda in the southeast, and Woleu N'tem in the
north -- are separated from each other by vast underpopulated areas.
There is still no adequate land transport system to connect these
centers, or to extend the benefits of economic development to isolated
settlements around the country.
Prospects and Development Strategy
8.        Gabon's outlook for increased mineral exports and revenue is
bright since there is room to expand exploitation of natural resources,
and demand is strong and price prospects favorable. Gabon's
forests are among the richest in Africa and the country has a near
monopoly of the Okume timber which is used in plywood production.
With improved transportation facilities, manganese output could
be doubled to 4 million tons by the early 1980's. This year's



- 3 -
offshore oil finds have boosted proven reserves to some 180 million tons,
and in two or three years crude oil production is expected to reach the
leveL of 10 million tons/year.
9.        Thus, real growth of 7 - 8 percent p.a. could continue
during the remainder of the decade provided the Government helps remove
some of the main bottlenecks to economic development: the transport
network needs considerable expansion, and manpower shortages--including
technical and managerial personnel--must be remedied.
10.       In the transport sector the Government is preparing the construc-
tion of a railway which will connect the port of Owendo with Franceville
throuigh Booue (700 km). The initial purpose of the project is to evacuate
timbe,r and manganese ore; thereafter the Government plans to build a
branch from Booue to the M6kambo/Belinga area to reach iron ore deposits.
If new resource development results in export of additional heavy
minerals such as iron ore, investmnents in new port facilities will be
equa:Lly necessary.
11.       Reducing the shortage of trained nationals is essential to meet
the fast growing needs of the modern sector and to expand Gabonese partici-
pation in the development and management of the economy. Gabon has one
of the highest primary school enrollment rates in Africa (about 90 percent),
but thus far the educational system has been able to meet only part of
the sharply increased demand for technical and managerial personnel.
Additional schools must be built, and more importantly,the quality of
teaching improved, and secondary curricula diversified and adapted to
labor requirements. With bilateral and multilateral assistance the
Government is now expanding educational facilities and placing increased
emphasis on vocational training.
12.       With regard to long-term development, the Government is anxious
to diversify the economy and to reduce its dependence on raw material
exnorts. In this connection it is actively considering the construction
of a nulp and pa3er plant as well as expansion of the country's oil-
refining capacity. In agriculture the Government intends to promote
production of cocoa, traditional food crops, livestock, fruits,and
vegetables. Although some of the required measures have been adopted,
more determined efforts including appropriate price incentives and improve-
ments in marketing systems are needed to achieve significant progress in
agricultural development. Government plans to establish advanced training
facilities for rural development agents appear a reasonable step toward
improving conditions in rural areas. Finally, far-reaching public
health measures will be necessary to reduce infant mortality and improve
the overall health of the population.



13.       Gabon's current five-year olan (1971-1975) called initially
for public investment of US$ 262 million of which US$ 115 million was
to be provided by Gabonese public funds and US$ 147 million by external
financing. However, in view of the brighter outlook at the end of 1973,
the CGovernment adopted new targets for public investments: US$ 130
million (instead of US$ 56 million) in 1974, and US$ 280 million (instead
of US$ 47 million) in 1975. The bulk of these additional commitments is
to be spent on infrastructure projects. The sharo increase in revenues
from oil and mineral exports which could not be foreseen when financing
requirements for the current plan were initially estimated, should
provide adequate resources to finance this vastly expanded public invest-
ment program. However, technical and managerial assistance on a large
scale will be indispensable to carrying it out.
1.       Gabon's debt has risen steeply and in 1972/73 the debt service
was almost equal to the current budget surplus of that fiscal year.
Expanded Government revenue is now easing the tight financial situation.
In 1'173 about 30 percent of current revenue was committed to debt
service, but in 1974,due to additional revenue from increased oil output
and higher prices, about 17 percent would be needed to service the debt.
Sharp recourse to supplies and financial credits from 1972-1971t resulted
in a debt service ratio of 7 percent during that period. With the
imprc,ved export prospects this ratio will decline below 6 percent in the
next few years. The Bank's share in Gabon's public debt outstanding and
disbursed and total debt service would equal 7.6 and 4 percent respec-
tively.
15.       In view of Gabon's strong exDort position and prosoects, its
record of public savings, and its potential for further growth, Gabon is
creditworthy for the proposed loar..



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GABON
16.       The Bank's past and present commitments in Gabor, amount to
about US$ 64 million (US$ 25.7 million outstanding) and cover five
projects: one in mining, two in highway construction, one in education,
and one in public utilities.  Project execution is satisfactory.  Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of September 30, 1974 and
includes notes on the progress of ongoing projects.
17.       Our first operation was a 1959 Bank loan of US$ 35 million to
the mining company COMILCG, which helped finance construction of facili-
ties -o extract and transport ore from a manganese mine at Moanda in
southeast Gabon to the Ocean port of Pointe Noire in the People's
RepubLic of the Congo. The project is operating successfully and COMILOG
prepaid the Bank loan in 1972. For a number of years after Gabon's
independence, the emphasis in Bank lending was on transport infrastruc-
ture. Two loans, one of US$ 12 million in 1964 and another of US$ 6
million in 1969, financed the construction of roads to open up new forest
areas for timber production and to promote general development in these
areas. Construction of the roads has been completed, the quality of the
work :IS good, and a surplus under the 1969 loan has been used to
strengthen the Government's road maintenance capability. The increase
in timber production made possible by these roads was appreciably higher
than anticipated. Therefore, the economic returns may be higher than
appraisal forecasts show.
18.       In 1968, the Bank began diversifying its assistance to Gabon.
A loan of US$ 1.8 million helped improve vocational and primary teacher
training and secondary education. Project schools were largely completed
by 1972 and have since begun to operate. In addition, a loan of US$ 965
million in 1973 helped finance the extension of Libreville's water supply
facilities. The project is designed to meet growing demand, and to
provide treated water to the lower income groups of the capital city
thereby reducing their dependence on impure water.
19.       Beyond the proposed education project, the Bank has no project
under consideration in Gabon. In fact,it appears that the countryes
future public finance and foreign exchange resources will be quite
sufficient to cover the financing needs of an expanded investment program.
However, the country's external financing and technical assistance
requirements will be reviewed from time to time and discussed wLth the
Goverrnment.



PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
The Ministry of Education and Scientific Research is responsible
for general, technical, and higher education.    Other ministries operate
schooLs related to their own activities, such as the National Forestry
SchooL under the Ministry of Forestry and Water Resources. The formal
educaeion system comprises a six-year primary cycle followed by seven
years of secondary education leading to the "Baccalaureat." Higher edu-
catioIl is given in the National University, which started operations in
1)70 and will be fully operational by 1975. Education is compulsory for
all Gabonese in the 6-16 age group.   Curricula are prescribed by the
M4inistry of Education for both public and private institutions. The
language of instruction is French.
21.       Public resources devoted to formal education increased by more
than five times from 1962/63 to 1971/72, totaling about 5 percent of GNP
in 1971.  Recurrent exoenditures on education have also risen considerably,
from 17 percent of all government recurrent expenditures in 1967 to
approximately 22 percent in 1974.   The size of the financial effort should
have enabled Gabon to considerably exoand and improve the education system.
As it stands, however, only 20 percent of the relevant age group is
enrolled in secondary schools, and the reoetition and failure rates are
high at both primary and secondary levels.
22.       Gabon must solve a number of problems before it can achieve an
eff"icient, development-oriented education system.   So far the system has
emphasized preparation of students for further education, not for the
labor market; while Gabon's economy and skill requirements have changed
significantly, the educational structure has remained the same. Secondary
schools, particularly vocational institutions, have been unable to keep up
with increased enrollment demands.   In addition, the system has not made
the best use of available funds.
2 3.      The Government is taking initial steps toward a comprehensive
eaucational reform aimed at improving the system's response to the
countryts present and future needs. In the meantime, consistent with the
above problems, it is introducing interim measures designed to (i) increase
the efficiency of certain institutions; (ii) improve, expand, and diversify
technical education; and (iii) broaden the technological base for all
students going through general secondary education.



-7-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Purpose
24.       Our first education project (Loan No. 540-GA) in 1968 assisted
the Government in creating a primary teacher training college and in
building additional capacity in general secondary education and in accel-
erate1 vocational training. Resoonding to rapid modern sector development,
the proposed project is designed mainly to help the Government implement
its interim measures in technical education and vocational training, but
also to contribute to the long-range improvement of the system. The
project was identified by UNESCO and prepared and appraised by the Bank
in October/November 1973. The Appraisal Report, "Appraisal of a Second
Education Project in Gabon" No. 51la-GA dated November 18, 1974,is being
circuLated separately to the Executive Directors, and a loan and project
summary is found in Annex III of this report. Loan negotiations were held
in Wa;3hington in October 1974 with a Gabonese delegation headed by
Mr. Faustin Ntogolo, Deputy Commissioner of Plan.
Description
25.       The project, to be executed during 1975-1980, consists of:
(a) the construction of, and/or equipment for:
(i) an upper secondary technical school in Port Gentil;
(ii) a lower secondary technical school in Libreville;
(iii) additional boarding places for the National Secondary
School of Commerce in Port Gentil;
(iv) additional boarding places and classrooms for the
National Forestry School in Cap Esterias;
(v) the introduction of the "Initiation a la Technologie"
course at the Lycee Leon M'Ba and the College Moderne
Akebe, both in Libreville; and
(vi) the Publications Unit in Libreville.
(b) the provision of:
(i) 15 man-months of specialist services and 51 man-
months of fellowships for the institution cited in
a(vi);



(ii) 5(6 man-months of specialist services to assist
the Government in completing, the planning of its
educational reform program -and L5 man-months of
fellowships to help train planners for the Ministry
of Education;
(iii) 12 man-months of specialist services and 48d man-
months of fellowships for the National Management
Institute; and
(iv) 3 man-years of professional services for the deputy
director/architect of the project, who wil:L be
responsible for day to day administration of the
project.
26.       The proposed project would help reform technical education so
as tc meet the needs of prospective emnloyers by (a) supporting the
development of new methods and curricula at the lower level (glades 7-10)
for the training of skilled workers--project items a(ii) and (v); and by
(b) exoanding canacity and increasing the number of soecializations at
the middle level (grades 9-12) so as to eventually reduce the country's
deoerdence on expatriate technicians--project item a(i).    In other
vocational areas the oroject would increase levels of enrollment in two
institutions--project items a(iii) and (iv). In addition, special
technical courses (initiation i la technologie) would be developed and
tested in two lower-secondary schools in the Libreville area. These
courses would give students a basic understanding of technologv as
necessary preparation for subsequent technical training.    The project
would also include assistance for curriculum reform--item b(ii), and
would establish a publications unit for the production of suitable
teaching materials greatly needed in Gabon.    The National Management
Institute would receive technical assistance to plan its development
according to the country's managerial requirements and to train its
teachers.
ProLect Execution
P 7.      A orolect unit headed by a project director and including an
architect (Deputy Director), a quantity surveyor, a procurement and
equinment soecialist, two site architects, and sunport personnel would
be ir charge of -oroject execution.  A project committee, a:Lso headed by
the Froject Direclor, comprising representatives of the Ministries of
Education, Forestry and Water resources, Public Works, Economy and
Finance, and Plan, would be resoonsible for nolicy making and coordina-
tion.  Conditions of effectiveness (Section 5.01 of draft Loan Agreement)
include establishment of the Project Unit, appointment of the Project
Director and his denuty, as well as of all members of the Project
Committee, and emoloyment of architectural consultants.



Project Cost and Financing
28.       The total project cost, net of taxes and customs duties, amounts
to about US$ 8.1 million with a foreign exchange component of about Us$ 5
million or 62 percent. (For a breakdown see Annex III.) Cost estimates
include a 15 percent physical contingency allowance for civil works with
10 percent of it for professional services. It also includes a 6 to 18
percent p.a. allowance for local price increases and a 7 to 24 percent
p.a. for foreign price escalation. The estimated cost of construction
may be among the highest in Western Africa, as was experienced under the
first project. These costs reflect the shortage of labor, the
high proportion and cost of expatriate staff in the construction industry,
the high cost of imported materials in Gabon, and the limited competition
among contractors. The Bank would make a loan of US$ 5 million to the
Government for a 15-year term (including a grace neriod of four years)
which,together with US$ 50,000 j   from the Bank Loan No. 540-GA,would meet
the foreign exchange requirements of the project. Gabon would finance the
remaining costs. Retroactive financing of about US$ 50,000 is recommended
under the present loan for services of architects to preoare the sketch
designs.
Procurement and Disbursement
29.        Contracts for buildings, furniture, and equipment would be
awarded following international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines. The buildings are within the capacity of Gabon's
construction industry. Local manufacturers of furniture would be given
a margin of preference of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of competing
imports, or the applicable customs duties and import taxes, whichever
is lower. Equipment and furniture would be grouped in lots of at least
$40,030. Bids would be invited for several lots at the same time.
Small items which cannot be satisfactorily grouped into lots wculd be
purchased locally on the basis of quotations following local procedures.
The total amount of such purchases would not exceed $120,000, about 10
percent of the gross costs of furniture and equipment during project
execution.
30.        Disbursements from the Loan Account would cover:   (i) 50 percent
of expenditures for civil works; (ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures
(c.i.f. cost) for equipment and materials; (iii) 58 percent of total
expenditures for furniture; (iv) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
expatriate consultants and technical assistance, or 85 percent of total
expen(litures for local consultants and technical assistance; (v) 100
percent of foreign expenditures for fellowships.
%/ The Executive Directors approved on September 4, 1973, reallocation
of US$ 50,000 from Loan No. 540-GA to cover the initial cost of
architectural services for the proposed second education project.

This project is progressing on schedule without significant
problems. Contracts covering 90 percent of all items have been signed
and are 24 percent below appraisal estimates, largely due to inter-
national competitive bidding. Howqever, recent price inflation might
increase total contract costs through the escalation clauses.
