INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTIOM AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT MI) RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO T14E EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
OI3 A PROPOSED LOAN TO NICERIA
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the equivalent of $17.3 million to help
finance a project for the reconstruction and expansion of 23 secondary schools
and 7 primary teacher training colleges in the East-Central, Rivers and South
Eastern States and related technical assistance. The loan would have a term
of 25 years, including 10 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annurfm.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The proposed loan - the sixteenth Bank/IDA operation in Nigeria and
thic second for education - would increase total Bank/IDA lending to $391.4
million (net of cancellations), representing over 40 percent of Nigeria's ex-
ternal debt. A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC invest-
ments as of Februarv 29, 1972 is given in Annex I.
3.        Nigeria's performance in executing Bank/IDA financed projects was
described fully in paragraphs 34-42 of my report and recommendation on the
rehabilitation program loan (P-911, dated April 2, 1971). Developments since
then are described in the following paragraphs.
4.        The status of the first education project (Credit 72-UNI) was de-
scribed in my memorandum of March 3, 1972 (IDA/R72-26). Project implementa-
tion outside the three Eastern States is now proceeding satisfactorily and,
following approval of amendments to the Credit Agreement in respect of the
Eastern States' component, that part of the project is expected to move ahead
quickly. The entire project is expected to be completed by the revised Clos-
ing Date of June 30, 1974.
5.        The serious problems affecting the Apapa Road project financed under
Loan 426-PNIT were reported to the Executive Directors in a memorandum from the
Secretary dated June 10, 1970 (SecM70-271) and in my report on the rehabilita-
tion program loan referred to above. Since then, the Federal Government and
Messrs. Gutfanti-Bonrniger have negotiatedl a revised construction contract,
which was apnroved hy the Federal. Executive Council in October, 1971 and is
awaiting signature., Meanwyhile, work has continued and the Federal Government
expects to stubrilt the signed contract and withdrawal applications in respect
of paymlents for construction since March, 1970 very shortly.  As soon as
these have been received, disbursement of the remaining $7.5 million of this
loan can resume. The project is now expected to be completed by about mid-1973.
Disbursement of twro subsequent transport loans - for highway rehabilitation
(040-UNI) and trnnsnort rehabilitation (694-UNI) - has been extremely slow,



owing to delays in tendering (640-UNI) and the time taken to -reach an under-
standing with the Government on the items to be included in the project
(694-UNI).  However, contracts have now been awarded and equipment ordered
for both projects and work has commenced.   The first withdrawal. applications,
amounting to about $1.4 million (640-UNI) and about $2.9 million (094-TRIT),
have now been received and disbursement of botlh loans is expected to accelerate
considerably during 1972. Disbursement of the rehabilitation program loan
(732-UNI) is proceeding satisfactorily; about $64.5 million h4ad becn withdrawn
at the end of February and I expect the loan to he fully disbpursept before the
end of this fiscal year.  The $7.2 million loan (764-UtTI) for the Wlestern
State Cocoa Project was declared effective on November 5, 197f1, and the first
withdrawal applications have just been received.. The Nigerian Industrial
Development Bank (NIDB) will probably commit the full amount of the second
Bank loan (705-UNI) by about the end of 1972 and an appraisal mission is
currently in the field with a view to preparing a possible third loan.
6.        Uitherto, Bank/IDA lending to Nigeria has concentrated on transport
and power (about 67 percent of total Bank/IDA lending).   Bothlsectors are
given high priority in Nigeria's Second National Development Plan (1970/71-
1973/74) and, in view of their substantial capital requirements, continued
external assistance is expected to be required.   A transport sector mission
visited Nigeria in mid-197i and its report, currently under reviewi by the
Governmuent and the Bank, identifies projects in highways, railroads, ports
and aviation. I expect to recommend a loan for a fifth highway project
very shortly. In power, the proposed merger of the Flectricity Corporation
of Nigeria (ECN) and the Niger Dams Autlhority (DTA) into a sinhIe entity
for the generation, distribution and marketing of power, a move which the
Bank strongly supports, is now scheduled to become effective in April, 1972.
Later this fiscal year, I expect to recommend a substantial loan to the new
corporation to help finance its expansion program.
7.        To date, the Bank Group has made only one loan for agriculture
(764-UNI) and one credit for education (72-UNI). However, both sectors were
the subject of survey missions in 1971, education by UJNESCO and agriculture
by the Bank. In addition, a Bank-sponsored and financed CommonxYealth Develop-
ment Corporation (CDC) mission reviewed the livestock sub-s6ctofr in the North
and West in 1970 and another CDC mission recently completed fieldwork for a
possible tree-crop rehabilitation project in South-Eastern State.   The aari-
culture and education sector surveys, both now under review by the Nigerian
authorities, identify priority prolects suitable for external financing.
8.        The Government and the Bank are thus currently engAged in substani-
tial project preparation work, with particular emphasis on sectors which have
received far less attention in the past than their importance.requires.   As
emerges from the followinig -iscussion on the economy, inadequac"y of project
preparation and limited adimiinistrative capability stand out a.lt the more
sharply as obstacles to economic development.   Nigeria's growing revenues from
petroleum are greatly expanidng the resources available to finance investment,
but they also pose a challenge to her financial and economic management. This
new situation calls for a careful review both of the level and the composition
of future Bank support for Nigeria.   This review is currently under way and



-3-
I expect to indicate its main conclusions when presenting the proposed power
loan to the Executive Directors before the end of this fiscal year.
PART II - TIE ECONOMY
9.        An economic report on Nigeria (AW-22a) was distributed to the Exe-
cutive Directors on January 29, 1971 an(d my report on the rehabilitation pro-
gram loan (P-911, of April 2, 1971) contained additional material relating to
the Ni-erian economy.   An economic mission returned from Nigeria in November,
1971 an(I its report will be distributed to the Executive Directors within the
next two months. The principal conclusions of the mission are summarized
in tii, following paragraphs.  A country data sheet is provided at Annex II.
10.       Two years after the end of its 30-month civil war, Nigeria appears
to be making good progress in overcoming the legacies of that conflict, in
rehabilitating its economy and in turning its attention once again to the
problems and opporttunities of long-run growth, development and social better-
ment.  The current rapid growth of production and indome and the marked im-
provement in the country's balance of pavments (both developments due largely
to the oil. boom) are helping to ease the burdens of reconstruction, while pro-
viding a strong resource base upon which to plan the development of the eco-
nlOmly.
11.       Crude oil production has now reached a level of 1.7 million barrels
per day - more than three times the maximum pre-war rate - and is projected
to rise to 3 million barrels per day by 1977. The contribution of the petro-
leum sector to Government receipts and to the country's exports has reached
50 percent and 75 percent, respectively, and these proportions are still
rising. The sector's share in CDP in 1971 amounted to 12 percent. By the
middle of the decade, this may anproach 16 percent but will still provide
only insig,nificant direct employment opportunities. Thereafter, the sector's
share is expected to decline as the rate of growth in other sectors acceler-
ates.
12.       Compared to an average annual growth of 5.5 percent for GDP during
most of the early Sixties, the post-war increase of national product and in-
come has been unprecedented.   BetwJeen 1969/70 and 1971/72, average growth
has been 14 perce,nt per annum. Only part of this growth is the result of
thie vast increase of crude-oil produlction over these years, as the other sec-
tors of the economv were growing on the average by 7.5 percent per year in
real terms. For the remaining years of the Second National Development Plan
a slower increase! is expected, but the average annual growth rate of rDP for
the full Plan pertiod (1970/71-1973/74) will nevertheless probably exceed 10
percent - 26 perc'ent in the petroleum sector and 8.5 percent in the rest of
the economy.  Exports nre risinp, much more rapidly than imports of goods and
non-factor servic!es, thus reversing the resource gap of earlier years. The
increase of priva'te consumption is expected to be only modest in relation to
available resoulrces, amounting to some 8 percent per year in real terms during



- 4 -
the Plan period, or 5.5 percent per year per capita.    Because of the important
role and special nature of the petroleum sector, there w.ill he large Increases
in Government savings.
13.       The current year (1971-72) has witnessed a dramatic inprovement
in the fiscal position of the Federa] and State Governments. Largely as a
result of the greatly expanded volume of petroleum production and increases
in the posted-price of crude oil, Federal recurrent revenues',have approxi-
mately tripled since 1969/70 to over EN 600 million. A current surplus of
about EN 170 million this year is expected to replace a deficit of tlhat
magnitude which existed two years ago.    State revenues have also showm sub-
stantial improvement, primarily because of larger Federal statutory trans-
fers, which now account for 78 percent of the States' currentt receipts, ra-
tlher than as the result of any significant new tax efforts.   Together, Fed-
eral and State recurrent revenues have increased from 14 percent of GflP at
factor cost in 1969/70 to an estimated 24 percent in 1971/72.
14.       Federal non-defense recurrent expenditures will probably rise by
about 20 percent in 1971/72 over the previous year.    Of particular note,
Federal recurrent spending for economic and social services sh6ws a
significant increase above the hitherto nearly static level maintained for
tlhe past decade. Substantial wage and salary adjustments recently granted
to the civil service and the army also account for much of the increase in
recurrent expenditures at both State and Federal levels. Defense and se-
curity expenditures (including defense capital) dipped in 1970/71 but hiave
probably risen again, still accounting for an estimated 58 percent of the
Federal recurrent budget, compared writh the war--time peak of 63 percent.
Little data is available regarding State expenditures in recent years, al-
though here, too, the trend is upward.   This refllects, in large part, the
rapid expansion of administrative expenditures in the several.inew states.
15.       Total non-defense public-sector capital expenditures in 1971/72
are likely to be about EN 160 million - up from the EM 100 million
spent in 1970/71, but still well below the Plan and budget target of more
than EN 200 million for the year. Federal and State receipts are expected
to yield a sufficient surplus to cover all anticipated public capital exPCn-
ditures in 1971/72 and, for the first time since independence, there may
even be an overall government surplus. Nigeria's domestic savings and bal-
ance-of-payments position will continue to provide a strong basis for develop-
ment during most of this decade.   Current fiscal concerns relate to the non-
inflationary employment and efficient allocation of resources which are ex-
pected to rise by nearly 50 percent over the next two years and to continue
growing at a rate.of at least 10 percent per year thereafter.
16.       In the two years ending last June, the Nigerian money supply
(including savings deposits) grew by 183 percent. 1While some of this
increase was accounted for by remonetization in the East and t-he additional
liquidity created by arrears on import payments, most of it, stemming fron



-5-
the heavy reliance of the Government on largely short-term borrowing from
the banking system, has been highly inflationary. Domestic inflation, as
measured by the urban, low-income consumer price index, accelerated during
the first half of 1971. In June, the price index was 19 percent above its
level of a year earlier. Most of the increase in 1971, as reflected in the
index, was attributable to food prices and, in view of the geographically
widespread nature of this phenomenon, appears to be largely related to the
rapid expansion of money and credit. Government measures against inflation
appear to have had little or no effect so far and appropriate monetary pol-
icies remain to be identified.
17.       There has been a striking turn-about in Nigeria's external finan-
cial position during this second post-war year. Confident that realized oil
revenues would soon exceed import payments, the Government liberalized im-
ports early in the year and took steps to restore much needed regularity and
certainty in the allocation of foreign exchange. Oil exports doubled again
in 1971/72 and the net foreign exchange impact of the petroleum sector rose
from EN 165 million in 1970/71 to an estimated EN 385 million this year.
Since April, 1971, imports - which are expected to show a further 30 percent
rise this year - have been paid for on a regular basis. At the same time,
the Government has liquidated the backlog of commercial payments which ap-
peared to pose a serious threat to the economy a year ago. The country's
net international liquidity position has improved substantially as a result
of the reduction in short-term liabilities, but reserves of about EN 100
million are equivalent to only two months' imports. With careful management
of the economy, it would be possible for the Government to relax remaining
foreign exchange controls and restore import payments to a fully current
basis over the next two years.
18.       Agricultural exports which have traditionally accounted for almost
all of Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings, are expected to grow very little.
Although the prospects for crude oil exports are good, Nigeria's heavy de-
pendence on one commodity introduces a new element of uncertainty in its ex-
port prospects and points to the urgent need to utilize resources now avail-
able to establish a base for sustained development in the non-petroleum sec-
tor. Moreover, after the middle of the decade, as further expansion of pe-
troleum production slows, the rate of growth of imports is likely to be
greater than that of net oil receipts.
19.       Despite the growing importance of other sectors, agriculture,
including forestry and fishing, which accounted for about 50 percent of GDP
at factor cost in 1970/71, will remain a key factor in Nigeria's economic
development as the largest employer of labor (currently about 72 percent of
the labor force), the principal source of food and raw materials for the in-
creasing population and a significant earner of foreign exchange. The ac-
celeration of agricultural growth and the provision of additional employment
opportunities in the sector is, therefore, crucial to the country's future
progress.
20.       The Bank agricultural sector mission which visited Nigeria last year
concluded that, if immediate steps were taken to improve producer price incen-
tives and the supply of farm inputs and transportation and to restore produc-
tion in the East, agricultural output could achieve an average annual growth



-6-
rate of 3 percent through 1975, provided weather were favorable and food out-
put responded to the pressures of demand.   This woutld still, he less than the
3.3 percent average annual increase recorded from 1958/5') through 1966/67 and
also less than is needed to provide adequiate domestic supplies tinder condi-
tions of rapid income growth, particularly in the urban areas. This may he
less a problem of the potential for expanding the supply of agricujlturAl pro-
ducts, which appears to be substantial, than one of expanding facilities for
the transport, marketing and storage of agricultural. produice for domestic con-
sumption and of providing adequate credit at several stages from the, produicer
to the market outlets.
21.       The promotion of agricultural growth wiJl rentire an increasing
share of the country's resources in the coming years, both throug,h direct in-
vestments in the sector and by way of the provision of economic infrastructure
conducive to agricultural development.   The distribution of resource uses be-
tween urban and rural areas is not only crucial. for balanced growth and the
restoration and maintenance of price stability, but can also serve the purpose
of stemming the present rapid growth of urban centers and concomitant income
inequities within the urban areas and between the urban dwellers and the rural
population majority. Problems of planning and project preparation associated
with a development strategy of that nature are serious and will necessitate a
substantial infusion of technical, organizational and managerial skills from
abroad.
22.       Since independence, the manufacturing sector has expanded very ra-
pidly: the growth of value added has averaged over 11 percent annually. In
large-scale manufacturing alone, it has risen over 15 percent annually since
1960 and about 20 percent during each of the past two years. Development be-
gan from a small base, however, and manufacturing's contriblutioni to GDP is
still well below 10 percent.  The surplus capacity of earlier yeats has dis-
appeared in many industries and recent increases in output haved hot kept pace
with the rapid growthl of consumer demand. Vigorous investment activity and
lively forcign interest in new ventures have resulted.
23.       Despite the improvement in the country's financial anl balance-of-
payments position since the Plan was prepared early in 1070, tCe Goverinment
is experiencing difficulty in meeting its public investment targets.   Prclim-
inary data indicate that there was substantial slippage in 1970/71, but some
imiiprovenment in 1971/72. Moreover, the extent of Plan fulfillment thus far lias
varied greatly between sectors and among the individual States.   In narticu-
lar, public capital expenditure in agriculture and by some of the new states
is behind the Plan schedule.
24.       For the balance of the present Plan period, it will probably not be
possible to expand absorptive capacity - especially that of the States - suf-
ficiently to take full advantage of the improved resource position.   There has
been some strengthening of administrative arrangements for planning and imple-
menting public sector programs, but much remains to be done in this regard.
It is essential that Nigeria resolve these problems, for a much larger public
investment program is clearly required in terms of Nigeria' s economic and so-
cial needs. Project preparation and investment capacity more generally now
loom as the major developmental constraints and are the issues to which the
Government will have to apply increasing attention.



PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
25.       Nigeria's education system consists of (i) a six-year primary cycle
commencing at age seven, (ii) a five-year secondary cycle leading to the "Or-
dinary" West African School Certificate (WASC) and a further two-year course
leading to the "Advanced" level, (iii) vocational and teacher training at
various levels after the primary cycle, and (iv) higher education of three to
five years at universities and other institutions.
26.       During the 1960s, primary and secondary school enrollment grew some-
what less than the estimated 2.5 percent annual population growth. Enroll-
ment in technical and vocational schools doubled and university enrollment
tripled, both, however, from low base figures. Nigeria spent about 3.2 per-
cent of GDP on education in 1970, a proportion which has remained almost cons-
tant since 1963, is low compared with other African countries and is not ex-
pected to increase during the present Plan period. The States are primarily
responsible for financing education, which accounted for about 35 percent of
their recurrent expenditures in 1970/71. They receive Federal Government
grants for part of their capital expenditures.
27.       Nigeria's Development Plan, which points to serious problems in the
education sector, outlines proposals for capital investment but does not offer
a strategy for educational development. Its main policies are: (a) to
restore facilities and equipment damaged or disrupted by the civil war; (b)
to expand education at all levels to achieve higher enrollment ratios, im-
proved quality and educational equality between the States; and (c) to develop
and expand technical and teacher training. The Plan's public sector investment
program allocates about EN 139 million (13.5 percent) to education, EN 49 mil-
lion by the Federal Government and EN 90 million by the States; about 45 per-
cent of the total is for primary and secondary education, 9 percent for tech-
nical and teacher training and 30 percent for university education. The
specific objectives for education during the present Plan period are as fol-
lows:
(i)  Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
The Plan envisages specific Federal Government assistance
to the Eastern States to restore and reactivate education-
al facilities and services disrupted by the civil war.
The proposed loan will contribute directly towards this
objective.
(ii)  Improyed Enrollment Ratios and Geographical Balance
In 1970, primary and secondary school enrollment ratios
for the country as a whole were about 34 percent and 4
percent respectively, ranging from about 5 percent in one
State to about 80 percent in another at the primary level
and from 0.4 percent to 9 percent at the secondary level.



- 8 -
The six Northern States were at the lower end of both
scales. The Plan's objective is a national minimum enroll-
ment ratio of 50 percent at the primary level by the mid-
1970s and 25 percent at the secondary level before the end
of the 1970s. The Plan emphasizes the need to equalize edu-
cational opportunity between the States; however, while some
Federal Government assistance will go to the North, it is
not clear, on the basis of the uneven States' investment pro-
grams, how this objective will be achieved.
(iii)  Qualitative Improvements
Increased primary school enrollments over the past .20 years
have been accompanied by a 60 percent drop-out rate, one-of
the highest in the world. Poor facilities and teaching,
both reflecting inadequate financing, are the main deficien-
cies, common to all levels of education in Nigeria,, although
drop-outs are lower at post-primary levels. Moreover, the
secondary school curriculum, geared mainly to university en-
trance and biased towards the arts, does not prepare students
for higher education in science and technology or middle-lev-
el occupations requiring prevocational training. Accordingly,
the Plan envisages the strengthening of science training and
the introduction of practical, employment-oriented shop work.
In this connection, secondary grammar schools in the Eastern
States are being converted into comprehensive schools; the
proposed loan will support this objective.
(iv)  Coordinated Expansion
Because development of secondary education has lagged behind
that of primary education, serious unemployment and frustra-
tion among primary school leavers has occurred at a, time when
skilled, middle-level technical manpower is in short supply.
The Plan aims at selective expansion of secondary, especially
technical and vocational, education to absorb the increasing
primary school output and to mitigate the manpower shortage.
(v)  Supply of Teachers
A serious shortage of qualified teachers is a major con-
straint on the development of primary and secondary educa-
tion in Nigeria. About 2,000 teachers have already been or
are currently being trained under the Federally-financed
Emergency Teacher Training Program, which will continue dur-
ing the current Plan period.
28.       While these objectives are sound, it is difficult to translate them
into a comprehensive and specific program because of the inadequacies of edu-
cational and manpower planning in Nigeria and the lack of data for such plan-
ning. Information on manpower needs, development and utilization is meager



-9-
and it is therefore virtually impossible to match educational outputs with em-
ployment needs and hence derive an optimum distribution of investments within
the education and training system. Even sd, the expansion of primary and sec-
ondary education will probably remain of high priority, based on social demand
and the shortage of secondary school graduates. While the Federal Government
is engaged in training educational planners with UNESCO assistance, much needs
to be done to improve educational and manpower planning, at both Federal and
State levels, to relate educational development more closely to projected
economic growth and, more specifically, all specialized and higher education
and training programs to some measure of anticipated needs. The Federal
Government is also considering the establishment of a national commission to
study the education system.
29.       The 1971 UNESCO Project Identification Mission confirmed the need
to expand and improve primary and secondary education in the Northern States
with the dual purpose of reducing disparities between the States and removing
the bottleneck of a shortage of secondary school graduates. Priority areas
recommended for early action are primary teacher training, the expansion of
industrial training at skilled worker and technician levels, the expansion of
secondary education, reform of secondary school curricula to increase their
relevance to the country's needs, expansion of adult education and improved
provision for agricultural training with special attention to non-formal
training systems.
PART IV - THE PRDJECT
30.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project in
Nigeria" (PE-33a dated March 9, 1972) has been distributed separately. A
Loan and Project Summary is attached to this report as Annex III.
31.       The genesis of the project was the Federal Government's request
in January, 1970 that the Eastern States' component of the first education
project (Credit 72-UNI) be reactivated and that these States' additional
needs for school reconstruction as a result of the civil war be considered
for supplementary Bank assistance. Bank missions visited Nigeria in October/
November, 1970 and in March, 1971 to re-appraise the Eastern States' compo-
nent of 72-UNI in the light of post-war priorities and to identify and ap-
praise this second project. During negotiations held in September, 1971
in Washington, the proposed $14 million loan was increased to $16 million
to accommodate an additional three schools requested bylSouth-Eastern State
and, following the revaluation of the Nigerian pound in relation to the US
dollar at the end of December 1971, it was increased further to $17.3 million.
Presentation of the proposed loan has been held up by the time required by one
State to approve'the draft Loan Agreement.
The inter-related objectives of the project are threefold:
(a) to rehabilitate selected war-damaged secondary schools and
primary teacher-training colleges;



- 10 -
(b)  to consolidate and expand these schools and colleg,es into
viable units; and
(c)  to strengthen science teaching and implement secondarv school
curriculum reform.
The scope of the project has taken into account the States' capital allocations
for education under the Plan, their own prlorities for the selection
of key secondary schools to be converted into comprehenslve scllools and their
ability to provide teachers for the schools concerned.   The main components
of the project are described below. A map showing the location of the proj-
ect institutions is attached.
Secondary Comprehensive Schools
32.       East-Central State, the most populous of the three Eastern States,
suffered the greatest war damage to its schools, has the largest Plan capital
allocation for education, and consequently comprises the largest share of the
project. The project will rehabilitate ten secondary schools anfl provi(de
additional facilities and equipment for their expansion and conversion into
comprehensive schools, with a total of 11,230 student places (7,659 rehabil-
itation and 3,575 additional) or about 12 percent of the State's expected
total secondary school enrollment in 1974. The schools will be co-educational
and all but two will enroll 1,000 - 1,400 students.   Most wll have arts,
science, technical or agricultural, commerce and home economics streams and
three will have two sixth form streams of arts and science.
33.       Rivers State. The project will rehabilitate five secondary schools
and provide additional facilities and equipment for their exparision and con-
version into comprehensive schools, with a total of 3,700 studeTit places
(1,770 rehabilitation and 1,930 additional) or about 37 percent of the State's

project will rehabilitate seven primary teaclher training colleges al.e pro-
vide additional classrooms, science teaching workshops and worklshops for
home economics, arts and crafts. Thereafter, primary teaclher training for
the entire State will be largely concentrated in these seven co-educational



colle-es, whclCh will accommodate 600 students in two-year post-secondary
courses. Together, they will graduate about 2,000 much needed primary
teachers annually. They are located near primary schools for easy access
to practice teachling.
Technical Assistance
36.       The project includes three types of technical assistance:
(a)  five and ton one-year fellowships for East-Central and
Rivers State respectively and two experts for five man-
years for South-Eastern State to organize and teach ac-
ceJ.erated training courses for some of the additional
techlnical subject teachers required for the comprehensive
schlools bv 1974,
(b)  one curriculum specialist for each State for one year to
help local staff develop the broader curricula required for
the comprehensive schools, and
(c)  twelve man-years of consultant architects' services to
assist the States in preparing standardized designs and
specifications for the project schools and bidding documents.
To ensure continuity, Nigerian counterparts will be assigned to work with con-
sultants and specialists employed under the project.
Project Costs and Financing Plan
37.       The total. project cost is estimated to be $27.8 million, inclutding
$15.fl million in foreign exchange. Detailed costs are given in Annex III.
The proposed $17.3 million loan will finance the entire foreign exchange
cost and $1.5 million of interest and other charges on the loan during con-
struction. The Federal Government will pass the loan proceeds on to the
three State Governments and will also finance the estimated $12.0 million
local costs.
Project Admi3istration
33.       A fiill-time project director, reporting to the Permanent Secretary
of th1e Federal Ministry of Education, and with quallfications acceptable to
th)e Banlk, will be responsible for project implementation.  His function will
bn to supervise the implementation and financial control of the project, main-
tain lJaison with thc Bank and coordinate the work of the three project units
to he established in the Itinistries of Education in each of the three States.
Each State project unit will be headled by a project manager, responsible to
the State Permanent Secretary of Education, and with qualifications acceptable
to the Bank. Under the guidance of the project director, each project manager

39.       The consultant architects referred to above will assist the project
managers in surveying project schools, developing standardized design giuildes
and preparing bid packages for construction, furniture and equipment.    Space
requirements, design and building standards developed] in the first project
(72-UNI) will be applied wherever feasible to economize on professional fees
and to speed implementation.   A consultant finn satlsfactory to thc Bank ha3
been selected and signature of its contract wxitli the Federal (ovornment is a
condition of signature of the proposed loan. Ministries of Works' architects
or local private architects will design the individual school and coll ege
buildings, using design guides developed by thc-consultant firm.
Procurement
40.       Contracts for civil works, equipment and furniture will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines.  All civil works contracts are expected to be won by Nigerian
companies or by foreign companies already worlcing in Nigeria; most of the
furniture is expected to be supplie(I locally but equipment will come largely
from overseas.  Domestic manufacturers of furniture andI equipment will be al-
lowed a preference in bid comparison equal to the prevailing duty on competing
imports or 15 percent of their c.i.f. price, whlichever is lower.
Disbursement
41.       The proposed loan will be disbursed against tlhe c.i.f. price of
imported furniture and equipment, 50 percent of the cost of civil works,
professional services, technical assistance and locally procturerl goods, repre-
senting the estimated foreign exchange component, and interest and other charges
durin- construction. While the draft Loan Agreement provides for withdrawals
in respect of expenditures on professional services and technical assistance
incurred after October 1, 1971, actual expenditures are unlikelv to exceed
$80,000, of which $40,000 would be eligible for reimhtursement.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRWUENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Sec-
tion 4 (iii) of the Articles,of Agreement and the text of a resolution ap-
proving the proposed loan have been distributed senarately. The detailed
covenants under which the three States will carry out the project, usually
contained in Project Agreements between the Bank and project executing agencies,
will in this case, for reasons of procedural convenience to the Nigerian au-
thorities, take the form'of Undertakings from each of the three States to the
Borrower and the Bank, satisfactory to the Bank and meeting the requirements
set forth in Schedule 5 of the draft Loan Agreement.   The submission to the



- 13 -
Bank by the Borrower of these Undertakings, signed by the three States, and
the appointment of the Federal project director and the three State project
managers will be conditions of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.
43.       I arn satisfied that the proposed loan would complv withi the Articles
of AGreement of the Bank..
