PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
NIGERIA SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 814-UNI)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the Second Education Project in
Nigeria for which Loan 814-UNI, signed in April 1972, provided US$17.3 mil-
lion. The Loan was fully disbursed on June 5, 1980.
The audit report comprises: (a) a Project Performance Audit Memoran-
dum (PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and (b) a
Project Completion Report (PCR) dated December 3, 1980 prepared, following a
mission to Nigeria, by the Western Africa Projects Department. The PCR
mission of February/March 1980 held discussions with Borrower officials and
visited some of the project sites, while the mission architect also visited
London for discussions with the consultant architects. Information was updated
by a subsequent visit to Nigeria by the leader of the completion mission.
No field visit was undertaken by OED specifically for this audit.
However, in January/February 1978, an OED mission visited Nigeria in connec-
tion with a seventeen-country study of Bank operations in the education
sector. This mission visited Enugu and Lagos and held discusions on the three
education projects in Nigeria with officials at State and Federal levels. The
views expressed by these officials have been reflected both in the Report of
that studyl/ and in the Project Performance Audit Report for the First
Education Project in Nigeria2 * The PPAM is based on the findings of this
mission as well as a review of the PCR, material in the Bank's files relating
to the project, the Appraisal Report (PE-33a) dated March 9, 1972, the Presi-
dent's Report (P-1046) of March 16, 1972, the record of the Board's discussion
of this project on March 28, 1972, and the Loan Agreement (814-UNI) dated
April 18, 1972.    The project experience has been discussed with Bank staff
associated with the project.
As is customary in the preparation of PPARs, a draft of this Report
was sent to officials of the Borrower for comment.      The Borrower s comments
are reproduced at pages 13 and 14 of this report.
The PCR, which has been revised after discussion with OED, achieves
broad coverage of the project experience with varying depths of analysis of
specific aspects.   In the light of the unusual problems experienced in this
project, the PPAM has found it necessary to analyze more thoroughly, and add
some observations on, implementation time and cost overruns, building design
and construction problems, and the educational aspects of project implementa-
tion. In addition, the PPAM draws some comparisons with the experience of the
Nigeria First Education Project (Cr. 72-UNI).

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
NIGERIA SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 814-UNI)
HIGHLIGHTS
Following the Civil War in Nigeria (1967-70), Loan 814-UNI was
approved in March 1972, to assist in rehabilitating and reconstructing war
damaged educational institutions in the three Eastern States of Nigeria. The
project--the Second Education Project in Nigeria--was aimed at expanding
and strengthening secondary and primary teacher education by helping to
rehabilitate secondary schools and primary teacher training colleges, reform
them, and improve the quality of their instruction.
The project provided for constructing, furnishing and equipping new
facilities at seven primary teacher training colleges and 23 secondary schools
(of which one was new), as well as technical assistance for teacher training,
curriculum development, and architectural support services. Facilities
for pre-vocational instruction were scheduled to be provided in secondary
schools.   In some cases, it was intended that certain prnject secondary
schools should be "matched" with neighboring schools, so as to share the use
of these facilities.
The project has been worthwhile. In view of the difficulties
confronting the Borrower during the reconstruction period, it has to be
considered a remarkable achievement to have successfully expanaed the facili-
ties for primary teacher and secondary education. The educational objectives
of the project are generally being achieved, except that the "matched" school
concept has not been fully implemented, and many of the workshops are not yet
functioning (PPAM, paras. 10 and 41).     The project institutions have higher
enrollments than those envisaged at appraisal (PPAM, paras. 35 and 36).      New
curricula have been developed (PPAM, para. 39).
The project took almost three times as long to implement as had
been originally envisaged, largely because of institutional weaknesses of the
States in the aftermath of the Civil War, particularly the shortage of quali-
fied project management staff, and the Borrower's inadequate financial support
of project implementation. However, the appraisal implementation schedule was
unrealistically tight (PCR, para. 1.02). Cost overruns of some 180% resulted
from (a) higher than expected rates of price inflation, especially in the
context of overall delays; (b) the difficult circumstances of reconstruction,
and (c) higher than expected costs of professional services (PPAM, paras.
16-20, 22-29; PCR, para. 1.02). During implementation, the Borrower undertook
to build the new secondary school and to finance all equipment and furniture
for the project schools without seeking reimbursement from the Loan proCEeds.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
NIGERIA SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 814-UNI)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY
1.        In January 1970, following the end of the Civil War (1967-1970) in
Nigeria, the Federal Government requested assistance to help reconstruct and
rehabilitate war-damaged and destroyed educational institutions, especially in
the three States of the former Eastern Region--East-Central, Rivers and South-
Eastern--by reopening that part of Credit 72-UNI which had been suspended by
the Federal Government in those States when the Civil War began. The Govern-
ment stressed the need for urgent action, and asked the Bank to consider
giving additional assistance for school construction.       In October/November
1970, the Bank sent a mission to (a) supervise implementation of the First
Project, (b) reappraise the portion of the First Education Project applicable
to the Eastern States and analyze reconstruction requirements and (c) discuss
the possibility of having a "crash" project for assisting reconstruction as
well as a more comprehensive nationwide project.     This mission agreed that a
"crash" project should be developed and recommended speedy identification,
preparation and appraisal.   In March 1971, a brief two-man mission (architect
and economist) appraised the proposed Second Project. The Loan was negotiated
in September 1971, signed in April 1972, and made effective in November 1972.
2.        The project was formulated to:     (a) rehabilitate,  consolidate and
expand 22 secondary schools and seven primary teacher training colleges into
viable units and construct a new secondary school, and (b) strengthen science
teaching and reform secondary school curricula.    The project was intended to
add 19,890 secondary and 4,200 teacher education places involving the con-
struction of 1,095 teaching spaces comprising classrooms, workshops and
communal buildings. The project included financing for a technical assistance
program, in case this could not be financed through other sources.          This
program included teacher training experts (five man-years), curriculum devel-
opment experts (three man-years), and fellowships to train teachers (15 man-
years). In addition, architectural services to develop school building
design guides and to monitor building design and construction were included
for financing.
3.        The establishment of a Central Project Office in the Federal Minis-
try of Education, with a full-time Project Director, and the appointment
of a Project Manager for each State Project Unit were conditions of signature
of the Loan Agreement.
4.        The project has been completed with certain changes.    During imple-
mentation, the Borrower undertook to finance, without reimbursement from the
loan proceeds, the provision of the new secondary school and all furniture and
equipment for the project schools. The Borrower undertook curriculum develop-
ment without resort to technical assistance.     Two technical teacher training



experts to train the technical teachers for one State were financed by the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation.     The project has therefore as-
sisted the rehabilitation and expansion of 29 educational institutions--which
have provided 21,570 secondary school places (about 8% more than planned)
and 4,350 teacher training places (some 4% more than planned)--and financed
fellowships to train technical teachers. Final disbursement was made in June
1980, 4-1/2 years after the originally planned Closing Date.     An implementa-
tion time overrun of 197% and a cost overrun of 180% in US dollar terms (163%
in Naira terms) were incurred.
II. PRINCIPAL ISSUES
(a) Project Generation
5.        At the time of the generation of the Second Education Project, the
Bank had had some six years' experience with the Nigeria First Education
Project (Credit 72-UNI).1/ The implementation of the First Project had
already been delayed and was    proceeding very slowly.   There had been delays
in concluding a contract with the consultant architects, shortages of person-
nel for project management, dislocation caused by the Civil War and shortages
of construction materials. Some of these problems were continuing.
6.        In some ways,   the approach to the Second Project differed       from
the approach to the First.   In order to improve the coordination of implemen-
tation, (a) the Borrower was required in the Second Project to establish
project units in the States and (b) consultant architects were provided as
technical assistance support for design and construction of buildings, instead
of as overall coordinators of project implementation. Furthermore, the
consultant architects were identified early and, at negotiations, it was
agreed that they would be appointed within a month.    Nonetheless, some of the
shortcomings of project generation in the case of the First Project were
repeated in the case of the Second.    For example, the established sequence of
steps in the project generation cycle--identification, preparation and ap-
praisal--was, as in the case of the First Project, short-circuited. The Bank
staff, doubtless influenced by the urgency of the situation, and believing
that they had sufficient knowledge of the educational situation in the coun-
try, wished to accelerate the processing of the Second Project. Thus, project
items were arrived at principally through correspondence--the Borrower supply-
ing technical data and the Bank relying on this material and on its desk
1/   See Project Performance Audit Report - Nigeria: First Education Project
(Credit 72-UNI) dated May 7, 1979 (Report No. 2498).



- 3 -
knowledge  of  the  sector.    Thereafter,  an appraisal missio /,     comprising
only an architect and an economist and not including the customary education
specialists, spent only eleven days in the field--an unusually brief period.
Hence, identification, preparation and appraisal were neither orthodox nor as
thorough as usual, and it is to the unusual manner of generating this project
that several of the subsequent misunderstanding (and consequent delays) can be
attributed. In this respect the experience of the First Project was repeated.
7.        Furthermore, the three State governments concerned were unfamiliar
with Bank practices and were rebu4lding their civil services and formulating
policies to cope with the immense and complex task of reconstruction.         The
amount of time (three years) allowed in the appraisal report for project
implementation was inadequate in these circumstances.
8.        In a sense, this project did not represent a typical Bank interven-
tion; its interim character was underlined by the fact that contemporaneously
with the appraisal field visit--in February-March 1971--there was a ten-man
UNESCO Project Identification mission in the field (for a total of 54 man-
weeks) reviewing national needs and priorities in education /.      As the report
of this UNESCO mission indicated, the needs of the three States of the former
Eastern Region were far in excess of what was being financed under this Second
Project.   Project composition was as yet unsettled during negotiations.      The
question of the reallocation of US$2.6 million from the First Education
Project among the three Eastern States was still being discussed. As a result
of the final decision on this matter, three schools were added to the South-
Eastern State component of the Second Project at loan negotiations.        By the
end of December 1971, the Federal Government and two States (East-Central and
South-Eastern) had approved the Draft Loan Agreement, but Rivers State had
not.
9.        The State Executive Council of Rivers State was prepared to approve
the proposed Loan, provided the State was not bound to adopt the concept of
comprehensive system of secondary education proposed by the Bank for this
project. This concept was then being widely promoted by the Bank in education
1/   The terms of reference of this mission refer to it as a post-appraisal
mission for the Second Education Project. However, there is no record in
the files of any previous appraisal mission.      On its return to office,
the mission reported that it had collected the information needed to
complete the draft appraisal report for the Second Project.      The mission
is, therefore, regarded in this PPAM as an Appraisal Mission. A mission
in October/November 1970 had been sent to Nigeria to supervise the First
Project, reappraise First Project items in the Eastern States, and dis-
cuss the possibility of a "crash" project to assist in reconstruction as
well as a nationwide project.
2/   This mission report was published by UNESCO in September 1971:     Education
in Nigeria. Educational Projects for External Aid. Two Vols.



projects.   The State Government asked that the Bank be more flexible in its
definition of comprehensive education, so as to enable secondary schools other
than comprehensive secondary schools to be included in the project.        Even-
tually, in late February 1972, Rivers State approved the draft Loan Agreement
without reservation. However, this disagreement, on a substantial educational
issue at such a late stage, illustrates the difference which existed between
the Bank's assumptions and the State Government's position on project content.
10.       The appraisal mission had proposed that small secondary schools
located close to each other be placed under one administration, or "matched",
so that they could achieve economies by sharing workshops and communal faci-
lities.   This was accepted and agreed to.      However, the "matching" idea,
although successful in some cases, has not proved practicable in all circum-
stances (PCR, paras. 3.01, 5.02 and 6.02). In some cases of heavy enrollment,
"matching" was administratively difficult; in others, "matching" was impos-
sible, either because the school principals were reluctant to merge facilities
or because, in the case of Imo State, a policy decision was taken not to
"match" boys' and girls- schools.   In other cases where the sites were contig-
uous, sharing of facilities was not practicable, because of either physical
features separating a site (e.g. a stream) or the long distances between the
teaching facilities of the adjacent schools concerned.       Thus, some schools
have been left with facilities inadequate for self-contained independent
operation while others have more facilities than originally expected because
of duplication of facilities at each of the matched schools (PCR, para. 6.02).
This was clearly a case where the idea needed to have been elaborated in
greater detail at preparation and appraisal, and to have been more widely
discussed for its practicability to have been fully assessed.
11.       Another problem concerning the operation of the project schools
was the availability of water.     The audit was informed that all the sites
visited by the completion mission and, to the best of the mission's knowledge,
most of those not visited, were experiencing severe water supply difficulties.
The project as originally designed included no remedial provision for this;
such provision was added, however, during implementation.      As a result, the
completion of these works has experienced delays (see also PCR, para. 5.03).
(b)   Project Management
12.       In the First Education Project (Credit 72-UNI), project management
was assisted by an expatriate firm of consultant architects whose task was
to propose criteria and goals for economical school construction; to co-
ordinate school planning and design; to advise on the employment of qualified
architects, engineers and contractors; to supervise bidding, contract pro-
cedures and awards, and to supervise construction and disbursement. In
practice, therefore, the consultant architects were the project managers.
Ministries of Works were expected to provide executive architects- services,
whether through their own staff or through employment of private architects.
In the Second Education Project, the responsibility for implementation was
more clearly vested in the Federal and State Ministries of Education, also



- 5 -
assisted by the same firm of consultant architects. The Borrower was required
to establish a Central Project Office to provide overall financial control,
to coordinate and guide the project units in the three Statesl/, and to
appoint a Project Director and State Project Managers before Loan Signature.
13.       As the PCR notes, the Project Director did not enjoy direct access
to the head of the Federal Ministry of Education as the Loan Agreement had
sought to ensure that he would (PCR, para. 4.02).        Four different Project
Directors held office between 1972 and 1980.      The Project Office was never
adequately staffed. The Federal Project Director was appointed on a full-time
basis only in September 1973.      The full-time Project Accountant, required
under the Loan Agreement, was appointed only in September 1979, some 6-1/2
years after Loan Signature.    The services provided by the consultant archi-
tects helped to compensate for these administrative and personnel handicaps of
the Central Project Office.    The consultant architects contributed architec-
tural and accountancy services, participated in the administration of the
architectural and construction aspects of the project, assessed instruc-
tional equipment needs, and undertook periodic progress reporting until April
1979, when their services came to an end.       Since April 1979, the Project
Office Architect has been supplied by the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Cooperation.
14.       The PCR also notes that the State Project Units, responsible for
carrying out physical implementation with some assistance from the consultant
architects, were hampered by insufficient staffing and support.       The State
Project Units in two States (Anambra and Rivers) each typically consisted only
of a project manager who, contrary to the Loan Agreement, was not assigned
full-time to the project.    The division of East Central State into two new
States in 1976 temporarily exacerbated the problem of organizing project man-
agement in these States. The Unit in Cross River State was better staffed and
of higher status, achieved better inter-Ministerial coordination and was more
effective than the Units elsewhere. Thus, throughout project implementation,
despite commendable efforts of project unit staff, these project management
units were never as effective as originally intended (PCR, paras. 4.04-4.06).
(c) Architectural Services
15.       The PCR analyzes the reasons for the extensive time and cost over-
runs (paras. 7.01 and 7.02).   Some further discussion is warranted in view of
the unusual nature of these overruns.
16.         In the First Education Project, the consultant architects prepared
an architectural Design Guide for the school facilities on the basis of which
the actual designs of project schools were prepared by executive architects;
1/   Subsequently, there were four State Project Units.       After 1976, East-
Central State was divided into Anambra and Imo States, and South-Eastern
State was renamed Cross River State.



-6-
executive architects took prolonged periods of time to complete project
designs, and also produced many alternative designs for largely identical
facilities at different schools.     This duplication of effort had entailed
higher costs and implementation time than necessary.      When the same firm of
consultant architects was engaged for the Second Project, it was requested not
only to produce a new and expanded Design and Procedures Guide but also to
provide designs and full working drawings, structural details and bills of
quantities for all "above ground" elements of all buildings common to most of
the project institutions.   This firm was also contracted to survey all sites,
appraise existing facilities as to their suitability for reconstruction or
rehabilitation, determine exactly the new building needs, establish cost
limits for new and rehabilitated construction, and prepare briefs for the
executive architects engaged by the State Project Managers.
17.       The architectural work which was left to be undertaken by the firms
engaged as executive architects was limited to: (a) the design of facilities
(such as administration offices, libraries, dining or multi-purpose halls and
kitchens) for which standardized drawings were not available; (b) such site
specific tasks as the layout of buildings and design of foundations, and (c)
the supervision of construction.    This division of labor between consultant
and executive architects had implications for implementation time and cost.
However, the possibility of effecting economies in design work by using the
structural modules of the standard designs in the preparation of designs of
non-standard buildings, was not explored adequately in advance.
18.       Seven local firms were engaged for projects implemented by the
East-Central State (later Imo and Anambra States), one for Rivers State
institutions, and two for Cross River State project items.     The employment of
no less than ten architectural firms to design the non-standard structures at
29 individual institutions reduced the scope for cost reduction attributable
to replication.
19.       Full bills of quantities     for all   "standard" buildings had been
prepared by the consultant architects; nevertheless, all but one of the
executive architectural firms employed quantity surveyors for their project
institutions. The only structural design work not completed by the consultants
was the work required for foundations and other below-ground elements of both
"standard" and "non-standard" buildings.     Nevertheless,  only one executive
architectural firm (employed by Rivers State) did this modest amount of
remaining structural design work itself. The other States and their executive
architects employed structural engineering firms to do the work; three such
firms were employed on the project institutions in the other three States.
Thus, a total of 19 professional firms--architects, quantity surveyors and
structural engineers--provided the executive services for the 29 project
institutions.   Thus, the strategy adopted for obtaining the required profes-
sional services was not the most economical possible.        The performance of
these executive services was of varying quality in regard to layout of the
buildings on site and site supervision.



-7-
20.       The  consultant   architects  assisted  the Central   Project  Director
and State Project Managers to supervise and coordinate project implementation.
This involved assisting them to brief executive architects, to review sketch
plans, working drawings and construction documents produced by the executive
architects, to prepare schedules of equipment and furniture and advise on
their procurement installation, to review and adjust tender and contract
documents, and to prepare quarterly progress reports. In practice, the
consultant architects performed a larger role in project management than was
originally intended, and provided some training in project management (PCR,
para. 4.03).
(d) Physical Implementation
21.       Architectural Designs.    The designs developed for the schools were
functional and flexible, and the working drawings and bills of quantities were
comprehensive and systematic.     The design details were subsequently revised
to take account of State Government revisions of the total" student places
requested at some institutions.     This revision was not done in every case of
change.   When the "matched" school concept was not fully implemented, the
accommodation schedules at the "matched" schools were not all readjusted;
consequently, some of those project schools which no longer shared facilities
did not acquire a full range of teaching facilities (PCR, para. 5.02).      Thus,
while in some cases the provision of teaching facilities was satisfactory, in
other cases problems arose with regard to providing a sufficient number of
laboratories and workshops to implement fully the kind of practical curricula
originally envisaged (see also PCR, Annex 2).
22.       Construction.     Construction of all institutions was carried out
under contracts awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. At all but
two of the 29 institutions, separate contracts were awarded for electrical
installations; at 18 of these, independent contracts were awarded for internal
and external electrical work; and, at 17 of the institutions, separate con-
tracts were also entered into for the plumbing water supply and drainage
installations--91 contracts in all for the construction program.        Since the
contracts awarded for electrical and plumbing work were not sub-contracts
given out by the general contractors for work at the institutions concerned,
the general contractors had no authority over the firms so contracted, and
could not coordinate building activities on their sites. Construction con-
tracts were awarded between February and October 1976, in Imo, Anambra and
Rivers States--three years behind the appraisal schedule--and between July
1977 and June 1978 in Cross River State--between four and five years behind
appraisal schedule.
23.       Borrower Funding of Construction.     Construction at project schools
in Cross River State took about three years to complete--double the 18 months
estimated at appraisal--and about four years in the other States.       The prin-
cipal reasons for the slowness of construction were (i) persistent shortages
of funds at the State level, (ii) repeated failure of the States to make



- 8 -
timely budget allocations to cover anticipated project expenditures, resulting
in the postponement of the awarding of contracts, and (iii) occasional suspen-
sion of work by contractors until their claims for payment had been met.
24.       At the Bank's request, the Borrower made substantial transfers of
funds to the States in 1977 to overcome this problem.      But, except in Cross
River State, these funds were not earmarked or placed in separate accounts;
they were placed in the States Capital Receipt Accounts and used for other
purposes.   In the view of the Borrower, as well as OED, had separate project
accounts been established at the State level as in Cross River State, these
delays in reimbursement would have been avoided and project implementation
might have been improved (see also PCR, para. 7.01).        In the view of the
Borrower, this deficiency in financial management was mainly responsible for
the serious   implementation problems encountered.     Covenants requiring the
establishment of separate project accounts have been included in Loan Agree-
ments relating to other sectors in Nigeria which were signed during the
implementation period of Loan 814-UNI.
(e) Furniture and Equipment
25.       Equipment and furniture lists for all institutions were prepared
by equipment specialists employed by the consultant architects.     Bank review
of the equipment lists before the Borrower assumed responsibility for equip-
ment procurement was advantageous, since it led to an appropriate adjustment
in some lists to make them more suitable for the intended prevocational
courses rather than for courses in more advanced skills.         The equipment
procured was less than planned and the procurement is as yet incomplete.    This
shortage was exacerbated by distribution problems. At the time of the comple-
tion visit, school principals were not aware of exactly what equipment their
schools were to receive, and, therefore, what they could still expect to
receive--a problem which has been widely observed in other audited education
projects (see also PCR, para. 5.10).
26.       In 1975,   in response to evidence of rapidly rising construction
costs, the Borrower requested that project furniture and equipment be procured
by the Borrower without reimbursement by the Bank and that the funds so
released be reallocated to civil works.     One year later, the Bank agreed to
the Borrower's request.
27.       Furniture procurement--also as yet incomplete--was initially de-
layed.  Once the orders were placed--generally only to local manufacturers--
supply was rapid (see also PCR, para. 5.11).
(f) Project Costs
28.       At appraisal, the project was estimated to cost the equivalent of
Naira 18.28 million or about US$27.8 million.        As implemented,  the total
project cost was Naira 48 million, or about US$78 million; about 163% more
and in local currency terms, and 180% more in terms of US dollars.         This
actual cost figure includes the cost of furniture and equipment which was
borne entirely by the Borrower.



- 9 -
29.       This extraordinary increase in costs was due principally to (a)
exceptional world-wide inflation of the 1970s, (b) escalating construction
costs in the country, resulting from the post-war reconstruction and construc-
tion boom (financed in part by the high income from oil), and (c) the delays
which exacerbated the impact of continuing price inflation (PCR, para.
7.02).!/   The largest individual cost increase was that of 212%--in con-
struction. In May 1977, the Bank staff had estimated that the cost of project
schools was two to three times greater than the cost of similar institutions
elsewhere in Africa.    The next largest increase was for professional fees,
mainly because the architectural consultants were employed for a considerably
longer period than originally planned (PCR, paras.      5.04-5.07).    The Loan
Agreement provided for 12 man-years of services of a consultant architectural
firm over roughly a four-year period.       With successive delays in project
execution, the consultants were involved over a seven-year period and costs
exceeded appraisal estimates by about 153%.
(g) Bank Supervision and Completion Reporting
30.       While there was consistent follow-up of implementation by the Bank,
both from Washington and its Lagos office through missions, cables, letters
and telephone calls, and good continuity in mission personnel, the audit draws
attention to the following problems of organization and effectiveness of
field supervision.
31.       Given the geographical dispersion of the three Nigeria Education
Projects, more time was needed for adequate field coverage of the items
than was typically allowed to supervision missions.       Few site visits were
possible and missions concentrated their efforts, as with the First Project,
on necessarily brief discussions in the State and Federal capitals. In
addition, effective supervision was hampered between 1975 and 1977--when there
were only three supervision missions--by the Borrower's refusal to accept
supervision visits. In December 1976, the Bank's Regional Vice President for
Western Africa wrote to the Commissioner in the Federal Ministry of Finance
deploring this refusal, and the situation improved after December 1977.
32.       Supervision missions visited Nigeria on the average, every four
months between 1977 and 1980; site visits were, however, still minimal and
this project continued to receive insufficient field time.     Not all of these
missions visited the States benefitting from the project.
33.       Partly in consequence of these difficulties, supervision was less
effective than is usual in education projects.     During the first five years
1/   The costs of school construction increased by over 400% during 1973-79.
By 1975, the price of concrete and other building materials had risen
to such an extent that the States requested that funds for equipment and
furniture under the project be reallocated to civil works (PPAM, para.
26).



- 10 -
there was insufficient initial briefing of, and assistance to, project manage-
ment. Despite a Loan Agreement covenant which obligated the Borrower to make
arrangements satisfactory for the Bank to provide funds for project imple-
mentation, the problem of funding project implementation persisted (PPAM,
paras. 23 and 24). The Bank did not raise with the Borrower the questions of
contract packaging and awards--for professional services and construction--
which had implications for the time and cost of implementation (PPAM, paras.
17-19 and 22).   The monitoring of (a) the layout of buildings on the sites,
(b) education policies in the States, especially on the limited application of
the "matched" school concept and its consequences for the project, and (c) the
fellowship program was also not effectively performed (PPAM, paras. 19, 21
and 40; see also PCR, paras. 8.01 and 8.02).
34.       Mission composition reflected some weaknesses shared by most of the
education projects audited to date.    Architects were members of 14 out of 15
supervision missions, but educators participated in only five.      The project
completion mission did not include education specialists.
III. EDUCATIONAL IMPACT
35.       As the PCR notes (para. 6.01), the provision of secondary school
places exceeded the targets.     The provision of more science facilities and
the diversification of the curriculum to include workshop courses for the
comprehensive schools were only partially achieved.        Most of the science
facilities are operating and suitable courses are offered.
36.       The PCR notes that the number of places provided in the primary
teacher training colleges and the enrollments have both exceeded appraisal
estimates (PCR, para. 6.04). The PCR also mentions that in two men's colleges
in Imo State, however, enrollments are below capacity, because of a Borrower
decision to change certification requirements by increasing the length of
courses by an additional year. More than one-third of the completed technical
classrooms in secondary schools and some of the technical classrooms at the
primary teacher training colleges provided are being used for activities not
originally planned (PCR, paras. 6.05 and 6.07).
37.       The goals of the secondary school program in the project were: (a)
to provide for more students by rehabilitating war-damaged facilities and
constructing new ones; (b) to diversify the curriculum by adding science
facilities and workshops and by training teachers for workshop courses; and
(c) to consolidate small schools into economically more viable institutions.
In the original project design, nearly half of the secondary school places,
and almost 75% of the primary teacher training places to be financed by the
Loan were additional to pre-war enrollment capacities.
38.       It is too early to assess the full qualitative impact of the project
on secondary education and teacher training in the States.        The PCR, in a
preliminary assessment (paras. 6.06 and 6.07), notes that the pass rate for



- 11 -
project secondary schools and primary teacher training colleges is about 70%,
well above the national average pass rates of 60% and 40% respectively. The
PCR also notes that the contribution of workshop courses to the output of
skilled workers cannot be assessed, not only because the workshops are not
operational, but also because a tracer system does not exist (para. 6.07).
The impact of the schools in this sense would best be assessed about five
years from now.
39.       With Bank agreement, the Borrower undertook the full task of cur-
riculum development and did not use the funds provided by the Loan.          The
PCR indicates that well-designed and well-developed curricula have been
produced by Nigeria's National Educational Research Council, and have been
adapted by the States to suit their specific needs (para. 5.14).       This was
part of an extensive national effort which fully supported the idea of diver-
sification of the secondary level curricula which was generally in keeping
with the objectives of the Second Project. However, the shortage of equipment
has adversely affected the amount of effective practical training in the
project schools, the reinforcing of science teaching, and the full practical
reform of secondary school curricula.
40.       The PCR notes the successful outcome of the technical assistance
expert services provided for training technical teachers (PCR, para. 5.12),
the success of the fellowship program in Rivers State, and the comparative
failure of this program in Imo and Anambra States, where only one of five
fellows sent abroad for training had returned to Nigeria by June 1980; he was
working as a technical educator (PCR, para. 5.13).
IV. CONCLUSIONS
41.       The most   impressive outcome   of the Second Education Project in
Nigeria was the expansion of facilities for primary teacher and secondary
education and the partial broadening of the curriculum of secondary schools.
Given the state of the Borrower-s economy and administration in the post-Civil
War era, this was a major achievement.     Nevertheless, it must be recognized
that the time and cost overruns were amongst the highest experienced in the
sector, and that they reflect the extraordinary circumstances of implementa-
tion. The Completion Report draws sensible lessons from the experience of
this project (paras. 1.04-1.08).
42.       The unorthodox generation of the project, in particular     its inade-
quate identification, preparation and appraisal, and the unrealistically low
estimate of how long implementation would take, resulted in implementation
delays (PPAM, paras. 7-10).
43.       Project management was inadequately staffed, both at the Federal and
State levels, and this resulted in implementation delays; much of the imple-
mentation management was actually left to the consultant architects (PPAM,



- 12 -
paras. 13, 14 and 20).     Persistent and continuing shortages of State funds
also contributed to the slowness of progress in construction (PPAM, paras. 23
and 24).
44.       The engagement of a large number of executive architects reduced the
scope for economies arising from replication of designs (PPAM, para. 18). The
number of quantity surveyors and structural engineers contracted appears to
have been high in the light of the limited quantity of work to be performed in
these specializations (PPAM, para. 19). Construction contracts for individual
sites, instead of being awarded to one general contractor (who would then
subcontract parts of the work as needed and coordinate the whole), were
divided into several separate direct contracts, making coordination on the
site difficult (PPAM, para. 22).     This strategy of contract awards does not
appear to have been the most economical and efficient arrangement.
45.       Educators were   insufficiently  involved  in appraisal,   supervision
and completion reporting in regard to this project (PPAM, paras. 6 and 34).
The problems posed by the Borrower s temporary refusal to admit supervision
missions were exacerbated by the Bank's failure to devote sufficient time and
manpower in the field to supervising this project. Supervision did not
successfully address the problems of (i) monitoring the evaluation of educa-
tion policies, in particular as they affected the concept of sharing school
facilities; (ii) the review of designs and tender and contract documents for
professional services as well as construction, and (iii) the fellowship
program (PPAM, paras. 31-33).   The issue of government funding of implementa-
tion was also not fully resolved until late in the implementation period,
despite the efforts of Bank staff (PPAM, paras. 23 and 24).
46.         In quantitative terms, both for primary teacher training and
secondary education, the provision of facilities and actual enrollments have
significantly exceeded appraisal estimates (PPAM, paras. 35 and 36; PCR,
paras. 6.01-6.05).   With examination pass rates well above national levels,
the project secondary schools and primary teacher training colleges have
achieved good results (PPAM, para. 43) but the lack of equipment (PPAM, para.
26) has militated against the full achievement of broadening science and
pre-vocational education at the secondary level.

Dear Mr. Kapur,
RE: PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT ON NIGERIA
SECOND IBRD EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 814 - UNI)
I must thank you immensely for your letter forwarding a
copy of the Draft Completion Report on the Second IBRD Education
Project. I have gone through the Report and found it, in the
main, analytic an(d objective, identifying probable causative
factors responsible for the delay and other concommitant problems
in the management and implementation of the Second Education
Project.
I have noted the lessons drawn from the implementation of
this Project. I must confess elements of the problems
identified are also manifest in the execution of the Third
Education Project (Loan 929-UNI). We are already making efforts
to correct some of the mistakes made at the planning phase of
the Project Cycle of both Second and Third Education Projects.
One of these we consider to be the most vulnerable factor
responsible for the sad end in the implementation of the
Second Project.
This factor of omission is considered very relevant to
sound financial management of the Second Project. Had both
parties (The World Bank and the Nigerian Government) ensured
the opening and operation of a designated Bank Account at the
negotiation stage, the Second, and indeed the Third Project
would have:-
(a) been completed as originally scheduled;
(b) cost less in human and material resources; and
(c) achieved, with certainty, the objective for which
the Project was designed.
...... 12

As you are aware, sufficient funds as operational grants-
in-aid were made available to the participating States by
the Federal Government for the specific purpose of executing
the Second 2roject. Unfortunately, this grant went into
the State's Capital Receipt's Account rather than a designated
Bank Account for the Project. It is our considered view
that non-compliance with this pre-recuisite in project
financial management is mainly responsible for the serious
problems identified in the execution of the Second Project.
I do hope that this lesson will be emphasized in the
final copy of the Completion Report in the interest of
future IBRD Projects which the World Bank in collaboration
with the Nigerian Government, would wish to operate. I am
earnestly looking forward to redding the fair copy of the
Second IBRD Education Project Completion Report.

I. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
Summary
1.01      While the loan for the Second Education Project (Ln. 814-UNI) has
been fully disbursed, the project is not yet completed; some civil works and
equipment procurement remain which the Government will finance entirely with
its own resources. The goals of the Second Education Project were to (a)
reconstruct secondary schools damaged by the civil war, (b) introduce
workshop subjects into their curricula and strengthen science teaching, and
(c) consolidate or "match" small inefficient schools into larger units
(para. 3.01). The first of these goals was not only accomplished but
exceeded. More facilities were constructed and more student places provided
than were anticipated at appraisal (paras. 6.01, 6.02 and 6.04). The second
and third goals were more difficult to accomplish. Many of the project
schools do not offer workshop courses because the equipment is not yet
available (paras. 5.09-5.10, 6.03 and 6.05). To expedite the delivery and
use of the equipment, the school principals should be given equipment lists
to verify its delivery, and the suppliers' contracts should stipulate that
they are responsible for installing special equipment and for training
personnel in its use (para. 5.10). The project provided for the training of
technical teachers for the workshop courses, but half of the fellowship
recipients have not returned to their States to teach (para. 5.13). While,
in theory, "matching" small schools to produce larger, more efficient
schools was a good idea, in practice it proved unworkable in many schools
(para. 5.02). The decision to "match" schools may not have been made if a
more thorough appraisal had been done which included visits to the sites of
the project schools and consultations with State authorities (paras. 5.02
and 8.01).
1.02      The project has already taken five years longer to implement than
was originally anticipated. In part, this was due to the unrealistic
assumption at appraisal that it could be implemented in three years.
Factors external to the project contributed to the delays, such as political
reorganizations (para. 2.01), communication difficulties between the Federal
Government and the four States (para. 4.02), and an economic boom which
created a scarcity of the goods and manpower needed for construction (paras.
2.01 and 5.03). At the Federal level, the Project Office had inadequate
resources with which to manage the project (para. 4.02); hence there was
heavy reliance on the consulting architects. While the Project Office
successfully assumed responsibilities from the consulting architects when
their contract expired, the reliance on the consulting architects might have
been reduced if there had been a provision in their contract to give conti-
nuous managerial training to key Project Office staff (para. 4.03). At the
State level, project management was difficult because a large number of
contracts had to be supervised. This number could have been reduced if
contracts for external and internal works had been consolidated (para.
4.06). However, the major cause of delay was the lack of commitment to the
project by the States. There were often insufficient funds to pay contrac-
tors even after the Federal Government had made a lump sum grant to the
States and, as a result, some contractors abandoned the sites. The diver-
sion of funds from the project might have been avoided if a special fund had
been created for the project.    (paras. 4.02, 5.03 and 7.01).   Further,



- li -
three of the four States did not allocate sufficient staff resources to
project management (para. 4.04). The fourth State hired a full-time Project
Director at a salary several levels higher than the salaries of the Project
Directors in the other States and gave him adequate staff, with the result
that project management was greatly facilitated (para. 4.05). For example,
he set up an Implementation Committee of State Ministers who expedited
project management. He was also able to involve the principals of the
project schools and they provided valuable on-the-spot surveillance of
progress on their schools.
1.03      It is difficult to evaluate the educational impact of this project
because it made no provision to build the institutions necessary to collect
this information. The quality of the project schools as compared with other
schools in Nigeria is difficult to assess, as there are no facilities to
collect dropout, repeater and examination pass rates. The degree to which
the workshop courses provided pre-vocational training cannot be determined,
not only because many of the workshops are not yet operational but also
because there are no provisions to trace the employment patterns of the
graduates (paras. 6.06, 6.07).
Lessons Learned
1.04      Lessons Learned for Project Managenient
(a)  The formation of implementation committees composed of senior
officials from Ministries should be explored as they may facili-
tate decision making.
(b)  The school principals of existing project schools should be
kept informed on the plans for their schools so they can provide
on-the-spot surveillance of progress.
(c)  Wherever possible, a single contractor should be responsible for
all external and internal works.
1.05      Lessons Learned for Equipment Procurement and Technical Teacher
Training
(a)  The school p-incipals should be given equipment and furniture
lists to verify their delivery.
(b)  Whenever appropriate, suppliers should be responsible for the
installation of equipment and for the training of personnel in
its use and maintenance.
(c)  Students should be closely monitored when they are trained out-
side the country; perhaps when they receive their fellowships they
should sign a contract requiring them to return to Nigeria and
teach for a specified number of years.



- 18 -
1.06      Lessons Learned for Project Financing
(a) Federal grants to the States should be disbursed after verifica-
tion has been received that the States have actually spent their
funds for the project, as was stated in the Loan Agreement (Article
III Section 3.01(d)).
(b) In future projects, a separate revolving fund should be considered
for financing project expenditures. This matter has already
been discussed with the Government which accepts the proposal in
principle and is willing to establish a single fund to finance
Bank-assisted projects in all sectors.
1.07      Lesson Learned for Project Evaluation
Nigerian institutions to collect and evaluate educational statis-
tics are needed to determine the impact of educational investments.
1.08      Follow-up.   During the supervision of the ongoing Third Education
Project (Ln. 929-UNI), the Bank should continue to monitor the work remaining
to complete the Second Education Project.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Country Setting
2.01   Three factors shaped the environment in which the Second Education
Project was designed and implemented. First, the project was appraised in
1972 when eastern Nigeria was recovering from the devastating effects of the
civil war (1967-70), during which many public buildings, including a large
number of schools, were damaged and in some cases became unusable. Second,
petroleum production in Nigeria began to expand dramatically in 1970, greatly
increasing public revenues. The war-s physical devastation, coupled with the
growth in revenues, resulted in a construction boom that created a heavy
demand for construction materials and skilled labor. Third, the administra-
tive structure of eastern Nigeria underwent changes that complicated project
administration. In 1967 the Eastern Region was divided into three States --
East-Central, River and South-Eastern State. In 1976, East-Central State was
divided into Anambra and Imo States and South-Eastern State was renamed Cross
River State. Creation of Imo State necessitated the construction of a new
capital and this severely over-extended that State's financial resources.
Moreover, a new Project Unit had to be created in Imo State in the middle of
project implementation.
Project Identification
2.02      This project grew out of a reappraisal of the components of the
First Education Project (Cr. 72-UNI) which were originally identified in
eastern Nigeria and the need for reconstruction of schools in that region
following the civil war. The objectives of the first project, which was
completed in 1977, were to emphasize science and workshop subjects in



- 19 -
secondary schools and teachers colleges. Additional rooms were to be built
at secondary schools and teachers colleges in all the Regions to house
science laboratories and workshops. But when the civil war began in July
1967, the Federal Military Government brought the project to a halt in the
Eastern Region by suspending its authority to make withdrawals from the
IDA credit. When the war ended in January 1970, the Government lifted the
suspension and requested that the Bank Group reactivate the credit and
consider giving additional assistance for school reconstruction. In the
autumn of 1970, a Bank mission to reappraise the First Education Project in
the eastern States and to study reconstruction needs in that area found that
most of the schools that were identified in the original appraisal had been
severely damaged. These findings, coupled with those of the UNESCO sector
mission which visited Nigeria in February/March 1971, led to the reidenti-
fication of the first project and to the identification of a second project
in the eastern States which would reconstruct damaged secondary schools
and primary teachers colleges and strengthen science and vocational training
in these schools. The Second Education Project was hastily appraised in
March 1971 because there was pressure from the Nigerian Government to begin
rehabilitating Eastern Nigeria. The total estimated project cost was US$27.8
million and the amount of the Bank loan was US$17.3 million. The Loan
Agreement was signed on April 18, 1972 and became effective on November 28,
1972.
III. PROJECT DESCRIPTI N
Project Objectives and Description
3.01      The project had three main objective':    to reconstruct and reha-
bilitate the war-damaged secondary and primary teacher training schools, to
expand the facilities and curricula of these schools to include more science
courses and vocational training, and to combine or "match" small secondary
schools so that they could share facilities (para. 5.02). At appraisal, the
project was estimated to cost US$27.8 million and consisted of:
(a) Reconstruction, expansion, furnishing and equipping of the following
institutions:
(i) East-Central State (in 1976 divided into Anambra and Imo
States). Ten secondary schools to provide a total
of approximately 11,230 student places, and seven primary
teachers colleges to provide a total of approximately 4,200
student places. Estimated cost: US$16.1 million.
(ii) Rivers State. Five secondary schools to provide a total of
approximately 3,700 student places. Estimated cost: US$4.2
million.
(iii)  South-Eastern State (in 1976 renamed Cross River State).
Eight secondary schools to provide a total of approximately
4,960 student places. Estimated cost: US$6.4 million.



- 20 -
(b) Fellowships for the training of technical teachers, and technical
assistance to (i) train technical teachers, (ii) develop a curri-
culum for the secondary schools to include workshop subjects, and
(iii) provide support to the Project Unit. Estimated cost: US$1.1
million.
Changes in the Project
3.02      Three changes in the project were made during the course of imple-
mentation. First, soon after the signing of the Bank loan the Government
assumed full responsibility for construction of the only totally new secondary
school. Second, as costs began to rise the Government were faced with a
choice of either reducing the scope of civil works financed by the Bank loan,
or financing a component of the project themselves. In 1976 they proposed to
the Bank that they assume responsibility for the purchase of all furniture
and equipment, amounting to US$4.6 million, so that these funds could be
reallocated to Civil Works, and this was approved by the Bank. Third, the
Borrower assumed responsibility for the development of curricula for the
teaching of science, mathematics and practical subjects in the new secondary
comprehensive schools without resorting to the technical assistance provision
in the loan.
IV.  PROJECT ADMINISTRATION
4.01      In the First Education Project (Cr. 72-UNI) the Ministries of
Works in the States and in the Federal Territory of Lagos were given the
responsibility for implementing the project components in their geographical
areas, but project management was poor because responsibility for the project
was diffused within these Ministries. The result was that much of the project
implementation was done by the architectural consultants. To avoid this
problem in the Second Education Project, project management was centralized
by creating a Project Office within the Federal Ministry of Education, and
Project Units in the Ministries of Education of the participating States, The
same architectural consultants provided architectural and managerial expertise
for the second project.
Federal Project Office
4.02      The Federal Project Office was responsible for (a) supervising the
Project Managers in the States; (b) preparing progress reports for the Bank;
(c) keeping financial and other records on the execution of the project;
and (d) handling all matters involving other Federal Ministries, including
the Ministry of Finance. A number of factors hampered the Project Office in
carrying out these responsibilities. First, it was difficult to supervise
the State Project Managers because communications were so poor: telephones
frequently did not operate, mail was slow and travel funds were scarce.
Second, inadequate resources were allocated to project management and there-
fore staffing problems plagued the Project Office. The Loan Agreement stipu-
lated that there should be a Federal Project Office staffed with a full-time
Project Director, a full-time accountant and adequate support staff; however,



- 21 -
the Project Director was unable to devote his full attention to the project
because he was also responsible for implementation of the First Education
Project until 1977 and also the Third Education Project (Ln. 929-UNI) after
1973. The accountant, who was not hired until the summer of 1979, was
subsequently transferred to other tasks, and access to support staff was
inadequate because the Project Office had to share them with other Federal
offices. Third, the Loan Agreement stipulated that the Project Director
should be responsible to the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of
Education, but his actual position is three levels below the Permanent
Secretary. To gain access to the Permanent Secretary's office, the Project
Director must go through the Secretary of the Bureau of External Aid for
Education, the Assistant Director of Education for Student Affairs and
Foreign Aid, and the Director of Education. The bureaucratic distance of
the Project Director from the Permanent Secretary left the Project Director
with insufficient authority and access to the decision-making levels of
Government. Finally, there has been a high turnover of Project Directors--
four over the life of the project.
4.03      These handicaps under which the Project Office operated made it
difficult to supervise the State Project Units, prepare progress reports,
maintain its own records and handle its coordination responsibilities with
other Federal ministries. In fact, most of these responsibilities were
assumed by the consulting architects (paras. 5.04 - 5.07) until the expira-
tion of their contract in April 1979. The Federal Project Office might have
been more actively involved in project management if the consultants had
been contracted to provi.de ongoing managerial training to the staff.
However, the consultants did spend several weeks prior to their departure
giving intensive training to the Project Office staff. After their depar-
ture, a fulltime accountant was hired and an architect was provided from the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation. The Project Office has now
successfully assumed responsibility for issuing progress reports, handling
financial matters and coordinating with other Federal ministries.
State Project Units
4.04      The Project Units were responsible for site supervision, prepara-
tion of reports, and procurement of civil works, furniture and equipment.
As they were under the State Ministries of Education, they did not have
access to the architectural services of the State Ministries of Public Works
and therefore they used the consulting architects to help them select
executive architects and supervise the project sites. The Project Units
experienced managerial problems similar to those of the Federal Project
Office: they were inadequately staffed and the State Project Managers did
not have sufficient authority to carry out their responsibilities. The Loan
Agreement stipulated that full-time Project Managers and adequate support
staff should be appointed for the Project Units, but in three of the four
States the Project Managers could not devote full time to project implemen-
tation as this responsibility was simply added to their regular duties. In
Imo State, for example, the Project Manager said that he was able to devote
only 20% of his time to the project. As was the case with the Federal
Project Office, adequate support staff were not made available and the
Project Managers had to compete for support services with other offices



- 22 -
within the State Ministries of Education. The Loan Agreement also stipu-
lated that each Project Manager should be given the powers necessary to
effectively implement the project. In Rivers, Anambra and Imo States, this
was not done and the status of the Project Managers was not high enough to
enable them to expedite the decision-making process. The Government policy
of rotating personnel frequently resulted in discontinuous management of the
Project Units. Anambra and Imo States have each had four Project Managers,
including two when they were combined in East-Central State.
4.05      The situation was better in Cross River State, where a full-time
Project Manager was appointed and given authority commensurate with his
responsibilities. He was also two or three levels higher in the bureaucracy
than  the other Project Managers, and was able to set up an Implementation
Committee which included the Governor of the State and the Ministers of
Finance and Education. This Committee met at least once a month to resolve
problems and make decisions to expedite project implementation. One of its
decisions was to open a special account for the project, and this avoided the
delays caused by inadequate State funds which were experienced in the other
States (para. 7.01). The Project Manager was also able to enlist the support
of the principals of the project schools, who provided valuable on-the-spot
project supervision.
4.06      The consulting architects gave substantial managerial assistance
to the Project Units, as there were an unusually large number of contracts
to supervise, both because there were many executive architects and because
separate contracts were awarded for water and electrical services. Ten
executive architects were hired in addition to six quantity surveying and
three structural engineering firms. Separate contracts were awarded for
water supply and electrical works in all but two of the 29 project schools,
making a total of 91 contracts for the State Project Units to supervise.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Civil Works
5.01      Goals and accomplishments.   The physical goals of the project were
to reconstruct and expand war-damaged schools. At appraisal it was decided
that 1,095 educational facilities, which included classrooms, workshops and
communal buildings, would be provided. The completion mission found that
this goal was exceeded, as 1,117 of physical facilities were provided (see
Annex 2). Most of these facilities (68%) are being used for their intended
purposes.  However, 13% are not being used as originally planned, largely
because some of the workshop furniture and equipment has not been delivered
and over one-third of the workshops are being used as regular classrooms
(paras. 5.09-5.10). Despite the fact that eight of the 29 project schools
are completely finished, only 19% of the physical facilities are not yet in
use. In general, the physical facilities are serviceable, but many have
rough finishes and some are not well placed on the sites. In one case poor
construction led to the collapse of a roof, which is being repaired. It is
anticipated that all the project schools will be operational by the end of
1980 (see Annex 2).



- 23 -
5.02      At appraisal, it was proposed that small secondary schools located
near each other be placed under one administration or "matched" so that they
could share workshops and communal facilities (para. 3.01). This idea was
successfully implemented in some schools but met with resistance in others.
In some cases, the schools were not "matched" because each school's enroll-
ments increased so much that it became administratively difficult to merge
them. In other cases there was no possibility that the schools designated
at appraisal to be matched could be jointly administered, either because the
principals were unwilling to merge their facilities or because, in the case
of Imo State, a policy decision had been made not to match boys and girls
schools.
Delays in Construction
5.03      Although more facilities were produced than anticipated at apprai-
sal, it has taken over eight years to implement what was expected to be a
three-year project. There are several reasons for the delays. First, the
establishment of the State Project Units was difficult in the post civil war
environment in which staff and office space were in short supply. Second,
the inadequate allocation of State resources for the project was a major
cause of delay during project implementation (paras. 4.02 and 7.01). Fre-
quently the contractors were not paid and some of them abandoned their sites
until they were paid, which in some cases was up to six months. Third,
delays occurred because the working drawings for electrical works and water
supply were late and this held up the bidding process for these contracts.
In six schools, all new construction and rehabilitation have been completed,
but the external water or electrical works are still not completed (see
Annex 2). Further, the enthusiasm of the executive architects who super-
vised these contracts waned because the post civil war economic boom pro-
vided them with more attractive opportunities. Fourth, obtaining Government
approval of contracts was a time-consuming process because the State Military
Executive Councils, which were the highest State authority at that time, had
to give their approval. Finally, the postwar boom generated a heavy demand
for skilled workers; realizing that they were in demand and that wages were
increasing, they had frequent strikes which delayed construction and in-
creased costs.
Consulting Architects
5.04      The consulting architects who were used for the First Education
Project (para. 4.01) were also retained for the Second Education Project and
they worked on both projects simultaneously. The agreement for continuation
of their services was signed on March 23, 1972, almost a month before the
signing of the Loan Agreement, and they provided good managerial and archi-
tectural support to both the Federal Project Office and the State Project
Units until the expiration of their contract in April 1979.
5.05      Services to the Federal Project Office.    The consulting architects
provided managerial support to the Project Office by (a) helping to super-
vise bidding contract procedures and awards, (b) preparing documents for the
Bank, and (c) assisting the Project Director with the preparation of progress
reports. They provided good managerial expertise and the necessary continuity
for the project.

5.06      The consultants   architectural services to the Federal Project
Office included (a) surveying all sites to assess existing facilities
to determine which could be rehabilitated and which should be replaced, (b)
establishing cost limits for construction and rehabilitation, and (c)
preparing a design and procedures guide for all "standard" buildings which
were required in every school (i.e. classrooms, science laboratories,
workshops and home economics blocks). Their designs for the "standard"
buildings were functional, flexible and well suited to Nigeria-s needs.
5.07      Services to the State Project Units.   The consultants contracted
to give technical support to the State Project Units by (a) helping the
Project Managers with the pre-qualification, bidding and contract award
process, (b) advising on the selection of executive architects and preparing
technical terms of reference, and (c) providing advice to the executive
architects when requested by the Project Managers. They did provide these
services, but it was difficult to provide ongoing technical support because
the Project Managers and the executive architects were located in the east
and the consultants were based in Lagos.
Furniture and Equipment
5.08      At appraisal, furniture and equipment for the project schools were
to be financed by the Bank loan, and the consulting architects prepared the
lists for the States in April 1975. As project costs began to escalate, the
States sought ways to preserve the scope of the project and proposed that
they assume responsibility for financing furniture and equipment (para
3.02). This request was granted in April 1976, but because each State was
responsible for procuring its own equipment, the rate at which furniture and
equipment have been acquired has varied from State to State.
5.09      Equipment.  The acquisition of equipment is important to project
implementation because without it the workshop courses cannot be offered.
The most critical factor has been the inadequacy of State funding, since
without funds in the budget, acquisition procedures cannot begin (para.
7.01). In Anambra and Cross River States where funding has been available
for equipment, all contracts have been awarded, the equipment is being
delivered, and school principals are supervising the deliveries. In Imo and
Rivers States, the State budgetary estimates for 1980/81 had not been
released as of June 1980. Imo is waiting for its budgetary estimates before
selecting a firm, but Rivers has gone ahead and selected a Canadian firm.
Imo and Rivers States estimate that their equipment can be delivered within
six months after the funds become available.
5.10      Several problems have arisen with regard to the ordering, delivery
and use of equipment for the project schools and some solutions have been
found. Anambra State experienced delays in delivery because of import
restrictions, while Cross River State found that if State Government im-
porters were used they could obtain exemption certificates when equipment
was not available domestically. Both Anambra and Cross River found that
using school principals to verify equipment deliveries was very helpful.



- 25 -
However, even in schools where equipment has been delivered, this equipment
sometimes is not used because it is not properly installed or maintained.
This could be resolved if the contract for the supply of special equipment
made the supplier responsible for installation and for training local staff in
its use and maintenance.
5.11      Furniture.   Furnishing the project schools was less complicated
than equipping them because furniture is produced locally. Cross River and
Anambra States used their School Boards and Schools Service Commissions to
order all furniture, and most of the furniture has been delivered in these
two States. Imo State has ordered its furniture and some has already been
delivered, and Rivers State is purchasing its furniture from local companies
as the school facilities are completed. The Federal Project Office is
encouraging all States to use their school furniture purchasing unit because
they are familiar with the procedures for purchasing furniture.
Teacher Training
5.12      The Bank loan provided for the training of technical teachers for
workshop courses in the project schools. There were two approaches to this
training requirement: Cross River State added technical teacher educators
to the faculty of the College of Technology in Calabar, while the other
three States provided fellowships. The Cross River approach proved to be
quite successful. The two technical educators, who were provided by grants
from the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation, were able to train
technical teachers to conduct courses in woodwork, metalwork, electricity
and general mechanics during their respective two and two-and-a-half years
stay.
5.13      The other three States have found it difficult to ensure that
their fellowship recipients will return to Nigeria and will be appropriately
placed. Of the ten recipients from Rivers State sent to England for nine
months of training in 1974, seven have returned and six are technical
educators in the State. In 1973 when Imo and Anambra States were the
East-Central State, five fellowship recipients were sent to the United
States but only one has returned to Nigeria and is working as a technical
educator. State officials and principals in all four States have expressed
their confidence that the Technical Teachers Colleges and the College of
Technology will be able to supply a sufficient number of technical teachers
to meet the needs of the project schools when they become fully equipped.
Curriculum Development
5.14      To help each State develop and adapt curricula, the project pro-
vided three man-years of specialist services, one year in each of three
subject areas -- science and mathematics, social studies, and workshop. In
1976 the Federal Government, with the consent of the Bank, assumed full
responsibility for the development of its own curriculum in these three



- 26 -
subject areas. Nigeria has a well-developed capacity for curriculum develop-
ment. The National Educational Research Council regularly produces curricu-
lum guidelines in all subject areas for secondary schools and primary teachers'
colleges, which are intended to be adapted by the States to their particular
educational needs. The Council's curriculum development efforts are supple-
mented by the summer seminars for science teachers given by the Comparative
Education Study and Adaptation Center, located at the University of Lagos.
VI. PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
Secondary Comprehensive Schools
6.01      For the secondary schools in the project, there were three basic
goals: (a) to provide for more students by rehabilitating war-damaged
facilities and constructing new ones; (b) to diversify the curriculum by
adding science facilities and workshops and by training teachers for work-
shop courses; and (c) to consolidate small schools into economically viable
units (para. 5.02). The goal to provide secondary education for more students
has been exceeded. At appraisal, it was anticipated that 880 facilities to
provide for 19,890 student places would be created by the project and the
completion mission found 896 facilities for 21,570 student places (see Annexes
1 and 2). The demand for these facilities has been great and at present the
student enrollment of 29,121 exceeds the 21,570 student places which have been
made available. While this confirms a demand for more secondary schools, it
has resulted in some crowding and the use of double shifts which may adversely
affect learning. However, there appear to be enough teachers for this level
of enrollment, as the average present teacher/student ratio is 1:31.
6.02      There are three reasons for this increase in facilities and the
subsequent increase in student places. First, the facilities in some schools
were not "matched" (para 5.02), each one was provided with facilities that
were to have been shared by the combined school. Second, most of the sites
were not visited-at appraisal and in some cases a number of existing physical
facilities were under-estimated. Third, some rehabilitation and temporary
construction work has been done by the parents and States independently of the
project.
6.03      The goal to provide more science facilities and diversify the
curriculum to include workshop courses has been more difficult to achieve.
While most of the planned science facilities are operating and the courses
offered, the experience with workshop courses has been poor, mainly because
the workshop equipment has not been delivered and the courses cannot be
offered without it (paras. 5.09-5.10). Over one-third of the completed
technical classrooms are being used for regular classrooms or for other
purposes while the equipment is being procured (see Annex 2). The curricula
for the workshop courses are available and an adequate number of teachers
for these courses, some of whom were trained under the auspices of the
project (para. 5.13), are expected to be available when the workshops become
operational.



- 27 -
Primary Teacher Training Colleges
6.04    The goals for the primary teacher training colleges were similar to
those for the secondary schools: (a) to provide more student places, and (b)
to diversify the curriculum to include workshop courses and more science
courses. The outcomes are also similar. At appraisal it was anticipated that
4,200 student places would be provided, compared with 4,350 now provided.
Enrollments are 5,275, which exceed the number of student places. Despite
this large enrollment, the teacher/student ratio is 1:23. However, in two
colleges the enrollments are lower than the number of student places; both are
men's colleges in Imo State and their enrollments have been adversely affected
by new certification requirements in that State. These requirements have
added a year to previous one- and two-year programs and the students do not
want to spend the additional time. One college plans to accept women students
next year to increase enrollments.
6.05      There have been delays in accomplishing the goal of expanding the
science and workshop facilities. As in the case of the secondary schools,
over one-third of the technical classrooms have been completed, but they are
being used as regular classrooms or for other purposes because they lack
equipment (see Annex 2).
Project Efficiency
6.06      It is difficult to assess the quality of the project schools as
compared with similar schools in Nigeria, because information on dropout and
repeater rates is not systematically collected in Nigeria and no provision
was made in this project to develop institutions for this purpose. The only
information on school quality that exists on a national basis is the examina-
tion pass rates; for secondary school the pass rate is 60% and for primary
teacher training colleges, 40%. Of the 15 schools visited by the completion
mission, only two of the primary teacher training colleges and four of the
secondary schools were able to provide pass rate information on their
schools. This scanty information indicates that the average pass rate for
secondary schools and for primary teacher training colleges is about 70%,
well above the national average.
6.07      Facilities for tracing the career patterns of graduates do not
exist. Only three primary teacher training colleges and four secondary
schools were able to provide any information on their graduates. The three
primary teacher training colleges reported that all their graduates accepted
positions as primary school teachers. Most of the secondary school graduates
have tried to continue their studies, as salaries for those with post-secondary
school training are more attractive. From 5% to 10% of the graduates go on to
university, 25-50% get more technical training, and the remaining graduates
join the work force. As most of the workshops are not yet operational their
impact upon the curricula cannot be assessed at this stage.

VII. PROJECT FINANCING AND COST
Financing
7.01      Delays and inadequacies in State funding for the project (para.
5.03) comprised the major problem in nroject implementation. Delays in the
initial stages occurred because most of the Project Managers found it dif-
ficult to have funds allocated to the project in the Stat:e budget estimates.
As contracts could not be awarded until funds were available, there was a
two-year delay between the preparation of bills of quantity in 1974 and the
award of contracts in 1976. During this time, construction costs increased
substantially but the contractors were held to the original prices. They
objected, particularly those in Imo State, and many abandoned the sites.
Throughout the implementation of the project there were persistent diffi-
culties because the States would not allocate funds and contractors would
abandon the sites. The situation became so serious that the Federal Govern-
ment stepped in and gave the States a US$31,635,000 grant to enable them to
complete the project. However, these funds were not distinguished from
general State revenues and sometimes were not used for the project. Only in
Cross River State, where the Project Manager opened a special account, were
the funds used for the project (para. 4.05).
Costs
7.02      Delays in project implementation occurred at a time when worldwide
inflation was increasing and construction costs in Nigeria were also rapidly
increasing as a result of the post-war reconstruction and the construction
boom. Hence, the total project cost is expected to be about US$78.0 million,
compared with US$27.8 million, or about 180% higher than anticipated. The
largest increase was the 212% increase in the cost of construction, from an
estimated US$17.0 million to US$53.0 million. The next largest increase
(152%) was for professional fees. This occurred because the architectural
and managerial support that the architectural consultants contracted to
provide to the Federal Project Office and the State Project Units was more
extensive than anticipated and lasted over a considerably longer period
(paras. 5.04-5.07). The cost of furniture and equipment has also increased
dramatically (139%) because inflation increased the cost in the interim
between the appraisal cost estimates in 1972 and payments made between 1978
and 1980 (paras. 5.08-5.11). The lowest cost increases were for technical
assistance (36%) because the fellowships were used in 1973 and 1974 and the
two technical teacher trainers were financed by the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Cooperation (para. 5.12).

VIII. THE BANK-S PERFORMANCE
8.01      While the rehabilitation and expansion of these schools in the post-
war environment of Nigeria represents quite an achievement, hindsight reveals
a few lessons which could expedite project implementation in the future. The
project was hastily appraised because the Government was very anxious to begin
the reconstruction and reintegration of eastern Nigeria. The project was
appraised before the sites were visited and before costs were detailed. This
led to an overly optimistic project implementation schedule, low cost estimates
and project designs which in some cases were unrealistic. If the appraisal
had taken place after an assessment Qf the number and condition of the physical
facilities had been made, the extent of the damage to these schools would have
been known, making it possible to do more realistic estimates of costs, a more
thorough assessment of the necessary physical facilities, and better project
design. For example, in theory, economies of scale could be obtained by
combining inefficient small schools into larger comprehensive schools.



- 30 -
However, this idea proved to be very difficult to implement (para. 5.02). The
First Education Project also suffered because lending took place too early in
the project cycle, but the consequences of lending early in the project cycle
were not yet clear because the First Education Project was only in the initial
stages of implementation when the second project was being identified.
8.02      Closer supervision, particularly in the initial stages of project
implementation, might have reduced some of the problems. During the first
three years there were four supervision missions, only two of which visited
the sites in the eastern States. From 1975 to 1977 there were only three
supervision missions because the Government was reluctant to approve missions.
The infrequency of Bank missions during this initial period had two results.
First, Bank personnel were not available to discuss with State officials the
need to allocate State funds to the project (para. 7.01). Second, the absence
of Bank personnel put an additional burden on the architectural consultants
because they had to explain Bank procedures and interpret Bank policies--
duties normally performed by Bank staff. After 1977, supervision missions
visited Nigeria about every four months; however, only three missions (includ-
ing the completion mission) visited the sites. Closer supervision of the
fellowship program might have encouraged the Federal Project Unit to monitor
the recipients more carefully and ensure that they returned to Nigeria and
were well placed. A strength of the Bank's supervision of this project was
the continuity of mission personnel; on 13 of the 16 missions, one or more
members had been on a previous mission.
