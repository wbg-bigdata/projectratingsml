REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE SABAH PORTS AUTHORITY WITH THE GUARANTEE OF MALAYSIA
FOR A SECOND SABAH PORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Sabah Ports Authority with the Guarantee of Malaysia for the
equivalent of US$13.0 millicin to help finance the Second Sabah Ports Project.
The loan would have a term of 17 years, including four years of grace, with
interest at 7.5% per annum. Co-financing of US$1.6 million will be arranged
by the Sabah Ports Authority with commercial banks.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The latest economiLc report, "Malaysia:  New Perspectives on the
Third Malaysia Plan" (No. 1594-MA), is dated October 14, 1977. Detailed data
on Malaysia's economy are shown in Annex I.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysia has done well in the past
and, in particular, during the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP, 1971-75). The per
capita income of US$860 (in 1976) is among the highest in Southeast Asia.
Public and private investment activity was stepped up and, as a result,
economic growth, which during the 1960s averaged 6% a year, increased during
the SMP to 7%. During the Second Plan the proportion of agricultural house-
holds in poverty in Peninsular Malaysia was reduced from 68% to 63%./2
Progress has been made in reducing the economy's dependence on rubber, and
the manufacturing sector has performed well in terms of output, employment
and exports. With a high export component in GNP, the country is very
vulnerable to external fluctuations, which were significant during the SMP.
In spite of the increased investment activity and resulting current account
deficits in the balance of payments, Malaysia managed to maintain a strong
external position during the SMP with relatively low debt service payments
and growing international reserves.
4.        Notwithstanding this good performance, there are still substan-
tial inequalities in income and employment, generally correlated with
racial background, and considerable poverty remains, especially in the
countryside. The inferior income position of the Malays is related to this
concentration of Malays in traditional smallholder agriculture and their
complementary meager ownership of corporate assets. Moreover, Malays are
poorly represented in the modern industrial sector, especially in managerial,
professional, supervisory and clerical occupations. These inequalities have
/1 Part I is essentially the same as that presented in the President's
Report No. 2221-MA, dated February 8, 1978, for the Northwest
Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Project in Malaysia.
/2  For our purposes, we have defined the per capita poverty level in
Malaysia as US$215 per annum, based on the cost of a subsistence diet
and of other basic necesssities.



-2-
threatened the stability of the country and, in 1971, prompted the Government
to introduce a New Economic Policy, which was designed to achieve national
unity through the two-pronged objective of eradicating poverty and of
restructuring society to eliminate the identification of race with economic
function.
5.        The Government recently initiated the Third Malaysia Plan (TMP,
1976-80). In addition to reconfirming the goals of the New Economic Policy,
the TMP stresses that national unity as well as social and economic progress
can only be achieved in an environment of security and order. The major
objectives of the TMP are: (a) to reduce the overall incidence of poverty
(from 44% in 1975 to 34% by 1980, which would mean reducing poverty in the
agricultural sector from 63% to 49%); (b) to increase Malay employment in the
modern sectors of the economy (from the 1975 Malay share of 32% towards the
1990 goal of 50%); and (c) to increase the share of Malays in the equity
ownership of the corporate sector (from the 1975 Malay share of 8% to 16% in
1980).
6.        One of the principal means set out in the TMP to reduce poverty is
to raise agricultural production. In the Third Plan, one quarter (M$4.7 bil-
lion) of total public development expenditures is allocated to this sector
(compared with 22%, or M$2.1 billion, in the SMP). Of this, more than one
third will be spent on increasing productivity in existing agricultural
areas. In addition, one million acres of new land are scheduled for develop-
ment. As a means of reducing poverty, the TMP also provides for improved
housing and other essential services for the poor in both rural and urban
areas. The TMP also stresses that greater attention will be given to improv-
ing the less developed states in Malaysia.
7.        The TMP goals are set out in a framework of substantial economic
growth. The target growth rate for GDP is set at 8.5% per annum. Private
investment is targeted to grow about 10% a year and public investment at
about 6%, resulting in an investment of M$44 billion, in current prices, over
the TMP period. Public development expenditures were set at M$18.6 billion,
with a higher level of M$20 billion targeted if resources became available.
8.        During 1976, significant increases in exports, both in prices and
volumes, particularly of oil exports, combined with moderate import increases,
resulted in a current account surplus equivalent to 6.2% of GDP. Despite a
reduction in market borrowing by the Government, reserves increased by US$900
million. At the end of 1976, gross official reserves were the equivalent of
about seven months of imports.
9.        Current projections of oil exports and export prices in general
are higher than those used as a basis for the TMP. Therefore, the resource
outlook for Malaysia is now brighter than was forecast in the Third Plan.
Overall export earnings during the Plan period should be about US$5 billion
more than was forecast in the TMP. Largely as a result of this increase,
public sector revenues are also expected to be higher by about US$3 billion.
The likelihood of these additional resources has prompted the Government to



-3-
increase its TMP target for development expenditures to M$20 billion and, if
implementation constraints are overcome, an even higher target could be set.
10.       During the next five years, Malaysia's balance of payments should be
in substantial surplus. The cumulative current account surplus could amount
to over 5% of GDP compared to a negligible current surplus in the previous
five years. Since such a current account surplus would be sufficient to
provide for an adequate level of reserves, capital inflows may moderate in
the future. At present, about 19% of public debt outstanding and disbursed is
from the Bank; this percentage may increase somewhat by the early 1980s.
Reserves are also expected to continue to increase slowly, while the debt
service on public obligations is likely to remain at its present level of
4-5% of export earnings. The Bank's share of debt service is currently
about 11% and may increase to 12-14% by the early 1980s.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
11.       The Bank has made 37 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport.
The proposed project follows up on the First Sabah Ports Project, financed
under Loan 774-MA of June 30, 1971. Construction of Kota Kinabalu and
Sandakan ports under the First Sabah Ports Project has been completed and the
loan of US$16.1 million is expected to be fully disbursed by mid-1978.
Completion of the project was two years behind original schedule due to slow
mobilization, delays in procurement of materials and difficulties in retaining
suitable consulting engineers. This delay, compounded with worldwide infla-
tion, resulted in a cost overrun of about 50%. The Sabah Ports Authority
and the Federal Government are financing the cost overrun.
12.       The execution of Bank projects in Malaysia has generally been
satisfactory although, in a number of cases, disbursements have been slower
than expected. As of March 31, 1978, the loans to Malaysia held by the
Bank amounted to US$734.9 million. Fifteen loans have been fully disbursed.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as well as notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
13.       While currently Malaysia is a resource surplus country, the open-
ness of the economy (exports are 45% of the GDP) and the volatility of the
prices of Malaysia's main exports (rubber, palm oil and tin) make the contin-
uance of large surpluses uncertain.  Furthermore, to cushion against fluctua-
tion in exports, large reserves are needed. As far as the Bank is concerned,
the primary consideration in lending is not resource transfer; rather, it is
institution-building and helping Malaysia to expand its capacity to implement
programs to combat the deep-rooted problems of poverty and unemployment,
particularly in the rural areas.
14.       Malaysia's commitment to assist its low-income groups has streng-
thened significantly in the past few years. The Bank can justifiably take
some measure of credit for its efforts to help Malaysia identify and prepare



-4-
projects of this type geared toward the rural poor. In view of Malaysia's
otherwise weak project preparation capability, the number of rural develop-
ment projects recently financed and in the current pipeline appears impres-
sive. The bulk of these projects has been financed by the Bank. In the
past, a large share of Bank lending for rural development was modeled on the
successful FELDA land settlement schemes. More recently, the Bank has been
focusing more on in-situ type projects, such as small-scale irrigation, area
development and agricultural support services. The National Small-Scale
Irrigation Project (approved in FY77) is assisting over 60,000 smallholder
farmers through the construction and rehabilitation of about 200 small
irrigation schemes. In Kelantan, Malaysia's poorest state, the Bank is
providing to about 100,000 families a package of development activities
including improved access roads and a strengthening of the state's agricul-
tural support services. This year, under a third project, the Bank has
provided assistance for expanding and strengthening Malaysia's national
extension services including training, technical assistance, production of
improved seeds, a revision of the approach to extension, and a provision for
improving program monitoring and evaluation.
15.       While these recent projects are by themselves impressive, they are
not truly representative of the Government's general capacity to develop
projects. This capacity remains limited, largely because of a shortage of
trained staff. With the help of the UNDP-financed and Bank-executed State
and Rural Development Project, which provides technical assistance in selected
federal departments and states, the Bank is helping the Government to develop
further its programs and projects for reducing poverty.
16.       The country needs assistance to help develop future poverty programs
and projects that reach out directly to low-income families in the rural and
urban areas. The central thrust of the Bank's future lending program is
poverty redressal in the rural areas through improved support services and
better facilities. The Bank's loans will assist those in absolute poverty by
providing irrigation and drainage facilities and farm-to-market roads for
existing smallholders, as well as by providing landless laborers with newly
developed land. The Bank's program will also improve support services by
expanding extension; by increasing agricultural, small-scale, and industrial
credit; and by producing higher quality seeds. The Bank plans to mount a
concentrated effort to help such institutions as RISDA, FELCRA, and the
Agricultural Credit Bank. The groundwork for this assistance has already
been laid by the North Kelantan Rural Development, National Small-Scale
Irrigation, Agricultural Research and National Extension projects. A plan is
also envisaged to help the Government expand social services, in particular
for low-income groups, through assistance for formal and informal skill
training and the expansion of family planning services. Assistance to
infrastructure development will be very selective, focusing on a rural and
coastal transportation network, rural electrification, and low-cost housing.
17.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made six invest-
ments totaling US$8.69 million. The total commitments under the investments
held by IFC as of March 31, 1978, amounted to US$1.44 million (Annex II).



-5-
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Sectoral Background
18.       Malaysia consists of 13 states: 11 in Peninsular Malaysia (51,000
sq mi) and 2, Sabah and Sarawak (77,500 sq mi), in North Borneo. In part,
because of their distance (about 900 miles) from Peninsular Malaysia, and in
part because of their historical circumstances, the two Borneo states have a
relatively high degree of autonomy. As this project is primarily concerned
with development of a port in Sabah, the sectoral background discussions will
concentrate on the state of Sabah.
19.       Sabah is relatively isolated, with no overland connection to
Sarawak, the Sultanate of Brunei, or to the Indonesian province of Kalimantan
that occupies most of Borneo. The state (30,000 sq mi) is predominantly
mountainous and covered with dense tropical forests. The population (850,000)
is primarily concentrated on the coasts and around the ports, and is growing
at around 5% per annum, mainly due to substantial immigration from the
Philippines and Kalimantan. Except for the Pegalan Valley, which paral-
lels the west coast of Sabah, the interior is very sparsely populated.
Traditionally, transport between towns has been by sea with minor roads
radiating out from the pcrts without forming a unifying network. In recent
years, the Sabah Government has actively promoted road construction to
connect various parts of the state, but the road system is still substandard.
20.       Sabah's economy has been led by the fast growing forestry and
logging sectors which in recent years contributed nearly 27% of the state's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 56% of its non-oil export earnings. Sabah's
dependence on timber should diminish, however, with the development of its
off-shore oil and copper deposits. In addition, there is a concerted effort
to raise Sabah's agricultural output by planting oil palm and cocoa, and by
substantially increasing Government assistance to rice farmers. Forecasts
indicate that the state's GDP will continue to grow at 8-9% per annum in real
terms over the next few years. Although statistics are lacking, there is a
great disparity between incomes in the modern, export-related sectors and
those in the traditional., rural agricultural sector that accounts for the
majority of the population.
21.       One of the major constraints to Sabah's economic development is
the labor shortage. Despite the steady increase in native population and
immigration from southern Philippines, the labor force has been growing by
less than 1.5% per annum. The migrant labor force (70% of the employed
in Tawau in 1976) does not form a permanent source of skilled or semi-
skilled manpower for industry; it is controlled by temporary passports or
work permits, and can be recalled or expelled on short notice by Indonesia
or Malaysia. This is not true of Moslem Filipino immigrants from the Sulu
Archipelago, but their sea-oriented life style limits their usefulness for
logging and timber processing industries or regimented, estate-type agricul-
ture.
22.       Another important feature of the Sabah economy is its dependence on
foreign trade. Exports account for nearly two-thirds of GDP, while almost



-6-
60% of domestic demand for goods and services is provided by imports. Due to
Sabah's small market size, its limited import substitution opportunities, and
the disadvantage of its industries in comparison with the industries of
Peninsular Malaysia, its dependence on foreign trade is expected to continue.
Highways and Road Transport
23.       Sabah's road network comprises about 2,350 miles of roads, of which
only 28% is paved. This contrasts sharply with Peninsular Malaysia where
86% of the 12,000 mile network is paved. The Sabah road network also has a
very low density: 0.08 mile of road per square mile versus 0.2 in Peninsular
Malaysia. Lack of an all-weather road network has been one of the most
serious obstacles to the improvement of living standards in the rural areas
of Sabah,. and to integrating the state economy. As a result, most develop-
ment in Sabah is concentrated in coastal, export-import oriented economic
enclaves, including Tawau and its immediate hinterland (the southeast coast
of the state).
24.       The Bank-financed Third Highway Project (Loan 1376-MA) will improve
the quality of road transport within the Tawau region but will not diminish
its geographical isolation. The situation should improve when the Sabah Public
Works Department (SPWD) completes the gravelling and bridge construction on
the Sandakan-Lahad Datu road in the near future, and the Sapulut-Tawau road
later.
Railways
25.       The Tawau region has no rail transport.  Sabah Railways serves the
west coast of the state between the port of Kota Kinabalu and Tenom, a
distance of some 96 miles. In recent years, gradual growth in passenger
traffic has been accompanied by a sharp drop in goods movement, which has
been diverted to more efficient road transport. At negotiations for the
Third Highway Loan, the Sabah Government agreed to make no new capital
investment in the Sabah Railways, to reduce passenger services as new roads
are opened, and to review the justification for railway service in light of
an improved and expanded road network. Since this agreement, there has been
no capital investment made in the railway.
Ports and Shipping
26.       Because of the lack of all-weather roads, there are as many as eight
ports in Sabah, some of which are only 50 miles apart. There are also small
jetties on rivers which are utilized for passenger and commodities transpor-
tation in areas with no roads. Rivers are also used for floating logs to
coastal loading points. Construction of rudimentary road links in the last
few years has resulted in some small ports losing traffic. Once an adequate
road network is completed, port activities will probably concentrate in Kota
Kinabalu (the state capital), Sandakan (the largest city), and Tawau (a
rapidly growing town with a rich hinterland). The importance of the port at
Labuan, a small offshore island, will depend upon the success of the new free
trade zone being developed there, the possible establishment of oil and
gas-based industries, and the decline in traffic when Brunei's nearby port of
Muara becomes operational.



- 7 -
27.       At present, there are seven ports under the jurisdiction of the
Sabah Ports Authority (SPA). Over 90% of the cargo (except logs which are
loaded from roadsteads) passes through the ports of Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan
and Tawau. New facilities, partially financed under Loan 774-MA (First Sabah
Ports Project), have recent:Ly been completed at Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan.
The proposed project will provide new facilities at Tawau.
28.       SPA is also consiidering construction of an industrial jetty for bulk
cargo at Sapangar Bay about 10 miles north of the Kota Kinabalu port. Devel-
oping Sapangar Bay into an industrial zone must be related to a general
development plan for Kota Kinabalu. Consideration will be given to the
cost and convenience of passenger and goods transport between the proposed
industrial zone and the rest of the urban area, and compatibility with
existing or planned land uses. Consultants are undertaking a feasibility
study for the Sabah Government which will be coordinated with a Bank-financed
urban study under the Third Highway Project.
29.       Semporna, one of SPA's four minor ports, situated about 70 miles
east of Tawau, has been incurring annual losses on jetty operations. As
ships use the jetty only once or twice each year, and a satisfactory connect-
ing road exists to Tawau, SPA intends to close the facility. The anchorage
will continue to be used by vessels for the loading of timber. SPA's inten-
tion to close shore facilities at Semporna, by no later than December 31,
1979, was confirmed during negotiations (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
Air Transport
30.       Air transport is vital for connecting Sabah with the rest of
Malaysia and neighboring countries, as well as for internal communications.
The Malaysian Airline System (MAS) offers daily Boeing 737 service between
Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu. MAS and foreign carriers also operate direct
routes between Sabah and SiLngapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Inter-
nally, MAS has a fleet of seven Fokker F27-500 and four Britten Norman
Islander (BNI) aircraft, exclusively servicing Sabah and Sarawak. In Sabah,
five airports are served daily: Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau, Lahad Datu
and Labuan. Kota Kinabalu and Labuan accommodate jet aircraft, while the
others receive the Fokkers. Another six minor airports are served by the
BNIs. Passenger traffic has doubled since 1970 and is now over 500,000 per
annum. With the presently limited road network, civil aviation will continue
to play an important role in connecting the east and west coasts of Sabah and
the coastal areas with remote interior locations.
Transport Policy Planning and Coordination
31.       The 1968 General Transport Survey reviewed all aspects of transport
planning in Malaysia and identified investment requirements up to 1975. For
Sabah, the survey emphasized development of roads and reconstruction of the
ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan. The recommendations for ports have
generally been followed with the construction of two ports which were recently
completed. With regard to roads, the Sabah Government has embarked upon a
reconstruction and upgrading program with Bank financing under the Third
Highway Project.



- 8 -
32.       Once the west coast road is reconstructed under the Third Highway
Project, railway service will be phased-out between Papar and Beaufort (see
map). When this phase-out is completed, the only remaining issue of modal
competition will be between roads and minor ports. The closure of Semporna
port is expected in 1979 and the role of other small ports will be reviewed
as the road network grows. Some short-distance passenger traffic will be
diverted from air transport to roads as the latter are improved.
33.       Until recently, transport planning in Sabah was rather limited and
left to the individual departments of the Sabah Government dealing with the
various modes.   The Sabah Public Works Department (SPWD) was responsible for
roads. Roads were built where needed, but inadequate planning led to an
emphasis on maximum road length production rather than on sound engineering
and construction standards. Consequently, many roads became impassable during
the rainy season, and others required heavy repairs shortly after construction.
Prompted by the economic slump and a recommendation from the Federal Govern-
ment, a Sabah Economic Planning Unit (SEPU) was created in late 1975, modelled
on the Federal Economic Planning Unit (FEPU). The SEPU will help coordinate
Sabah's transport development.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Historical Background
34.       In 1976, SPA's consultant, Posford, Pavry and Partners (UK),
completed a 20-year master plan for Sabah ports development. The plan
recommends an early expansion of Tawau port, to be followed by further
expansion of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan ports at a later date. The proposed
project is based on the consultant's recommendations and consists of the
construction of additional cargo berths at Tawau, mechanical equipment for
Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and Tawau, and technical assistance and staff
training for SPA. An appraisal report (No. 1881a-MA), based on the findings
of a Bank mission in October 1977, is being circulated separately. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington in April 1978. Supplementary project data are
given in Annex III.
Tawau Port
35.       Tawau is located at the northern entrance to Cowie Bay, which forms
a deep and well-protected anchorage between the mainland and Sebatik Island
(see map). The bay mainly serves as an anchorage for vessels loading timber
logs and woodchips. General cargo traffic at Tawau, measured in revenue
tons, grew by about 9% per annum from 218,000 tons in 1973 to 298,000 tons
in 1977, and is expected to grow at a slightly higher rate between 1978 and
1986. Ships calling at Tawau today are experiencing substantial delays in
obtaining berth services and the situation is expected to deteriorate as
traffic grows.
36.       The existing general cargo quay at Tawau, constructed in 1961,
provides 750 ft of effective berthing length for general cargo vessels and a
small ramp in shallow water for loading and unloading coastal roll-on/roll-off
vessels. Some quay repairs are necessary and US$102,000 is included in the
proposed loan for this purpose. The quay is not designed to accept the



- 9 -
concentrated loads associated with today's cargo handling equipment.
Nevertheless, after project completion, this facility will be needed for
small ships and light general cargo loads. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that SPA would continue to use the existing jetty at Tawau for
light general cargo until it is replaced with the concurrence of the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02). Due to the narrowness of Tawau's
existing jetty and approach road, and inadequate storage facilities, port
operations are slower and less efficient than at SPA s two other major ports
where Bank-financed wharves recently became operational. The proposed
project will considerably improve future cargo handling performances and
reduce ship waiting and turnaround time at Tawau.
37.       Existing port facilities are also used for passenger ferry opera-
tions, consisting of four trips daily between Tawau and Sebatik Island.
Passenger ferries use inner berths only. Traffic is unregulated, unsafe,
conducive to pilferage, interferes with port cargo and customs operations,
and earns no revenue for SPA. As cargo traffic grows, the hazards associated
with passenger traffic wilL intensify, and SPA agrees that a new location is
necessary for passengers. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that the State Government would move passenger traffic to another acceptable
location by no later than December 31, 1979 (draft Guarantee Agreement,
Section 3.02(b)).
Prolect Description
38.       The major purpose of the proposed project is to provide additional
berths and ancillary facilities at Tawau, which, together with the existing
wharf, will meet the port's needs up to 1990. The project is based on the
consultant's recommendations as amended following Bank review and has been
included in the Third Malaysia Plan.
39.       The proposed project would include:
(a) construction of a concrete piled wharf (500 ft x 300 ft) with an
upstream piled extension (500 ft x 80 ft), a transit shed (50,000
sq ft floor area), an access road (length 750 ft), an office, a
vehicle maintenance facility, ancillary buildings, and utilities at
Tawau;
(b) reclamation and surfacing of approximately 10 acres of land for
storage;
(c)  cargo handling equipment for Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and Tawau
ports;
(d)  engineering services, including design and supervision of civil
works, site investigations and siltation studies; and
(e) technical assistance and staff training for SPA.

Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
40.       The total project cost is estimated at US$26 million (including
local duties and taxes of US$1 million). The foreign exchange component
would be US$14.6 million (about 56%). The proposed loan of US$13 million
would cover the foreign exchange costs of all civil works, engineering
consultants' services, technical assistance and training. The remainder of
the foreign exchange costs (for mechanical equipment) is expected to be met
by borrowing from either the Sabah State Government or commercial banks.
Co-financing with commercial banks will be arranged by SPA. The local currency
required, M$28 million (US$11.4 million equivalent), will be provided by SPA
except for the road costs of M$0.4 million which will be met by the State
Government.
41.        Cost estimates for civil works are based on preliminary designs
and unit prices for ongoing similar works in Malaysia; those for mechan-
ical equipment are based on recent purchases. Estimates are in late 1977
prices. Physical contingencies of 15% have been included for civil works.
Price contingencies are 9% annually in 1978-79 and 8% in 1980-82 for civil
works; and 7.5% annually in 1978-79 and 7% in 1980-82 for cargo handling
equipment. The foreign exchange cost for technical assistance includes fees
(estimated at US$6,000 per man-month) and air fares. Local costs include
subsistence allowances.
Implementation
42.       The project will be carried out by SPA, assisted by consulting
engineers acceptable to the Bank. Use of acceptable consultants was confirmed
during negotiations (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02). For effective
implementation of the proposed project at Tawau, assurances were obtained
during negotiations from the Sabah State Government that it will:
(a)  vest in SPA, by no later than December 31, 1978, about three
acres of land adjacent to the existing foreshore, needed for
port extension and for mobilization of construction camp at site
(draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02(a)(i));
(b)  reserve about 10 acres of land adjacent to the new port area
for future port use by 1990 (draft Guarantee Agreement,
Section 3.02(a)(ii));
(c)  construct, by no later than December 31, 1980, an access road link-
ing the new port facilities with the North Road (draft Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.02(c)); and
(d)  restrict further reclamation east of the port to the existing
seaward limit to avoid increasing siltation at existing and pro-
posed port facilities (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02(d)).
43.       The works are expected to be completed by the third quarter of
1981, assuming effectiveness of the proposed loan by October 1, 1978. How-
ever, about 500 ft of wharf should be available for berthing ships and cargo
operations by January 1, 1981. The construction schedule incorporating
this target was discussed and accepted by SPA and the Bank during negotiations.



- 11 -
Procurement and Disbursement
44.       All civil works, except for the access road, would be executed under
one civil engineering contiract, and would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The
Government intends to levy import duties on items procured for the project.
45.       Disbursements for civil works would be made at 58% of total costs.
For consulting services, technical assistance and training, disbursements
would be made at 100% of total costs. A disbursement schedule is given in
the Loan and Project Summary (page ii).
46.       A siltation study and additional soil borings at Tawau were
completed. in April 1978; other necessary site investigations will commence
shortly.  It is proposed that the foreign exchange cost of these studies and
investigations and consultant services, estimated at US$170,000, be retro-
actively financed from the proposed Bank loan.
SPA Organization, Management and Staff
47.       SPA is a quasi-government corporation with adequate powers to manage
and maintain ports. However, major capital expenditure budgets and significant
changes in tariffs and salary scales are subject to State Government approval.
SPA effectively operates seven out of Sabah's eight ports, the exception
being the duty-free port of Labuan handling mainly transhipment cargo for the
independent Sultanate of Brunei. Traffic at Labuan, administered by Sabah's
Marine Department, is expected to reduce when Brunei's port at Muara becomes
operational soon.
48.       SPA's management is generally satisfactory, but there remains a
need to strengthen certain aspects, especially the capability for develop-
ment of economic policies and investment planning. Recognizing this situa-
tion, SPA has proposed that a management study be carried out by consultants
to strengthen the Management Services Department and to improve traffic
operation control. A feasibility study is also required to devise and help
implement a multi-shift system at major ports. These studies (which will
take about one year) are included in the proposed project. The consultant's
terms of reference for these studies were approved by SPA and the Bank during
negotiations.
49.       SPA's engineerirLg department requires additional experienced staff
to handle large civil works and to improve mechanical plant maintenance
services. This was evident during the First Sabah Ports Project when
difficulties in retaining foreign consulting engineers resulted in SPA having
to augment its staff with expatriates under contract to assume project
supervision responsibilities for the remainder of the project work. SPA has
agreed to assign regular and supernumerary staff to consulting engineers on
site and to the consulting engineers' headquarters during the proposed
project. Training in mechanical plant and equipment maintenance will be
undertaken at training centers in Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan or Peninsular
Malaysia. The proposed loan provides for Bank financing of the foreign
exchange costs of this training.



- 12 -
50.       Management starting salaries, particularly for professionally
qualified accountants and engineers, are at present lower than comparable
private sector enterprises, creating difficulties in attracting and retaining
personnel. The Federal Government has already approved new salary scales for
statutory bodies in Peninsular Malaysia and the State of Sabah intends to
ratify the new salary scales in 1978. It is therefore expected that SPA's
difficulties in recruitment of qualified professional staff will soon be
overcome.
51.       In accordance with a requirement of the First Sabah Ports Project
that SPA retain auditors satisfactory to the Bank, a local firm of chartered
accountants has been auditing SPA's commercial accounts since 1973. It was
reaffirmed during negotiations that audited accounts for 1978 and thereafter
will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal
year (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.02).
52.       SPA's internal audit division currently reports to the Chief
Accountant, which means that the executive officer in charge of day-to-day
accounting also controls the audit of these transactions. This procedure
is to be changed by having the Internal Audit Chief report directly to the
General Manager.
SPA Finances
53.       Ever since its creation in 1967, SPA has maintained a sound
financial position. Tariffs are cost-based and adequate, and operating
ratios are satisfactory. These results have been achieved despite a 50%
cost overrun for the First Ports Project, with the final cost now estimated
at US$41 million compared to the appraisal estimate of US$27 million. SPA
was able to meet local cost overruns from internally-generated resources and
has received a Federal Government loan towards increased foreign exchange
costs.
54.       On the basis of reasonable assumptions regarding traffic, opera-
ting costs (including the effect of inflation), and a 15% tariff increase
assumed in 1980 to cover inflation, SPA should be able to earn a rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets in use of not less than 6% in 1978 and
1979, and 7% in 1980 and 1981. An appropriate rate thereafter will be
agreed between the Bank and SPA by no later than December 31, 1981, based
on a review of SPA's forecast cash requirements for the period 1982-85.
The review will take into account SPA's tax liabilities at that time and the
timing and magnitude of capital expenditure on the Phase II development at
Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan ports. These financial requirements have been
covenanted (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).
55.       To ensure that an adequate financial position is maintained,
understanding was reached during negotiations that SPA will: (a) not incur
new debt if net revenue falls below 1.75 times the maximum debt service
requirements for any succeeding fiscal year (draft Loan Agreement, Section
5.06); and (b) not incur capital expenditures (other than the project)
exceeding M$3,000,000 in any fiscal year without prior consultation with the
Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.05).



- 13 -
56.       SPA intends to obtain expert assistance to review the adequacy of
its insurance coverage. The cost of the proposed consultancy work for asset
revaluation and insurance is included in the proposed project. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that SPA would maintain coverage with
responsible insurers, or make other provisions satisfactory to the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.01).
57.       The financial projections' sensitivity to the following risks was
examined: (a) increase in cost of project; (b) increase in operating costs;
and (c) slower shift from raw to processed timber exports. The most signifi-
cant effect is likely to be from (b). However, even if inflation proves to be
higher than forecast, no difficulty is anticipated for SPA in raising tariffs
more than the modest 15% assumed for 1980.
Ecology
58.       None of the proposed work will affect the existing ecology of the
harbor; dredged material, if any, will be disposed of at an approved location.
Justification, Benefits and Risks
59.       The port of Tawau serves a potentially rich but geographically
isolated region with no paved roads to any part of Sabah beyond Lahad Datu.
The availability of adecquate and efficient port facilities is essential to
the region's economic development. The existing Tawau port has experienced
growing congestion in recent years at a cost estimated at close to US$1
million for 1977 alone. The present situation will further deteriorate as
port traffic increases. The main purpose of this project is to provide the
Tawau region with port JEacilities to meet future needs of its seaborne
commerce.
60.       The expansion of existing port facilities will avoid the need to
invest in much more cositly and less efficient lighterage operations. There
will also be savings to the economy from reduced cargo losses due to damage
and pilferage, lower cargo handling costs, and reduced ship waiting and
turnaround time. The resulting economic rate of return is estimated at 24%.
61.       The principal project risk involved is that port traffic projections,
particularly for the wharf, will depend largely on the Sabah Government's
ability to implement its timber policies. If the pace of industrialization
lags, exports of timber products will be lower and log exports will be higher
than projected. The delay in industrialization may also affect capacity to
import and so reduce imports across the wharf. Resultant lower traffic flows
through the project facilities would reduce the economic rate of return from



- 14 -
24% to 20%, indicating that the proposed project remains viable even under
these conditions.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Sabah Ports
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, and
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors. Special conditions of the project are listed in
Section III of Annex III.
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Effective Date: August 24, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Work has been satisfactorily completed on the new berths at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan. Slow progress in completing the access road to
Sandakan delayed full use of the latter facilities until mid-1977. The new
headquarters building has been occupied. Delay in mobilization, procurement
of materials and difficulties in retaining suitable consultant engineers,
compounded with the world-wide inflation, resulted in a cost overrun of about
50%. Settlement of an outstanding claim by the contractors will delay the
final account and the closing date of the loan has been postponed by 18
months to June 30, 1978.
Loan No. 799   Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of February 11, 1972;
Effective I)ate: April 17, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1978
All equipment and materials have been received. Malayan Railway (MR)
operations showed an all-round improvement during 1976 and 1977 although some
key efficiency indicators were still below acceptable standards, especially
those pertaining to locomotive and rolling stock maintenance. As a result of
a successful marketing driLve in 1976, a modest financial return of about
1% was achieved that year compared to losses incurred during the previous ten
years. A substantial wage award effective July 1, 1977 imposed a new strain
on financial recovery, but subsequent tariff increases and some economies in
expenditure should produce a break-even result in 1977 and enable a profit to
be earned in 1978 and thereafter. Reasonable progress is being made in
clearing the external audit backlog.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of August 22,
1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980
Overall, the project is about 85% completed. Two of the three
contract sections constituting the new Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway have
been completed and the third section which is nearing completion has been
partially taken over. Except for a two mile section at the northern end, the
Expressway was opened for traffic in October 1976. The improvement works to
the existing Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Road are substantially completed, while
the widening and improvement works of the Kuala Lumpur-Batang Kali Road,
which were started in November 1976, will take still one and a half to two
years to complete. Consulting services for various studies and detailed
engineering have been completed. Construction costs have escalated sharply
because of rapid inflation, and the total project cost is now estimated
to be US$46 million, compared to an appraisal estimate of US$37 million.

Loan No. 1214  Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$26.0 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effective Date: November 11, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The main objective of the project is to increase the efficiency
of the transport system in Kuala Lumpur. Public transport services will be
improved while the use of private cars will be restrained. Although primarily
concerned with urban transport, the project also introduces new approaches to
residential development for low-income families. The main components are:
(a) road and intersection improvements, traffic engineering and control
schemes and new radial roads; (b) transport policy measures including intro-
duction of minibus services, traffic priorities for high-occupancy vehicles
and area road pricing; (c) new serviced plots for about 1,400 households and
150 businesses and improvement of infrastructure services for about 2,100
existing households; and (d) technical assistance to support traffic manage-
ment and transport planning, to prepare an urban development project for
Kuantan, and to review national housing policies and programs. Progress on
the transport components has been quite satisfactory although delays have been
experienced. Execution of the residential components has been less satisfac-
tory due to administrative and policy problems.
Loan No. 1376 Third Highway Proiect; US$35.0 Million Loan of April 4, 1977;
Effective Date: May 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The main objective of the project is to improve the highway network
in the East Malaysian State of Sabah through the reconstruction and upgrading
of priority links and the development of the Public Works Department's
maintenance capacity. A further objective is to protect road investments in
Peninsular Malaysia through a pilot road maintenance and pavement strengthening
program in three states. The project also includes an urban study of Kota
Kinabalu in Sabah and a transport/railway study in Peninsular Malaysia.
Construction work on the East and West Coast Roads in Sabah started in
September 1977, about five months behind schedule. The highway maintenance
and upgrading program in Sabah has not yet been started due to a delay of
about one year in appointing consultants to assist PWD. While satisfactory
progress has been made in the preparatory work for the construction in
Peninsular Malaysia, the reorganization of maintenance sections in the three
pilot states is behind schedule due to staff shortages. The consulting
services for the studies are slightly behind schedule and will be completed
during the first half of 1978.

Loan No. 1443 Eighth Power Project; US$22.0 Million Loan of August 3,
1977; Effective Date: January 9, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
The 275 kV transmission lines from Temengor to Papan and from Port
Dickson to Malacca financed under the Sixth Power Project have been completed.
The Seventh Power Project (the Prai Power Station extension, 3 x 120 MW) and
the Eighth Power Project (the Pasir Gudang Power Station, 2 x 120 MW) are
still in the early stages of construction; the progress is generally satis-
factory.
Based on the Bank's recommendation, the Government has agreed to
apply fuel surcharges to commercial and industrial consumers since mid-1975
and to provide NEB with equity of about US$200 million during the period
FY77-81 on a year by year basis to bridge NEB's financial gap. Maximum demand
and energy sales for FY77 were 975-MW and 5,297 GWH respectively (16% above
FY76 levels).
The co-financing arrangement for the Eighth Power Project (commer-
cial bank loan of US$30 million) was completed on October 4, 1977.
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project consists of the expansion of water supply facilities
to meet increasing demands in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley area. The
first part of the project, comprising ordinary water works, was completed
in 1976, practically on schedule and within the cost estimates, and is
operational. The construction of the Langat Dam, the last and major work of
the project, is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by
the end of 1979. Completion will be two years behind schedule. Cost of the
dam is likely to be about 25% more than originally estimated, resulting in an
increase in the total project cost of about 15%. No difficulties are foreseen
in raising the additional funds required. The Selangor State Water Department,
which is responsible for the project, performs well in spite of staffing
problems. Its financial management still needs some strengthening.
Loan 1213-MA   Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project; US$21.5 Million Loan of
March 11, 1976: Effective Date: August 25, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is the first stage (1976-81) of a 30-year master plan
for the sewerage development in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan area. It
includes the extension of sewers (about 70 miles of trunk and lateral sewers)
and treatment facilities to serve an additional population of 200,000 in the
Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory; the institution of a separate Sewerage Depart-
ment within the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, with its own accounting system and

finances; engineering and management-consultant services; staff training; and
the preparation of sewerage and pollution control measures for the Kuala
Lumpur metropolitan area. The engineering of the project has been satisfac-
torily completed. Bidding for two out of the three major contracts (sewers)
has also been completed. However, land acquisition and resettlement of
present occupants are creating serious problems which are delaying the project.
The establishment of a separate accounting system for the Sewerage Department
(Kuala Lumpur City Hall) is progressing well. Action to levy the sewerage
surcharge on water bills has been undertaken after long delays. Compliance
with covenants regarding long-term sewerage and urban planning in Selangor
State is lagging.
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$25.0 Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective
Date: June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Planting operations have been completed but due to the severe
droughts in 1976 and 1977 a heavy supplying program especially on the rubber
schemes is being carried out, which is due to be completed by the end of
1978. About 23,500 acres of oil palm and 16,400 acres of rubber have been
planted. Planting and maintenance standards are satisfactory. Only scheme 15
is in production. So far, 1,467 houses have been constructed and 1,347
settlers have moved in. Schools and clinics are under construction but will
only be completed about one year after settler entry. Due to delays in
settler house construction, settler entry will be delayed by two to two and a
half years on various schemes. JKR capacity is a major constraint in speeding
up house construction. Coordination between JKR and FELDA has improved
considerably and FELDA expects that the backlog will not increase. Oil palm
mill construction on scheme 18 is on schedule and will be completed by April
1979. Water to schemes 16 to 18 is temporarily supplied from Jengka II due
to delays in intake construction on scheme 19. Due to excessive transfers in
middle management field staff, there is lack of leadership which affects
continuity of work.
Loan No. 967   Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16, 1974; Closing
Date:  June 30, 1982
Clearing and planting proper are satisfactorily on schedule, except
for phase III of the Ulu Dengar scheme due to late logging. Planting and
maintenance standards are satisfactory. Oil palm production started on four
schemes in 1977. However, due to the severe droughts in 1976 and 1977, early
yields are disappointing. Attacks of elephants and wild boar resulted in a
loss of 25% of the total oil palm stand. FELDA has embarked on a massive
trenching program around the scheme boundaries and indications are that this
program may be effective. FELDA is now preparing for a gigantic supplying program.
So far, 828 houses have been constructed and 710 settlers have moved in. Due
to delays in settler house construction, delays of one to three years in
settler entry are to be expected on various schemes. Lack of capacity in JKR
and in the Ministries of Education and Health has delayed construction of
schools and clinics, but the situation is improving because of the creation of
separate units in these Ministries catering for FELDA schemes. Two of the
five oil mills to be constructed under the loan were commissioned in 1977.

Loan No. 973   Western Johore Agricultural Development Project: US$45.0 Million
Loan of April 5, 1974; Effective Date: August 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Project civil works are still substantially behind schedule, and
acceleration of work has proven difficult due to unusually severe rainfall
and flooding, refinements in design requiring construction of numerous
small water control structures, and the persistent problems of land acqui-
sition in a settled smallholder area. However, work is progressing on all
drainage basin contracts, at costs considerably below appraisal estimates.
The project has recently been expanded to include the construction of
drainage works and agricultural installations in the Phase II area of
Western Johore and construmction of a network of secondary roads in the
original Phase I area.
Loan No. 1044  Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million Loan of
October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
Clearing and planting operations on schemes 8 and 9 are delayed by
about 9 to 12 months due to late logging. Scheme 2 is in production.
Production on scheme 3 has been postponed due to labor shortages. Schemes 4
and 5 are expected to come in production by late 1978, but this may also
have to be postponed. Despite the labor shortage, maintenance standards are
satisfactory. Attacks by elephants and wild boar resulted in a loss of 12%
of the total oil palm stand. FELDA will start a trenching program whereafter
a supplying program will be initiated. Following the decision to reduce the
holding size from 14 to 10 acres, settlers of schemes 1 through 5 will be
housed in Town 22, while separate townships will be constructed for schemes 6
through 9. So far, 411 houses have been completed and 283 settlers moved in.
The relationship between DARA and FELDA has improved considerably following
the changes in DARA top management, and FELDA expects that the backlog in
settler entry will not irLcrease. Efforts will be made to clear this backlog.
Loan No. 1115 Agricultural Research and Extension Project; US$28.5 Million
Loan of May 30, 1975; Effective Date: October 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project implementation is now about two years behind the appraisal
estimates. A new Director General was appointed in mid-1977 and a new
Deputy Director for Administration was appointed in January 1978, but the
post of Deputy Director for Research is still vacant. Some progress has
been made on international recruitment of scientist and research program
reviewers. Six scientists are now on board and a total of 15 man-years has
been committed representing 15% of the total scheduled under the project.
An additional one man-year has been utilized for consultants to conduct nine
program reviews. Civil works and fellowships are the only components of the
project that have been proceeding at a satisfactory pace. The extension
component of the project is also about two years behind schedule and has had
similar management constraints with a change in Directors occurring in March
1978. The next six months should be adequate to indicate whether the new
management will be able to get the project moving.

Loan No. 1294 North Kelantan Rural Development Project; US$21.0 Million
Loan of JUly 21, 1976; Effective Date: October 28, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project includes the Lemal Irrigation component which will
provide drainage and flood protection to 30,000 gross ha of farmland and
intensive irrigation to 12,000 net ha of paddy; construction of 190 km of
rural roads throughout North Kelantan; 15 small irrigation schemes serving
1,300 ha of paddy; construction, rehabilitation and equipping of 25 Farmers
Development Centers (FDCs); and establishment of an effective agricultural
extension service for Kelantan. The project start-up period has seen rapid
implementation of the FDC component, good progress on the agricultural
extension component with planning, staffing and preparation of equipment
specifications proceeding on schedule, and a welcome degree of cooperation
between the Farmers Organization Authority and the Kelantan Department of
Agriculture in Joint planning of agricultural service buildings and field
operations. Some delay in engineering of roads and irrigation works has
occurred due to delays in approval of staff, but this problem appears to have
been largely resolved.
Loan No. 1444 National Small-Scale Irrigation Project; US$39.0 Million Loan
of August 3, 1977; Effective Date: October 25, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The loan became effective on October 25, 1977 and the project works
have just been started.
Loan No. 599   Education Project: US$8.8 Million Loan of May 23, 1969:
Effective Date: September 16, 1969; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The Project provided US$8.8 million for the construction of technical,
vocational, agricultural and general secondary schools and one teacher training
college. All project institutions have been completed and are in satisfactory
operation. Savings attributable to lower than expected project costs and the
shift in the exchange rate were used to finance additional project items
transferred from the Second Education Project (Loan 810-MA). Disbursement of
the outstanding balance of US$0.2 million is expected to be completed shortly.
Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of April 5,
1972; Effective Date:  July 7, 1972: Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
The project is financing the establishment of a curriculum develop-
ment center, science schools for the University of Penang, vocational schools,
and an educational television system. With the exception of parts of the
University and one vocational school, project institutions are practically
completed and operating. Earlier delays incurred in the implementation of
these two items necessitated a postponement of the closing date by one year.
The delays are reflected in slow disbursements, but the problem is currently
being addressed by the Bank and the Government. Project cost overruns (20%)
are expected to be financed by the Government.

Loan No. 974   Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of April 5,
1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government to develop technical training,
pre-service teacher training, and an East Malaysia educational television
system. Implementation has improved since a year ago when less than 50% of
project civil works had been tendered. Contracts have now been awarded for 11
out of 13 project institutions. Construction began in early 1976 and most of
the project institutes aret scheduled for completion in late 1978. The Project
Unit is functioning satisfactorily, despite current problems with bid evaluation.
Loan No. 1329 Fourth Education Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of
November 18, 1976; Effective Date: January 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is (lesigned to improve the quality of primary schooling
and to redress existing imbalances in the provision of primary education
by providing additional cLassrooms in poverty areas, facilities for teacher
training and one teacher training college in Sarawak. The project includes
three new Industrial Training Centers and expansion of two existing ones. It
includes also a study on community education in preparation of government
investment in nonformal education. Project implementation began in January
1977 and appears to be satisfactory. Problems in the processing of disburse-
ments have been resolved. Shortage of staff in the Project Unit has been
remedied by the Government. Disbursements began a half year behind schedule
during the second half of FY78.
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Effective Date: June 21, 1973; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
There has been continued progress of civil works. Out of a total
of 571 buildings, 232 have been completed; another 80 are under construction;
and a further 148 buildings are at tender stage. An IBM mini-computer has
already been procured and put in operation. Computerization of management
information is under way. A review of the total program (including the
project) has been carried out by an external team of experts. Program
performance in 1976 was even better than in 1975 and the number of annual
new acceptors was the highest since the inception of the program. Project-
assisted extension of integrated rural health and family planning services
recorded the highest increase in performance. Disbursement has also increased
from 5% in September 1976 to 10% in June 1977 and 22% by the end of March
1978. This is mainly due! to the energetic efforts of the new management of
the National Family Planning Board (NFPB).
