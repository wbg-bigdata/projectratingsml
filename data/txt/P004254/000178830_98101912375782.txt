I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
1.01      Malaysia comprises 13 states:  11 on Peninsular Malaysia (51,000
sq mi) and 2 in North Borneo, Sabah and Sarawak (77,500 sq mi). In part
because of their distance (about 900 miles) from Peninsular Malaysia, and in
part because of historical circumstances, the two Borneo states have a
relatively high degree of autonomy.
1.02      Because this project is primarily concerned with development of
a port in Sabah, economic and sector background discussions will concentrate
on the state of Sabah. It is a relatively isolated area, with no overland
connection to Sarawak, the Sultanate of Brunei, or the Indonesian province of
Kalimantan that occupies most of Borneo.
1.03      Sabah's 30,000 sq mi are predominantly mountainous and covered
with dense tropical forests. The population of only 850,000 is growing by
around 5% p.a., including substantial immigration from the Philippines and
Kalimantan. The state's population is primarily concentrated on the coasts,
in and around the ports. Except for the Pegalan Valley, which parallels the
west coast across the Crocker Range, the interior is sparsely populated.
Traditionally, transport between towns has been by sea with roads radiating
out from the ports rather than forming a unifying network. In recent years,
the Sabah Government has actively promoted road construction to connect
various parts of the state, but the road system remains substandard. Sabah
is now concentrating on upgrading the basic system.
1.04      Sabah's economy has been led by the fast growing forestry and
logging sectors which in 1975 contributed nearly 27% of the state's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and 56% of its non-oil export earnings. Because of a
slack in world demand, particularly in Japan, the main customer for Sabah
timber, production in 1975 was about 10% below that of 1974. Since prices
also dropped, 1975 export revenues were 35% lower than those of 1974. In
1976, however, timber export revenues rose to M$1.2 billion, more than double
the 1975 level.
1.05      Sabah's economic dependence on timber should diminish with the
development of its off-shore oil and copper deposits. In addition there is a
concerted effort to raise Sabah's agricultural output by planting oil palm
and cocoa and by substantially increasing Government assistance to rice
farmers. Forecasts indicate the state's GDP will continue to grow at 8-9%
p.a. in real terms over the next few years. Although statistics are lacking,
there is a great disparity between incomes in the modern, export related
sectors and those in the traditional, rural agricultural sector that accounts
for the majority of the population.
1.06      Three potential areas of constraint to the realization of Sabah's
economic potential are labor shortages, dependence on foreign trade and
inadequate land transport.



- 2 -
1.07      Despite increases in native population, immigration and inflow of
refugees from Southern Philippines, the active labor force has been growing
by less than 1.5% p.a. This has been due in part to a faster growth of the
under 15 age group and in part to the rapid expansion of secondary school
enrollment. The increasingly important migrant labor force (70% of the
employed in Tawau in 1976) is unreliable as a permanent source of skilled or
semi-skilled manpower for industry: it is controlled by temporary passports
and work permits and can be recalled or expelled on short notice by Indonesia
or Malaysia. Tlhis is not true of Moslem Filipino refugees from Sulu
Arzhipelago, but their sea-oriented life style limits their usefulness
for logging and timber processing industries or regimented, estate-type
agriculture.
1.08      Another important feature of the Sabah economy is its dependence
on foreign trade. Exports account for nearly two-thirds of gross domestic
product, while almost 60% of domestic demand for goods and services is pro-
vided by imports. Given the limited market size and import substitution
opportunities in Sabah and its competitive disadvantage relative to the
Peninsular Malaysia-based industries; this dependence is expected to continue.
The Transport System
(Map 13392)
Highways and Road Transport
1.09      Sabah's road network comprises about 2,350 miles of roads of which
only 28% are paved. This contrasts sharply with Peninsular Malaysia where
862; of the 12,000 mile network is paved.  The Sabah road network also has a
very low density: 0.08 mile of road per square mile versus 0.2 in Peninsular
Malaysia.
1.10      Lack of an all-weather road network has been the single most
serious obstacle to the improvement of living standards in the rural areas,
and to integrating the state economy. As a result, most development in
Sabah is concentrated in coastal based and export-import oriented economic
enclaves, including Tawau and its immediate hinterland.
1.11      The Bank-financed Third Highway Project (Loan 1376-MA) will improve
the quality of road transport within the Tawau region but will not diminish
its geographical isolation. The situation should improve when SPWD completes
the gravelling and bridge construction on the Sandakan-Lahad Datu road in the
near future, and when a Sapulut-Tawau road is built in the longer term.
Railways
1.12      The southeast coast Tawau region has no rail transport.  Sabah
Railways serves the west coast of the state between the port of Kota Kinabalu
and Tenom, some 96 miles away. In recent years, gradual growth in passenger
traffic has been accompanied by a sharp drop in goods movement, which has
been diverted to more efficient road transport.  At negotiations for the



Third Highway Loan, the Sabah Government agreed to make no new capital
investment in the Sabah Railways, to reduce passenger services as new roads
are opened, and to review the justification for railway service in light of
an improved and expanded road network. Since the agreement, there has been
no new railway capital investment made.
Ports and Shipping
1.13      Because of the lack of all-weather roads, there are a large number
of ports (8) in Sabah, some of which are only 50 miles apart. Construction
of rudimentary road links in the last few years has resulted in some small
ports losing traffic. Once an adequate road network is completed, port
activities will probably concentrate in Kota Kinabalu (the capital), Sandakan
(the largest city), and Tawau (a rapidly growing town with a rich hinter-
land). Road distances from Kota Kinabalu to Sandakan and from Sandakan to
Tawau are only about 220 and 230 miles, respectively. The importance of the
port at Labuan, a small offshore island, will depend upon ,he success of the
new free trade zone being developed there, the possible establishment of oil
and gas-based industries, and the decline in traffic when Brunei's nearby
port of Muara becomes operational.
1.14      At present, there are seven ports under the jurisdiction of the
Sabah Ports Authority (SPA). However, over 90% of the cargo (except logs
which are loaded from roadsteads) passes through the ports of Kota Kinabalu,
Sandakan and Tawau. New facilities, partially financed under the 1971
Loan 774-MA, have recently been completed at the first two ports. The
proposed project will provide new facilities at Tawau. There are also small
jetties on rivers which are utilized for passenger transportation and com-
modities in areas with no roads. Rivers are also used for floating logs to
coastal loading points.
1.15      SPA is considering construction of an industrial jetty for bulk
cargo at Sapangar Bay about 10 miles north of the Kota Kinabalu port.
Developing Sapangar Bay into an industrial zone must be related to a general
development plan for Kota Kinabalu. Consideration will be given to cost and
convenience of passenger and goods transport between the proposed industrial
zone and the rest of the urban area, and compatibility with existing or
planned land uses. Consultants are undertaking a feasibility study for
the Sabah Government which will be coordinated with a Bank-financed urban
study under the Third Highway Project.
Air Transport
1.16      Air transport is vital for connecting Sabah with the rest of
Malaysia and neighboring countries, as well as for internal communications.
The Malaysian Airline System (MAS) offers daily Boeing 737 service between
Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu. MAS and foreign carriers also operate direct
routes between Sabah and Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Inter-
nally, MAS has a fleet of seven Fokker F27-500 and four Britten Norman
Islander (BNI) aircraft, exclusively servicing Sabah and Sarawak. In Sabah,
five airports are served daily:  Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau, Lahad Datu
and Labuan. Kota Kinabalu and Labuan accommodate jet aircraft, while the
others receive the Fokkers. Another six minor airports are served by the



- 4 -
BNIs. Passenger traffic, now over 500,000 passengers p.a., has doubled since
1970. With the presently limited road network, civil aviation will continue
to play an important role in connecting the east and west coasts with each
other and with remote interior locations.
Transport Policy Planning and Coordination
1.17      The 1968 General Transport Survey which reviewed all aspects of
transport plaaning in Malaysia, identified investment requirements up to
1975. For Sabah, the study emphasized development of roads and reconstruc-
tion of the ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan. The recommendations have
generally been followed with the recently completed construction of two
ports. With riegard to roads, the Sabah government has embarked upon a
reconstruction and upgrading program with Bank financing under the Third
Highway Project.
1.18      In 1976 a master plan for the development of Sabah ports was com-
pleted for SPA by their consultants Posford, Pavry and Partners (UK). The
report recommends the early expansion of Tawau port facilities. Further
expansion at Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan is recommended for a later date.
1.19      Transport coordination will not be a major problem in Sabah.  Once
the west coast road from Papar to Beaufort is reconstructed under the Third
Highway Project, railway service will be phased out between Papar and Beaufort.
When this phastsout is completed the only remaining issue of modal competition
will be between roads and minor ports.  The closure of Semporna port is
expected in 1979 (para. 2.31) and the role of other small ports will be
resviewed as the road network grows. Some short distance passenger traffic
will be divertted from air transport to roads as the latter are improved
(e.g., between Lahad Datu and Tawau after the east coast road is reconstructed,
aLso under the Third Highway Project).
1.20      Until very recently, transport planning in Sabah was rather lim-
it'ed, and left to the individual departments of the Sabah Government dealing
with the various modes; the Sabah Public Works Department (SPWD) was respon-
sible for roads. Roads were built where needed, but inadequate planning led
to an emphasis on maximum road length production rather than on sound engi-
neering and construction standards. Consequently, many roads became impas-
sable during the rainy season, and others required heavy repairs shortly after
construction. Prompted by the economic slump and under pressure from the
Fiederal Government, a Sabah Economic Planning Unit (SEPU) was created in late
1975, modelled on the Federal Economic Planning Unit (FEPU). The SEPU
will help coordinate Sabah's transport development.
II. PORT SUBSECTOR
SPA Organization
2.01      SPA is a quasi-government corporation created by state legislation
in 1967 to provide, maintain and manage port services and facilities in
Sabah. SPA's governing board, appointed by Sabah's Minister of Communications
and Works, comprises a chairman and eight other members, two of whom are



Government representatives; the remainder are traders engaged in imports and
exports, insurance, agriculture and timber. SPA is empowered inter-alia to
fix tariffs, determine terms and conditions of service for its employees,
adopt annual income and expenditure budgets, invest surplus funds, and borrow
money with the consent of the Sabah Minister of Finance. However, the enact-
ment creating z.A also empowers the Sabah Minister of Communications and
Works to give SPA directions on matters which affect the interests of the
State as a whole. In practice this means that major changes in tariffs and
salary scales are subject to concurrence of the Sabah Government. Further-
more, SPA must obtain SEPU approval for major capital expenditures on port
development.  SPA's full-time General Manager, who controls day-to-day
operations, is an experienced port administrator. Chart 18444 shows SPA
organization.
2.02      SPA operates three major ports (Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and Tawau)
and four minor ports (Kudat, Kunak, Lahad Datu and Semporna). Only the port
of Labuan, which is administered by Sabah's Marine Department, remains
outside SPA control. Situated on Labuan island, 120 miles southwest of Kota
Kinabalu, this port is a duty free zone handling mainly transhipment cargo
for the independent Sultanate of Brunei. This traffic is expected to
diminish in the near future when Brunei's port at Muara becomes operational.
Management, Staff, Training
2.03      Management is generally satisfactory, but there remains a need to
strengthen certain aspects, especially the capability for development of
economic policies and investment planning. Recognizing this situation,
SPA has proposed that a management study be carried out by consultants to
improve the role of the Management Services Department in traffic forecast-
ing and commercial activities. SPA also requires consultancy assistance to
improve traffic operation control techniques and documentation. A feasibi-
lity study is also required to devise and help implement a suitable multi-
shift system at major ports. These studies (which will take about one year)
are included in the proposed project, and terms terms of reference have been
approved by SPA and the Bank. Finally, SPA's engineering department requires
additional experienced staff to assist in administering large civil projects
and to improve mechanical maintenance services.   This was evident during the
First Port Project when difficulties in retaining foreign consultant
engineering staff resulted in SPA augmenting their staff with expatriates
under contract in order for SPA to assume project supervision responsibilities
for the remainder of the project work. SPA has agreed to assign regular and
supernumerary staff to consulting engineers on site and to the consulting
engineers' headquarters during the proposed project. Training in mechanical
plant and equipment maintenance will be undertaken at training centers in
Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan or Peninsular Malaysia. The proposed loan provides
for Bank financing of the foreign exchange costs of this training.
2.04      The Federal Government has approved in principle the establishment
of a National Ports Council to coordinate port development planning and staff
training for all Malaysian ports. It is envisaged that a national ports
training center would eventually be set up in Peninsular Malaysia. SPA's
current training requirements are met by the ad hoc assignment of staff to



- 6 -
Peninsular Malaysia ports for on the job training; formal training is
conducted at local vocational and trade schools, the Institute of Technology
in Kuala Lumpur, and at the Port of Singapore Authority Training Center.
2.05       Salaries per employee (excluding management) range from about M$200
to M$1,100 per month, in line with State Government pay scales. Management
starting salaries, particularly for professionally qualified accountants and
engineers are currently lower than comparable private sector enterprises,
creating difficulties in attracting and retaining personnel. However, the
State Government assured the Bank that improved salary scales will be
iimplemented later this year.
Existing Port Facilities in Tawau (Map 13393)
2.06      Tawau is located at the northern entrance to Cowie Bay, which forms
a deep natural anchorage between the mainland and Sebatik Island. It is
completely protected, except from infrequent easterly winds. Minimum water
dapth at the entrance is 48 ft which causes no practical draught restraint to
shipping.  Tides range from 2.3 ft at mean neap tides, to 8.2 ft at mean
spring tides. The waters of the bay are silt-laden, but currents of 2-3
knots are recorded on the charts and there appears to be little siltation
except as caused by obstructions.  The bay serves as an anchorage for vessels
loading timber logs and woodchips.
2.07      The existing general cargo quay, constructed by SPA in 1961,
consists of a jettyhead 650 ft long x 40 ft wide, reached by an approach
jetty 200 ft long x 40 ft wide. A dolphin with catwalk at each end gives
an effective berthing length of 750 ft. A ramp in shallow water near the
shore end of the approach jetty is used for loading and unloading coastal
roll-on/roll-off vessels and heavy equipment.
2.08      The 650 ft long outer berth has a depth of 20 ft below Lowest Low
Water Ordinary Spring Tide (LLWOST) at its upstream end, decreasing to about
15 ft below LLWOST at the downstream end. The 575 ft long inner berth has a
depth of 5 ft below LLWOST. Much of this is almost dry at low water, and
local craft must arrive during high water; their hulls sit on the bottom
during much of the tidal cycle. The rate of siltation around the jetty is
estimated at 1.7 ft per year, due in part to reclamation for urban development
east of the port. Extensive dredging was carried out in early 1977 to
restore necessary depth alongside the outer berth. A recently completed
siltation study indicates that the seaward limits of urban development
reclamation should be restricted (see para. 3.12 [d]). Siltation around the
proposed berths is not expected to exceed 1.25 ft per year, involving about
4,500 cu m annual dredging.
2.09      The concrete jetty deck is in reasonably good condition but there
is considerable spalling of the precast concrete pile-heads, where they
join the underside of the deck platform, exposing the reinforcing steel. No
underwater inspiection has been undertaken, but it appears that the spalling
is limited to the area above water level. Timber fendering on the outer
berth is in reasonable condition, but that on the inner berth is in a poor



state of repair. M$250,000 (US$102,000) is included in the proposed project
for necessary repairs to the quay. The jetty is not designed to accept the
concentrated loads associated with today's cargo handling equipment. Neverthe-
less, after project completion, this facility will still be used for small
ships and light general cargo loads until it is replaced, in concurrence
with the Bank (para. 6.02 [a]).
2.10      Two adjoining transit sheds, with a total storage area of
44,000 sq ft are located on land behind the quay. Their concrete floors are
on different levels, but several short ramps provide mutual access. The open
stacking area consists of about 43,000 sq ft of bitumen-surfaced pavement.
An additional eight acres has recently been reclaimed by filling in a former
enclosed dock basin, and SPA is now surfacing this area for open storage
and truck parking.
2.11      SPA occupies a single-story semipermanent building alongside one of
the sheds, with an area of 800 sq ft. The existing temporary immigration
office is a single story timber structure to the east of the sheds; a new
permanent office is nearing completion at the east end of the reclaimed area.
The Marine Department and Customs share a two-story concrete framed building
located next to the existing port entrance. The Marine Department also
utilizes a small control tower.
2.12      SPA's existing cargo handling equipment at Tawau consists of
25 forklifts, 10 towing tractors, 50 trailers and one 10-T mobile crane. Of
the existing fleet, some 19 forklifts and 7 tractors have reached the end of
their useful life; the cost of replacement is included in the proposed
project. SPA presently does not have any workshop to adequately service and
maintain its mechanized plant and equipment. This will be provided under the
proposed project.
2.13      An oil jetty, built in 1973, is located two miles upstream of the
general cargo quay.
Traffic
2.14      SPA traffic statistics from 1973 to 1977 are given in Table 2.1.
During the period total imports grew 6.3% p.a., from 1.12 to 1.40 million
tons; while exports increased by 5% p.a. from 5.37 to 7.12 million tons.
Excepting timber logs, exports including processed timber increased by nearly
10% p.a. Timber log exports increased from 6.23 million tons in 1976 to 6.65
in 1977. However a downward trend is expected in future as more timber
processing plants are established in Sabah (see para. 2.16).
2.15      Traffic forecasts from 1978 to 1983 are given in Table 2.2.  They
take into account major agricultural and forestry exports, including the
extent to which they will be locally processed prior to shipment; import
needs of these industries including fertilizers, machinery and construction
materials; and consumer goods imports.



- 8 -
2.16      Timber log exports are forecast to decline by 2 million tons (or
about 35%) by 1983, while other exports are expected to increase by 333,000
tons (or 70%) during the same period. Logs are loaded on ships at anchor,
other exports pass mainly over SPA wharves.   Imports are projected to
increase by about 50% (6.75% p.a.) between 1977 and 1983.
2.17      At the port of Tawau, timber logs are forecast to decline at a
slower rate (about 30% by 1983) because exploitation of timber started later
here than at other areas, and timber reserves near Tawau are large. Other
exports are expected to grow by 125%, mainly as a result of increased proces-
sing of timber and stepped up cocoa and palm oil exports. Imports are
projected to increase by about 60% (8% p.a.) by 1983. Detailed forecasts
for Tawau (by commodity) for 1978 to 1986 are given in Table 2.3.
Operations
2.18       SPA is in charge of all cargo handling operations, port mainte-
nance, administration and security. With the exception of cargo handling
equipment drivers, transit shed and warehouse clerical staff and tally
clerks, most SPA ports do not directly employ operational labor. At Tawau
and Lahad Datu SPA directly employs wharf labor and hires stevedores on a
daily basis from contractors. Other SPA ports contractually hire both types
of labor. Labor works a single shift of three parts, 7:30 am to 11:30 am,
1:00 pm to 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm depending upon traffic. Arrange-
ments are occasionally made for work beyond 10:00 pm; overtime rates are paid
beyond 5:00 pm. Relations between SPA and its employees are good, and no
work stoppages have occurred since SPA assumed control of the ports.
2.19      To ease congestion ad hoc multi-shift working arrangements were
introduced in 1974 at Kota Kinabalu. The scheme was discontinued in 1975 as
traffic declined. When traffic again increased in 1976, opening of the
new berths rendered shift work unnecessary. SPA appreciates the need for more
intensive use of new and better designed facilities, both at Kota Kinabalu
and Sandakan, to achieve lower operating unit costs and postpone the next
expansion phase at these ports. A study to devise and operate a suitable form
of multishift system will be undertaken for SPA by consultants. The latter
will also review traffic control and documentation procedures at all ports
and assist SPA in establishing operational performance indicators and targets.
Foreign exchange costs for these stud-es a-e included in the proposed project.
2.2')     Most cargo is moved from the hold by ship's gear.  However, mobile
cranes are also used on request of the ship's agent.  Cargo stored in sheds
or on open storage areas can remain in port for three days free of charge.
Penalty charges are then levied to induce consignees to remove their goods
promptly. SPA may also transfer non-delivered cargo to warehouse storage and
charge consignees for removal costs.



-9-
2.21      Due to physical constraints, cargo operations at Tawau have always
been slower and less efficient than SPA's other major ports. The jetty and
its approach road are narrow and there are not enough covered and open
storage areas, nor parking space for trucks to move cargo between private
warehouses and the ships' side. In 1977, 298,000 tons of general cargo moved
across the existing wharf. Berth occupancy is high and ship waiting time
during 1976 totalled 276 days. In 1981, when the proposed project would be
fully completed, general cargo is expected to reach 442,000 tons. By January
1981, civil works should be sufficiently advanced to permit partial use of
the new wharf for cargo operations, which will minimise congestion. In the
meantime an ad hoc shift system may be tried, but only minimal success can be
expected, given the lack of storage space until 1981, so until then, ship
waiting time will increase substantially probably triggering the imposition
of a freight surcharge by shipping companies.
2.22      Gang productivity at Tawau for conventional general (including
automobiles) and pre-palletized cargo are low, averaging 17.3 and 24.3
revenue tons per gang hour worked, respectively, compared with Kota Kinabalu,
where new Bank financed wharves recently became operational and productivity
rose from 19.1 and 39, to 21 and 43 revenue tons per gang hour, respectively.
Similar improvement can be expected at Tawau when the proposed project is
completed. Pre-palletized cargo, accounting for about one third of Tawau's
wharf traffic, is expected to grow to about 45% by 1983. Direct deliveries
at ships' side, with consignees and exporters providing their own labor and
trucks, account for nearly 50% of wharf cargo. This has become a normal
practice in all SPA ports, in part as a result of limited transit shed space.
2.23      Existing port facilities are also used for passenger ferry opera-
tions, consisting of four trips daily between Tawau and Sebatik Island.
Seventy-six thousand passengers used the service in 1976/77. No accurate
records exist prior to 1975 when a ferry disaster occurred, but the Marine
Department estimates that 46,000 persons were carried in 1971/72 indicating
an average growth rate of 10.5% annually. Passenger ferries use inner
berths only. Traffic is unregulated, unsafe, conducive to pilferage,
interferes with port cargo and customs operations and earns no revenue for
SPA. As cargo traffic grows, the hazards associated with passenger traffic
will intensify, and SPA agrees that a new location is necessary for passen-
gers. The State Government has agreed to move passenger traffic to another
acceptable location by no later than December 31, 1979 (para. 6.01[a]). This
move is not expected to involve SPA in any capital expenditure.
2.24      The Marine Department of Sabah's Ministry of Transport is respon-
sible for maritime and navigational operations including tugs and pilotage,
communication with vessels at sea, lighthouses and other navigational aids.
The Federal Customs Department carries out all customs activities within the
port but has no control over transit sheds and cargo handling areas.  Their
working hours are adjusted to meet port needs. Good working relations
prevail between SPA and the Marine and Customs Department.



- 10 -
Tariffs and Costs
2.25      Tariffs for all SPA ports are generally cost based and regulated
by SEA subject to,Sabah Government concurrence.  In February 1976 SPA's
revenues increased by about 10% p.a., when advantage was taken of the intro-
duction of the metric system by applying SPA's tariffs to lower cargo weights
and measurements. The first planned tariff revision since SPA's creation
occurred in July 1977. Substantial selective increases were made to offset
the effects of inflation, resulting in an overall increase in revenue of 60%
p.a. A comparison of pre and post July 1977 tariffs is given in Table 2.4.
The revision should enable SPA to earn satisfactory profits until about
mid-1980, when increases equivalent to 15% across the board wi-Ll be necessary
to maintain an adequate financial return until at least 1983.
2.26      SPA's level of operating costs is satisfactory.  The operating
ratio was 71 in 1977 and is not expected to rise above 72 (in 1980) when a
further tariff increase and additional revenue from traffic growth will
reduce the ratio to the upper 60's through 1983.
Budget, Accounting, and Audit
2.27      SPA prepares detailed annual operating and investment budgets.
Monthly statements for management compare budgeted and actual results, and
give reasons for variances. SPA management has adequate flexibility in
reallocating budget funds, and need only seek board approval for major
revisions. The budgets are not subject to Sabah Government approval except
that port development items must first be approved by SEPU and included in
Sabah's Five Year Plan.
2.28      SPA's accounting and costing systems were improved with the aid of
consultants in 1974. Ample detail is now given in annual accolnts and the
costing system enables the profitability of each port service to be promptly
ascertained. SPA intends to have consultants study the feasibility of
introducing mechanised data processing to provide operational and financial
data for management and to handle payroll, billing and other procedures.
The cost of this study is included in the proposed project.
2.29      In accordance with a requirement of the First Sabah Plorts Project
that SPA retain auditors satisfactory to the Bank, a local firn of chartered
accountants (with international association) have been auditing SPA's commer-
cial accounts since 1973. Prior to 1973 the audit was conducted by the local
branch of an international firm. Apart from routine qualifying remarks on
income tax liability and contingent liabilities for contractors' claims in
the 1976 accounts, all audit certificates have been clean. SPA has reaffirmed
that audited accounts for 1978 and thereafter will be submitted to the Bank
within six months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 6.02[b|).
2.30      SPA's internal audit division currently reports to the Chief
Accountant, which means the executive officer in charge of day--to-day
accounting also controls the audit of these transactions. This procedure
is to be changed later this year by having the Internal Audit Chief report
directly to the General Manager.



- 11 -
Uneconomic Ports
2.31      Semporna, one of SPA' four minor ports, situated about 70 miles
east of Tawau, has been incurring annual losses on jetty operations ranging
from M$74,000 to M$371,000. Despite the tariff revision in 1977, -uture
losses of about M$90,000 a year can be expected if no action is taken. As
ships use the jetty only once or twice each year, and a satisfactory con-
necting road exists to Tawau, SPA has agreed to close shore facilities at
Semporna, by no later than December 31, 1979, (para 6.02[c]. The anchorage
will continue to be used by vessels for the loading of timber.
III. INVESTMENT PLAN AND PROJECT
SPA's Investment Plan (1978-1980)
3.01      SPA's current Investment Plan extends only to 1980, the last
year of the State Third Malaysia Plan. Apart from minor items totalling
M$3.5 million, SPA's Plan provides for payment of retention monies and
contractors' claims for the completed Bank-financed port project at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan, and two new projects: the proposed Tawau project and
the provision of bulk cargo handling facilities at Sapangar Bay (para 1.15).
Financial provisions in the Plan are:
US$ million
M$ million    equivalent
Completion of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan
Projects                                     23.00           9.39
Tawau Development                              46.23           18.87
Sapangar Bay Development                       20.00           8.16
Minor Projects                                   3.50           1.43
Total                                     92.73          37.85
3.02      The sums provided for completion of the Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan
projects and for Sapangar Bay development should be adequate. The provision
for Tawau expansion, however, is based on 1976 estimates which have been
revised in the course of this appraisal. SPA will rephase investment
expenditure for Tawau to extend payments into 1982. Revised costs of the
proposed project are given in para. 3.08.
3.03      Port development at Sapangar Bay is intended to provide a jetty for
bulk liquid cargo such as petroleum products and palm oil. These products
are presently handled over the old Kota Kinabalu wharf. The wharf is struc-
turally weak and likely to become unusable by 1986. Furthermore, petroleum



- 12 -
product storage tanks, located adjacent to the city and the new port, consti-
tute a safety haazard.  This was dramatized in 1972 when fire broke out at the
installation.
3.04      With good depths up to 50 feet and good sheltering, Sapangar Bay is
i,leal for navigation.  SPA envisions reclaiming about 50 acres of land at the
site for use as an industrial zone. However, development is being studied in
more detail: Posford, Pavry and Partners (UK), consultants, are undertaking
a detailed feasibility study for Sabah Government, the results of which
are expected by about September 1978. Project completion by 1980, which the
SPA Plan assumies, is therefore unlikely. SPA expects to receive a long-term
loan from the Sabah Government to finance the foreign exchange costs of this
project.
The Project and the Proposed Loan
3.05      At Tawau, the proposed project would provide berths and ancillary
services sufficient (together with the existing wharf) to meet the port's
needs until about 1990.  Space exists for the addition of future extensions.
The project is based on consultant recommendations, as amended following
Bank review which considered five schemes, three of which were substantially
more expensive but failed to provide adequate compensatory benefits. One
aLternative scheme was slightly cheaper than the proposed one.  However, it
provided 355 fl: less berthing space, involved longer hauls for cargo between
ship and shed, and would only meet Tawau's traffic needs up to 1983, i.e.
two years after completion.  The proposed project is included in the Federal
Government's Third Malaysia Plan.
Description of the Main Project Items
3.06 (a)  Civil Works (Map 13394)
Civil works comprise the following:
(i) construction of a reinforced concrete-piled wharf (500 ft
long and 300 ft wide), with an upstream piled extension (500 ft
x 80 ft);
(ii)  reclamation, surfacing and paving of approximately 10 acres
for storage;
(iii)  construction of a new transit shed (50,000 sq ft floor area)
located on the piled wharf;
(iv)  provision of an office, a vehicle maintenance facility, ancillary
buildings, gates, fencing, internal roads and utilities;
(v) repairs to the existing wharf; and
(vi)  construction of a 750 ft long 75 ft wide access road linking
the port to North Road. Design and construction will be under-
taken by SPWD and financed by the Sabah Government.



- 13 -
(b) Cargo Handling Equipment
Procurement of mechanized cargo handling equipment for the new port
expansion at Tawau, and replacement equipment for the ports of Kota
Kina alu, Sandakan and Tawau. Details are provided in Table 3.2.
(c) Engineering Services
(i)  site investigations and studies to determine siltation rates,
ground conditions, hydrography, topography and location of
suitable hydraulic sand filling;
(ii) engineering services for design and supervision of the above
civil works.
(d) Technical Assistance
Provision of technical assistance and training needs for SPA staff
in engineering and port planning, and vehicle and equipment
maintenance; and management consultancy assistance for SPA in
the following fields:
(i)  improvement of traffic operation and control techniques and
documentation;
(ii) improvement of planning and commercial activities of the
management services department;
(iii) feasibility studies for the introduction of a multishift wharf
operational system and mechanised data processing at major SPA
ports.
(iv) feasibility studies for the expansion of Kota Kinabalu and
Sandakan; and
(v)  revaluation of SPA's fixed assets.
3.07      The proposed wharf at Tawau will provide an outer berth of 1,000 ft
at a service depth of 32 ft LLWOST; and an inner berth of 500 ft at a service
depth of 25 ft LLWOST. The berth will be designed to accept a container
handling crane in the future. The transit shed, located on the wharf and
closer to the ship's side, will provide for faster storage of transit cargo
at short-haul distance. About 10 acres of land will be reclaimed with sand-
fill immediately behind the wharf apron. The fill will be contained by a
coral and rock-faced bund supported on piles. The reclaimed area will
be serviced with roads, surfaced for open storage, car and lorry parks and
be the site for offices and ancillary buildings. The siltation study and
site investigations will provide final design criteria for the proposed
works.

Cost Estimates
3.08      Total cost of the project is estimated at M$ 63.7 million (US$26.0
million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$14.6 million,
of which US$13 million would be covered by the proposed loan. Details of
project cost estimates are given in Table 3.1 and summarized below.

3.09      Cost estimates for civil works are based on preliminary designs
and unit prices for ongoing similar works in Malaysia; those for mechan-
ical equipment are based on recent purchases. Estimates are in late 1977
prices, and include price escalation and physical contingencies over the
project period. Physical contingencies of 15% have been included for civil
works items in the project. Price contingencies are included for all pro-
curement items; assumed price increases are 9% annually in 1978/79 and 8% in
1980-82 for civil works; and 7.5% annually in 1978/79 and 7% in 1980-82 for
cargo handling equipment. The foreign exchange cost for technical assis-
tance includes fees, estimated at US$6,000 per man-month, and airfares.
LDcal costs include subsistence allowances.

Financing Plan
3.10      Financing of the project, estimated at US26.00 million equivalent
with a foreign currency component of US$14.60 million, will be met as follows:

3.11       Siltation studies and additional soil borings, which were completed
in April 1978, confirm siting of the proposed Tawau port expansion layout.
It is proposed that the foreign exchange cost of these and other necessary
site investigations and consultant services estimated at US$170,000, be
retroactively financed from the proposed Bank loan.
Project Implementation
3.12       The project will be carried out by SPA, assisted by consulting
engineers acceptable to the Bank upon terms and conditions, including pro-
vision for training engineering personnel nominated by SPA, satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 6.02[d]). In addition, for effective implementation of the
proposed project at Tawau, the Sabah Government has agreed to:
(a) vest in SPA, by no later than December 31, 1978 about three
acres of land adjacent to the existing foreshore, needed for
port extension and to enable the civil works contractor to begin
mobilization at site (para. 6.01 [b]);
(b) reserve about 10 acres of land adjacent to the new port area for
future port use by 1990 (para. 6.01 [b]);
(c) construct, by no later than December 31, 1980, an access road link-
ing the new port facilities with North Road (para. 6.01 [c]);



- 16 -
Procurement and Disbursement
(d) restrict further reclamation east of the port to the existing
seaward limit to avoid increasing siltation at existing and pro-
posed port facilities (para. 6.01 [d]).
3.13      All civil works except for the access road would be executed under
one civil engineering contract, which would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines. The
Government intends to levy import duties on items procured for the project.
3.14      The works are expected to be completed by the third quarter of
1931, assuming effectiveness of the proposed loan by October I, 1978.
However, about 500 ft of wharf should be available for berthing ships and
cargo operations by January 1, 1981. The construction schedule shown in
Chart 18445 has been approved by SPA and the Bank.
3.15      Disbursement for civil works would be on the basis of 58% of total
costs and 100% of total costs for consulting services, technical assistance
and training. Retroactive financing is proposed from December 1, 1977 in an
aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of $170,000 in respect of a
siLtation study, necessary site investigations and consultant services at
Tawau.  Disbursements by the Bank are expected to be completed by September 30,
1982.  The estimated schedule of quarterly disbursements is given in
Table 3.3, and is based on the assumption that the proposed loan would
become effective by October 1, 1978.
Ecology
3.]6      None of the proposed works will affect the existing ecology of the
harbor; dredged material, if any, will be disposed of at an approved location.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
General
4.0)1     The Tawau region is an economic enclave with no paved roads to any
part of Sabah beyond Lahad Datu. This geographical isolation results in a
limited market, with short distances betw en the port and inland origins and
destinations of port cargo.
4.02      The Tawau port consists of a general cargo wharf, liquid bulk jetty
ancl anchorage facilities. Past traffic data (Table 2.1) indicate an average
annual growth in over-the-wharf traffic of 8-1/2% (from 218,000 tons in 1973
to 298,000 tons in 1977). During the same period, traffic over the SPA
pet:roleum and palm oil jetty increased from 38,000 tons to over 123,000 tons.
Anchorage operations - mostly log and woodchip shipments - rose from
1.5  million tons in 1973 to 2.2 million tons in 1977.



- 17 -
4.03      During the 12 months ending June 30, 1977, 297 vessels averaging
1,800 gross registered tons (GRT) used the Tawau general cargo wharf. Of these,
55% were tramp and 45% (30% of which were national flag) were liner ships.
During the same period 100 ships averaging 2,800 GRT used the bulk cargo
jetty, and 703 ships averaging 4,200 GRT loaded timber in the stream.
4.04       Imports account for 79% of total wharf traffic.  They include a
wide variety of general cargo shipped in relatively small consignments from
nearby national and Southeast Asian ports. Agricultural products - rubber,
cocoa, copra and palm kernels - are the principal exports over the wharf.
4.05      Direct deliveries at ships' side account for 81% of exports and
nearly 50% of total wharf cargo. The share represented by palletized cargo
has grown from one fourth in 1973 to one third in 1977. Increased palleti-
zation has improved port productivity, but the continued high rate of direct
deliveries has led to congestion at the wharf.
4.06       A detailed commodity and facility forecast is presented in
Table 2.3. Total port traffic will show no change during the 1977-86 period
as a decline in the volume of anchorage operations will be offset by a growth
in traffic using SPA port facilities. SPA wharf traffic will increase
from 298,000 tons to 756,000 tons (i.e., by 10.8% annually), while SPA oil
jetty traffic will grow by 9.5% annually. Traffic projections beyond 1986
were made only for traffic across the wharf, the facility to be improved.
Traffic is expected to reach 1.016 million tons by 1991 and continue to grow
thereafter.
4.07       Agricultural export projections are based on ongoing and approved
Government, estate and smallholder planting programs. Totals for logs assume
continuation of the Government policy of bringing log exports to sustainable
levels by mid-1980, with a concurrent increase in local processing prior to
shipment. Processed timber exports show a substantial increase during the
1977-86 period, with most products being shipped directly from the
manufacturers' waterfront facilities.
4.08       Import projections were prepared separately for agricultural and
industrial inputs (fertilizer, cement and construction materials and heavy
equipment), major staple foods (rice and sugar) and consumer goods. Agricul-
tural and industrial input projections took account of regional forestry
and agricultural development programs and projects. Population growth,
changes in diet and import substitution were considered in projecting staple
food imports. Effective demand for imported consumer goods was estimated
by adjusting population and per capita income growth for the elasticity of
import demand. A further adjustment was made to reflect the long-term effect
on per capita incomes of export commodity price movements and increased local
ownership of productive assets. Resulting traffic forecasts were adjusted
in the later years for land transport diverted by the intercoastal highway
construction program.

4.09      Port traffic projections, particularly for the wharf, will depend
largely on the Scbah Government's ability to implement its timber policies.
If t:he pace of industrialization lags, exports of timber products will be
lower and log exports will be higher than projected. The delay in indus-
tralization may also affect capacity to import and so reduce imports across
the wharf. Traff-ic projections reflecting low processed ti,iber growth show
total wharf tonnage at only about 700,000 in 1991, reaching 1 million tons by
2001 (see para. 4.19).
Benefits and Economic Return
4.10      Ships serving the port of Tawau experienced congestion in 1976
and 1977. Increasing delays were also encountered by trucks serving the
port. The situation will further deteriorate if port traffic increases as
projected in this report without the proposed facilities.
4.11      To meet: anticipated traffic growth, SPA has asked the Bank to
finance the foreign exchange component of a port expansion project. If this
is not possible, the next best alternative would be to supplement existing
wharf operations with lighterage facilities. The nearby ports of Kunak and
Semporna (50 miles) and Lahad Datu (100 miles) are unsuitable alternatives
because of inadequate wharf facilities and high trucking costs. To do
nothing would mean a severe reduction in foreign trade, the negative reper-
cussions of which cannot be measured. Therefore, a simple "with-and-without"
comparison was not possible. Such a comparison would have shown substantially
higher, but spuri.ous benefits.  Accordingly, the methodology compares the
project with the next most economic alternative.
4.12      The cost benefit analysis presented herein (detailed in Tables 4.1
through 4.8) compares the project, including the existing wharf, with a
lighterage scheme including the existing wharf.
4.13      Quantif-iable benefits attributed to the proposed project, which is
expected to become partly operational in January 1981 and fully completed by
late 1981, consist of:
(a)  avoidance of the cost of lighterage facilities, including lighters,
service craft, shore cranes, wharves and their operation and
maintenance;
(b) a decrease in cargo losses due to lighterage operations;
(c) lower cargo handling costs;
(d)  reduction in ship waiting time; and
(e) reduction in ship turnaround time.
These benefits are described in paras 4.14-4.17 below.



- 19 -
(a) Avoidance of the Cost of Lighterage Facilities
4.14      Projected growth in wharf traffic between 1976 and 1980 will
accelerate port congestion by raising ship waiting time from 276 days to over
3,000 days, and resulting costs from US$0.6 million to US$6.2 million. If
nothing is done to alleviate this problem, estimated ship waiting time by
1981 will exceed 14,000 days and cost $29 million. Without the proposed
project, lighterage facilities would be needed to avoid this cost. An
initial lighterage system would consist of 20 lighters, 12 lighter berths,
12 mobile cranes, service craft, a transit shed and an equipment workshop
requiring a total investment of about US$9 million. Additional lighterage
investment and operational costs would be incurred in subsequent years to
accommodate further traffic growth. SPA's experience in 1975, when lighters
were used to reduce congestion at Kota Kinabalu, indicates that long-term
leasing of lighters is not a viable alternative.
(b) Cargo Loss Due to Lighterage Operations
4.15      Cargo damage, a normal feature of lighterage operations, is esti-
mated at 0.25% of the value of nonpetroleum cargo imports. Petroleum imports
and exports (rubber, kernel, timber, etc.) are homogeneous products less
susceptible to damage through handling. Since the value of nonpetroleum
cargo imports is M$1246 per ton, cargo damage is estimated at M$3.10 per ton.
Lightered cargo subject to damage is 'expected to rise from 73,000 tons in
1981 to 340,000 tons in 1991, with annual losses increasing from US$92,000
to US$430,000. Cargo losses due to pilferage are insignificant at present,
but the 1975 experience at Kota Kinabalu shows that these would rise
substantially during lighterage operations. SPA officials believe that such
losses would be 25% higher in Tawau because of nearby international borders.
At least 1% of certain general cargo imports such as high value canned foods,
beverages and manufactured products handled by lighters would be lost due to
pilferage. Assuming that the unit value of such general cargo is about 20%
more than that of nonpetroleum imports, a per ton value of M$1,500 and per
ton loss of M$15 appears reasonable. Detailed estimates of pilferage and
damage loss savings are given in Table 4.4.
(c) Cargo Handling Savings
4.16      The proposed project will avoid double handling costs inherent in
lighterage operations. Resulting savings are estimated at US$209,000 in the
first full year of operation (1982) and are projected to rise to US$747,000
in 1991. Details are given in Table 4.5 and the cost of different types of
cargo handling operations are compared in Table 4.6.
(d) Ship Waiting Time Savings
4.17      It is assumed that, without the proposed project, SPA would
maintain ship waiting time at the 1976 level (276 days) by increasing the
lighterage fleet and lighter berths as traffic grows. It was found that



- 20 -
lighterage system costs needed to reduce waiting time below 276 days would
exceed the savings therefrom. The proposed project will reduce ship waiting
time in 1982 to 74 days; thereafter, waiting time will increase with traffic
growth. By 1992, the resulting costs will be large enough to justify
construction of an extension to the proposed project. However, for the
purposes of caLculating economic benefits of the proposed project, traffic
levels and ship waiting time costs after 1991 are maintained at the 1991
level. Details are given in Table 4.7.
(e) Ship Turnaround Time Savings
4. 18     The present weighted (conventional and palletized cargo) product-
ivrity of wharf labor in Tawau is 18.8 revenue tons per gang hour. Based on
the results of Bank-financed port improvements at Kota Kinabalu (para 2.22),
this should increase to 21.7 revenue tons per gang hour with the project.
Further increases in cargo handling productivity are expected from the
continuing trend toward palletization, stimulated by the proposed port
improvements.   No ship turnaround time savings are expected in 1981, as the
partial use of new facilities and continued construction activity in the port
area will nullify productivity gains in that year. In 1982, however,
aggregate ship turnaround time will be reduced to 108 days, and future
savings will rise in proportion to wharf traffic growth.  Detailed estimates
of ship turnaround time savings, based on an average ship time in port value
of US$2,000 per day, show that annual savings will rise from US$216,000 in
the first year of the completed project to $466,000 in 1991 when project
facilities are fully utilized (Table 4.8). Ship waiting time and turnaround
time were simultaneously calculated using a port simulation model.
4.19       The economic return on the basic traffic forecast is 24%.  In
addition to this return, a return was calculated on the reduced projections
described in para. 4.09. Under this alternative, lighterage and other costs
do not rise as rapidly, but are sufficiently large so that the proposed
project remains viable. The returns are shown below, following para. 4.20.
Sensitivity and Risks
4.20      Sensitivity of the economic rate of return has been tested for
higher project costs and lower project benefits. Results of the sensitivity
analysis, summarized below, show the project is economically viable even
under these conditions.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
General
5.01      The First Ports Project at Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, partly
financed by Loan 774-MA has already cost about M$86 million due to unexpected
worldwide cost increases since 1972; the appraisal (1971) estimate was M$67
million. Contractors are claiming a further MS$ 24 million for material
price variations, time lost and currency fluctuation losses. SPA disputes
these claims, but a compromise settlement is expected to result. For finan-
cial projection purposes it has been assumed that SPA will meet claims to the
extent of M$16 million. In this event, total project cost will be about
M$102 million, 52% higher than estimated at the time of appraisal (see footnote).
5.02      SPA was able to meet local cost overruns of the project from
internally generated resources, and has received a Federal Government loan
to cover increased foreign exchange costs.
5.03      Loan 774-MA requires SPA to achieve a 7% rate of return on net
fixed assets in use; a rate which was determined in 1971 by relating forecasts
of SPA's cash needs to anticipated net asset values. In view of the actual
cost of SPA's new assets at Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan a 7% rate of return is
now considered excessive; a rate revision is discussed in paras. 5.21 and
5.22.
5.04      Past and future financial performances of the project port of Tawau
will next be examined, followed by consolidated results for all SPA ports.
Past and Future Financial Performance - Tawau

/a Excluding anchorage operations revenue.
5.06      Projected revenues are based on traffic forecasts in Table 2.3,
which assumes a 15% tariff increase on July 1, 1980 for all services except
anchorage. Forecast operating expenses allow for a 5% annual rate of infla-
tion (the rate prevailing in Sabah during 1976 and 1977). Should inflation
exceed this rate, the 1980 tariff increase would have to be greater than 15%.
Operating expenses also provide for labor force increases relative to traf-
fic growth. Staff costs take into account a recent salary award. Deprecia-
tion charges are equivalent to about 3% of gross fixed assets, excluding
land.
5.07       Forecast operating expenses do not provide for any additional
costs which may be incurred if ad hoc shift working occurs in 1980/81. SPA
would pass these costs on to shipowners, who would accept them rather than
suffer chronic delay. In turn, shipowners would probably impose a surcharge
on freight rates until congestion was fully alleviated by the project.
5.08      The projections show very satisfactory results.  Operating ratios
range between 54 and 65, and loan interest is covered even without taking
into account anchorage operations revenue. Debt service (except for 1982) is
covered by Tawau's own resources. In 1982, the first full year of operations
under the proposed project, a 6.5% rate of return is expected; a return in
excess of 7% can be anticipated thereafter. No income tax liability for
Tawaiu has been included in these projections. The question of tax liability
is further discussed in paras. 5.21 and 5.22.

Past SPA Consolidated Financial Performances
5.09      SPA's consolidated income statements for the years 1973-77,
detailed in Table 5.3, are summarized below:
1973   1974   1975   1976   1977

5.10      This table indicates that interest charges and total debt service
were adequately covered during the period under review. The required rate of
return was achieved by a wide margin in 1975 and 1976 due to low asset values
prior to completion of the new facilities at Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan.
Operating ratios (80 in 1975 and 79 in 1976) were higher than normal due to
rising operating costs. The situation was normalized in July 1977 when
tariffs were raised.
5.11      SPA' consolidated balance sheets for the year 1973-77, given in
Table 5.4, are summarized below:

5.12      The above table shows that SPA's working capital and debt/equity
ratio position has been satisfactory throughout the period. This ratio
in 1977 is abnormally high due to the receipt by SPA in December 1977 of a
$16.1 million loan from the Federal Government, which will be utilized during
1978 for the settLement of claims arising from the First Ports Project.
Future SPA Consolidated Financial Performance
5.13      Forecast- 1978-83 income accounts for each major port, and
for Trinor ports combined, are given in Table 5.5.  These are summarized
following para. 5.14.
5.14      The forecasts are based on assumptions and data detailed in
Table 5.6. Revenues are based on traffic forecasts in Table 2.2 and assume
a July 1, 1980 tariff increase equivalent to 15% of revenue (excluding
anchorage operations income).  Expenses are based on assumptions previously
outlined in para. 5.06. Overall result s ar- very satisfactory, with operating
ratios ranging between 65 and 71. Interest earned and debt service coverage
ratios are also satisfactory: they do not fall below 3.2 x and 2.0 x,
respectively, during the period under review. The rate of return falls below
7% in 1978 and 1979, due to the high cost of new assets at Kota Kinabalu and
Sandakan (see para. 5.01), and rises in 1980/81 following the July 1980
tarii-f increase. The rate again falls (to about 7%) in 1982/83 when assets
from the proposed Tawau project are taken into SPA's fixed assets in
use.

5.16       Table 5.6 details all assumptions used in the above forecast
balance sheets. Receivables vary with traffic; accounts payable vary with
cash operating costs; fixed assets take into account investments proposed
under SPA's Investment Plan and loans are assumed for foreign exchange
investment costs.
5.17       The above forecasts show a satisfactory financial position for SPA
with current ratios never falling below 2.5x and debt/equity ratios never
exceeding 42/58.
5.18       A consolidated cash flow forecast for 1978-83 is given in
Table 5.8 It includes funds generated by and investment made in all SPA
ports, together with SPA's entire debt commitments. The forecasts are
summarized below for the Tawau project investment period, i.e. 1978-82:

1978-82 investment expenditures from internally generated resources, a very
satisfactory performance.

5.20      In their Master Plan for Development of Sabah Ports, SPA's consul-
tants recommend that further expansion (Phase II) at Kota Kinabalu and
Sandakan should start in 1978.  However, detailed feasibility studies,
including hydrographic surveys and soil investigations, are needed before
designs and tender documents can be prepared. The earliest possible start
would therefore be 1980. Were SPA to introduce multi-shift workinb at both
ports, it is conceivable that a start on further expansion could be delayed
until about 1982; this is assumed in the above forecasts. The growth rate of
timber processing will also affect the timing of further port development.
In 1977, anchorage timber revenues amounted to almost M$10 million, or 34% of
SPA's total operating revenue. By 1983, increased processed timber traffic
over the wharves and a decline in log exports are expected to reduce anchor-
age revenues to M$7.7 million or 16%. Trends in traffic growth should be
constantly reviewed by SPA. The proposed upgrading of SPA's Management
Services Department with consultancy assistance should help in this respect.
5.21      Cash flow forecasts are based on an assumption that federal income
taxes on SPA's net income will not become payable until fiscal 1980. The
Federal Government has already waived income tax through fiscal 1973 in view
of SPA's heavy investment expenditure on development at Kota Kinabalu and
Sandakan ports. SPA has requested a further waiver (through 1976 and hopes
that it will extend to 1980), in view of the continuing need for heavy
capital expenditure in Tawau and Sapangar Bay (a similar waiver has been
granted for Kuching port in the State of Sarawak). In the event that waivers
beyond 1976 are denied, it is estimated that SPA would need to pay about
M$15 million to the Federal Government during the 1978-80 period. The
forecasts indicate that such payments would reduce SPA's current ratio to 1.4
in 1980 which is adequate.
5.22      Under Loan 774-MA, SPA is required to earn a return after taxes of
not less than 7% in 1976 and thereafter, excluding revenue from anchorage
operations. SPA's rate of return during the period 1978-83 with and without
a tax waiver, is estimated below:
1978   1979   1980   1981   1982   1983

- 28 -
In the absence of a tax waiver, tax payable in 1978 through 1980 is expected
to relate almost entirely to anchorage operations, net revenues from along-
side operations being largely offset by capital expenditure allowances. In
1982 and 1983, as annual capital expenditure is reduced, tax on alongside
operations would become payable, reducing SPA's rate of return achieved to
between 5 and 6%. However, should an earlier start be necessary for Phase II
expansion of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, SPA's tax liability and rate of
return in 1981/82 would be materially affected. Consequently it is con-
sidered premature to predetermine a rate of return which SPA should earn
beyond 1981 until the position regarding a tax waiver and the timing and
magnitude of further major port development projects are known. SPA has
agreed to earn not less than 6% in 1978 and 1979; 7% in 1980 and 1981; and,
thereafter, an appropriate  rate of return to be agreed by SPA and the Bank by
no later than December 31, 1981, based on a review of SPA's forecast cash
requirements for the period 1982-85 (para. 6.02 [e]).
5.23      To ensure that an adequate financial position is maintained, SPA has:
(a) reaffirmed not to incur new debt if net revenue falls below 1.75 times
maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year (para 6.02
[f]; and (b) agreed not to incur capital expenditures (other than the
project) exceeding M$ 3 million in any fiscal year without prior consultation
with the Bank (para 6.02[g].   Section 5.06 of Loan 774-MA requires SPA,
upon completion of the project, to periodically review with the Bank its
cash requirements so as to determine SPA's fiscal policies; in view
of the 1981 review proposed in para. 5.22, reaffirmation of this section is
unnecessary.
5.24      SPA intends to revalue its fixed assets in the near future, with
the assistance of a consultant. For 80% of SPA's existing assets, construc-
tiDn or procurement was completed in 1976/77. A revaluation at this juncture
wolald thus raise SPA's total asset values by a relatively small amount.
Consequently, no estimate of revaluation is included in SPA's forecasts.
SPA also intends to obtain expert assistance to review the adequacy of its
insurance coverage. In addition to comprehensive coverage on Bank-financed
fixed assets, S:PA's mobile equipment and craft are insured together with
coverage for personal accident and monies in transit. The cost of the
proposed consultancy work for asset revaluation and insurance is included in
the proposed project. SPA has agreed to maintain coverage with responsible
insurers, or malke other provisions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.02 [h]).
Sensitivity Analysis
5.25      Previous forecasts of SPA's revenues have been accurate. In the
1971 appraisal report for Loan 774-MA, total revenue in 1976 was forecasted
at M$20.15 million, compared to actual results of M$20.74 million. Revenue
projections for 1978-1983 include fairly conservative estimates for income
from anchorage operations (which may not decline at the rate assumed).
It is therefore considered unlikely that future SPA total revenues will
faLl much below forecasts.



- 29 -
5.26      Previous forecasts of operating expenses were also accurate: SPA's
actual total in 1976 was M$10.84 million compared to the appraisal forecast
of US$10.32 million. The project's sensitivity to changes in cost of the
project and level of operating costs was examined. Relatively generous
price and physacal contingencies have been built into the estimated project
costs (para. 3.09). As to operating costs, Sabah's current inflation rate is
assumed to continue into 1983. However, should costs increase to a greater
extent, no difficulty is anticipated for SPA in raising tariffs more than the
modest 15% assumed for 1980.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Agreement has been reached with the Government of Malaysia that it
shall maintain the arrangements with the Sabah Government ensuring that the
Sabah Government shall:
(a) remove passenger traffic from the Tawau jetty to another location
acceptable to the Bank by no later than December 31, 1979 (para
2.23);
(b) vest in SPA, by no later than December 31, 1978, about three acres
of land required for the project and reserve a further 10 acres of
land for future Tawau port use by 1990 (para 3.12 (a) and (b);
(c) construct a Tawau port access road by no later than December 31,
1980 (para 3.12(c)); and
(d) restrict further reclamation east of Tawau port (par 3.12 (d);
6.02      Agreement has been reached with SPA that it will:
(a) continue to use the existing jetty at Tawau for light general
cargo until it is replaced in concurrence with the Bank
(para 2.09);
(b) reaffirm the audit covenant of the first port project (para 2.29);
(c) close alongside port facilities at Semporna by no later than
December 31, 1979 (para 2.31);
(d) appoint consulting engineers acceptable to the Bank (para 3.12);
(e) earn agreed financial rates of return (para 5.22);
(f)  not incur new debt if net revenue falls below 1.75 times maximum
debt service (para 5.23);



- 30 -
(g) not incur capital expenditure (other than the project) exceeding
M$3 million in any fiscal year without prior consultation with the
Bank (para 5.23); and
(h) maintain satisfactory insurance coverage (para 5.24);
6.03      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 13 million
equivalent to the Sabah Ports Authority guaranteed by the Federal Government
for a term of 17 years, including a grace period of four years.

time of the lighterage system.  After 1986, ship waiting time in the
project port will exceed the ship waiting time for lighterage operations
resulting in a net cost to the project as shown in Table 4.7.
/c  By 1992, ship waiting time costs will be large enough to justify construction
of an extension to the proposed project. However, for the purpose of cal-
culating economic benefits of the proposed project, traffic levels and ship
waiting time ccsts after 1991 are maintained at the 1991 level.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORTS PROJECT
Financial Forecasts - Methodology and Principal Assumptions
1. Traffic
Traffic will increase as forecast in Tables 2.2 and 2.3.
2. Revenues
(a) Basic
SPA revenues have been calculated on the basis of traffic forecasts
referred to above, using current SPA tariffs.
(b) Tariff Increases
An across the board increase of 15% p.a. has been applied to all
revenues, except those from anchorage operations, with effect from
July 1, 1980.
3. Operating Expenses
(a) General Inflation Factor
General inflation is assumed to raise costs at an annual rate of 5%.
This has been applied to all expenses except depreciation.
(b) Operational Labor Costs
Most operational labor is provided by labor contractors who are
basically paid on per ton of cargo handled. Cost are increased in
line with traffic growth.
(c) Nonoperational Labor Costs
These costs are based upon recent wage awards and assume annual
increments occur in accordance with these scales. Modest increases
in staff as necessary are included by SPA.
(d) Maintenance Costs
These have been estimated by SPA based upon past experience. New
port facilities at Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and eventually, at Tawau
will tend to reduce these costs in the initial years. No reduction
has, however, been assumed.



Table 5.6
Page 2
(e)  Depreciation
SPA bases depreciation on the life and residual value of each
asset using the straight line method. This method has also been
applied to assets being procurred/constructed under the proposed
project. The overall percentage of depreciation to gross fixed
assets is about 3% which is considered adequate.
(f) Interest charges
These have been forecast on the basis of the existing Loan 774-MA
plus an estimated 7 1/2% p.a. for the proposed Bank loan; 8% p.a.
for Federal and State Government loans and 8% p.a. for a commercial
bank loan for cargo handling equipment.
4. Federal Income Tax
Tax is computed on taxable income at the rate of 40% plus 5% development
tax. It is assumed that all interest charges are deductible expenses.
As no income tax has been assessed on SPA to date, initial and annual
allowances on capital expenditure have not yet been agreed between SPA
and Treasury. The appraisal estimates of tax liability are therefore,
very approximate as capital allowance are assumed to equal SPA's deprecia-
tion charges.
5. Balance Sheet
(a) Receivables
These are assumed to be 10% of revenue.
(b)  Account Payable - Port Operations
These are forecast on the basis of 13% of total cash expenses.
(c) Accounts Payable - Capital Works
These are assumed to be 7-1/2% of work in progress.
(d) Loans
Repayments are assumed as follows:
IBRD proposed loan - effective October 1, 1978; 26 1/2 yearly repay-
ment of equal amounts starting December 15,1982. Federal and State
loans - 15 years (no grace period) repayable on annuity method.
Commercial bank - seven years (no grace period) repayable on annuity
methodl.



Table 5.6
Page 3
6. Revenues from Sapangar Bay Development
It is assumed that revenue from the reclaimed land will be equivalent to
7% on net fixed assets in use. To reflect this in SPA's forecasts,
M$1.2 million p.a. has been added to Kota Kinabalu port revenue in 1982
and 1983 at 1977 prices. (This sum is equivalent to MS$ 0.90 per sq ft
per year on 30 acres.)
