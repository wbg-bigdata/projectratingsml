SECOND SABAH PORTS PROJECT (LOAN 1580-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The Second Sabah Ports Project was a sequel to the First Sabah
Ports Project for which a loan (Loan 774-MA) was made available in 1971. It
followed the same basic aim of the first project, which was to improve the
port facilities to serve the expanding economy of the state of Sabah.
The purpose of this project was to rehabilitate and expand the port
facilities at Tawau, by repairing the exisring quay, which had deteriorated to
a poor condition, and provide new berths and back-up facilities to increase
port capacity. An important component of the project aimed at developing the
institutional strength of the Sabah Ports Authority by focussing on operations
and training. Without the project the economically productive hinterland of
Tawau would not have been able to realise its full potential and the economic
costs would have been a severe inhibiting factor on the area's development.
The project was expected to cost US$26.0 million, of which the Bank loan would
provide US$13.0 million. In the event project costs were about 8X higher at
US$28.1 million, as the civil works costs were costlier than expected. This
total includes US$2.8 million for contractorts claims, which is estimated to
be the settlement figure for the US$6.0 million claimed.
Although the main contract for the port improvement works were
completed over two years later/than expected, the project was justified by the
virtual elimination of ship waiting time and by the increase in traffic and
productivity.  Container traffic vas introduced at Tawau for the first time
and in 1983 over 1,200 TEUs were handled. Traffic over the wharf did not
achieve the appraisal estimate due largely to the late completion of the works
and net port operating revenues followed this trend, though revenue per ton
was better than forecast. The shortfall in wharf traffic was offset by an
increase in anchorage operations.
The technical assistance components provided input for a revised
tariff structure as well as forming the basis for further action in strength-
ening the institutional organization of SPA, for the intro4uction of computer-
ization and for the setting up of a local training school.
All the loan covenants were complied with and rates of return were
acceptable.
Taken overall the project has proven to be of valuable economic
benefit to the important area of Sabah around Tawau as it has reduced the
economic costs of both imports and exports and has enabled local traders to
take advantage of containerization. With some adjustment to their working
methods, the development under this project, taken together with that under
the First Sabah Ports Project, should satisfy the demands on the SPA for port
facilities for some years in this economically thriving port of Malaysia.



MALAYSIA
SECOND SARA  PORTS PROJECT (LOAN 1580-MAL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1.* INTRODUCTION
1.01      Tawau is one of the three largest ports in Sabah, ranking third
after Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan. Between them, these three ports handle over
90S of Sabah's trado, escluding timber logo which are loaded at anchorages at
Sandakan> Taweu and L had Datu. The other sixt Kudat, Kanak, Labuan, Lahad
Datu, Sapanga# Bay and Semporna handle only small quantities of general carso
(see Map IBRD 13392 (PCR)).
1.02      The Sabah Ports Authority (SPA) was creatod in 1967 and has had all
the ports under its jurisdiction since 1972 with the exception of Labuanp
which is administered by Sabah's Marine Department. Situated on an island
near the Sultanate of Brunei, Labuan is a free-zone and the center of Sabah's
oil and gas industry. Sapangar Bay is a recently completed industrial jetty
for bulk liquid cargo, located about 10 miles north of Kota Kinabalu.
1.03      Since 1971 the Bank has financed eight transport projects in
Malaysia, of which four have had major components in Sabah, two each for ports
and highways. The ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan were extended and
improved between 1971 and 1977 under the Bank's First Sabah Ports Project
(Loan 774-MA).
2.  PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      In 1976, a master plan for the development of Sabah's ports was
completed for SPA by their consultants.  The report recommended the early
expansion of the port facilities at Tawau because of the growing traffic and
increasing ship waiting time occurring there. In addition, further expansion
of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan was recommended for a later date. This report
formed the basis of an appraisal by a Bank mission in October 1977.
2.02      The mission recommended that the port at Tawau be improved by the
construction of 1,000 ft of quay together with back-up facilities, equipment
and technical assistance, as detailed in Chapter 3 (para. 3.01).
2.03      The total project cost was estimated at M$63.7 million (US$26.0 mil-
lion) of which M$35.77 million (US$14.6 million) would be the foreign exchange
component. The Bank Loan for US$13 million was approved on May 25, 1978 and
signed on September 20, 1978 with an effective date of November 10, 1978.
2.04      The major Loan covenants focussed on the maintenance of an adequate
rate of return and the closure of shore operations at Semporna port, while
covenants in the Guarantee Agreement covered land, passenger traffic, access



-2
and reclamation.  Compliance with all these covenants has been satisfactory;
details are given in Table 1.
3.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AN) COST
-      A.  Project Scope and Content
3.01      The project as approved by the Ba.ak consisted of:
(a) Civil Works (Map IBRD 13394 (PCR))
(i? Construction of a reinforced concrete piled wharf (300 ft long
and 300 ft wide), with an upstream piled extension
(500 ft x 80 ft).
(ii) Reclamation, surfacing and paving of approximately 10 acres for
storage.
(iii)  Construction of a new transit shed (50,000 sq ft floor area)
located on che piled wharf.
(iv) Provision of an office, a vehicle maintenance facility,
ancillary buildings, gates, fencing, internal roads and
utilities.
(v) Repairs to the existing wharf.
(vi) Construction of a 750 ft long, 75 ft wide access road linking
the port to the North Road. Design and construction will be
undertaken by SPWD and financed by the Sabah Government.
(b) Cargo Handling Equipment
Procurement of mechanized cargo handling equipment for the new port
expansion at Tawau and replacement equipment for the ports of Kota
Kinabalu, Sandakan and Tawau. Details are in Table 2.
(c) Engineering Services
(i) Site investigations and studies to determine siltation rates,
ground conditions, hydrography, topography and location of
suitable hydraulic sand filling.
(ii) Engineering services for design and supervision of th-e above
civil works.
(d) Technical Assistance
Provision of technical assistance and training needs for SPA staff
in engineering and port planning and vehicle and equipment mainte-
nance; and management consultancy assistance for SPA in the
following fields:



-3-
(i) improvement of traffic operation and control techniques and
documentation;
(ii) improvement of planning and commercial activities of the
management services department;
(iii) feasibility studies for the introduction of a multi-shift wharf
operational system and mechanized data processing at major SPA
ports;
(iv) feasibility studies for the expansion of Kota Kinab.lu and
Sandakang; and
(v) revaluation of SPA's fixed assets.
The expected project completion date was September 30, 1981, with 500 ft of
quay available for berthing ships and for cargo operations by Jan'iary 1, 1981.
B. Hydraulic Studies and Soil Investigations
Siltation Study
3.02      A Siltation Study was completed and the report submitted to SPA by
their consultants in May 1978, at the time of publication of the Appraisal
Report. This report concluded that, on the basis of the data then available,
the probable rate of siltation could be of the order of 0.38 m/year. The
alignment and design of the quay were decided upon, in the light of this
report, to minimize the effect of the quay on future siltation.
3.03      A contract for Siltation Monitoring at the quay was awarded to
United Surveyors in November 1979. This allowed for seven hydrographic
surveys to be carried out over a period of 42 months. Because of slight
delays in the program, the final survey was completed in November 1983.
3.04      An Interim Report indicated that the rate of siltation had increased
to 1.5 mtyear, but the Final Report concluded that the rate was much higher in
some areas, reaching 2.8 m/year. It was recommended that maintenance dredging
be carried out every nine months and suggested that SPA purchase their own
dredging equipment. In view of the increased siltation rate, it was necessary
to construct a sheet-pile cofferdam around the sea-water pump intake and lead
an intake pipe to the front of the new quay.
Soil Investigation
3.05      Three soil investigatibns were carried out in connection with this
project. The first was compleced in 1976, the second in 1978 and the final
one in 1980.
3.06      The first investigation resulted in the design of the layout
selected for the new facilities of a reclained area for storage and a piled



4-
quay and apron, with a transit shed located on the piled structure. A hard
strata appeared to exist at 100-130 ft, which was suitable for founding the
piles.
3.07      The second investigation was carried out at the request of the Bank
to confirm the conditions behind the quay line. This showed a strata of sand-
stone dipping from 70-100 ft in a seaward direction, which was added confirma-
tion for the use of bearing piles.
3.08      The third investigation was a series of additional boreholes carried
out in the vicinity of the finger jetty, where pile driving had indicated the
absence of a hard layer at the expected depth. The boreholes confirmed a
discontinuity and the piles in this area had to be lengthened to act as
friction piles.
C. Implementation of Government and SPA Financed Components
Cargo Handling Equipment
3.09      SPA bought a number of items of cargo handling equipment for Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan under the First Sabah Ports Project (Loan 774-MA), and
has continued to buy further equipment progressively during the currency of
this. second project in order to improve the efficiency of the ports under its
control. All equipment was purchased with SPA's own funds as was intended,
the Bank's loan having no provision for financing equipment.
3.10      During the project period, additional and replacement equipment was
purchased for Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Lahad Datu and Kudat, as well as for
Tawau to service the improved facilities, to a value of M$5.89 million, of
which M$3.208 million can be considered to be the project component. This
figure is close to the appraisal estimate of M$3.295 million. Table 2
compares actual purchases made by SPA with appraisal estimates of equipment
requirements.
Port Access Road
3.11      The short length of the new port access road from the uiew main gate
to North Road was designed and financed by SPWD. Construction took much
longer than scheduled and it was not finally completed until April 1983. The
length and width of the road were increased from those proposed at appraisal
in order to improve the access, which changes contributed to the delay.
3.12      The main factors that delayed completion were:
(a)  Police quarters on the alignment of the new road could not be
demolished until additional work had been completed on the new
accommodation, which was considered to be below standard by the
Police Department;



(b)  8SE  electricity posts along the north end of Salleh Road and the
Telecommunications Department's telephone junction box at Jalan
Masjidi Salleb Road were not removed in time for road construction
to proceed on schedule, because this area was not in the original
proposal; and
(c}  demolition and reconstruction of concrete pavement in the area of
water and sewage mains were not completed on time.
3.13      All the problems were reviewed and resolved at a meeting on
October 11, 1982, which was attended by all parties concerned.
Port Administration Building
3.14      The project, as appraised, envisaged a simple single storey port
office building, but SPA decided to build a four-storey building, with provi-
sion for expansion to six storeys, which would also incorporate the canteen,
originally planned to be within the port security fence. The contract for
this building was not part of the main port contract, design work and supervi-
sion being carried out by local firms of architects and consulting engineers.
The contract was let before any approvals had been obtained from the Bank and,
partly In view of this, it was agreed with SPA that the building would be
taken out of the Bank-financed portion of the project and would be paid for
from SPA's own funds.  The cost of the building was M$2,688,000, with consul-
tancy fees of M$300,000.
3.15      The contractors ran into financial difficulties, were unable to
complete the building and surrendered the contract to SPA. Another contractor
was engaged to complete the work, but they, too, had problems and left the
building incomplete, so that some finishing items were transferred to the main
port contract and completed by that contractor in April 1983.
D. Implementation of Bank Financed Civil Works
(a)  Port Construction
General
3.16      SPA appointed consulting engineers in August 1978 to carry out  the
detailed design and supervision of the project, and by September 1978 topogra-
phic and hydrographic surveys had started and the soil investigation boreholes
were under way.
3.17      Tenders were received in July 1979 and the Main Contract was awarded
on November 1, 1979 in the sum of M$36*000,000. The Commencement Date was
November 30, 1979 and the original Completion Date was May 31, 1982, a
Contract Period of 30 months. An implementation schedule showing the original
contract program and actual achievement is shown in Table 3.
3.18      A Nominated Electrical Sub-contract was awarded on April 15, 1980 in
the Sum of M$1,781,161 for completion by the same date as the Main Contract.



-6-
3.19      There were a number of causes that delayed the completion of the
contract, and the contract period was extended to May 11, 1983. The works
were substantially complete on April 13, 1983, except for electrical and mech-
anical components and the entire works were completed on December 17, 1983,
when the final Certificate of Completion was issued, 18½ months after the end
of the original Contract Period and over seven months after the end of the
Extended Contract Period.
3.20      Major problems encountered were in the supply of coral fill,
obtaining suitable sizes of rock armouring, shortages of skilled tradesmen,
unexpected sub-soil conditions, greater than expected siltation rates, hair-
cracking of the -oncrete in the quay and SPA's requirements for avaiLability
of storage areas. These are summarized below.
Problems in the Supply of Coral
3.21      The original proposal by the consultant was to obtain coral for
bunding from the Semporna area. Following objections from fishermen, the
State Government rejected this area on environmental grounds. Start of work
on an alternative agreed site for on-shore excavation of coral was delayed due
to difficulties the contractor had in obtaining an explosives permit from the
police. The underlying coral at this site was subsequently found to be of
unsuitable density and strength: similar conditions were found to exist on
all the islands in this area. The agreement of the Government was finally
obtained for the manual extraction of coral (not using explosives) from the
tidal reef west of Pulao Bum Bum, in the Semporna area, which enabled
production to proceed.
3.22      The delay to the construction of the rock bund protecting the sand
filling of the reclamation, caused by these problems in the supply of coral,
in turn delayed the start of the jetty concreting. It also delayed the
completion of the inshore piling, which the Specification required to be time-
dependent on the progress of the rock bund.
Problems in the Supply of Rock Armour
3.23      The rock bund was further delayed due to problems in obtaining
suitable sizes of rock armouring. Whilst the maximum size of rock was readily
available, the contractor had great difficulties in obtaining the two smaller
sizes required and had to resort to hand-splitting the larger rocks and to
opening up his own quarry. Rock was eventually obtained from no less than
seven different quarries.
Problems in the Availability of Skilled Tradesmen
3.24      A shortage of skilled carpenters and plywood panels for shuttering
caused further delays to the concrete construction of the quay. A :hortage of
skilled welders delayed the offshore Lengthening and fabrication of the
tubular steel pipes.



-7-
Unforeseen Sub-soil Conditions
3.25      The quay piling was designed to be driven to set in the siltstone
underlying the softer layers of silt, clay and sand, as determined from the
boreholes carried out as part of the site investigation. In part of the
western section of the finger jetty, however, the siltstone was not encoun-
tered. Additional boreholes were required to locate the extent of this
discontinuity, and the piles had to be increased in length to allow them to
act as friction piles. It is not certain that the localised discontinuity
encountered in the siltstone would necessarily have been identified unless the
original borehole program had been significantly more extensive.
Siltation Problems
3.26      In May 1981, after monitoring  of the seabed levels had been in
progress for some time, it became apparent that the effect of siltation in the
area of the quay was worse than had been forecast. This particularly affected
the Fire Fighting Pump House located on the quay, and it therefore became
necessary to provide a sheet-pile caisson around the pump impellers, with a
sea water intake pipe leading to the face of Berth No. 1. It was also decided
to provide an anti-fouling unit within the caisson to prevent the formation of
marine growth, which would otherwise affect the operation of the pumps.
Additionally, in order to enable the new berths to operate to full capacity,
dredging of the area alongside the quay was carried out in 1982 to offset the
serious effects of the high rate of siltation.
Problems with Asphalt Plant
3.27      Because of the inadequacies of the locally available compaction
plant required for the bitumen macadam surfacing, it was found necessary to
apply a tack coat in order to obtain compliance with the specification
requirements for compaction.
Problems with Cracking of Quay Concrete
3.28      The earlier in-situ slab sections of the quay deck construction were
found to have developed fine hair-cracks, which required a major program of
crack sealing to be undertaken by the contractor. Subsequently, in spite of
taking precautions, including changing the method of curing, using low-heat
cement, providing a water cooling system at the batching plant, providing
additional construction joints with a two-stage pouring program and restrict-
ing the pouring of concrete during periods of maximum ambient temperatures, it
was not possible to completely prevent further cracking.
Problems with Services
3.29      Because of the inexperience of the sub-contractors involved, the
Fire-fighting, Fresh Water, Sewerage and Electrical services suffered exten-
sive delays, which were compounded by damage to items of equipment during
shipping and port handling as well as by accidental damage on site.



Client's Requirements and Variations
3.30      Apart from the delays caused by the problems of coral and rock
supply, the shore works were further delayed and the program disrupted by the
requirement of SPA that Open Storage Area (OSA) No. 1 should be made available
for their use as soon as Berth No. 2 was opened. This required the provision
of temporary surfac ng on GSA No. 1 and two-stage temporary fencing and light-
ing to OSA Nos. 1 and 2.
3.31      In May 1982, SPA decided to include in the contract an additional
OSA No. 3 for container traffic. This led to changes in the drainage, fencing
and lighting of the onshore area as well as the necessity to provide a Standby
Generator Yard and to make provision for future Reefer Units.
3.32      The decision to construct the larger Administration Building led to
the necessity to demolish the old Gatehouse which contained the switchgear for
the original port electrical system. It was necessary, therefore, to build a
new Switchroom No. 2 and to provide new switchgear.
3.33      A number of items were transferred from the Administration Building
Contract to the Port Contract because of the failure of the contractor. Some
of these items were later found to be faulty, which led to delays in the occu-
pancy by SPA of this building and of the offices in the Transit Shed, because
of late commissioning of the telephone system.
3.34      Large numbers of small variat:ions to buildings, drainage and the
electrical system were made at SPA's request in order to improve security,
make provision for air conditioning certain buildings, improve the operations
of the port, reduce maintenance and provide additional safety precautions.
Contract Progress
3.35      The contract started off well and ddring the first eight months the
contractor generally kept fairly well to program. By mid 1980 the program for
coral and rock supply was behind schedule but approval for normal extraction
of coral from Pulau Bum Bum enabled this work to commence in July 1980. The
principal problems encountered on coral extraction and rock production (see
also 3.37 below) related primarily to the prohibition on the use of explo-
sives. In retrospect, had these difficulties been more fully realised the
delays occasioned by manual extraction could bave been lessened.
3.36      In October 1980, the contractor issued a revised construction pro-
gram, which showed completion in October 1982, five months after the end of
the contract period. At this time the delays caused by the unexpected subsoil
conditions were affecting the piling program too.
3.37      Progress continued to be sufficient to meet the new program for a
few months, but in February 1981 it started to drop off and fell behind sche-
dule mainly because of production problems in the quarries, which delayed the
rock bund. Progress on concreting the quay also fell behind because of
shortage of labor.



-9-
3.38      The contractor produced yet another construction program in April
1981, which showed completion by August 1982, but this involved rescheduling
many items of work for late in the contract, a device that rarely works when a
contract is set on a course which involves delay to vital parts of the works.
3.39      On July 15, 1981 Berth No. I was opened to traffic, 5½ months after
the date specified in the contract and the rate of progress picked up around
this time so that it kept to the revised program. The contractor, however,
produced the third revision of his construction schedule in August 1981, which
again put the completion date back to October 1982, but in view of the items
which still had to be completed so late in the contract period, this date did
not seem realistic.
3.40      By November 1981, progress in all main sections of the work began to
tail off as concreting of the quay slowed down, the completion of the recla-
mation area was further delayed and work on buildings and services slipped
well behind schedule. The production of a fourth revision to the construction
schedule in January 1982 was considered to be totally unrealistic as it still
showed a completion date of October 1982 together with a requirement that
output be increased by 200% to achieve that date.
3.41      Work continued to make slow progress throughout 1982.  The whole of
the quay was opened to traffic on September 15, 1982, 3½ months after the end
of the original Contract Period. Extensions of time totalling almost 12
months were granted to cover variations and other delaying factors so that the
end of the Contract Period became May 11, 1983.
3.42      Most of the civil components of the works were completed by April
13, 1983, leaving the completion of services as the main delaying fkctor. The.
entire works were eventually completed on December 17, 1983 after a construc-
tion period of 48½ months compared with the original contract period of 30
months. The claims for extension of time requested by the contractor and
granted by SPA are given in Table 4.
(b) Technical Assistance
Management
3.43      In August 1979, SPA selected management consultants for a 14-month
assignment to assist them in:-
(a) improving traffic operations;
(b) expanding the role of the Managemert Services Department;
(c) studying the feasibility of introducing a multi-shift system on the
wharves;
(d)  studying the possible use of computerized data processing; and
(e) revaluing SPA's fixed assets.



- 10 -
3.44      The study, involving 50 man-months of work, Cost US$400,000 and the
Final Report was produced in 1981. While some of the recommendations of the
report have not been implemented by SPA, the asset revaluation has been used
in conjunction with a tariff study, commissioned by the Federal Government for
East Malaysian ports, to produce a new tariff structure. The findings in
respect of personnel and personnel development led to the launching of a
training needs masterplan study (see para. 3.47). The recommendations on
computerization have led to the installation of computers for management
purposes within SPA. The above referenced report was discussed with SPA, who
gave reasons for not wishing to implement some of the recommendations.
Specific obstacles were cited for not being able to proceed with multi-shift
working, but, at the same time, SPA considered that the report gave a fresh
look at their problems, which would prove useful in the future when adapted to
local philosophies. rJntil they make best use of the existing investments i-n
port facilities, SPA will find it difficult to make a convincing case for the
financing by the Bank of further facilities.
Equipment Maintenance
3.45      At the end of 1980, SPA selected consultants to carry out a 2-month
course in planned maintenance for their mechanical engineers and technicians
at Kota Kinabalu.
Training
3.46      The training program financed by the loan comprised:
(a) maintenance ttaining for Workshop personnel;
(b) overseas training of 5 port engineers by SPA's Consulting Engineers
and of 1 mechanical engineer by other consultants; and
(c) on-the-job welding training provided by consultants.
This training has proved most useful in building up SPA's expertise and skills
in vital areas of port operation.
3.47      Consultants were retained in 1983 to study the training needs of SPA
over the ensuing 10 years with a view to setting up a SPA Training School. A
survey was carried out among SPA staff between April and July 1983 and the
results were incorporated into a Training Masterplan designed to improve
operational efficiency and management techniques and aimed at assisting SPA
management to know and understand the training needs of their personnel. The
report also drew attention to various organizational issues that needed to be
addressed and outlined the methodology and initiatives that SPA should embark
upon to bridge the identified training gaps. The implementation of the
recommendations has started.



- II 
(c) Consultants
Port Works
3.48      The consultants performed satisfactorily.  The overall design of the
facility is good and it serves the requirements of Tawau Port very well.  The
design of the Transit Shed, however, could have made more efficient use of the
floor area if it had been based on multiples of the standard pallet together
with the required minimum space for a forklift truck in the aisles.
3.49      Site supervision was also satisfactory.  The level of staffing
agreed with SPA proved insufficient especially at those times when the
contractor was working extended hours. The local associate consultant
suffered from a rapid turnover of staff, which in turn resulted in-an
additional workload on the site staff.
Administration Building
3.50      Design was carried out by a local architect and local consulting
engineer. The services of both these firms were considered by SPA to be
sAtisfactory, but reports by Bank staff indicated that workmanship was poor,
attributable, in part, to lax supervision.
(d) Contractors
Port Works
3.51      The main contractor's performance was generally satisfactory and
workmanship was good. They consistently tried hard to overcome the various
delaying factors which affected the contract, most of which were not their
fault and for which they received appropriate extensions of time.
3.52      The nominated sub-contractor for the electrical works eventually
completed the work satisfactorily, but was much delayed by his inexperience
with the types of equipment he was called upon to install.
Administration Building
3.53      The contractor for this building did not perform well and the
workmanship was poor, which was one of the factors contributing to the Bank
declining to finance this component. The contractor also suffered from
financial problems and eventually had to relinquish the contract before
completion.
E. Costs
3.54      At the time of writing this report, the cost accounts for this
project had not been finalized pending the assessment and settlement of the
contractorts outstanding claims. In assessing the project costs it has been
assumed that the outstanding z.laims of M$14.6 million will be settled for
about M$6.9 million. The total provisional project costs are, therefore,



- 12 -
M$68.867 million-(US$28.109 million) as against M$63.7 million (US$26.0 mil-
lion) in the Appraisal Report. The estimated foreign exchange component of
the total project cost is M$39.563 million (US$16.148 million), which is
M$3.793 million (US$1.548 million) more then the ajprais8l estimate.
3.55      The cost increase is mainly attributable to:
(a) increased costs of materials;
(b) claims for delay; and
(c)  additional works requested or undertaken by SPA, which were not
included in the original project (e.g. Port Administration Building,
extra open storage areas, additional access roadworks etc).
3.56      Disbursements against the various categories listed in Schedule 1 of
the Loan Agreement are as follows:
Original amount         Actual

3.57      Disbursements initially lagged about 18 months behind the appraisal
forecast, but they quickly caught up to being only about one year behind and
then followed the forecast profile, being completed exactly one year late.
See Table 5.
4. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
4.01      Because of the slow start to the project and the delayed opening of
the new berth to traffic, cargo throughput over the wharf did not increase at
the rate expected in the Appraisal Report. From 298,000 tons in 1977,
throughput was expected to reach 487,000 tons in 1982 and 541,900 tons in
1983. The totals achieved in 1982 and 1983 were 459,711 and 508,900 ton*
respectively.  For 1984, actual wharf throughput was 537,500 tons versus a



- 13 -
forecast of 604,300 tons (See Table 6). Imports exceeded the expected growth
rate, but this was offset by a much slower growth in exports over the wharf.
Imports of cement, other construction materials and fertilizer were higher
than forecast. However, exports of palm kernels, rubber and processed timber
across the wharf were below the 1978 forecast. Exports loaded at anchor,
primarily logs, increased sharply. On the whole, as shown below, traffic over
the wharf grew at an annual rate of 9.LX versus the forecast rate of 10.6X
during the period 1977-1984.

TEU's than Sandakan and this type of traffic is expected to grow rapidly. At
present most containers age unstuffed in the yard and the contents transferred
to the transit shed as general cargo. As traffic increases, the present
system will have to be reorganized so that the boxes are unstuffed at the
transit shed or a door-to-door service initiated for FCL's. The tr4ffic for
1983 at Tawau was as follows:

5.01      SPA's tariffs have not been altered since 1977, though a new cost-
based tariff structure is awaiting Government approval. These new tariffs are
the result of a study for the East Malaysia Ports carried out by consultants
appointed by the Malaysian Ministry of Transport in 1980.  An asset revalu-
ation carried out at the same time has also been used as an input for the
revised tariff structure. However, the financial statements presented herein
are based on historical cost and do not include revalued amounts.
B. Earnings
5.02      Der.ils of actual and forecast income and expenditure for FY77 -
FY83 are given in Table 5.1 and Annex Table 6 for Tawau Port and in Annex
Table 7 for SPA. SPA's actual and forecast consolidated balance sheet is in
Annex Table 8. As shown in the summary table below, port operating revenues
increased by 14.1X p.a. over the 1977 to 1983 period versus a forecast growth
rate of 14.9%. With no rate adjustment in the period, the net revenue growth
rate of 15.82 fell short of the forecast of 16.3S. Anchorage revenue had been
forecast to drop; instead the export volume of timber continued to grow,
during the period.
5.03      Revenue yield per ton of cargo over the wharf had been forecast to
increase by 4.6X; even without the tariff increase the unit revenue yield was
higher by 6.1%. Operating ratios at the port remained on target over the
period, indicating that control was maintained over operational costs.
Revenue yield from the port has kept pace with expectation, even without the
rate increase envisaged. Similarly, financial return on investment, (based on
historical cost) 8.12 in 1983 versus a forecast 7.1X has been held marginally
better than forecast expectations. Debt service coverage at a factor of 1.49
in 1983 is firmer than forecast, both because of the good revenue yield and
the slower drawdown of loans during the extended construction period.
C. Financial Position
5.04      A consolidated income and expenditure account and balance sheet for
SPA are shown in Table 7 and 8; a summary of SPA's financial position over the
project period is shown below:

Financial results have been satisfactory and the SPA balance sheet
has improved with a stronger debt-to-equity ratio in 1983 than 1977. Although
current liabilities have built up over the period and reduced the current
ratio, the cash flow position is strong a shown in the sumuary statement of
sources and uses of funds below:

6. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01      SPA underwent considerable institutional change during the time of
the First Sabah Ports Project (Loan 714-MA), when a number of additional ports
were taken over. Staff numbers rose to meet these demands and there were some
changes in the organization of management. Generally SPA's management and
organization is satisfactory.
6.02      In 1981 the Sabah Ports Authority Enactment was repealed and
reenacted. Among the changes were the inclusion of the General Manager as an
ex-officio member of the Board and the transfer of the power of appointing the
members from the Minister to the Governor. The term of office of the Board
has also been extended by one year to 3 years. The new Act also laid down
that the. Auditor-General, Malaysia shall be the external auditors for SPA.
However, because of a shortage of manpower in the Auditor-General's
Department, an interim arrangement has been made under the provisions of the
Malaysian Audit Act by which the Auditor-General appoints a professional
auditing firm to audit SPA accounts under his official direction in order to
avoid delays. The internal audit chief is not directly responsible to the
Ceneral Manager.



- 18 -
6.03      While there have been no specific additional functions assumed by
SPA, there have been moves within the Government to invite SPA to assist in
supporting undertakings of the Government, some commercial in nature, for
which SPA could contribute expertise or financial resources.  These cases are,
however, decided upon only after a full review of their merits by SPA.-
6.04      There has been a considerable increase in manpower at Tawau, both
direct employees as well as contract labor, arising out of the commissioning
of the new facilities. There has also been a decision to reexamine the wisdom
of continuing with the present arrangement for the engagement of contract
stevedore labor in view of the lack of capacity of the management of the
contractors to provide skill and safety training and ensure strong and effec-
tive management. Alternatives being examined include the establishment of
more direct SPA control and direction through either policy guidance and
enforcement or SPA participation in setting up companies dedicated to the
provision of stevedore services.  A study-is presently in progress.
6.05      The emphasis of this Second Sabah Ports Project has been more on
improving traffic operations and individual skills.  As noted in para. 3.43,
SPA selected management consultants to assist them in their institutional
development. The asset revaluation was used in the setting up of a new tariff
structure and SPA have started to computerize their operations. Some of the
recommendations of the report, however, have not been implemented on the
grounds that they did not accord with local philosophies. The training
included in the project mainly covered mechanical and infrastructure
maintenance (see paras. 3.45 and 3.46). Consultants also produced a Training
Masterplan (para. 3.47) that addressed the training and organizational needs
of SPA with a view to setting up a Training School, which is now being formed.
6.06      The difficulty of attracting and retaining well-qualified staff
remains a problem because of unfavorable salary scales compared with the
private sector. The situation has, however, been somewhat alleviated by the
introduction of contractual terms of service and by further improvements in
the salary scale.
7. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01      The approach taken in the economic appraisal was to compare costs of
meeting anticipated traffic growth against the next best alternative, that of
supplementing existing wharf operations with lighterage. To compare the
project against the cost of "doing nothing" would not have been realistic
because alternate ports of Kunak and Semporna are inadequate and cost of
trucking too high.
7.02      Quantifiable benefits consisted of the savings in avoiding the cost
of lighterage and shore support equipment, savings in cargo handling, loss and
damage, and reductions in vessel waiting and turnaround time (Para 4.02).
Based on the traffic forecast of more than 11% per year and the need to serve
the cargo with a fleet of 20 lighters, 12 lighter berths with cranes, sheds
and workshops, the largest area of forecast savings would be this avoidable



19
outlay with its high operating cost.  Including cargo and vessel savings, an
economic rate of return of 26% was forecast.
7.03      Applying this s,me methodology but with project economic costs
higher at US$24.97 million versus US$18.4 million, delayed benefit streams and
lower cost savings because of project delays and less-cargo, the internal rate
of return was reduced from 26% at appraisal to 12.6% (see Table 12).
Paralleling the original analysis, no salvage value was assumed at the end of
the 20 year period. Inclusion of this would not change the result
significantly however. The project was sensitive to both the lags in
achieving the benefits as well as the 35% overrun in cost.
8. THE ROLE OF THE IBRD
8.01      The Bank's reporting requirements - i.e. monthly progress reports,
annual traffic and financial statements and periodic budgetary and costing
reports - were reasonable.
8.02      Project supervision was satisfactorily carried out by SPA's
consultants. This was a much better system than that adopted in the First
Sabah Ports Project. Supervision missions by Bank staff were appropriate to
the size of the project and problems being encountered.
8.03      Despite the insistence of the Bank on an additional borehole
investigation to confirm the existence of the aard strata to take end-bearing
piles, the discontinuity in the strata in the area of the finger jetty was
still not revealed which resulted in some time and cost overrun. The rest of
the time and cost overrun was caused by a combination of factors - material
supply, labor shortage, changes and additional works requested by SPA and the
employment of a nominated electrical subcontractor, approved by the Bank, who
turned out to be insufficiently experie-ced in the type of work demanded.
8.04      Relations between SPA and the Bank remained good, and if it were not
for strict budgetary restraint being imposed by the Federal Government, SPA
would be keen to involve the Bank in a further port development project.
9.  CONCLUSION
9.01      In conclusion, the project is justified despite considerable delay
in completion and cost overruns. Ship waiting time has been drastically
reduced and port throughput has increa3ed at a good rate, with containers
making a significant contribution, which will increase with time. While the
project achieved a higher than expected financial rate of return the economic
rate of return was about half of the aDpraisal estimate.
9.02      While the implementation of the project has been seen as the long-
awaited answer to a real shortage in the basic port facility to support an
economically productive hinterland, the upgraded facilities have also



- 20 -
generated greater confidence among the trading coomunity so that they now more
readily subscribe to-the benefits of a bigger-volume and better-organized
importing system. This trend opens them and the consumers to the benefits of
economies of scale. At the sae time the commissioning of the new facility
has enabled the introduction of container traffic to the area with all its
attendant benefits and in one year Tawau has overtaken Sandakan in the number
of TEU's handled. The improved layout of the port and its interface with the
town roads has introduced order to an otherwise chronic traffic pattern.
9.03      The overall financial situation of SPA remains good and, with the
maintenance of a strong economy in Sabah, future prospects are promising.
