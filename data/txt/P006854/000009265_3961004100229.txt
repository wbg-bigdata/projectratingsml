MIMORANDUM AND RECOqMENDATION OF TH PRESIDENT
OF THE  MRD TO TH EXECJUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED PROJECT TO COLOMBIA
FOR A MUNICIPAL HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum on a proposed loan to Colombia for the
equivalent of US$50.0 million to help fimance a Municipal Heath Services Project. The loan would be
at the RBak's standard variable interest rate for a term of 17 years, including a grace period of five years.
2.    Backgound. Despite the world-wide recession, Colonbia maintained an annual growth rate of
3.4 percent ihroughout the 1980s. In 1990, the Government introduced a program of economic reforms
to resolve structura impediments to maiting growth, raising productivity and imrroving external
competiiveness. A complementar effort is underway to develop human resources and to reduce poverty,
which currently affects an esimated 40 percent of the population. Priority is given to improving the
quality and coverage of basic social services. Ihe upgrading and expansion of prmay health care figures
prominently in this strategy.
3.    Between 1965 and 1990, Colombia experienced significant improvements in demographic and
health conditions. The fertility rate dropped from 6.5 to about 2.9. Infant and maternal mortality also
declined, from 80 to 27, and from 2.5 to one per 1,000 births, respectively; and, the population growth
rate declined from 3.7 percent to 1.5 percent. The current life expecanq, at 69 years, compares
favorably with other lower-middle income countries in Latin America. Gains in life expectny have
been offset by incses l mortality attributable to violence, accidents and chronic diseases, as Colombia
enters the epidemiologic transition characteized by a shift towards health problems of developed
coies. Moreover, marked disparities in health status persist among income groups. Variations are
evident in basic indicators, e.g., the infant mortality rates in the poorest departments (states) are nearly
twice those of the wealthiest (about 40 versus 20 per 1,000); and malnutrition levels for children of
mothers in the lowest income range are seven tumes higher than those for children of women in the
highest income range. Higher than average fertility, infant mortality and child malnutrition rates are also
closely associated with mothers lacking basic education.
4.    The Health Sedor.  The health sector in Colombia comprises the public health system, social
seur  systems (for government and private sector employees), and private services. The public health
service is responsible for serving 65 percent of the population; social securit serves 18 percent, and the
private sector, 17 percent. Health care in the public service is provided at three levels: local health
posts, centers and hospitals; departmental hospitals; and university and specialized hospitals. Colombia
is currently decentaizing opatig and fiscal responsibilities for public sector programs to the country's
33 d         and 1,029 nvmicipalities. Municipalities will become responsible for providing primary
health care and departments for providing higher level health services. The central Ministry of Health
(MOH) and the Departental Health Services (DSs) are being reorganized to focus on providing policy,
plaming and tecical guidance and support to the municipalities.
5.    Health expenditures in Colombia comprised about 6 percent of GDP in 1990, with public
expenditu  representing 2.4 percent of GDP. Ihe public health system cumently receives half its
funding from national transfers: a share of curret revenues for recurrent expenditu; and a share of
revenues fiom a value-added tax for investment. Departmental revenues from selected taxes and lotteries



-2-
are also allocated for health. At present, the public health system accounts for about 40 percent of public
recurrent expenditure for health and social security, 60 percent. his split highlights a high degree of
inequity between the two systems, with per capita expenditure for social security representing nearly six
times that for the public system. To correct thbis imbalance, the 1991 Constitution mandates increasing
shares of both current revenues and the value-added tax for tLe public health system during the 1990s.
6.    As a result of inadequate expenditure, coupled with poor average quality and efficiency of
aervices, effective coverage of the public health system is limited to just over half of the target
populaion. An estmated 30 percent of the populaion, mainly rurJ and peri-urban poor, lacks access
to basic health services, including primary health care at the local level. The main issues facing primary
care are:
(a) Jnstultuonal Constrwaints. The quality of information on health status, services and related
costs and finacing at the municipal level is poor on average. This weakness forms part of a
broader set of management limitations for planning and monitoring primary health services,
which will likely be magnified in the early stages of decealization: municipal mayors, health
authorities, and newly created municipal health boards and commitees for health facilities lack
experience in service planning and monitoriag. They wil require systemac training and support
to undertake these responsibilities and enhance local accountability for services provided, drawing
on the MOH, DSs and available experdse (e.g., NGOs, universities) in the departmets.
(b) Service Weakbn. While no formal evaluation is available, low average quality is
indicated for priary health care. A complete package of basic services is not universally
provided. Curative care has been emphasized over preventive, outreach and community
education services, and provision of higher levels facilities over primary facilities. Ability to
respond to priority health needs, notably for maten and child care and emergencies, is further
limited by shortages in medical supplies and equipment. A promising program to finance and
distribute essental drugs through community pharmacies has been initated by the central
government and vill be epanded nationwide. Unmet needs for rehabilitation and upgrading of
facilities, and in selected areas, for new or expanded facilities, also detract from the quality and
coverage of primary services. High staff turnover among health professionals at the muicipal
level, consisting largely of recent graduates serving a year of national service, is attributable to
inadequate incentives and limited pre-vice orientation to primary health care. This urnover,
and an absence of regular on-e-job training and support for all primary health personnel,
increase the problems. As a result of the quality problems, and lack of effective patient referral
and cost-recovery practices among service levels, primary facflities are often by-passed for
higher-cost secondary and tertiay level facilities (3e-occupancy rates are 35 percent, 59 percet
and 75 percent, respectively).
(c) Policy and Evaluation Shortflls. Key policy measures, required to support effective
development of primary health care are also lacking, in particular, mehanisms to ensure efficient
prcing of public services and to enhance cost-recovery. Income-based user fees vary more
widely than can be explained by income levels (from 0 to 50 percent of local hospital costs); and
differential fees are not used to discourage use of higher level facilities for providing standard
primary care services. Systematic quality control and facility accreditation practces, and
comparability among employment systems at the three administive levels of the public health
system are also reqired. Further, regular evaluation of the impact of prmary health services
is needed to guide policy.

7.    Govenment Strategy. The Government's health strategy aims to improve efficiency and equity
in resource use, and raise quality. To this end, it has prepared a long-term program to reorient the public
health system. The focus of improvements, as embodied in a 1990 health reform law, will be primary
care directed to the poor. Restructuring of social security, and improved competitiveness of public
services, are complementary aims; and the Government has Initiated assessment of dternatives to the
current social security system, focussed on improving equity and efficiency. The Government seeiks to
enhance the responsiveness of services to local needs through the decentralization and the planned
increase in shares of central govement transfers for health. Earlier legislation provided for the transfer
of central govenument revenues and mnagement responsibilities fjr prmary healdh care to the
muniiaities, and created new opportunities for revenue generaton for those services (mainly a
municipal health lottey). A proposed law, detailing criteria for deemining central allocations to the
municipalities, and procedures for the transfer of funds, is under preparation.
8.    Project Objectives and Target Population. The project would represent the fis phase of a ten-
12 year Government program to strengthen the public health system. It would develop local management
capaciy and provide incentives, in the form of centra govermnent grants, to support municipal provision
of a basic package of primary health services. The main objectives are to: a) enhance municipal skills,
in nine areas of the country, to plan and monitor primary health care sevices; (b) ;mprove the
effectiveness and coverage of primary health services in those municipalities; and (c) design and execute
key policy measure, and introduce evaluation, to support the development of primary health services.
The project covers eight d'aments and selected pen-urban slums in Bogott. It includes 220
municipalities with a population of 9.8 million and aims to reach, in particular, some 6 million poor,
representing over 60 percent of the total. The project would be complemented by an Inter-American
Development Bank operation designed to strengthen resource use and management at higher level public
hospitals Qoan amount, US$40 miion).
9.    Project Description. (a) Institutional Development (11 percn of total costs) would: Q)
introduce a municipal health information system (MHIS) comprising health personnel and facilities data,
health services dat and related costs and financing data. Based on the MHIS and other municipal data,
monitoring indicators, focussed on service outcomes, productivity and coverage, would be constucted
and introduced, beneficiary assessments undertaken, and planning carried out; and (O) proviie related
technical assistance, training and onthe-job support for about b,000 municipal ,dmmitoto  health
aministators and community repesentatives. This training and technical support (as well as that to be
provided for health practitioners under the project) would be  oodinat  by the MOH and DSs, and
would incorporate use of departmental training centers and experienced contractors dra,n from
universit s, NGOs, and other departmental groups. (b) Service Development (80 percent of total costs)
would: provide for implementationof municipal subprojects, to be co-financed by the central government
*           and the municitalities, to support a basic package of primary health services, focussing on preventive and
curative care for maternl and child health, emergencies, and selected infectious and chronic diseases;
and on communty education, outreach services and effective referral. The subprojects would support
*           the package by: (i) providing supplies, equipment and furniture for health institutions, and financing the
reabilitation, upgrading and construction or expansion of primary bealth facilities, based on standard
planning and use criteria (basic drugs would be financed under the essential drugs progam outside the
subprojects); and (i) providg techmica assistance, traiing and technical support for municipal health
practitione, including some 3,700 physicians and nurses, 7,000 assist nurses and 2,000 community
health promoters. Technical assistance would also be provided to increase the focus on primary health
in pr-sevi  training for health profesionals. (c) Policy Development and Evaluation (5 percent of
totl ¢osts) would: provide technical assistance to the MOH to (i) undertk key policy studies and



-4-
prepare and introduce related measures in the areas of service pricing and cost-recovery for primary
services, including the introduction of differential (income-based) fees for primary services by level of
provider; quality control and accreditation; and employment systems and incentives for public health,
including introduction of incentives for retaining national service professionals at the municipal level
(e.g., possibilities for early promotion, fellowships for public health studies); and (ii) design and
implement a baseline, mid-term and end-term evaluation to measure the projec's impact and potential
replicability. Financing would also be provided for project administration (4 percent of total costs).
Breakdowns of costs and fiancing for the project are shown in Schedule A, and arrangements for
procurement and disbursement in Schedule B. The timetable for key events for project processing is
provided in Schedule C and the status of Bank Group Operations in Colombia in Schedule D. A map
of Colombia is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11743-CO, dated May 14, 1993, is also
attached.
10.   Project nagement. Overall coordination and monitoring for the project would be undertaken
by a project coordinating office in the MOH and in the DSs in the project areas. Ihe project coordinator
and techiczl and amistrative subcoordinators have been appointed. The instuional and policy
development components, and all training and technical support subcomponents, would be managed
through this structure and financed through use of central government funds. The municipalities, through
their regular admstrative strucres for health, would approve and implement the service development
subprojects. These would be drawn from investment plans prepared by the municpalities with DS
support and approval, in accordance with institutional, technical, financial and economic criteria
established under the project. The central government contnbution to the financing of municipal
subprojects would be managed through the Social Investment Fund (FIS), created in 1992 to manage co-
financed investments in health and education. The FIS would employ fiduciary agents to manage project
funds. The FIS, through the fiduciaries, would also review physical and financial outcomes of the
subprojects to ensure that subproject criteria had been met. The central Government's contribution to
municipal subprojects would take the form of grants; the municipalities would finance 70 percent of the
civil works and 30 percent of equipment and supplies included under the subprojects from their shares
of centra government transfers for health, other revenues and contributions in kind. Guidelines for limits
on subproject size, based on municipal characteristics, criteria for subproject design and approval, and
details on financing and management responsibilities are contained in a project operations mamual. A
work program has been detailed for the first year of project implementation. An annual review of
progress would serve as the main mechanism for supporting effective project implementation. Subproject
financing arragements, approval criteria and implementation procedures would form a particular focus
of these reviews. In 1996, a mid-term review would assess overall progress towards the project's
development objectives, as reflected through a set of key impact indicators as will as project monitoring
results. Experience would be used to introduce adjustments as may required.
11.   St bit. The strengthening of prmary health care in the public sector will require
improvements in the management capabilities of the municipalities, and a municipal commitment to
provide adequate investment and reurrent financing. Conuing institutional and technical support from
higher adminitative levels will also be needed for the foreseeable future. Increased community
involvement in the provision of services should stimulate demand for quality services, reinforce
government commitment, and enhance transparency of decision-making. E  at auditing of facilities
and goods provided, and of expenditures under the municipal subpro.ets, would strehen local
accuitability.



12.   Lssons From Previous Bank Involivanet. The Bank has supported thee health projects in
Colombia. A Health Svices Integrtion Project (Lon 2611-CO of 1986), combining healtb, watr
supply, sanitation and nutrition activities, is neaing comletion. It suffered delay and was ultimately
reduced in scope owing to complexity of design, fra ntaton of implemeation responsibilities, and
changing priorities for the public health system. A nuion project (Loan 1487-CO of 1977) confimed
the feasibility of implemening a food cou    progam, but direct benefits, in terms of calories delivered,
were low. The third opeation (Loan 3201-CO of 1990), recendy initiated, supports a chlldcae and
nutriion program in low-income, urban areas, and focsses on ensuring the quaity and effectiveness of
the program as it expands. Lessons of experience center on the risks of complex project design in the
light of instional and implementation limitations, and the importance of monitoring and evaluadon to
improve design during implenton. The design of the proposed project therefore emphasizes clarity
and simplicity in procedures and flexibility, through its progra tic  ppr , to incorporate
adjustments over time. The project is limited in georphic scope, focusses on development of
management and implementation capabilities, and provides technical support for project implementation.
It fiuther includes a strong monitoring and evaluation component.
13. Rationale for Bank Involvement. ITe project would underpin a priority long-term program of
the Government and continue the Bank's strategy of supporting development of social services to reduce
poverty. The project would establish an effective model for delivery of improved primary health
services. The main value-added of the Bank's participation would be its emphasis on building
management and implementation capabilities at the municipal level, strengthening the framework for
sector policy development, and evaluatig project outcomes.
14.   Agreements Readied. During negotions, the Govement agreed that: (a) the four policy
studies identified be carried out in accordance with terms of reference and schedules satisfactory to the
Bank, results be reviewed with the Bank, and for the study on cost recovery, Bank comments be
considered and changes introduced in the project oper;dons manual to ensure that saard provsions for
cost recovery are included in each subproject agreement; (b) the evaluation of project impact be carried
out in accordance with terms of reference satisfacy to the Bank; (c) a central project coordinator and
technical and administrtive subcoodiatos, satisfactory to the Bank, be maintained throughout the
implementation period; (d) an annual review of project impl  be carried out jointly with the
Bank by September 30, and the proposed budget, financing and implemnentaton plans for the following
calendar year be prepared for that review and that a mid-implementation review, assessing overall
progress towards project objectives and incorporatng key impact indicators, be carried out in 1997; and
(e) project accouns be audited anmnally by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and copies of
the audited statements be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year. A condition
of effectiveness would be: (a) appointment of at least 12 tedcnical, adminisrve and legal staff to the
central project coordinatng office; (b) submission to the Bank for review of the final project operatons
manual, including procurement procedures and prototype bid documents, and a detaied plan and system
for financial reporting, accounting and auditing under the project, satisfactory to the Bank; and (c) signing
of three MOH'departmental agreeme, to support project start-up. A condition for dIsbursement
under the iional development component, for activiies direcdy affecting the departments or
municipalities (i.e., excluding project promotion and other genera activities) would be the signing of
corresponding agreements between the MOH and the departments, and the deprten  and the
municipalities.   Condiltions for disbursement under municipal subprojects woud be the
operationalization of the Social Investment Fund, including appointment of a Director General and a
Board of Directors, issuance of by-laws, and signing of a contract between the MOH and the FIS; an
the signing of contracts among the FIS, fiduciaries and municipalities.



15.    nvfronrmental Aspecs and Progam    Objectve Categies. The prject does not present
signffican envronmeal risks. Measures will be taken to ensure appropriate disposal of waste fom the
first level health institutions to be assisted. A "C" envionmeal rating -is hus proposed. The project
relates primarily to the poverty alleviation and human resources categories, and would also contribute to
public sector management objectives.
16.   Benefits and Risks. The project would contribute to improving directly the health status and
welfare of nearly 8 million individuals In the project area, Including 6 million classified as poor.
Experience gained through implementation would SUpport the broader introduction of the basic package
of primary health services at the municipal level. Increased local participation iould serve to strengthen
demand and accountability for the provision of those services. Ite project would further strengthen
policy development and management capabilities within the public health system, in particular, planming
and implementation capabilities at the municipal level. The main Implementation risks relate to
institutional weaknesses. To reciuce these risks and mitigate the complexities of evolving financing
practices and procedures, the project will incorporate and build upon the ongoing process of
decentralization but not depend upon the outcomes of tha process. Rather, the project would focus on
developing effective management and implementation capacity for delivery of primary health services at
the municipal level. The implementationrisks will further be reduced by the project's focus on selected
departments, and the application of guidelines and criteria to ensure adequate institutional and financing
capabilities of municipalities before launching municipal subprojects. An additional risk is that municipal
interest in participating in the project would fail short of expectations. Ihis risk has been inmized by
selecting departents committed to objectives of the project, that would promote and support municipal
participation. A final risk, that municipal co-financing demand or capacity would be insufficient, has
been reduced through establishment of limits for subproject size, which consider municipal revenues, and
by the incentive provided through central grants for subproject financing. In addition, the cofinmcing
guideiines would be monitored and adjusted as necessary to ensure the adequacy of the grant mechanism
as an incentive for municipal investment.
I..   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
