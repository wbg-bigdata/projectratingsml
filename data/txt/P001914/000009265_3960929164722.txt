MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDAITON OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTN ATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO MAURrTIUS FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJEC
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to Mauritius
for US$12.37 mnillbn is submitted for approval. The proposed Loan would be on IBRD terms
with 17 years maturity with 5 years grace and would help put in place the country's national
Environmental Investment Program (EIP) including the policy and institutional arrangements
and the physical inputs necessary to have physical planning, land use control, inErastructure
investments and envii-nmental protection managed in a coordinated way. Co-financing totalling
US$400,000 would be provided by ICOD, an international NGO.
Bac9round
2.        Mauritius consists of a group of islands in the Indian Ocean, with a total area of
about 2045 km2. The densely populated principal island (population 1.0 million in 1985) is
located some 800 km east of Madagascar. Less developed outer islands are dispersed over a
wide area of the Indian Ocean; the largest of them (Rodrigues with a population of 30,700 in
1985) is 650 km east of the main island of Mauritius.
3.        The country has a narrow natural resource base. Sugar cane is grown on almost
90 percent of the island's total cultivable land (45 percent of total land area), and the sugar
industry employs about 20 percent of the labor force (1987). Despite significant expansion since
the early 1970s of other sectors, notably manufacturing and tourism, sugar cane exports still
represent the largest source of net foreign exchange earnings, and the export tax levied on sugar
output contributes about 11 percent to Government's current revenues.
4.        Following the successful implementation of successive stabilization and structural
adjustment programs in the early 1980s, the economy of Mauritius experienced an export-led
economic boom which resulted in a near doubling of per capita incomes in less than a decade.
Between 1985 and 1988, real GDP growth averaged about 7 percent annually and it is estimated
that GNP per capita topped US$1,800 in 1988. Past successes notwithstanding, there are
indications that this boom is now moderating and a period of more sustainable growth has set
in, as evidenced by the comparatively modest growth in GDP of about 3.9 percent in 1989.
This decline in the rapid pace of economic growth was inevitable, given that Mauritius had
attained full employment and could no longer rely on additional growth by deploying idle labor
resources. Rapidly rising wage rates, reflecting the tight labor market situation, have continued
to exert upward pressures on the rate of inflation, which was 12.6 percent for 1989 and is
expected to remain in that neighborhood for 1990. Despite these developments, the country's
balance of payments remains in overall surplus and international reserves have risen to almost
five months of imports.
5.        Over the past decade, the environment has been a key factor in the economic re-
vitalization of Mauritius: a rapidly growing textile and garments sector has drawn on high quality
groundwater and surface water resources to feed its process requirements, and the industry has
used the assimilative capacity of rivers and streams to dispose of its wastes; a dynamic tourism
sector has been built on the attractions of the natural and cultural environment, while
agricultural productivity has been maintained by the heavy use of fertlizers and pesticides.



- 2 -
6.         However it has become clear that the capacity of the country's natural resources to
sustain these vital roles is under threat, without management and investment, environmental
problems will inhibit further development, and reduce the quality of life of Mauritians. At this
threshold and at a time when the country is pursuing sound macroeconomic policies, Mauritius
has seized the opportunity to focus on an approach that aims to prevent future costs from
environmental degradation, and to develop an overall strategy which integrates environmental
concerns into its development process. Mauritius is one of the first developing countries to
develop a comprehensive National Envronmental Action Plan and a US$109 million
Environmental Investment Program to implement the plan. The NEAP and the EIP have been
endorsed by Government, representatives of the private sector, local and international NGOs,
and full funding has been assembled from a variety of donors. The World Bank has assisted
with the preparation of the NEAP an the EIP and in the coordination of donors to assure the
EIP's funding.
7.         The Bank's strategy in Mauritius over the next few years will focus on helping the
country to sustain and extend the benefits achieved so far mainly through economic and sector
work and very selective lending. This means helping the country to maintain its generally sound
macroeconomic policy posture and macroeconomic discipline; to promote increased productivity
within the sugar industry's current level of production, leading to a gradual release of resources
for other uses, and improve the price incentives and other institutional systems for agricultural
diversification; to diversify industrial exports and fulfill the necessary related skill and
institutional requirements; and finally, to assess the environmental impact of resource utilization,
and help integrate the environmental concerns into the country's development process.
8.        A Country Economic Memorandum entitled 'Mauritius: Managing Success'
(Report No. 7661-MAS) was issued on July 10, 1989.
Project Oblecffves
9.         The objective of the proposed Project, which consists of high priority components
of the ETP, is to put in place the policy and institutional arrangements necessary to have
physical planning, land use control, infrastructure investments and environmental protection
managed in a coordinated and rational way. The Project would also enable the government to
take immediate remedial measures including selective investments to reverse the trend of
environmental degradation and to develop a system of environmental monitoring and analysis
for setting environmental standards and assessing the viability and cost-effectiveness of future
investments.
Prolect Description
10.       The Project would finance high priority elements of the EIP consisting of
investments, studies and technical assistance and help reinforce the process of coordination
among donors. The components of the EIP to be included under the Project consist of- (i) the
National Physical Development Plan; (ii) environmental laboratories; (iii) design and engineering
studies for an industrial park, (iv) design and implementation of a sanitary landfill site and
rehabilitation of present dumps; (v) integrated pest management and research; (vi) marine



-3-
conservation; and (vii) establishment of the Black River Gorges National Park The above
mentioned components would enable the government to: (a) strengthen the process by which
parcels of land are defined, identified, allocated, transferred subdivided, registered, valued and
taxed to ensure protection of natural resources and historic architecture; (b) implement systems
of sewerage and solid waste collection and disposal; assess the impact of industrial effluent and
emissions from industry on the environment and the health of the population; (c) assess the
impacts of pesticide and fertilizer use on the water resources and health of the population of
Mauritius; (d) establish marine parks and conservation program including management plan for
marine resources and a monitoring program to assess any adverse impact from development on
marine resources; and (e) establish a terrestrial conservation program including the country's
first national park. A breakdown of costs is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Mauritius
are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8996-MAS dated November 16, 1990, is also attached.
Rationale for Bank's Involvement
11.       Government has given environmental proteA- ion high priority. The Bank's strategy
has been to assist the Government in developing an overall strategy which integrates
environmental concerns into its development process. This has involved Bank assistance to the
Government over the last two years in its efforts in developing a policy, institutional and
legislative framework and an investment program for environmental protection and
management. In view of the cross-ministerial nature of the topic and the complexity of
formulating environmental policy, the Bank should play an important role in assisting the
Government in establishing a long-term program that will be critical to the island's economic
development and in assisting with donor coordination.
Actions Agreed
12.       The following measures have already been taken by Government (a)
establishment of a National Environment Commission (December 1987); (b) approval of a
White Paper on a National Environmental Policy (June 1990); and (c) establishment of the
Environmental Protection Department (October 1989) and appointment cf its Director (June
1990). The following assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations and
incorporated as covenants into the Loan Agreement: (i) National Physical Development Plan to
be completed by December 31, 1992; (ii) prior to establishment of the Central Environmental
Laboratory (CEL), presentation of its proposals to the Bank to clearly define the testing
responsibilities and limitations for each of the environmental laboratories, followed by the
implementation of the agreed division of responsibilities; (iii) land acquisition for the CEL to be
completed by June 30, 1991; (iv) establishment of the Park Advisory Board by June 30, 1991;
and (v) creation of the Black River Gorges National Park by December 31, 1991.
Establishment of a Technical Steering Committee for integrated pest management and research,
and effectiveness of the co-financing agreement with ICOD for marine conservation would be
conditions of disbursement for the respective Project components.



-4-
Benefits
13.       Benefits which can be attributed specifically to the project include: cost-effective
allocation of environmentally related infrastructural investment; environmentally appropriate
location of new investment; envirommental quality control; treatment of tourism and industriaL
including toxic waste; improved disposal of solid waste; development of cheaper, mofe
environmentally benign forms of pest control for agriculture; the conservation of the only area
of original indigenous forest remaining in Mauritius, and the associated flora and fauna, with
the options which the conservation of this genetic stock keeps open for the future in terms of
potential development of medicine, food production, and basic research, and the recreational
opportunities provided by the National Park; conservation of the marine environment, and the
development of recreation opportunities via the Marine Parks.
Risks
14.       The main risks in the execution of the Project relate to the government's ability to
make the institutional and policy adjustments necessary to achieve implementation, including
enforcement. However, such risks are dirninished by: the nature of the NEAP process itself,
which intensively involved Government and the private sector at all levels as well as other
interest groups including national and international NGOs, and therefore assures commitment in
the setting of objectives, priorities and delivery mechanisms; the progress already made in
institutionalizing environmental policies; and the track record of the implementing agencies in
other programs. These risks are also minimized by Government's awareness of the likely
economic costs of delays or poor implementation of the project because of the high dependence
of the Mauritian tourist economy on a high quality environment. Finally, the external visibility
of the program vis-a-vis the donor and environmental communities will be an important
incentive for Government to implement it.
Recommendation
17.        I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.
