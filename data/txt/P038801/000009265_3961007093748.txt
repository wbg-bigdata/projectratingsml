MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE CREDIT
TO BURUNDI
1.          I  submit for your approval the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation for a proposed Emergency Credit to Burundi for SDR 9.8 million
(US$14.6 mitlion equivalent), on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help
finance an Emergency Assistance Project (EAP). The Credit would support the
importation of high priority items on a broad positive list of imports, as IDA!s contnbution
to the Government's broader Emergency Recovery Program (ERP).
2.          The Emergency. On October 5, 1994, a new government was formed in
Burundi after a long transitional period characterized by violence and destruction. A year
earlier, three months after Burundi's first democratic elections, the President of Burundi
was assassinated together with the President and Vice-President of the National Assembly.
This gave rise to an outbreak of violence which continued into early 1994, costing more
than fifty thousand lives. In this critical situation, the National Assembly designated a new
President of Burundi in February 1994. On April 6, the new President was killed, together
with the President of Rwanda. While Burundi succeeded in avoiding the ensuing
massacres that devastated Rwanda, these events aggravated long-standing ethnic tensions
and made it more difficult for the country's main ethnic groups to reach a consensus on
modalities of power sharing. Sporadic violence has continued to occur in parts of the
country. Encouraged by the international community, the Bunmdians worked out the
modalities for power sharing in a "Convention de Gouvernement", which was signed six
months later by 12 of the 13 poltical parties. The Convention's implementation has
begun: on September 30, the interim President was swom in as President followed by the
formation of a new government headed by the former Prime Minister. Progress has been
made in solving the politico-institutional crisis; the new equilibrium is fizle, however,
and needs to be consolidated through rapid and tangible improvement in the economic and
social conditions of the population.
3.          While overall destruction of public infrastructure was limited mainly to
communal buildings and small roads and bridges, the crisis caused a sharp drop in both
food production and the delivery of social services. This contributed to the human
hardship caused by the crisis, in terms of the breakdown of social bonds, widespread theft
and destruction of personal property. The health and education sectors were among those
most seriously affected. A sizable part of the health services personnel was killed or fled,
medical supplies and vehicles were stolen and distribution channels broke down. The
number of teachers declined by about 20% in primary schools and 40%/O in secondary
schools. Many prnmary schools have not reopened in rural areas, and enrollment rates
have dropped to less than 25% of the level of September 1993. Furthermore, the lack of
teachers and learning materals has severely affected the quality of education. Re-



2
estaishment of basic social services to their nonnal levels would facilitate the return of
displaced persons and refugees to their homes.
4.          The agricultural sector, which accounts for about 50% of the country's
GDP, has suffered losses, primarily in the areas of livestock, food crop production and
forestry. The livestock population has been reduced by about 10%, while food production
in 1994 is estimated to have declined by some 22%0 For the first time, Burundi has to rely
on large-scale food aid to meet its needs. Uncontrolled exploitation by refugees and
displaced persons has recently exacerbated the destruction of forest area, estimated
consrvatively at about 20,000 ha  Tools and seeds are needed urgently to enable
agricultural production to play its key role in getting economic growth back on the
positive track in 1995.
5.          Private sector activity, the main engine in Burundi's strategy for export-led
economic growth, was severely affected by the crisis. In urban areas, the level of
business confidence declined sharply and pnvate investment came to a standstill due to
security concerns. In rural areas, many entrepreneurs lost some or all of their stocks
and equipment. Preliminary estimaces assess the destruction of business property
during the crisis at about US$20 million. Small scale enterprises were hit particularly
hard. Beyond the resumption of confidence in interal security, some direct assistance
to private entrepreneurs will be needed.
6.          The Economic and Financial Situation. Prior to the political crisis,
Burtundi bad a mixed track record under the adjustment program, started in 1986 and
supported by three Stnrcturrl Adjustment Credits from the Bank as well as SAF and
ESAF  angements with the IMP. The country successfully implemented monetary
and foreign exchange policy reforms but encountered difficulties in limiting the role of
the public sector and reducing the fiscal deficit. During the adjustment period up to
1992, average growth in real GDP (3.7%) was above the SSA average. Following the
outbreak of severe disturbances, real GDP declined by 16% and the cost of living
increased by 28% (1994 data compared to 1992 levels). Over the same period,
government revenue fell by 35% in real terms due to the decline in business activity
and the collapse of external budgetary assistance. This brought about a fiscal crisis and
the accumulation of goverment arrears. By mid-September 1994, arrears exceeded the
equivalent of US$20 million, including US$6 million to extemal creditors. A number of
enterprises that had not been paid by government became unable to service their debts to
commercial banks, which, in turn, had to borrow from the Cental Bank. The
Government is beginning to take corrective measures so that this vicious circle does not
lead to a crisis of the banking system.
7.          Against this gloomy picture, the government's economic and financial
management has remained firm throughout the crisis. For example, government
current expenditures during the first eight months of 1994 were only two-thirds of their
level for the comparable period in 1993, in nominal terms. Moreover, the govermment



has refrained from imposing any tmde restrictions. This was made possible, in part,
by satisfactory reserve levels and the recent increase in world coffee prices.
8.          The govemment intends to continme its policies of prudent economic
management. The objectives for 1995 are to reduce the inflation rate to 10% from 17%
in 1994, and increase real GDP by 10% (to a level that would remain 8% below that of
1992). The goverfnent intends to restrict the budget deficit to a level that is compatible
with the inflation target and the pnvate sector's credit requirements. Moreover, net
foreign exchage reserves would be kept at their end-1 993 level, to provide a comfortable
cushion aginst unforeseen shocks.
9.          Despite these sensible policies, the budgetary situation is expected to
remain tight for the remainder of 1994 - particularly if all arrears are to be cleared - as
well as in 1995 because of rehabilitation needs, especially in the social sectors. The
budget will also have to cover part of the cost of restructuring the bankdng system. In the
last quarter of 1994, approximately US$23 million would be needed in additional
budgetary assistance mainly for social sector spending and the repayment of arrears For
calendar year 1995, Burundi would need US$246 million in total extemal assistance
(inclusive of technical assistance and humanitarian aid). This amount is 14% lower than
the 1991-92 average of US$286 million.
10.         The Govermuent's Recovery Efforts. Emerging from a widespread
parlysis caused by the political crisis, the transitional authorities acted simultaneously
on several fronts. On the political front, they promoted national reconciliation through
power sharing. Following a revision of the Constitution, a new president and
government were recently appointed. On the economic front, the government has
endorsed an Emergency Recovery Prograun (ERP), which was prepared with the help of
IDA The government has already started to rehabiltate infrastructure in health and
education with the help of existing projects. Also, special training programs for newly
recuited primary school teachers have been initiated and school materials distnbuted to
orphans. Seeds have been distributed in affected areas to ensure an improved crop during
the next harvesting season.
11.         MindfIu of its medium term development objectives, the government
invited the IMP and IDA in September 1994 to assist them in designing a macro-
economic framework for 1994 and 1995. The govenmuent's broad strategy was outlined
subsequently by the Minister of Finance during a donors' meeting in Paris on September
28, 1994. The main objectives are to restore internal security in order to halt the
deterioration of the economic situation and establish a sound basis for an uptun in
economic activity. In January 1995, another IB  mission is scheduled to visit Burundi to
prepare the ground for a possible ESAF program. The policies envisaged to resume the
econonic reform process will be outlined by the authorities in a Policy Framework Paper
(PFP) covering the period 1995 through 1997, to be agreed with the Bretton Woods
institutions in early 1995.



4
12.         IDA's Support to Recovery. IDA!s assistance strategy will consist of
support to the recently appointed government to: (i) ensure the delivery of services in
priorty sectors such as health services and primary and secondary education; (ii) help
coordinate emergency operations by the international commumty; and (iii) revive the
economic reform process. In order to achieve these objectives, a three-fold approach will
be pursued.
13.         First, in light of the changed conditions in the country, IDA has started to
restructure more than half (US$116 milion) of the undisbursed project portfolio of
US$190 million. The projects identified for restructuring are in agriculture, the private
sector as well as infrsitucture. The focus will be on rehabilitation, capacity building,
improved delivety of servces and the promotion of the private sector through extensive
contracting out. Also, the Social Action Credit (US$10.4 million) which has recently
become effective will allow IDA to support the reconstruction effiort in the areas of
rehabilitation of social infrastructure, capacity building at the local and central levels, and
labor intensive employment generating activities.
14.         Second, IDA has helped the government prepare the ERP, which involves
outlays totaling US$53 million over a period of about 13 months through early 1996. The
ERP would be supported by the proposed EAP (US$14.6 million), the allocation of funds
under ongoing IDA projects, and by other donors (Schedule A, Tables 2a and 2b). Third,
IDA is preparing to undertake new investment lending in the health, telecommunications
and other sectors, and resume the adjustment dialogue, initially through a medium-term
economic program As indicated earlier, the PFP is now under preparation. The policy
discussion in the conex of the PFP will serve to re-evaluate the content of the tird
Structural Adjustment Credit (SACEI) and the timing of the release of its second tranche,
now scheduled for June 1995.
15.         IDA's assistance is being closely coordinated with that of other donors. A
number of donors, who will together contribute an amount of US$35.5 million,
participated in the preparation of the ERP. The ERP was discussed at a donors' meeting
in Paris on September 28, 1994. A follow-up round table meeting in Geneva wil be
convened by UNDP in cooperation with IDA, in March 1995. Several donors have
expressed interest in participating in forthcoming reviews of the Public Investment
Program (PIP).
16.       Emergency Recovery Program - Objectives and Desaiption.  The
government's ERP aims at rebuilding capacity, addressing Burundi's most pressing social
needs, and restoring long-term economic growth potential. Its purpose is to minimize
social unrest and economic hardship, and help the country return to pursuing long-
standing human resource development objectives. The ERP wil become an integral part
of Burundi's 1995 budget, and is based on estimated needs in five priority sectors (health,
primary and secondary education, agriculture, inrastuture and private sector).  It
comprises import finance, civil works and technical assistance to: improve the social
conditions of the population; create employment; rehabilitate infirtructure; and restore



5
basic government fimctions.  Total rehabilitation needs amount to US$53 mi}lion
(Schedule A, Table 1, column 2). For health and education, the most affected sectors,
special programs have been included such as: (i) a social fund for health, covering medical
expenses for parts of the population that cannot afford them, and technical assistance
necessary to hire and train qualified medical staff and provide employment incentives; and
(ii) special funds for education, to allow for the training of new teachers and financial
support of families and children severely affected by the crisis. Eligibility for subsidies
under the social fund will be subject to a certificate of hardship. A proposal for
implementation of these schemes based on existing structures is under preparation by the
Ministries concerned. Not included in the ERP is humanitarian assistance to refugees
(total needs in 1994 are esfimated at US$156 million), which is being provided through
continued direct donor financing coordinated by the UNDP. The key e'-,.nents of the ERP
in each sector are summarized below.
17.         Health: US$18.7 million (35%). Health accounts for the largest part of
the ERP due to the extreme deterioration of the public health system and the top priority
attached by donors to the financing of current non-wage expenditures in the sector. These
expenditures, together with the constitution of appropriate worlkng stocks of genenc
drugs, account for about half of total costs to be financed under this component.
Rehabilitating health centers and providing needed equipment and vehicles that have
disappeared represent another 12% of total costs.  Three special programs account for
the remaning 39%: (i) strengthening management capabilities and providing temporary
technical assistance; (ii) improving the nutitional intake of children and feeding mothers;
and (iii) subsidizing the cost of medical insurance for those most affected by the recent
events (social fund).
18.         Primarty and Secondary Education : US$18 nillion (34%A). After
having been closed for about five months, the public school system was reopened in
March 1994. However, enrollments in September 1994 were at least one quarter lower
than they were in September 1993, before the events; moreover, the quality of education
has deteriorated. The objective of the ERP is to help reverse the sharp drop in the
enrollment level in primary and secondary education and to ensure a minimum acceptable
level in the quality of education. The rehabilitation and construction of classrooms
account for about half of total costs under this component; the purchase of text books
accounts for 22%; and that of other equipment and vehicles amounts to another 9%MO. The
remaining 17% cover three special programs: (i) training of teachers in aress of short
supply; (ii) providing education in basic democratic values proposed by UNDP; and (ii)
subsidizing education costs for orphans and children of displaced persons.
19.         Agriculture : US$9.6 milion (18%).  Massive dislocation of the
populaton and persistent insecurity associated with the crisis haMv disrupted the rhythm
of agricultural actvity, causing a decline in both production and marketing. Overall
needs for tools and seeds account for 60% of this component of the ERP. Rehabiltation
of rural infrastructure accounts for 28% of total cost and purchases of vehicles and
bicvcles account for a further 90/O. The remaimng 3 % is devoted to improving the



6
enviromnent in areas damaged by fires (and development). A significant share (30%/O) of
emergency finds has already been committed under existing projects for distributing
seeds and tools and for rehabilitating smaLl processing plants, such as coffee washing
stations.
20.         Infrastructure : US$3.5 million (7°%). Overall needs are limited to
US$1.5 million for repairs of small bridges, US$1.6 million for the replacement of
canalization tubes in Bujumbura and US$0.4 million for the rehabilitation of communal
buildings and small electical repairs. Of the total amount, works valued up to US$1.0
million could be executed through labor intensive schemes by local communities
(admnistrative buildings, transport). Finacing of overall sector needs has already been
secured.
21.         Private Sector: US$3.2 million (6%). Financing needs are linited to
two proposed operations beneting low income groups. The first requires US$1.1 million
for the financing of labor intensive works in rural areas, such as reforestation and rural
infastructure in areas not included under the Agriculture and Infirstrcture allocation
discAssed above. Already underway with donor support, these activities are crucial in
generating cash for the rural population and necessary for the resumption of small scale
trdig and artisan activities. The second operation, which has already been initiated by
another donor agency, is estimated at US$2.0 million and seeks to provide low cost
financing for small rural investments.
22.         Financing Plan. The total estimated cost of the ERP in 1995 is US$53
million, to be expended over a 13-month period beginning in February 1995. Of this
amount, US$17.0 million represents secured financing, consisting of US$2.9 million of
IDA funds allocated under ongoing projects and US$14.1 nilion of assistance from other
donors, including Belgium, European Union, France, Germany, UNDP, and USAID.
Outstanding financing requirements of US$36.1 million are to be met as foliows: US$14.6
mhlion form IDA, under the proposed EAP; and a total of US$21.5 million in financing
from Belgium, European Union, and Germany (subject to final agency approval in some
cases). Needs covered under the ERP by sector and sources of funding are shown in
Schedule A, Tables 1 and 2 (also Technical Annex F), and reflected in the fiscal accounts
and the balance of payments (Technical Annex 1, Tables 5 and 6).
23.          ERP Implementation. The ERP would be filly implemented within 13
months. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the execution of the ERP (see
Technical Annex E, Chart 1). Five existing agencies, which are involved in coordinating
projects and activities in the respective sectors, will be responsible for implementing the
ERP: (i) the health project implementation unit; (i) the education sector implementation
unit; (iii) the department of agriculthral planning; (iv) the department of roads and
buildings; and (v) the private sector development implementation unit.  These
implementaion units will have direct access to the Mister of Finance. They wull follow
up on the execution of the project and facilitate fast identification and resolution of
implementation problems, as well as intersectoral and donor coordination. The Central



7
Bank (BRB) will be in charge of preparing ^  submitting disbursement requests and
collecting relevant documents for private sector imports.
24.         The proposed project - EAP. The EAP (US$14.6 million), in addition to
US$2.9 million already reallocated to address sector needs under various projects in
agriculture, education, health and infrastructure (Schedule A, Tables 2a and 2b), would be
IDA's contribution to the ERP. The Credit consists mainly of a quick-disbursing
component which will finance selected imports (Schedule B, page 1) supporting key
sectoral expenditures included in the ERP. In addition, a small amount (US$150,000) has
been included for technical assistance, including (i) audits, and (ii) contingency for
urgently required consultancy assignments not covered by other financing sources.
25.         The EAP has to be viewed as a catalyst for mobilizing emergency
assistance from other donors in a timely and organized manner. Out of the overall sectoral
needs included in the ERP, other donors are planning to provide direct budget support in
social sectors as well as general balance of payments support; also, a number of donors are
restructuing existing activities and proposing new ones. IDA would fill remaining gaps
under the ERP by financing priority imports.
26.         The proposed Credit would finance 100% of the foreign cost, insurance
and freight of goods imported from eligible sources based on a positive list of imports
(Schedule B, page 1). The import categories chosen correspond to the general needs of
the sectors. For agriculture, these categories correspond primarily to items 2, 3, 4, 9 and
II of the positive list; for education, to items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9; for health to the entire
positive list; for infrastructure, to items I through 5 and 7 through 9; and for the private
sector, to the entire positive list. Specific amounts have been allocated to the five
components of the project corresponding to the five sectors (reflected in Schedule B,
Disbursements Category). The EAP will be implemented utilizing the arrangements
described for the ERP in paragraph 23 above. Procurement procedures are similar to
those established for the third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC m, Credit 2376-BU),
which have worked well. Retroactive financing (back to September 1, 1994) up to an
aggregate amount of SDR 1.96 million will be acceptable for eligible imports.
27.         Lessons Learned From  Other Emergency Operations.   Similar
operations in war-tom countries have shown the importance of: (i) a simple program
design; (ii) an implementation scheme based on existing units; (iii) strong government
commitment with frequent communication between the Borrower and the Bank; and (iv)
well focused technical assistance. These lessons have been incorporated into the design of
the proposed operation.
28.         Rationale for I]DA Involvement. The Country Assistance Strategy for
Burundi, presented to the Board on June 4, 1992, was geared to the country's long-tenr.
development needs. It focused on the goals of promoting sustainable private sector-led
and export-oriented growth, poverty alleviation and a reduced role for the state. These
goals remain valid, but for the short term, IDA's strategy is to help the country meet its



8
needs for immediate reconstruction and recovery. This will pave the way for resuming
implementation of the reform program. The installation of a president and a new
govermnent with fuill constitutional powers represents a crucial step towads the
restoration of peace and security, and ".e resumption of economic growth. At this critical
time, Burundi needs a resumption of donor assistance, which (excluding humanitarian
assistance) fell in 1994 to half its pre-crisis level. IDA involvement will serve as a catalyst
both for donor mobilization and for the coordination of emergency assistance of various
donors within the 1995 budget. Already, IDA's support, through the EAP, was found to
be essential in preparing the ERP, and government and the donors are looking for
continued IDA involvement.
29.         Agreed Actions.
a) ERP Management. The implementation of the ERP will be
facilitated by using existing management units under the direction of the Minister of
Finance. Disbursement and procurement will follow procedures established under SAC
HIl and be handled by a service in the BRB. The ERP will be integrated into the 1995
budget which, in turn, will be prepared by the goverrnent in close cooperation with
the IMF, IDA and other donors.
b) Reform  Measures.  The appointment of a coalition government
representing the country's main ethnic groups indicates the authorities! willingness to
foster the peace process and national reconciliation. The government has adopted the
ERP and expressed its commitment to sound sectoral and econornic policies. Policy
implementation will be facilitated by the preservation of continuity in key positions
(Minister of Finance, Munister of conunerce and Governor of the Central Bank, in
particular) and the choice of qualified managers in other key positions (Minister of
Planning and Minister of Agriculture).
30.         Environmental Aspects. The EAP is not expected to have any negative
environmental impact (Environmental Rating: C).
31.         Project Benefits By providing support at a critical time and by triggering
coordinated assistance from the donor community, the proposed operation would help the
government restore basic conditions for economic and social recovery and continued
adjustment. Timely assistance will help to reduce economic hardship and facilitate
economic recovery while providing a safety net for disadvantaged groups. At the same
time, it should improve the prospects for the return of political stability. The credit would
also enable the Bank to demonstrate its readiness to respond to the country's needs and
thereby sustain the momentum for reform. In the absence of this support, it would be
extremely difficult for the new government to prevent a further deterioration in the
economic and social conditions of the population, which could lead, in turn, to renewed
large-scale violence.

32.         Project Risks. The risks of political instability and a relapse into violence
are high, particularly if the situation does not improve in neighboring Rwanda and
instability prevails in the region. Moreover, project implementation would suffer if the
weakening of institutional capabilities experienced over the past twelve months does not
continue to be reversed. Indications of strong donor support for Burundi's recovery and
return to sustainable growth have already provided encouragement for finding solutions to
the political crisis. With a new government committed to peace, and economic reform
already in place, important steps have been realized towards the establishment of the
political and institutional pre-conditions for implementing the EAP and prepanng the
ground for long-term recovery. Quick, positive results from the ERP would be an
important factor in reducing the risk of prolonged social hardship and renewed political
instability.
33.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit of SDR 9.8
million would comply with the Articles of the Association and reconmnend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
