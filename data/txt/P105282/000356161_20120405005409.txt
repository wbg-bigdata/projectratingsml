F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project was to: (a) strengthen policy making and management
functions of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare; and (b) provide critical inputs to
sustain the referral system needed to support essential health services.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Following project restructuring in Nov 2009, the Project Development Objectives (PDO)
was modified to read as follows: (i) strengthen the policy framework and selected
management functions of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW); and (ii)
improve pre-service training and selected components of the basic package of health
services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

1. Country and sector background. The years of civil war (1989 - 1997 and 2001 -
2003) left Liberia one of the poorest countries in the world, with a Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita of approximately US$151, and had a devastating effect on
many of the systems that contribute to good health: basic housing, water, electricity,
sanitation, roads, education, and health care. 8 For example, much of the physical
infrastructure and equipment that was crucial to the health sector was destroyed during
the war- many hospitals and clinics were burned to the ground, very few county hospitals
had fully functional laboratories, and most county hospitals and health centers were
without running water, electricity, or functioning basic sanitary systems. In addition,
there was a severe shortage of human resources (0.04 physicians per 1,000 population
and 0.2 nurses per 1,000 population, assuming 3.4 million inhabitants). This dire situation
was further compounded by a lack of transportation and other communication systems.

2. At the end of the civil war, the health status of the Liberian population was among
the worst in the world. Life expectancy at birth had dropped to 42 years (WHO 2006),
which was below the 45-year average for other low-income countries under stress
(LICUS). Infant mortality was estimated at 157, and under-5 mortality at 235 per 1,000
live births, among the highest in the world in 2004. Malaria was the leading cause of
child morbidity in Liberia, accounting for about 42 percent of cases, followed by diarrhea
with 22 percent, and acute respiratory infections 12 percent. The maternal mortality ratio
(MMR) was also very high, estimated at 760 deaths per 100,000 births in 2004 (UNICEF
2006).

3. In the post-war environment, the government relied heavily on foreign assistance
for the provision of health services. By 2006, 80 percent of the 390 functional health
facilities were being fully supported by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
Similarly, most supplies, drugs, and incentives for health care providers were provided by
relief organizations, and through foreign assistance. Some of these organizations,
however, were beginning to phase-out as Liberia moved from a relief to development
stage, leaving the government to face the challenge of ensuring a relatively smooth
transition from humanitarian relief to longer-term development.

4. Rationale for Bank assistance. The technical support and resources needed to
sustain access to basic health services during the transition from emergency relief to
long-term development were assessed to be beyond the capacity of any one international
partner working in Liberia. Given this, and the dire state of Liberia‟s health system, as

8
  The Comprehensive Nutrition and Food Security Survey conducted in Liberia in 2006 revealed that 68 percent of
households covered by the study had no access to improved water sources, and 76 percent had no access to sanitary
facilities. The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP, 2006) reported that only 41 percent of the population
has access to health services.

                                                          1
reflected in its poor health outcomes, an emergency response by the Bank was considered
critical. Consequently, the Health Systems Restructuring Project (HSRP) sought to: a)
provide emergency support to close the sector‟s financing gap, which remained even after
commitments of about $30 million per year from other major donors; and b) (given the
Bank‟s comparative advantage) focus on supporting three somewhat marginalised pillars
of the National Health Plan (NHP): support systems; human resources for health; and
infrastructure development- most donors tended to focus on delivery of the basic package
of health services (BPHS). In addition, it was recognized that the Bank had extensive
experience in facilitating the execution of complex projects in which many donors
contribute to a common agenda, and there is a need for intersectoral synergies. The
project was consistent with the OP/BP 8.0 criteria for Liberia (Rapid Response to Crises
and Emergencies), and consistent with the Interim Strategy Note (ISN), and Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5. According to the PAD, the PDO is defined as: „to contribute to: (a) strengthening of
policy making and management functions of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare;
and (b) providing critical inputs to sustain the referral system needed to support essential
health services‟. The PDO in the FA and Project Appraisal Document (PAD) are worded
slightly differently.9 For the purpose of this ICR, the definition in the FA will be used.

6. The key outcome indicators related to the project‟s objectives as defined in the PAD
were: (i) Semi-annual reviews of: (a) progress made to implement the Recipient's
National Health Plan; and (b) forward looking action plans to address problems identified
at the time of these reviews; and (ii) one functional secondary referral center per county.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
    and reasons/justification

7. The WB Board approved first-order restructuring of the HSRP in January 2010. The
proposed changes were necessitated by three factors: (i) the PDO and indicators were
considered to be beyond the scope of project; (ii) the project was under-budgeted and
commodity prices were rising more than initially foreseen; and (iii) implementation
progress was sub-optimal due, mostly, to management problems.

8. During restructuring, the PDO was modified to read as follows: (i) strengthen the
policy framework and selected management functions of the Ministry of Health and
Social Welfare (MOHSW); and (ii) improve pre-service training and selected
components of the BPHS. The key outcome indicators related to the modified PDOs, as
defined in the amended FA were:



9
  In the FA, the objective of the grant was: “to assist the Recipient in its post-war efforts to reconstruct its health sector,
through: (a) strengthening of policy making and management functions at MOHSW; and (b) providing critical inputs to
sustain the referral system needed to support essential health services?.

     (i)     Policy in the area of human resources for health, health financing, and
             decentralisation of health services, respectively, submitted to Cabinet;
     (ii)    Number of county head offices using fully computerised ICT systems in the
             production of their quarterly HMIS report;
     (iii)   Annual student enrolment for the school year at: a) TNIMA, and b) AM
             Dogliotti‟;
     (iv)    Number of courses offered at AM Dogliotti with an active laboratory; and,
     (v)     Proportion of targeted health facilities that improved at least 10 percentage
             points in equipment scores according to the accreditation criteria.

9. The status of outcome and intermediate outcome indicators in the original and
amended FA are outlined in the Data Sheet.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10. This project focussed on supporting three somewhat marginalised pillars of the
NHP (support systems, infrastructure and HRH), and the Government of Liberia‟s (GoL)
transition from emergency/humanitarian relief to development. As such, it can be inferred
that the benefits achieved under this project accrued to the entire population. Certain
groups, however, were expected to receive special focus- mothers and children under 5-
because of the Government focus under the National Health Policy and Plan (NHPP) to
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by focussing on improvements in
maternal and child health (MCH), and health personnel due to the severely constrained
human resources capacity in Liberia.

1.5 Original Components

11. The following three components were consistent with the operational and integrated
framework for implementing the National Health Policy, and National Health Plan.

(a)    Component A- Support Systems (appraisal estimate: US$2.37 million/30.3% of
estimated cost; actual cost: US2.48 million/28.4% of actual cost)

12. This component aimed to support the operational capacity of the MOHSW to
effectively manage the project by, inter alia, strengthening its management capacity, and
expanding its monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, through the provision of technical
advisory services, training, and incremental operating costs.

(b)     Component B- Human Resources (appraisal estimate: US$2.83 million/36.3%
of estimated cost; actual cost: US2.38 million/27.3% of actual cost)

13. This component supported the hiring of clinical teachers (including medical doctors,
nurses, midwives, and allied health workers) for purposes of training and supervision of
clinical care staff. It aimed to provide technical assistance and training to public
education institutions to reform their curriculum to enhance the education level of
medical doctors, nurses, and allied health workers. It also aimed to provide, training,

                                            3
technical advisory services, and equipment to enhance the technical and managerial
capacity of key staff in the Recipient‟s health sector including, inter alia: (a)
transportation costs of trainers and trainees; (b) per-diem of trainers and trainees; (c)
workshops; (d) seminars and courses; (e) rental of training facilities and equipment; (f)
acquisition of training equipment and teaching material; (g) internet access to online
learning; and (h) study tours.

(c)    Component C- Infrastructure and Equipment (appraisal estimate: US$3.31
million/ 42.4% of estimated cost; actual cost: US$ 3.87million/44.3% of actual cost)

14. This component supported rehabilitation of essential medical facilities and medical
teaching institutions, including the maternal and child wards at the John F. Kennedy
Hospital and the A.M. Dogliotti College of Medicine (COM). In addition to this, it also
supported the acquisition of basic medical supplies, medical emergency equipment,
radiology and laboratory equipment, communications equipment, energy generating
equipment, Internet connection equipment, ambulances for MOHSW clinics and health
centers, county hospitals, and the John F. Kennedy Hospital.

1.6 Revised Components

15. At restructuring, a decision was made to modify project components.10 Specifically,
in an effort to improve project efficacy, and maximize the efficiency of existing funds, a
decision was made to:

   (i) drop certain activities that were being supported, at least in part, by other
development partners or that were not essential to providing the BPHS: (a) development
of health contracting policy; (b) revision of curriculum to enhance the education level of
medical doctors and nurses; and (c) procurement of solar panel, medical emergency
equipment, and communications equipment for MOHSW clinics and health centers,
county hospitals, and/or the JFK Medical Center.

   (ii) add certain activities that would improve the sustainability and effectiveness of
investments (i.e., ICT, medical, laboratory, and radiology equipment): (a) training of
middle level managers and technical support system staff (i.e., ICT, equipment operation
and maintenance, and procurement); (b) training of health workers; (c) provision of waste
management equipment and supplies for referral centers; and (d) renovation of waste
management facilities at target hospitals.

1.7 Other significant changes

16. Significant changes were made to: (i) the project‟s schedule; and (ii)
implementation arrangements.




10
     The basis for this decision is discussed further in Section 2.2- implementation.

                                                         4
  (i)    Project Schedule. The closing date of the project was extended at restructuring
         by one year- from October 1, 2010 to October 1, 2011.

  (ii)   Implementation Arrangements. The project's institutional arrangements were
         modified in an effort to: (a) improve efficiency, and (b) bring project
         arrangements in line with the current Ministry‟s institutional hierarchical
         framework. There were two changes.

           a. It was decided that the 'Steering Committee' function referred to in the FA
              would be undertaken by the existent Deputy Ministers' Briefing (headed
              by the Minister of Health and Social Welfare).

           b. A new coordination mechanism was added to the existing arrangements,
              and the FA: a monthly Project Monitoring and Coordination Meeting
              (chaired by the Project Coordinator) was established to discuss
              implementation progress and challenges.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

17. Sufficiency of background analysis. This project was prepared in the aftermath of a
protracted war, in a country with severe capacity and infrastructure constraints, and
limited mechanisms for donor coordination. In this environment, it is commendable that
the project was prepared in a short 4-month period. Unsurprisingly, however, given the
country context and this short project-preparation period, the background analysis was
insufficient. This was compounded by limited technical analysis of either the cost
effectiveness of the proposed intervention, or alternative approaches, and a poorly
designed results framework.

18. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design. The PAD states that the
project design built upon existing Bank experience in emergency reconstruction and
contracting services from nongovernmental providers (Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chad,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone) and human
resources strategies developed for similar conditions in other African countries. The
lessons learnt from these examples and reflected in the design are not specifically
mentioned in the PAD. However, a review of a few of these examples (Afghanistan,
Bosnia, and Sierra Leone), shows that they also included institutional capacity building
and human resources development in addition to what might be considered pure post-
conflict interventions (restoring services and rehabilitating buildings). The rationale
appears to have been that restoring health services without addressing either human
resources constraints or the capacity to manage the system would not lead to sustainable
outcomes.

19. Assessment of project design. Given the post-conflict environment, and the limited
time devoted to project preparation, the design of the project may have been overly

                                           5
ambitious, with limited coherence between inputs and expected outputs, inadequate
costing of activities, and an insufficient attempt to sensitize and build the capacity of
stakeholders and implementers to Bank procedures (e.g. procurement) that needed to be
followed. This could have been avoided- or at least planned for- given that weak capacity
and a lack of familiarity to Bank procedures (as discussed in paragraph19 below) were
posited as potential risks.

20. Lending Instrument. The Project was funded by an Emergency Recovery Loan
(ERL). Since Liberia's arrears to the Bank and to other MDBs had not yet been cleared,
this project was proposed in the context of IDA's framework for pre-arrears clearance
grants. This funding instrument was consistent with the emergency nature of this project,
and the fact that (as mentioned above) it aimed to support the health sector in its
transition from emergency/ humanitarian relief to development.

21. Assessment of risks and their mitigation. At the start of the project, a number of
risks were assessed. The overall risk of the project, however, was not rated.

22. Identified risks included: a) the external environment; and b) the health sector itself.
Despite the recent political stability and resumption of economic growth at the time, the
general socioeconomic and political environment was still considered fragile, with
continued poor service delivery threatening to erode the government‟s popular support.
Even with high growth rates, many Liberians were expected to remain in extreme poverty
for the near future. Specific key risks included:

    Volatility in donor funding and lack of long-term commitment: this presented a
     major risk to the achievement of project outcomes given the relatively small
     funding envelope by the Bank, and the reliance on donors for the achievement of
     some of the defined results. The intention was that this risk would be mitigated by
     encouraging the government to seek both multiyear commitments from major
     donors and a common program of work. In reality, this risk was mitigated through
     project restructuring which tightened the results chain and developed a clear link
     between project-specific activities and outputs/outcomes.

    Weak management capacity and weak incentive environment. Capacity in both the
     MOHSW and the provider network was weak, with those considered capable often
     lacking the authority to make decisions. These risks were mitigated through
     technical assistance, including on-site “tutoring? of local staff by external experts.
     While it was envisioned that incentives would also be used to reward specific
     desirable behavior change, this was not realized. Weak implementation capacity
     was a challenge during much of the project implementation period.

    Slow execution of tasks. Given that the Bank was new to Liberia- and hence the
     client was unfamiliar with Bank processes and guidelines- delays in the execution
     of project activities were envisioned early on. The intention was that this risk would
     be mitigated by preparing TORs and bid packages as early as possible during
     implementation, and by working closely with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry

                                             6
          of Public Works during the first couple of procurement cycles. In reality, these
          mitigation strategies were inadequate. For example, procurement was a consistent
          complaint echoed by stakeholders interviewed for the ICR, who cited significant
          delays.

23. Adequacy of government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement, and/or
participatory processes. Being new to the health sector in Liberia, the Bank worked
closely with the government, the COM, international donors (USAID, EU, DFID, Irish
AID, PMI, and Global Fund), UN partners (UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, and UNDP) and
NGOs to appraise the Project.

2.2 Implementation

    (i)      Mid-term Review

24. A mid-term review (MTR) of the HSRP took place in February 2009. By this time,
the project had disbursed XDR 0.79 (14.11%) out of the XDR 5.6 million grant. During
the MTR, the task team determined that the likelihood of achieving the PDO by project
closing was moderately unsatisfactory for the following reasons:

          Strengthening of policy-making and management functions of the MOHSW:
           despite significant efforts made in the development of health financing policy, and
           the area of Health Management Information System (HMIS)/ Information and
           Communications Technology (lCT), the lack of progress in the development of a
           human resources policy, and weak capacity in essential support systems
           (especially procurement), resulted in progress toward this PDO being rated
           moderately unsatisfactory.

          Providing critical inputs to sustain the referral system needed to support essential
           health services: considering (i) slow progress in recruiting clinical teachers and
           staff in areas of critical shortages and in rehabilitating health facilities, and (ii)
           good progress of procurement of medical and laboratory equipment, but the
           relatively small contribution of the Project to making this equipment functional,
           progress toward this PDO was rated moderately unsatisfactory.

25. In order to address these challenges, project restructuring was recommended at the
end of the MTR mission. Unfortunately, the restructuring process lasted about a year.
Among the causes for this delay was non-compliance with one of the conditions for
project effectiveness which had been waived: the development of a medical waste
management plan (MWMP) acceptable to the Bank. In addition to this, pending activities
included a Project Operations Manual (POM), Interim Financial reports (IFRs), and the
environment and social management framework (ESMF).




                                                 7
 (ii)          Project Restructuring

26. In order to address design and implementation issues identified during the early
stage of implementation and through the MTR (e.g., overstated PDO and indicator targets,
budget pressures due partly to rising commodity prices) and to improve pace and quality
of implementation, the project was officially restructured in January 2010. At that date,
the project had disbursed XDR 2.59 (46.25%) of the grant. The restructuring introduced
the following changes: (i) the PDO was scaled down to better capture the project
contribution; (ii) the project‟s scope of work was modified to accommodate the current
sector situation and commodity price increases; (iii) project‟s performance indicators
were modified; (iv) implementation arrangements were adjusted; and (v) the project
closing date was extended from October 1, 2010 to October 1, 2011.

 (iii)         Performance

27. This project was prepared as an emergency project under OP/BP 8.0, in a post-war
country with extremely limited institutional and implementation capacity. As such, and
given both the short project lifespan and the small amount of project financing, the
project was not expected to produce substantial medium to long-term outcomes such as
improving health status. Rather, it was designed to build key institutional and
implementation capacity over the very short (original) 3-year implementation timeframe.
Project performance is assessed over two phases: pre-and post-MTR.

   a) Pre-MTR (July 2007 – Feb 2009)

28. From project effectiveness to MTR in February 2009, project implementation was
extremely slow. This is reflected in very low disbursements of 0.79 million SDR
(14.1%).

29. The slow pace of project implementation and progress is associated largely with
foreseen but underestimated risk factors such as weak institutional capacity, an overly
ambitious project design, and limited understanding of Bank procedures on the part of
counterparts. Specific problems- identified by the review team during the MTR-
included:

        (i)     Lack of in-house procurement capacity within the Ministry;

        (ii)    Insufficient understanding of Bank procurement, financial management and
                  operational procedures (the operations manual was only submitted in
                  November 2009, or 28 months after project effectiveness);

        (iii) limited managerial capacity within the Ministry, coupled with suboptimal
                institutional and implementation arrangements- including the absence of a
                strong coordination mechanism- covering multiple implementing units
                (MOHSW, JFK Medical Center including Tubman National Institute of
                Medical Arts (TNIMA), and A.M. Dogliotti COM);

                                                8
     (iv) Sub-optimal communication among the implementing units themselves and
           between implementing units and the project coordinator's office, resulting in
           severe delays in the information flow between the World Bank and the
           implementing units; and

     (v)   The country context, including unattractive salaries and the security situation
           which made recruiting both health workers in areas of acute shortage and
           external technical assistants extremely difficult. Notably, the weak
           management capacity and weak incentive environment were mitigated
           through on-site "tutoring" of local staff by external experts supported by other
           development partners.

30. Finally, as previously noted, the MWMP, POM, IFRs, and ESMF were prepared
with significant delay. This was linked to a lack of familiarity by the counterpart with
Bank guidelines, limited in-house capacity, and challenges in attracting suitably qualified
consultants to Liberia- a post-war, post-conflict, and high-risk country.

   b) Post-MTR (Feb 2009 – Oct 2011)

31. From the MTR to project restructuring in January 2010, about 32% of the project
funds were spent (1.8 million SDR). In aggregate, 2.3 years (and approximately 8 months
before the original project closing date), only 46% of the Grant had been disbursed (SDR
2.59 million). The project pace picked up significantly following the MTR, particularly
with respect to the procurement of equipment and supplies for health facilities and
teaching institutions, due to the recruitment of an external procurement agent, and more
intensive supervision and hands-on support from the task team. Project performance with
regards to the PDO and IP were both rated MS at restructuring.

32. Project implementation improved further following project restructuring due largely
to continued intensive implementation support from the Bank task team, as well as: a)
streamlined implementation arrangements; and b) improved management capacity. While
prior to restructuring few activities were completed, at project closing, nearly all planned
activities were completed or near completion.

   a. Component 1: Support Systems. Under this component, the project supported
      improvements to both the policy environment, and management capacity
      functions. The key sub-sector policies in the areas of HF, HRH, and
      decentralization were supported, thereby contributing to the creation of an
      enabling environment to implement the NHPP both effectively and efficiently.
      The Project also supported the annual health conferences that brought together
      key stakeholders to evaluate the implementation status of the NHPP and to plan
      the following year‟s program of work. In addition to this, the project strengthened
      two key management functions of the MOHSW – procurement and Health
      Management Information System (HMIS). The project trained 8 procurement
      officers including two at the master‟s level. While further training is required to

                                             9
         reinforce their basic training and to improve contract management, preparation
         and updating of procurement plans as well as the quality of procurement activities
         has improved significantly. Meanwhile, installation of IT and communication
         equipment, as well as training of 5 IT specialists responsible for HMIS and
         networking enabled all 15 counties to use computerized ICT system in the
         production of HMIS reports.

      b. Component 2: Human Resources. Under this component, the Project supported
         various pre-service training activities including recruitment of pre-clinical and
         clinical teachers, procurement of text-books, teaching aids, as well as IT and
         laboratory equipment, rehabilitation/construction of laboratories and other
         infrastructure at the COM, and provision of stipends to students at the TNIMA.
         As a result: two certificate programs to train clinical staff in areas of critical
         shortage (i.e., nurse anesthetist and radiographer) were re-instituted; annual
         student enrollment at the COM and the TNIMA significantly increased; and,
         students at both institutions now benefit from better quality education through
         revised curricula, and improved access to laboratory facilities.

      c. Component 3: Infrastructure and Equipment. Under this component, the
         project: supplied medical and laboratory equipment to more than 200 health
         facilities throughout the country; and recruited about 50 clinical teachers and staff
         in areas of critical shortage- these were placed in targeted areas. Both activities
         contributed to improving the availability and coverage of the BPHS, which
         increased from 32% in 2008 to 84% in 2011. In addition, the project supported the
         rehabilitation of the 2nd and 3rd floor of East Wing at JFK Medical Center to
         improve MCH service capacity of JFK Medical Center. Rehabilitation was
         successfully completed by project closing, with service delivery due to commence
         in the first quarter of 2012. Finally, all four targeted labs at the COM were
         successfully rehabilitated, with 50% of these being used.

  (iv)     Project at Risk status, and actions taken

33.     The project was in problem status for 16 months. The decision to restructure the
project was swiftly taken (within 6 months after the project entered problem status), but it
took longer than planned to effectively restructure the project. However, improvements
in project performance and disbursements could be seen soon after the MTR.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(i)      M&E Framework and Design

34. During project preparation, a results framework was developed with clear
responsibilities for data collection. However, there was inconsistency in the link between
the PDO and outcome/intermediate indicators. In particular, not only was there an unclear
results chain between PDOs and outcome/outputs indicators, but the indicators
themselves tended to overstate the project's contribution to the health sector. For example,

                                              10
the original results framework included indicators that were supported by other
development partners- with no contribution envisioned from the project- as well as
indicators that were completely beyond the scope of the project given the short time span
and relatively limited funding. Two examples of these indicators are: “200 targeted
clinics restored to functionality through the provision of new equipment and staff, to treat
mothers and children? and “15 targeted referral centers with maternity and child wards
restored to functionality through the provision of new equipment?; 2.5 years into project
implementation, there was no change to the status of these indicators. It is therefore not
surprising that these indicators were significantly scaled-back at project restructuring.

35. A significant change made during project restructuring was: (i) a limited adjustment
of the PDO; and (ii) amendments to the project's performance indicators. These changes
tightened the results chain, making the PDO and indicators more reflective of project
activities, the short project period, the difficult country context, and limited budget. In so
doing, the revised results framework allowed for a more accurate assessment of the
project's performance.

(ii) M&E implementation and Use

36. Reporting for the Health Management Information System (HMIS) was
significantly improved under this project through both the procurement of essential
equipment, and capacity development. Specifically, IT equipment was installed in all 15
county health offices, and Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) in 7 counties. IT staff
was trained to use this equipment, in an effort to improve (inter alia, the regularity of)
data collection, and data reporting. Less emphasis, however, was placed on the users of
the data, and the overall quality of data. Notably, the intention was that hardware for
HMIS was the responsibility of the Bank and software (modules)/capacity development
was that of USAID (through “BASICS? program). This arrangement reflects a
commendable attempt by the Bank to maximize the efficiency of project funds.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

   (i)     Environmental Management

37. The environment category of the Project at the time of appraisal was B. The project
triggered BP/OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), due to the possible handling and
disposal of hazardous medical waste. While there was rehabilitation, there was no new
construction, and no land acquisition. Safeguards issues related to this project concerned
development and implementation of the MWMP, although this was significantly delayed.
All planned medical waste management shelters at 5 hospitals were completed.
Distribution of HCWM equipment and supplies procured locally was also completed.

   (ii)    Financial Management & Procurement

a)    Disbursement. As noted previously, 14.11% of the grant had been disbursed by
MTR in February 2009. This was significantly lower than projected. Low disbursements

                                             11
can be attributed largely to limited capacity, and unfamiliarity with the Bank‟s FM and,
especially, procurement procedures. By-end 2009, however, disbursement improved
significantly to 46%. This momentum was maintained for the remainder of the project-
103% of the grant was disbursed by project closing.

b)      Financial management. Project funds were initially managed, satisfactorily, by
the Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) within the Ministry of Finance, despite
the fact that there is no mention of such an arrangement in the Financing Agreement (FA).
Subsequently, the project funds were managed by the Office of Financial Management
(OFM) from the MOHSW, as stated in the FA. Substantial assistance has been provided
to the OFM, especially by DPs (largely DFID, followed by Pool Fund donors), to remedy
the weaknesses identified at appraisal. FM has been rated satisfactory in all ISRs.

c)      Procurement. Throughout most of the project, procurement was challenged by
delays that were at times significant. This can be attributed, first and foremost to limited
knowledge of Bank procurement guidelines, and procurement methods. This was
compounded by the perceived unattractiveness of bidding on „goods‟ in Liberia, because
of concerns surrounding relatively small quantities.

38.     During restructuring, and in an effort to place emphasis on procurement, an
indicator directly related to procurement: “Number of procurement officers in the
MOHSW fully trained in accordance with the Public Procurement and Concessions Act?
was added to the results framework. Specifically, 8 staff was trained, and is currently
working within the MOHSW. This includes 2 senior Procurement Officers who are
expected to be awarded an MSc in Public Procurement Management from the
International Training Center (ITC-ILO) at Turin University, Italy shortly. Procurement
was mostly rated MU or MS in the ISRs.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39. The HSRP project will be followed by a new project- the Liberia Health Systems
Strengthening (HSS) project. Preparations for this new project are already underway. The
project is expected to be submitted for Board approval in early 2013, and should be
funded through an IDA credit (US$10 million), and possibly a Health Results-based
financing (RBF) grant (US$6 million). The new health project will shift away from input-
based financing toward output-based financing in recognition of the need to incorporate a
more responsive incentive mechanism within the decentralized health system.

40. In preparation for this new operation, analytical work is underway in the following
areas: a) an ESW on health financing, which is focused on analyzing technical and
allocative efficiencies; b) technical assistance for the development of an operations
manual on performance-based contracting (PBC) in Liberia; and c) support (along with a
number of other partners) to a health worker motivation/ compensation study.




                                            12
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

(a)   Relevance of objectives

41.     The objectives of the HSRP remain highly relevant to the country‟s current
development priorities stated in the PRSP (i.e., rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering
basic services, building capacity) and the CAS (i.e., increased access to social protection
and social services in the face of shocks, and capacity development). The initial PDO was
based on the assessed needs of Liberia, and in effect aimed to fill gaps not already
covered by other Development Partners (DPs). Specifically, since the BPHS was already
being covered by other donors, the project design focussed largely on the three pillars of
the NHPP that were not adequately covered: infrastructure; human resources and support
systems; in addition to strengthening the referral system. This was consistent with a
traditional role of the Bank as a “lender of last resort?. Project objectives were also
relevant given the Bank‟s comparative advantage.

42.      Importantly, given severe capacity constraints in Liberia after the war (0.04
physicians per 1,000 population and 0.2 nurses per 1,000 population), and limited
institutional capacity, the project attempted to assist with the crucial initial stages of
building capacity for longer-term reconstruction. While improvements to the policy
environment may be regarded as being non-essential in a post-war, post-conflict
environment, this is also arguably the most opportune time to assist the client to begin the
process- albeit a long-term one- of re-building the foundations of the health sector. This
is also consistent with the approach taken in other post-conflict operations, as noted in
paragraph 18.

43.     However, as previously discussed, the PDO was based on an overestimation of
the actual implementing capacity of stakeholders, and therefore had to be modified at
project restructuring. Nevertheless, the revised PDO remained relevant. At restructuring,
the PDO was revised to reduce the project scope by: (i) strengthening only selected
management functions; (ii) focusing on pre-service training; and (iii) refining the focus
from the referral system to basic health services, to fill the unexpected gaps arising from
the less-than- initially pledged aid provided by DPs.

44.    On the basis of this discussion, the PDO relevance is rated substantial.

(b) Relevance of design and implementation

45. Initial design and project organization, which included three components, each
covering one of the three pillars of the NHPP, was aligned to the original PDO. Its design
as an ERL is considered appropriate for reasons outlined earlier (see Section 2.1).

46.   The original project design, however, fell short in the following key areas:



                                             13
          As noted in section 2.3 above, the original PDO indicators overstated the project‟s
           actual contribution to the health sector by, inter alia, including the contribution of
           other development partners.
          Overall responsibility for project implementation was vested in the MOHSW.
           This was risky for the first Bank financed project in the health sector. To alleviate
           the risk, a Program Coordination Unit, led by a Program Coordinator, was created
           within the MOHSW. MOHSW implementation capacities, however, were clearly
           overestimated during project preparation. As a result, there were huge delays in
           project implementation and especially in procurement pre-MTR.
          Given both poor health outcomes in Liberia, and the accepted US$15-25 million
           financing gap at project preparation, it can be inferred that the BPHS was not
           adequately covered. Hence, given the disease burden and the emergency nature of
           the project, the focus of other donors on the BPHS the Bank should perhaps not
           have excluded itself from focussing more on this. This was indeed addressed in
           the restructured project, where the BPHS received approximately 4 times more
           funding than originally planned.

47. Despite these shortcomings, the pace of implementation, along with the
disbursement rates improved after MTR. Importantly, revising the project design (by
scaling it back in terms of sub-components and activities to more accurately reflect the
project‟s resources and the actual implementing capacity) during project restructuring
increased its relevance and consistency with the PDO, and the project was able to
disburse the entirety of its proceeds, by the revised closing date.

48. Project design and implementation relevance is assessed as modest for the period
prior to restructuring and substantial for the period after restructuring. Overall, the
project design and implementation relevance is assessed as substantial.11

49.    Based on a substantial rating of the relevance of objectives, and a substantial
rating of the relevance of design and implementation, overall relevance is rated
substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50.    Despite implementation challenges, the project performed well in some areas.
This assessment of project efficacy will weigh the achievement of both the original and
revised PDO, and take into account original and revised indicators.

       a) Original PDOs and indicators

51.      PDOs. The original objective of the project was to: (a) strengthen policy making
and management functions of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare; and (b) provide
critical inputs to sustain the referral system needed to support essential health services.
These objectives were measured by two KPIs. At project restructuring, neither of their


11
     Modest being 2 and Substantial 3, we have: (2 * 0.46) + (3 * 0.54) = 2.54 or Substantial.

                                                       14
two KPI 2009-level targets, and (understandably) end-targets had been achieved. For
example, while the project aimed to contribute to the development of referral centers in
60% of counties, by project restructuring, only 27% had referral centers compared with
the anticipated 45%. By the revised project closing date, however, the target was
exceeded.

52.     Intermediate outcomes. 2 of the 8 intermediate outcome indicators were fully
achieved by project restructuring; three indicators were not achieved; and three were
partially achieved. That said, the two achieved indicators, and 2 of the 3 partially
achieved indicators were supported by partners- particularly USAID- with negligible
support provided by the Bank financed project in these areas.

53.     A major project achievement during this period was the recruitment and
deployment of clinical teachers and staff in areas of critical staff shortages. While this
indicator was substantially achieved at restructuring, it was fully achieved by the revised
closing date. This is a significant achievement given the difficult country-context. Staff
was placed in clearly targeted facilities, in an effort to improve the coverage and quality
of health services. Meanwhile, the (pre-clinical and clinical) teachers- coupled with the
provision of needed equipment- helped to significantly improve the quality of teaching at
both TNIMA, and COM, thereby assisting in the production of critically needed health
workers. According to the Borrower‟s ICR comments: “A major project achievement
during this period was the recruitment and deployment of all required clinical teachers
and staff in areas of critical staff shortages. The provision of clinical staff in critical
areas of need increased staffing levels at select health institutions. Thereby, enabling
improvements in the quality of patient care and increases in the number of patient visits
and admissions, facility-based deliveries, as well as successful medical and surgical
outcomes.?

54.     Finally, one partially achieved indicator at restructuring- „15 targeted referral
centers with maternity and child wards restored to functionality through the provision of
new equipment‟, was fully achieved at project closing, and the renovation and equipping
of 2 maternal and child health wards at the JFK hospital was substantially completed.
These wards should substantially improve the availability of MCH services. The number
of pediatric beds, for example, will increase from 28 to 88 (214% increase). This will
improve access and coverage of services, and enhance patient care. For this pre-
restructuring project phase, project efficacy is rated modest.

   b) Restructured PDOs and indicators

55.     PDOs. The revised PDO was to: (i) strengthen the policy framework and selected
management functions of the MOHSW; and (ii) improve pre-service training and selected
components of the basic package of health services. By project closing, 4 out of 5 KPIs
had been achieved, with 2 of these exceeded. In addition to improvements in the policy
environment (in health financing, HRH and decentralization) which have provided
critical inputs to much needed health sector reforms, the project also strengthened
selected management functions: HMIS and procurement capacity. Notably, the

                                            15
computerization of the HMIS has helped to improve evidence-based decision-making by
health managers due to regular submission by county health offices of progressively
improved quarterly medical, epidemiology and other reports.

56.     The annual student enrolment at the COM and TNIMA were also exceeded at
project closing, with 87 more students enrolled at TNIMA than the 350 targeted.
Improvement to the BPHS can be inferred through a proxy indicator- improvements to
equipment scores. In this regard, 66% of targeted health facilities showed improved
equipment scores of at least 10% points, compared with the target of 50%. This includes
7 secondary referral hospitals which received modern x-ray and laboratory equipment,
significantly improving diagnosis and case management. In addition, 4 labs at the COM
have been fully rehabilitated. Although 50% of these were “non-functional? at project
closing due to a lack of teaching staff/ equipment, they are expected to be operational for
the 2012/13 academic year.

57.    Intermediate outcomes. 7 of the 8 intermediate outcome indicators were achieved,
with four exceeded. Firstly, the project helped to increase the number of health workers
in Liberia, through its focus on pre-service training in-country. For example, as noted in
the Borrower‟s ICR comments: “revitalized Nurse Anesthesia and Radiography training
programs being offered at the TNIMA enabled this institution to produce its first sets of
Nurse- Anesthetists (12) and X-ray Technicians (41) in over two decades?.

58.     By providing instructors in areas of critical shortage, improving educational
standards and teaching facilities, and providing stipends for students, the annual
enrollment at both TNIMA and COM significantly improved. As a result, 895 health
personnel (including nurses, physician assistants, midwives, nurse-anesthetist, x-ray
technicians, and environmental health specialists) were trained (with 605 of these
receiving stipends) under this project. This substantially exceeded the target of 300. The
importance of this achievement cannot be overstated given the severe post-war health
worker constraints in Liberia.

59.    The issue of stipends was particularly important for the retention of students
within the health system. All supported students are now working in Liberia, since in
order to qualify for the stipends they needed to sign 2-year contracts with the
Government.

60.     Over the course of the project 222 health facilities have been constructed,
renovated, and/or equipped; at a minimum, 1 piece of equipment was received at each of
these facilities. Specifically, 200 health clinics, 15 health centers, and 7 referral hospitals
i.e. 33% (200 of 611) of health clinics, 33% (15 of 45) of health centers and 20 % (7 of
35) of referral hospitals received medical and laboratory equipment through the project.
In addition, 2 targeted wards at JFK Medical center were fully renovated. The
significance of these wards was previously discussed in paragraph 54 above.

61.    For the post-restructuring phase, project efficacy rating is substantial.



                                              16
62.    Weighing outcomes by disbursement pre and post-restructuring for the original
and revised PDO, the overall efficacy rating is substantial.12

3.3 Efficiency

     (a) Efficiency of project execution

63. As noted previously, disbursement prior to the MTR was significantly lower than
projected; approx 14.11% of the grant had been disbursed by February 2009. Following
the MTR, however, this improved significantly. By-end 2009, disbursement had
improved to 46%. This momentum was maintained for the remainder of the project-
103% of the grant was disbursed by project closing.

64. As there is only one category of disbursement, it is possible to track disbursement
by component/activity. However it is difficult to assess the real unit cost of each output or
outcome, when there is no clear linkage between activities and outputs/outcomes. For
example, activities such as infrastructure, human resources and monitoring and
evaluation, as defined in the Project Financial Report, contribute to more than one
output/outcome, and without an analytical accounting system, it is almost impossible to
know what part of the cost of an activity should be allocated to an output/outcome such
as a functional secondary referral centre (one of the PDO indicators prior to project
restructuring). Fortunately, the problem disappears with some of the restructured outputs,
for which there is a direct link between the activity and the output cost.

65. The component “support systems? which aimed to strengthen policy-making,
policy-monitoring and evaluation, and the management capacity of the MOHSW,
disbursed approximately USD 2.37 million (or 27.8% of the grant proceeds). This level
of allocation to the implementing agency includes some equipment costs, and can be
attributed to the extremely low levels of capacity within the MOHSW in the aftermath of
the civil war. Under this component, key policies were also developed- although at a cost
that was higher than initially anticipated, due to underestimation of the capacity
constraints, and the challenges attracting high-quality consultants to Liberia, given the
high-risk, post-war context.

66. A key objective of the project, as repeatedly stated in all official documents, was to
reduce the sector‟s financing gap and focus on the neglected pillars of the NHPP. This
financing gap has been effectively filled: between the two years 2007/08 and 2009/10,
Liberia witnessed doubling of its health expenditure (called institutional health spending
in its NHAs) per capita (from USD18.68 to USD33.44), with total institutional health
spending reaching US$130 million. This brought the institutional spending closer to the
WHO recommended US$34 (US$40 in 2007 constant dollars) and well above the
recommended 5% share of health spending out of the country‟s GDP to14%.13


12
  Modest being 2 and Substantial 3, we have: (2 * 0.46) + (3 * 0.54) = 2.54 or Substantial.
13
  That said, the increase in the donor-share of total institutional health financing (from 72% in 2007/8 to
83% in 2009/10), raises sustainability and predictability concerns. Health financing issues are further

                                                    17
67.     Also, while the number of targeted health facilities has been reached, this was
done at a cost higher than what was initially estimated. Medical and laboratory equipment
of 200 health clinics amounted to US$ 889,000 - compared with an original allocation of
US$ 200,000. The average unit cost was US$ 4,445, compared to an original estimate of
US$ 1,000). However, more equipment was provided than initially planned, because
some DPs were not able to provide all of the equipment they had planned to provide.
Since there is no initial estimate of the unit cost of this additional equipment, it is difficult
to draw any conclusions on efficiency in this area.

    (b) Contribution to efficiency gains in the sector

68.     The project contributed to harmonizing government and donor mechanisms by
bringing donors together around a Government owned NHPP. This is a significant
achievement given the large numbers of sometimes uncoordinated and fragmented donors
in a post-conflict environment. The NHPP was co-financed by the Government and
donors, the HSRP project being complementary to the contributions of other DPs. Also,
technical assistance was provided by all DPs in a coordinated way to strengthen
capacities, especially in fiduciary areas, and in support of the implementation of the NHP.
While the harmonization agenda can be pursued further, this was a critical efficiency gain
for the MOHSW, as it reduced the transaction costs associated with managing different
donor funded activities.

69.     Donor coordination also optimized the planning cycle and initiated the process of
reducing duplication in planning. Specifically, joint DP efforts on strengthening financial
and procurement management capacities within the MOHSW contributed to
strengthening both financial and procurement processes and therefore to an increase in
the efficiency of the sector.

70.    The NHPP, supported by the new policies and plans in health financing, human
resources for health and decentralization, have helped to improve efficiency and equity,
by shifting health expenditures towards: (i) high impact low-cost interventions; (ii)
primary health care; and (iii) services in rural and remote areas.14

    (c) Efficiency of Implementation

71.    The pace of implementation at the beginning of the project was slower than
expected, due mainly to limited capacity of the implementing entities and insufficient
understanding of Bank operational procedures. This resulted in (sometimes significant)
implementation delays. Following project restructuring, the quality and speed of



compounded by the Government‟s decision to move towards scaling up the BPHS to an essential package
of health services (EPHS). Given Liberia‟s free health care policy, the EPHS is also free, but is expected to
be introduced on a phased basis.
14
   The 2012 draft NHAs show that the percentage of administrative costs is decreasing and that the gap
between urban and rural is now negligible.

                                                     18
implementation improved considerably, as evidenced by all key planned project activities
being completed or near completion by project closing.

72.    Operating costs were particularly efficient. This amounted to 2.61% of total
disbursed proceeds, which is low, particularly when one considers the severe capacity
constrained country-context. Even taking into account the consulting services fees used to
contract Crown Agents for procurement TA, operating costs reach 7.54% of project
proceeds, and remains satisfactory.

73.     In light of this discussion of the efficiency of project execution, contribution of
efficiency gains to the sector, and the efficiency of implementation, overall project
efficiency is rated modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74. Despite the challenges during the preparation and implementation of the HSRP, it is
important to recall that this was an emergency project, which was prepared in a very short
period, and in a country plagued by many years of a bloody civil war, with high poverty
levels and severely limited capacity.

75. Recognising this, and based on the ratings above- substantial relevance, substantial
efficacy and modest efficiency- the overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

76. The HSRP supported the initial stages of national reconstruction through rebuilding
the policy framework and essential management functions of the Ministry of Health and
Social Welfare (MOHSW) as well as improving pre-service training and selected
components of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS). In so doing, issues such as
equity- for the poor and other vulnerable populations- have been placed firmly on the
development agenda. The 2010 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) Survey
shows drastic reduction in discrepancies among urban and rural populations.15 That said,
the project‟s direct impact on poverty alleviation, gender aspects, and social development
cannot be ascertained because of the existence of multiple donors.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

77. The overall design of the HSRP hinges on sustainability and long term institutional
    strengthening.



15
     See Annex 3.

                                            19
       77.1 Institutions have been strengthened. The procurement unit and the OFM
       of the MOHSW have been strengthened. Eight (8) procurement officers, including
       two at masters‟ level have been trained to support the MOHSW and project
       specific procurements. The OFM has been established and strengthened mostly by
       other donors (such as DFID, USAID and EU). In addition to this, the MOHSW
       has been equipped with IT and communication equipment, 5 IT specialists have
       been trained on Health Management Information System (HMIS) and networking,
       and monitoring and evaluation capacities have been developed. These skills will
       be particularly useful for the subsequent Bank financed project.

       77.2 Capacity Building. The project contributed to an improvement in human
       resources for health through recruitment of teachers and staff in key areas of
       critical shortage and training of almost 900 health personnel including doctors,
       nurses, nurse-anesthetists, radiographers and other allied health workers...
       Appreciably, even though this area still remains significantly challenged, the
       MOHSW has shown great commitment to improving this area which is at the core
       of effective service delivery.

   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

78. Although noted above, it is worth emphasizing that this project resulted in a number
of positive externalities. The project supported the initial stages of national reconstruction
through rebuilding institutional and implementation environments to better deliver
service in the next phase of reconstruction and development. In so doing, significant
emphasis was placed on the need for evidence-based policy making to guide national
reconstruction efforts, and the critical importance of capacity building efforts- both at the
national and sub-national levels. While gaps remain in both of these areas, it is clear that
the project was successful in raising the profile of their importance.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

79. N/A- a beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops did not take place.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

80. During the life of the Project, a few significant changes have been made to reduce
the risk to development outcomes:

     80.1 The country has developed the National Health Policy and Plan 2011-2021,
     along with sub-sector policies and strategic plans to further improve the
     implementation and policy environment.




                                             20
     80.2 The country has attracted various funding sources (e.g., The Global Fund and
     USAID to support clinical staff/teachers, Italian Corporation to support the COM,
     etc) to support the implementation of NHPP 2011-2021. According to the draft
     2009-10 National Health Accounts (NHA), total institutional health expenditure
     (THIE) as a percentage of nominal GDP has increased from 10% in 2007-8 to 14%.
     Most funding- 83%- comes from donors. This significant funding, of course, brings
     its own challenges not least of which are issues of sustainability and volatility.
     80.3 Also, as discussed above, significant capacity building activities took place in
     areas such as procurement, and financial management.

81. Despite this, risk to development outcomes is moderate due to the following:

     81.1 Despite significant focus on improving capacity building in areas such as
     procurement, a post training evaluation shows suboptimal capacity for some
     procurement officers. Consequently, there remains a need for the Ministry to
     continue periodic and regular hands-on training for procurement staff. While the
     task team has worked with the Ministry to secure funding from other sources to
     continue supporting some activities including training programs, sustainability of
     these is now uncertain. In addition to this, management capacity- for example, for
     middle-level management to improve selected management functions at the
     MOHSW- also needs to be further strengthened (e.g. in M&E- including
     verification and validation).

     81.2 While the MOHSW has been restoring health facilities in an effort to quickly
     scale up the delivery of the BPHS at the facility level, with support from NGOs, the
     availability of high impact interventions remains limited. This is due partially to
     both a critical shortage of skilled health workers, as well as the inadequate
     performance of existing health workers who are often considered to be
     insufficiently trained, and motivated to proactively perform out-reach services,
     especially in hard-to-reach areas. Also, despite challenges financing, and ensuring
     the coverage and quality of services included in the BPHS, this package has been
     expanded to an essential package of health services (EPHS), which includes non-
     communicable diseases. The EPHS has yet to be costed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82. It is important to consider that the project was prepared in the aftermath of a bloody
civil war, in an environment with severely constrained capacity- at all levels- and with a
client that was new to the Bank. This project was prepared in a short time period, became
effective less than a month after Board presentation, and conformed to the procedures of

                                           21
the ERL lending instrument. During project preparation, the Bank focused its support on
the pillars of the NHPP which were not covered by other development partners. In
addition, the Bank used its bargaining power and good relationships with donors to
support NGOs in the transition period (from humanitarian to development assistance),
particularly in the transfer of local know-how to local communities before leaving. As
previously noted, this was a key aim of the project.

83. In spite of this, it is clear that the Bank could have done more to ensure that the
project was better designed- through, for example, ensuring that there was a clear link
between project activities and results; activities were more realistically costed, and less
(overly) ambitious; and, capacity was assessed. Improvements in these design areas
would have improved the preparedness of the client for project implementation. For
example, capacity gaps should have been better diagnosed and training sessions in
Bank‟s procedures, either before or just after effectiveness, should have been conducted.
Also, strong technical assistance for the project operations manual; (operationalization of
the) procurement plans; development of the required environment and social management
framework, and medical supplies and medical waste management plan should have been
provided, and budget allocated for any TA in these areas. Finally, the Bank should have
ensured that training was conducted in Bank procedures, and insisted that the operations
manual be completed soon after project effectiveness. This should have improved
implementation.

84. Based on this discussion, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

85. Supervision missions were regular and regularly prepared Aide-Memoires, and staff
was committed to the project. That said, the project paper stated that quarterly
supervision missions comprised of Bank specialists were needed to ensure a fast pace of
implementation. If the first supervision took place 3 months after effectiveness, the
mission comprised only one Bank staff: the TTL. The following supervision mission took
place 9 months after this. The first and second ISRs show a list of issues for which no
solutions are proposed. It is only with the September 2008 mission that supervisions
became effective- carried out by a Bank team of specialists headed by the TTL.
Periodicity, however, remained bi-annual and not quarterly as planned. Implementation
support was further challenged by the absence of HD support on the ground.

86. In an effort to address problems with the design issues noted above, project
restructuring was recommended during the MTR, and effected approximately 1 year later
due to a number of delays noted earlier.

87. Considering the fact that this is was the first project and the MOHSW was not
familiar with the Bank procedures, the Task Team's support, early on, was not sufficient

                                            22
to address the implementation bottlenecks. Following a change in TTL in mid-2008,
however, the Bank team provided extensive support, supervision and technical assistance
to address implementation bottlenecks and challenges. This coincided with candid
assessment of performance, realism in ISR ratings, with an active attempt made to
highlight key implementation challenges, and proactively seek to address these. All these
efforts eventually resulted in the completion of planned activities, disbursement of the
whole grant proceeds and attainment of most of the revised objectives. That said, over the
life of the project, limited Bank budget constrained the team‟s ability to provide much-
needed TA. Also, there were very limited comments from the CMU, and overall
implementation might have benefitted from stronger support from our technical
specialists in areas such as safeguards.

88. Based on the above discussion, Bank supervision is assessed as moderately
satisfactory.

   (d) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

89.   In view of the moderately unsatisfactory performance in ensuring quality at entry
and moderately satisfactory quality of supervision, overall Bank performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90. The GoL has demonstrated its commitment to improving health outcomes in Liberia,
and has placed health firmly on the Government‟s development agenda. This
commitment is evidenced by concerted efforts in a number of key areas linked to efforts
to improve the coverage and utilization of health services, improvements in health
financing, and a concerted effort to improve the policy environment.

91. Following the civil war, the Government was instrumental in ensuring that the
much-needed needs assessment, which resulted in a Results Focused Transitional
Framework (RFTF), took place as planned, with the support of development partners- in
particular, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bank. This first
step signaled the commitment of the GoL to addressing health issues in Liberia. This was
followed by the official declaration of a free health care policy covering a comprehensive
range of health services described as the BPHS in 2006. This policy was underpinned by
the argument that that fees impeded access by the poor and vulnerable in a post-war
context where few people had the resources to pay for health care. Specifically, securing
equitable access by different segments of the population to an efficient and effective
system of health and education was viewed as a central part of the government‟s quest for
social reconciliation and poverty alleviation.



                                           23
92. That said, while the GoL did abolish user fees, health sector funding was not
increased to meet the additional needs. In addition, the BPHS itself was inadequately
costed, and despite achievements, is undermined by, inter alia, frequent shortages of
supplies; a shortage of clinical health workers; inadequate numbers of health facilities;
and widespread under-the-table payments at facilities. 16 Despite these challenges, the
BPHS has been expanded to an Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) that now
includes non-communicable diseases. 17 Costing of the EPHS is a process that is just
beginning.

93. Health financing in Liberia has improved, and a concerted attempt has been made to
improve the policy environment in an effort to ensure that implementation is underpinned
by sector studies, and in effect, are evidence-based. The GoL‟s contribution, for example,
while remaining stable as a percentage of the national budget (between 7 and 9 percent)
over the last five years, has more than tripled in absolute terms, from $10.9 million in
2006/07 to $32.5 million in 2010/11. Also, cognizant of the huge donor dependence, the
GoL is working to both rapidly improve the efficiency of the health sector and to explore
alternative financing approaches. Importantly, the Government also appears to be moving
towards clarifying its position that its free health care commitment will be limited to the
immediate post war period, with limited re-introduction of fees in 2013.

94. On the basis of this discussion, overall government performance is rated moderately
satisfactory.

 (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

95. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

96. The MOHSW is the project's executing agency. The project was implemented by
three of its departments (Planning, Research, and Development; Health Services; and
Administration) and by the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Medical Center and the COM.
Financial management was initially ensured by a Project Financial Management Unit
(PFMU) in the Ministry of Finance (MOF), but was handed over to the MOHSW's Office
of Financial Management (OFM). Project procurement was handled by “Crown Agents?,
a procurement agency, whose contract ended as of March 31, 2009. In further
collaboration between the PFMU and MOHSW, oversight responsibility for outstanding
procurement under the project was assumed by the International Procurement Agency, a
procurement firm contracted by PFMU to assist large spending government entities to
deal with their complex procurement issues, in conjunction with the Procurement Unit of
the MOHSW.




16
   According to the 2007/8 NHA, for example, the poorest 20 percent of the population reportedly spent as much as 17
percent of their annual income on health.
17
   Expanded services include: non-communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, school and child health and eye
care.

                                                        24
97. A Project Coordinator's office, based in the MOHSW was responsible for
coordinating the efforts of these implementation entities, and serving as the focal point
for the communication between the implementing entities and the World Bank. Project
management- particularly in the pre-restructuring environment- was sub-optimal due
partly to insufficient understanding of Bank procurement, financial management and
operational procedures. Consequently, project implementation suffered from internal and
external management issues such as lack of proactive communication and follow-up by
the project coordinator, and the implementers of the activities (i.e., technical departments
of the MOHSW) (and the Bank). Notably, the delay in restructuring was linked to
unfamiliarity with the required internal (restructuring) procedures by the Bank team as
well as non-compliance by the client to the ESMF, and POM- two dated covenants. Non-
compliance with the ESMF is linked to lack of budgetary provisions resulting in delayed
availability of required funds coupled with significant difficulty in hiring a suitably
qualified consultant.

98. That said, assessment of the performance of implementing agencies must consider
that this was the first Bank-financed project executed by the MOHSW which: a) was not
familiar with the Bank procedures; b) lacked the technical expertise to move some project
activities forward (e.g., policy development, support system, infrastructure); and c) had
difficulty recruiting consultants to help them due to unfavorable country environment.
Consequently, it is clear that implementation challenges and bottlenecks cannot fall
solely on the shoulders of implementation agencies. Notably, project management
improved substantially following project restructuring given various capacity building
activities and increased involvement by key functionaries and focal persons of
implementing entities. Communication and interaction with the Bank task team also
improved with an additional staff recruited in the Project Coordination Office.

99. On the basis of this discussion, overall government performance is rated moderately
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating:

100. Based on the discussion above, the Borrower performance can be rated as
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

101. The capacity of implementers should be carefully considered in the project design,
and implementation, and supported by adequate Bank Budget (BB). Capacity-building
in critical areas of project management should be front-loaded when the capacity of
implementers is low. At the start of the project, front-loaded capacity building activities
(in areas such as procurement, disbursement, financial management, and M&E) should be
planned and budgeted, and implemented strategically, along with carefully planned
follow-up activities. Project preparation and appraisal, for example, should be supported

                                            25
by a key technical and operational specialists who have the skill mix needed to diagnose
and address a broad range of sectoral concerns. Capacity building needs to be supported
by adequate BB- particularly in cases in which there is inadequate staff in the country
office to provide hands-on support during project design and implementation.

102. OP8 is an important and useful instrument if used appropriately to address short-
term issues. An emergency project (under OP/BP 8.0) needs to be prepared quickly, but
this should not deflect attention from having a well-designed project, with a minimum of
basic pre-requisites for a meaningful purpose, suitable design, realistic approach, and
simplicity to generate an effective rapid response.

103. Innovations in design- particularly as they related to capacity constraints- should
be encouraged in fragile, post-conflict countries. Attracting high-quality staff or
consultants in countries with high security problems and no experience with Bank
operations is a difficult task. Successful project implementation in such countries,
however, is completely dependent on having strong technical assistance provided by
experienced specialists. Innovative approaches to addressing this constant problem need
to be strongly encouraged and incentivized.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      As an emergency project after many years of civil war, the project‟s aimed to
support the GoL in its transition from emergency/ humanitarian relief to development
through: (i) strengthening the policy framework; (ii) building capacity, particularly in the
areas of planning, budgeting, financing, management and human resources for health;
and (ii) improving pre-service training and selected components of the basic package of
health services. Its efficiency should thus be measured, first, in terms of allocative
efficiency and, second, technical efficiency.

2.     At project appraisal, total spending on health was around US$60 million. It was
then estimated that the MDG spending target of US$34 per capita would require total
spending of about US$l08 million, leaving a shortfall of US$48 million. In the short run,
the MOHSW had set more modest target of around US$18 per capita.

3.    Other estimates indicated that the major donors (other than the WB such as
USAID, ECHO, DFID, and Irish Aid) were likely to provide annual support in the range
of US$20 million to US$25 million over the next two years, leaving a US$5 million to
US$10 million shortfall in 2007 compared with spending levels in 2006.

4.     In 2009-10, total spending on health reached about US$131 million, or US$33.44
per capita. This is 14% of GDP as compared to 10% in 2007-08. This means that the
MDG spending target of US$34 has been reached. However, the government‟s share of
financing decreased by 10 points of percentage (from 24 to 14%), and the private share
decreased from 1 point of percentage (from 4 to 3%). It is mostly due to external donors
whose share increased from 11 points of percentage (from 72 to 83%) that this target was
reached. This reinforces the initial sustainability and predictability concerns.

5.       The National Health Policy and Plan (NHPP), supported by the new policies and
plans in health financing, human resources for health and decentralization, was
significantly successful in improving efficiency and equity by shifting health
expenditures towards: (i) high cost-effective interventions; (ii) primary health care; and
(iii) services in rural and remote areas. In other words, the sector policy was being re-
oriented towards efficient interventions that better serve the need of the poorest segments
of the population.

6.      Over the period 2007-2010, the allocation of funds to curative care has increased
by 3 points of percentage (from 45 to 48%), while the allocations for: (i) prevention and
public health programs decreased by 5 points of percentage (from 33 to 28%); (ii) health
administration decreased by 2 points of percentage (from 11 to 9%); and (iii) capital
formation for health care providers decreased by 4 points of percentage (from 10 to 6%).
Considering the majority of the health problems for Liberia are preventable which should
be handled at the primary level; there is a need to have a closer look at the efficiency and
effectiveness of the institutional health spending.




                                            31
7.       In 2009/10, the four largest providers as share of Total Institutional Health
Expenditures (TIHE) occurred in: (i) government owned hospitals (26 percent); (ii)
provision and administration of public health programs (26 percent); (iii) Government
health centers/clinics (22 percent); and (iv) trained traditional midwives (8 percent).
Unfortunately, the evolution of these shares is unknown due to the paucity of data. The
only conclusion that can be drawn at this point is that the current allocation should be
revised to provide more resources to public health programs and primary health care
providers, and thus increase efficiency. It should be noted that the decrease of 2 points of
percentage in the Administration allocation resulted in an improved efficiency that could
be further improved with additional reallocations from the Administration to health care
facilities.

8.      Accessibility to Health Providers seems to have increased in great proportion.
According to a 2010 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) Survey, the
percentage of the population that has accessed to health facility within 5 kms is now 86.8
(87.1% in rural areas and 86.4% in urban areas). Also, 89.6% of people in need of health
care visited a health provider (89.5% rural, 89.7 urban). The very low difference between
urban and rural accessibility rates shows a real success in reaching the remote
populations and, certainly, of the decentralization policy.

9.     With regard to health services affordability, user fees have been suspended, which
explains the low share of household financing. Also, only 11.7% of the 10.4% of sick
people in need of health care who did not consult a health provider are mentioning the
cost as the reason (16.9% urban and only 7% rural). This might be explained by the
presence of many poor people in the slums of big cities (such as Monrovia) and/or by a
higher cost of health services in urban settings.

10.     Through equipment and training, the project has increased the technical efficiency
of the health system in Liberia. Among the 53.3% of patients unsatisfied with the health
services provided, only 2.4% complained that the treatment was unsuccessful (3.2 rural
and 1.6 urban). Also, only 1.3% mentioned the lack of trained professionals. The long
wait (particularly at rural health facilities), the lack of drugs, the distance and the costs
were the main complaints, issues that could be addressed by the upcoming Bank-financed
project.

11.     In conclusion, gains have been substantial in both allocative and technical
efficiency.

1.   BACKGROUND

1.1. Prior to 2006, International Non-Government Organizations managed and
delivered over 90% of available healthcare services in Liberia. This situation was
precipitated by fourteen years (1989 – 2003) of devastating civil conflict during which
the national healthcare delivery system virtually disintegrated due to extensive
destruction of health facilities and the exodus of health workers. Complementary to
contributions from other development partners, the IDA/World Bank-funded Liberian
Health System Reconstruction Project (HSRP) was initiated as an emergency response to
the dire need for revitalization of the health sector.

1.2. Consistent with the strategic interventions of the National Health Plan: 2007-2011,
the HSRP comprising three components - Support Systems, Human Resources, and
Infrastructure and Equipment - purportedly commenced on 9th July 2007 with completion
scheduled for 1st October 2010. The project development objectives (PDOs) at its
inception were:

     (i)     Strengthening of policy-making and management functions of the MOHSW,
             and

     (ii)    Providing critical inputs to sustain the referral system needed to support
             essential health services.

1.3. The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the project, conducted in February 2009,
revealed a number of inherent and other constraints to successful project completion.
Consequently, during project restructuring in November 2009 the PDOs were modified as
follows:

     (i)     Strengthen the policy framework and select management functions of the
             Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW); and

     (ii)    Improve pre-service training and select components of the Basic Package of
             Health Services.

1.4. Modifications were also made to relevant targets and indicators in conformity
with the revised PDOs. Additionally, changes were made to key implementation
arrangements and the project period was extended by one year ending 1st October 2011.




                                           36
2.       OVERALL PROJECT ASSESSMENT

2.1. Project Objectives and Design

2.1.1. The intent of the original PDOs remained relevant for attainment of the overall
goal, that is, assistance in reconstruction of the health sector. Notwithstanding, the
revised project objectives provide more measurable indicators with the clarity and
specificity necessary for impartial project assessment and evaluation. However, the
project design involving multiple implementing entities with anticipated technical
assistance (TA) from other development partners was overly ambitious. Specifically,
considering foreseen risks to project implementation including the fragile management
structures of line departments and the lack of firm commitment for provision of TA.

2.2.     Implementation and Operational Experiences/Challenges

2.2.1. Consistent with the PDOs, major project provisions included: (i) policy
development, (ii) recruitment of clinical teachers and staff in areas of critical staff
shortages, (iii) support to designated health training institutions for pre-service training of
key health workers, (iv) renovation and equipment of laboratory and radiology facilities
at select secondary health facilities as well as (v) rehabilitation of pediatric and maternity
wards at a tertiary health facility.

2.2.2. It is germane to note, that prior to enactment of the Public Procurement and
Concessions Act of 2005, “shopping? was the procurement method predominately
utilized by all government institutions. Moreover, the Procurement Units at these
institutions, including the MOHSW, were not generally manned by staff appropriately
trained to conduct a wide range of procurement functions. The HSRP, therefore, provided
for engagement of a Procurement Firm responsible to handle all procurement under the
project and train the staff of relevant procurement structures within the MOHSW.

2.2.3. It is also important to mention that the HSRP was the first IDA/World Bank-
financed project executed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Consequently,
the lack of prior knowledge and insufficient understanding of relevant Bank procedures
and processes impeded timely project implementation. Other factors which negatively
impacted smooth project management and implementation were:

         Inadequately staffed implementing units and line departments compounded by the
          unavailability of technical assistance required to strengthen the management
          capacity of these implementing entities;

         Delayed identification and orientation of key functionaries responsible for
          implementation of various project activities;




                                              37
         Absence of a fiduciary authority or designated procurement specialist , given the
          dearth of in-house procurement capacity, to handle project procurement activities
          prior to recruitment of the stipulated procurement firm; and

         Budgetary shortfalls and gaps resulting in (i) a fifty percent reduction in the
          contract period and number of consultants fielded by the firm engaged to handle
          project procurement; (ii) deferred funding of project operational costs; and (iii)
          delayed compliance with conditions precedent, i.e., Environment and Social
          Management Framework (ESMF) including a Medical Supplies and Medical
          Waste Management Plan (MSMWMP).

3.       OUTCOME ASSESSMENT

3.1.      Period Prior to Restructuring: July 2007 –December 2009 (30 months)

3.1.1. At the end of the 27-month period prior to project restructuring, appreciable
strives had been made towards attainment of planned targets and indicators.
Consequently, several indicators were fully achieved, a few of which were achieved
through external support. Significant amongst the latter was the drafting and adoption of
the Contracting Policy. This policy facilitated contracting of public and private
organizations in order to speed up delivery of healthcare services in underserved areas of
the country and increase health coverage of the population.

3.1.2. A major project achievement during this period was the recruitment and
deployment of all required clinical teachers and staff in areas of critical staff shortages.
The provision of clinical staff in critical areas of need increased staffing levels at select
health institutions. Thereby, enabling improvements in the quality of patient care and
increases in the number of patient visits and admissions, facility-based deliveries, as well
as successful medical and surgical outcomes.

3.1.3. The combined provision of pre-clinical and clinical teachers, textbooks, teaching
aide and equipment improved educational standards at designated health training
institutions, i.e., the Tubman Institute of Medical Arts (TNIMA) and the A. M. Dogliotti
College of Medicine. More significantly, these project inputs enabled both health
training institutions to accelerate production of critically needed health workers.

3.1.4. The accelerated production of medical doctors, professional nurses, midwives and
other health workers during this period, reportedly, resulted in a 10% increase in the
availability of these essential health workers with a corresponding reduction in staff
requirements. At the individual level, for the first time in years, students enrolled at the
two training institutions were able to complete their studies on schedule, instead of the
previously experienced deferred graduation due to the lack of instructors and teaching
materials for key courses.




                                              38
3.2.   Period After Restructuring: January 2010– September 2011 (21 months)

3.2.1. At project completion, all revised project objectives had been achieved and in
several instances planned targets/indicators were surpassed. Major project achievements
are as follow:

      enhanced diagnosis and case management by key secondary referral hospitals (7)
       given the availability of modern x-ray and laboratory equipment as well as
       improved staffing levels in areas of critical staff shortages;

      increased procurement capabilities through appropriate training of staff members
       of the Procurement Unit/MOHSW;

      informed decision-making by health managers due to regular submission by
       county health offices of progressively improved quarterly medical, epidemiology
       and other reports given computerization of the Health Management Information
       System;

      improved learning conditions and environment at designated health training
       institutions through provision of fully equipped science laboratories and adequate
       supplies of textbooks and teaching aides; thereby, contributing to improvements
       in educational standards;

      increased annual enrollment at both health training institutions due to improved
       educational standards and teaching facilities. Remarkably, in Academic Year
       2011/2012 annual enrollment at the A.M. Dogliotti College of Medicine reached a
       record high of 210 students with the largest freshman class of 51 students enrolled
       thus far;

      revitalized Nurse Anesthesia and Radiography training programs being offered at
       the TNIMA enabled this institution to produce its first sets of Nurse- Anesthetists
       (12) and X-ray Technicians (41) in over two decades;

      augmented health workforce, during the project period, with inclusion of 30
       medical doctors produced by the College of Medicine and a total output of 631
       nurses, physician assistants, midwives, nurse-anesthetist, x-ray technicians, and
       environmental health inspectors from the TNIMA;

      increased bed-capacity given recently rehabilitated maternity and pediatric wards
       at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital (JFKMH) resulting in the availability
       of an additional 102 hospital beds. Notably, pediatric beds available at the
       JFKMH increased from 28 to 88 representing an appreciable 214% increase.
       Availability of the additional hospital beds is expected to alleviate overcrowding
       of existing wards, decrease cross infection, and enhance improved patient care;
       and

                                           39
         completed draft policies in the areas of Human Resources for Health, Health
          Financing, and Decentralization. These policies are expected to inform required
          national debates and consultations towards adoption of measures pivotal to much
          needed health sector reforms.

3.2.2. We also note with appreciation the recent acquisition of five (5) long-wheel based
vehicles earmarked for delivery of Maternal and Child Healthcare (MCH) outreach
services and clinical supervision. These vehicles have been assigned to counties with low
health coverage and comparatively high infant and maternal mortality rates (IMR and
MMR).

4.       INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL

4.1. Project Context

4.1.1. The project intervened during a period (2007 – 2011) when Liberia was
transitioning from emergency relief to reconstruction and encumbered with a shattered
economy and heavy debt-burden, disproportionately high IDPs populations, and grim
human developmental indices. The national response to factors underlying these
constraints was embodied in its two-phased Poverty Reduction Strategy covering the
period: 2007-2011. Significantly, during this period most government institutions were
not fully functional and experienced acute shortages of trained professionals in all
disciplines. Thus creating severe capacity gaps in all sectors with grave consequences and
far-reaching implications for national reconstruction and development.

4.1.2. In the health sector, the diminished workforce curtailed the availability of
qualified health managers required to adequately staff line departments and effectively
plan and manage the delivery of healthcare services. Saddled with the immense
responsibility for health sector reform and development, these fragile line departments
found it difficult to cope with numerous functions and competing official demands. These
hindrances limited full participation by the MOHSW in project preparation.

4.1.3. Cognizant of the management capacity gap, line departments were to be
strengthened mainly through the provision of technical assistance by other partners.
However, this was not realized and remained a significant challenge encountered
throughout project implementation. This and other challenges outlined in paragraph 2.2.3
above contributed to the initially slow pace of project implementation. These along with
other concerns and considerations resulted in the project being consistently rated
“moderately unsatisfactory? and, therefore, labeled a problem project. However,
following project restructuring and increased involvement of line departments, project
implementation improved tremendously resulting in two upgraded ratings of “moderately
satisfactory? and a final “satisfactory? rating.




                                            40
4.2. Lessons Learned

       Overcoming challenges in implementation of the HSRP required steadfastness,
        sound analysis and understanding of pertinent issues, and sober reflection regarding
        the way forward.

        Harnessing the strengths of implementing entities through a multi-disciplinary
        network of focal persons, coupled with the lead role and participation of the Project
        Coordination Office in project management and implementation was crucial to
        successful project completion.

       Emergency response projects, by nature, are not best suited to addressing diversely
        acute short-and long-term capacity issues in a comprehensive manner. Therefore,
        the imperative in recovery or reconstruction situations to move beyond
        conventional capacity-building measures and incorporate viable options from
        international best practices and lessons learned under similar post-conflict
        circumstances.

4.3. Recommendations

4.3.1. Given lessons learned from project implementation, the following
recommendations are proffered with the view to enhancing smooth and timely
implementation of other projects in the near future.

       Utilization, despite the controversy regarding Project Management Units (PMUs),
        of an appropriately resourced PMU with full responsibility for project management
        and implementation. The PMU is highly recommended considering continued
        managerial limitations and increased responsibilities of line departments. Working
        in concert with other partners and the Department of Planning, Research and
        Development/MOHSW, the PMU should also be actively engaged in fostering
        comprehensive development of the management capabilities and capacities of key
        units and other structures.

       Institution of start-up periods of 3 to 6 months duration for the PMU to conduct
        preparatory arrangements critical for project commencement and implementation.
        Such arrangements should, where necessary, include required feasibility and special
        studies, review and revision of project documents, and preparation of: (i) clearly
        defined TORs for key project staff; (ii) Project Operations Manual; and (iii)
        Procurement plan and protocols. Other preparatory arrangements should entail
        recruitment and orientation of core project staff; procurement and prepositioning of
        essential goods and services; compliance with conditions precedent; and renovation
        or acquisition, equipment and furnishing of required office accommodation.




                                              41
5.   PERFORMANCE APPRAISIAL OF THE BANK AND OTHERS

5.1. Bank

        Regular implementation supervision missions;
        Late project restructuring, with disbursement at 46% and about 10 months to
         project completion date; and subsequent
        Increased supervisory assistance and support.

5.2. Fiduciary Authorities

      Very satisfactory management of project funds initially by the Project Financial
       Management Unit within the Ministry of Finance, and subsequently by the Office
       of Financial Management (OFM) at the MOHSW.

5.3. De facto partners (DFID, RBHS/USAID-Liberia, CHAI, the EU and ISS/National
     Health Institute of Italy )1

      Substantial assistance towards increasing the financial management capabilities
       and capacities of the MOHSW through establishment and strengthening of the
       OFM.

      Appreciable support for project and related activities such as curriculum
       development, formulation of the contracting policy, background studies to inform
       development of the Health Financing and Human Resources for Health policies as
       well as renovation and equipment of classroom, dormitory, and ancillary facilities
       at the College of Medicine.

5.4. De facto Co-financiers (Global Fund-Liberia, MOHSW and the Special Project
     Fund/MPEA) 1

      Co-financing of advanced procurement training for two procurement officers,
       initial project operational cost, interim salaries for PCO staff, and construction
       and furnishing of the Anatomy Laboratory and ancillary facilities at the A.M.
       Dogliotti College of Medicine.

6.   CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

6.1. Despite implementation challenges, the project was successfully completed with
disbursement at 103% and all revised project objectives (PDOs and key associated
outcome indicators) fully achieved or exceeded in several instances. As anticipated,
these achievements have contributed positively to overall reconstruction of the health
sector. However, given the far-reaching consequences of the civil conflict especially
regarding the crosscutting issue of low human and institutional capacity in all sectors,
continued priority must be accorded to sustainable health sector reform and development.

                                           42
6.2. Therefore, additional support is needed to validate and further elaborate various
policy options through required feasibility and special studies and broad-based
consultations. Special attention is also required in addressing the demonstrated needs for
health systems strengthening through targeted capacity-building in key areas; as well as
assistance in streamlining the organizational structure of the MOHSW commensurate
with its regulatory and policy-making responsibilities.

6.3. It is also imperative to consolidate and build upon gains made in reducing the
disease burden of the population, and also institute effective measures to assure reduction
of the country‟s IMR and MMR which rank amongst the highest worldwide. The
National Health Policy and Plan period: 2011 - 2021, therefore, gives priority to delivery
of the Essential Package of Health Services, which includes a comprehensive range of
MCH services. In this regard, it is our fervent hope that meaningful partnerships will be
forged among various partners and stakeholders to assure attainment during this plan
period of Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5, respectively, related to reduction in
child and maternal mortality rates.

6.4. Other strategic interventions of particular importance focus on strengthening the
human and institutional capabilities and capacities of (a) key paramedical and medical
training institutions and (b) four designated Regional Hospitals and associated Diagnostic
Services Centers. Thereby, enhancing the availability of a critical mass of healthcare
workers – both basic and specialized - and fostering increased availability, accessibility
and adequacy of healthcare services of acceptable quality.
