                         Following a 14-year civil war in 2003, Liberia's basic health systems were in ruins, resulting in abysmal population health outcomes. The people and the government of Liberia have
                         made impressive strides since then in consolidating peace and strengthening national authority, yet the challenges for rebuilding the health system continue to be numerous and
                         diverse. For example, as of June 2008, only 32 percent of existing health facilities were providing basic package of health services. A freeze on user fees has reportedly increased
                         access and utilization of services, but coverage of many health services remains low and inequitable, with a concentration of resources in the capital city. This is due mainly to

                         profound shortages in human resources, lack of support systems, including equipments, supplies and essential drugs, and limited management and planning capacity of the
                         MOHSW.

                         The Health Systems Reconstruction Project (HSRP) sought to provide emergency support to reduce sector's financing gap, which remained even after commitments from the other
                         major donors. Because these donors focus primarily on delivering the basic package of health service (BPHS), the Project intended to address the remaining three pillars of the
                         National Health Policy and Plan (NHPP): support systems; human resources for health; and infrastructure development. The goal was to enable a transition from a post-conflict
                         emergency health delivery system dependent mostly on humanitarian support to a regular health service delivery system through rebuilding the policy framework and key essential
                         management functions of the MOHSW as well as improving pre-service training and selected components of the BPHS.

                         [Implementation Status and Outcomes]
                         While there were some implementation delays initially due partly to limited institutional and management capacity including that of the Bank operations, the pace and quality of project
                         implementation has substantially improved, since the mid-term review and restructuring of the project mainly thanks to streamlined implementation arrangements, better management
                         capacity, and intensive implementation support from the Bank task team. Even though it was the first emergency project supported by the Bank after a long and destructive war, as of
                         September 8, 2011, nearly all planned activities under the Project have been completed and are near completion.

                         a. Policy framework: The key sub-sector policies - in the areas of health financing, human resources for health, and decentralization - have been developed and thereby creating
                         enabling environments to implement the NHPP more effectively and efficiently. The Project has also supported the annual health conferences which bring key stakeholders to
                         evaluate the implementation status of NHPP and to plan the following year's program of work.

                         b. Management function: The project has strengthened two key management functions of the Ministry - procurement and Health Management Information System (HMIS). The
                         project has trained 8 procurement officers including two at the master's level. While further training is required to reinforce their basic trainings and to improve contract management,
                         preparation and updating of procurement plans as well as quality of procurement activities have become much better. Installation of IT and communication equipment as well as
                         training of 5 IT specialists responsible for HMIS and networking have enabled all 15 counties to use computerized ICT system in the production of HMIS reports.

                         c. Pre-service training: The Project has supported various activities of pre-service training such as recruitment of pre-clinical and clinical teachers, procurement of text-books,
                         teaching aids, as well as IT and laboratory equipment, rehabilitation/construction of laboratories and other infrastructure at A.M. Dogliotti College of Medicine, and provision of
                         stipends to students at the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts (TNIMA). As a result, two certificate programs to train clinical staff of critical shortage (i.e., nurse anesthetist and
                         radiographer) have been re-instituted. Also, annual student enrollment at the College of Medicine and the TNIMA has more than tripled and students at both institutions have
                         benefited from better quality education (e.g., courses with an activity laboratory component and clinical practicum, etc).

                         d. In-service: The Project has supplied medical and laboratory equipment to more than 200 health facilities throughout the country. Also, the Project has recruited about 50 clinical

                         teachers and staff in areas of critical shortage and placed them to targeted areas. Both ac tivities (along with support from other DPs) have contributed to the availability of the BPHS,
                         which has increased from 32% in 2008 to 84% in 2011. Also, the project has supported the rehabilitation of the 2nd and 3rd floor of East Wing at JFK Medical Center (which is to be
                         completed by end of September) to improve MCH service capacity of JFK Medical Center.
