                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation continues to be satisfactory. Most of the planned activities under the project have been completed or are near completion. Health financing,
                         decentralization, and human resources for health policies have been drafted and will be submitted to the Cabinet in August 2011. Reporting for the Health Management Information
                         System (HMIS) has been improved by installing the IT equipment in all 15 county health offices. Installation of Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) in targeted counties is well
                         underway. Both nurse anesthetist and radiography training programs are ongoing and will produce 16 nurse anesthetists and 41 radiographers by November 2011. A. M. Dogliotti

                         The project has supported various procurement capacity building activities. However, a post training evaluation shows that the capacity of some procurement officers is still sub-
                         optimal. There is great need for the Ministry to continue arranging for the delivery of periodic and regular hands-on training for the procurement staff. The Ministry agreed to review
                         the assessment report internally and address shortcomings with support from other development partners.
