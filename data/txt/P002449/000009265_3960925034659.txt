PROJECT COEPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 699-SO
Preface
Credit 699-SO for $7.0 million, was signed on June 1, 1977 and
became effective on January 24, 1978. The project, as originally designed,
was to be complIFed by June 30, 1980 and closed December 31, 1980. The
Closing Date wi. extended several times and ultimately set at December 31,
1984. Disbursements amounted to $5.9 million and the remaining $1.1
million was cancelled.
This report consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR)
prepared by the Eastern and Southern Africa Projects Department. The PCR
was prepared on the basis of information contained in the Staff Appraisal
Report, a review of Bank files including supervision and progress reports,
and discussions with Government official and information collected on a
mission to Somalia during September/October 1985.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Project Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments, and the Borrower's response
is included in this report as Annex 1. As a result of these comments, we
have revised para. 3.11 and 3.13 as well as included an Attachment 1 to
Table 2.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THID  HICUWY PROJECT
CREDIT 699-SO
Highlights
1.        Two previous transport projects financed by the Association
assisted the Government in attaining its objectives of upgrading the
primary roads. !2..e project, which this credit helped finance, was the
coastruction of a paved road between Hargeisa and Borama with a link road
to Tug Wajale. The project also included a feasibility study for the
Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib road and the related detailed engineering technical
assistance and machineshop equipment.
2.        The Hargeisa-Borama road was primarily designed to assist in the
transport of cattle, sheep and goats to the northern port of Berbera for
export. The expected benefits would be the savings in weight of the
animals being trucked, and the reduction in vehicle operating costs. Prior
to appraisal traffic on these road sections had been increasing at an
annual rate of 5%. The project road was 132 km in length and was to have
been completed by June 30, 1980.  In fact only 70 km, Hargeisa-Nabadid,
were completed with a delay of 5 years. The cost for the completed section
was slightly higher than the appraisal estimate for the entire 132 km. The
increase in unit costs -an be attributed to inflation due to the extended
time period for construction and also the settlement of the contractor's
demobilization claim. However the delay in the final completion was
largely the result of military activities in the area.  Detailed
engineering had been completed before appraisal. Given all the problems,
the fact that the project road section Hargeisa-Nabadid was completed at
all and with an adequate rate of return, should be regarded as an
accomplishment (para. 5.12).
3.       Points of particular interest arising out of this project are the
the ,ollowing:
(i)   the contract for construction was signed on November 7,
1977 approximately 2 1/2 months before Credit
effectiveness, but action was suspended shortly thereafter
due to the political situation in the country (para. 3.01);
(ii) actual construction started in mid-November 1978. Two
weeks later the contractor's camp came under bombardment
and shortly thereafter came under machine gun fire. The
camp was moved and expatriate staff left the country. Land
mines exploded at a later date killing several people. The
contractor invoked force majeure and the contract was
terminated in December 1980 (para. 3.07);
(iii) after a lengthy delay a second contract was awarded in May
1983 but due to co-financing problems work was not
commenced until March 1984 (para. 3.05);
(iv) despite the problems both contractors produced works of
good quality (para. 3.07); and
(v)   the technical assistance component did not achieve the
desired objectives (paras. 3.19 and 3.20).

PROJECT COPnLETION REPORT
THIR HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 699-SO
1. Introduction
1.01      Somalia's transport infrastructure comprises about 17,700 km of
roads, 3 principal ports and 10 airports, but no railways or pipelines.
Road transport is by far the most important means of modern transport. The
Third Highway Project was designed to assist the Government in attaining
its objectives of upgrading the primary road system to overcome serious
traffic interruptions during rains; enable roads to carry livestock
traffic; reduce high vehicle operating costs; and improve the maintenance
capability of the Civil Engineering Department. The Project consisted of
the construction, and related supervision, of the Hargeisa-Bnrama Road
(114 km), with a link to Tug Wajale (18 km).  The Project also included a
feasibility study of the Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib Road (340 km), technical
assistance, training and machineshop equipment.
1*02      Two previous transport projects financed by the Association also
contributed to the Government's abovementioned objectives. The First
Highway Project (Credits 74-SO and 123-SO) (US$8.5 million) included the
construction of a two-lane road (about 216 km) between Afgoi and Baidoa,
maintenance equipment and technical assistance. Work commenced on January
17, 1968 and was substantially completed by March 31, 1971. The
maintenance certificate due on March 31, 1972 was not issued by Government
because of a dispute concerning the completion of certain outstanding
works. The Second Highway Project (Credit 295-SO) (US$9.6 million)
comprised the construction of a two-lane road (158 kn) between Hargeisa and
Berbera; a feasibility study and detailed engineering for the civil works
component of the Third Highway Project, and technical assistance for
transportation plannning. The construction work was completed about two
months behind schedtle, with the final costs within the appraisal
estimates.  Both projects were completed satisfactorily with economic rates
of return above the appraisal estimates.
1.03      The Third Highway Project was initiated by the 1966 Transport
Survey in which the consultants recommended that a road be constructed
between Hargeisa and Tug Wajale via Nabadid.  The Government requested
IDA's assistance in financing the necessary studies as well as a 44 km
stretch from Nabadid to Borama.  Accordingly, with funds made ava1lable
under the Second Highway Project (Credit 295-SO), consultants completed the
feasibility study in 1975 and proceeded with the detailed engineering and
preparation of tender documents.  Design details and cost estimates were
sufficiently advanced by March 1976 to enable an appraisal mission to visit
the country. Board presentation was April 19, 1977, signing date was June
1, 1977, and the Credit became effective on January 24, 1978. The Project
as originally designed was to be completed by June 30, 1980 and the Credit
closed December 31, 1980.



1.04      The mobilization of the contractor's equipment and personnel
proceeded behind schedule and actual construction did not commence until
mid-November 1978. Work was almost immediately interrupted by military
activity in the area and did not resume at full scale until Ma, 1979.
Further military activity during June and August 1980 resulted in all
expatriate staff withdrawing from the project. At this point overall
progress achieved was 44.5% against a target of 90%. The contractor
invoked force majeure and the Government agreed to terminate the contract
as of December 27, 1980.
1.05      In May 1981 the Government invited bids from other contractors
operating in Somalia and in May 1983 signed a contract for the completion
of the construction from Gebile to Nabadid (14 km). Due to cost increases
the remaining sections could not be conetructed.  In effect this meant that
70 km would be completed out of the 132 km estimated at the time of
appraisal. The Association provided a Credit of US$7.0 million for the
project and the remainder was financed by the African Development Fund
(US$5.5 million equivalent); Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development
(US$8.0 million equivalent); Islamic Development Bank (US$7.5 million
equivalent); with the Government meeting the remaining costs (US$2.0
million equivalent).
1.06      rais completion report is based on:
'i) a review of project files; and
(ii) information collected on a mission to Somalia during September/
October 1985.
It. Project Preparation and Appraisal
OrigLn of the Project
2.01      As part of a tJNDP-financed Technical Assistance Program included
in the First Highway Project, a survey of the transport facilities in the
country and of the proposed transport projects was undertaken in 196566 by
consultants.  The survey identified, among other projects, the road between
Hargeisa and Borama, with a link to Tug Wajale on the Ethiopian border, as
having high priority for development, mainly justified in terms of benefits
to the agricultural activities in the area. The Government requested, and
IDA and AfDB agreed, to include funds in the Second Highway Project to
carry out the feasibility study and subsequent detailed engineering for
this road project. The feasibility study confirmed that the project was
viable in economic terms.
2.02      The 1974-78 Development Plan included the upgrading of the
Dinsor-Gelib road.  he feasibility study and the detailed engineering for
this road were included in the project.
2.03      The Civil Engineering Department (CED) of the Ministry of Pt!blic
Works and Housing is responsible for the planning, design, construction and
maintenance of the highway network in Somalia. The Department is also
partly responsible for the control of traffic using the highways. In 1976,



-3-
when the project was designed, it was generally considered that the
organization and the staffing of the CED was inadequate to handle these
tasks, and it was decided to include technical assistance to strengthen the
CED, and also some machineshop equipment.
Preparation and Apprad al
2.04      The various components of this project were prepared by the
Somali Government, consulting engineers, and the funding agencies'
appraisal mission in 1976. The appraisal of the project took place in
March-April 1976 by a combined mission from IDA end AfDB. At that stage
the consultants had already completed the detailed engineering of the
Hargeisa-Borama road (financed under the Second Ulghway Project).
Pro ect Description
2.05      The description of the project is as follows:
(i) Construction of Hargeisa-Borama road and Tug Wajale link (132 km)
and right-of-way acquisition;
(ii) Construction supervision;
(iii) Feasibility study of Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib road (about 340 km);
(iv) Detailed engineering of (iii), if required;
(v) Strengthening of CED:
a) Technical assistance;
b) Machineshop equipment.
IIL. ProJect Inplementatlon and Cost
Road Construction
3.01      The civil works contract was awarded after International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) including prequalification, in accordance with
Bank guidelines. Invitation for prequalification of contractors was sent
out in August 1976. The report on the prequalification analysis is dated
October 1976, but Government requested, and IDA agreed, to extend the
October 1976 closing date for prequalification applications to enable
additional firms to submit their applications* The contract was eventually
signed on November 7, 1977 approximately 2-1/2 months before Credit
effectiveness. Order to commence works was issued to the contractor on
November 30, 1977 but the Government suspended action oa December 16 due to
the political situation in the country. The suspension order was withdrawn
on December 28. Mobilization was behind schedule and was not completed
until July 1978.

3.02      Actual construction work commenced in mid-November 1978 but came
to a halt on November 30, 1978 due to a bombardment at Gebile.  On
December 12, 1978 the contractor's camp came under machine gun fire with
the result that the camp was moved from Gebile to Hargeisa and most of the
expatriate staff left the country. Work was resumed in February 1979, but
by the end of the month, 50% of the contract time had expired and only 10%
of the work had been completei compared with a target of 32%. Construction
carried on slowly for the following year and as of May 19, 1980, only 39%
of the work had been completed although 96% of the contract period had
expired. There were several reasons for the shortfall in addition to the
military actions referred to. Although the quality of construction was
gQod, the site management of the contractor left much to be desired. The
project was without a site manager for over six months between August 1978
and March 1979. During the period January through to the end of May 1980,
a fuel shortage existed in Somalia resulting in work stoppages. The
contractor eventually brought fuel from Djibouti, at a higher cost, and
increased the storage capacity from 150,000 to 300,000 liters, about a
one-month supply. Shortly thereafter, land mines exploded, damaging two
trucks and killing four persons. Two months later, on August 27, 1980
following an air raid, all expatriate staff resigned. Finally, on October
26, 1980 a land mine exploded, destroying a land rover and killing two
persons. The contractor invoked force majeure and the Government agreed to
terminate the contract effective December 27, 1980.
3.03      In May 1981 a meeting was held in Mogadishu between the
co-financers and the Government to determine the future of the project.
The proposal submitted by the consultant, with the support of the
Government, was to complete the road by force account. The alternative
proposal was to approach other contractors, both local and foreign, who
were operating in Somalia. This latter approach was acceptable to all
parties.
3.04      The Project, as originally designed, was to have been completed
by June 30, 1980. In May 1981, when the decision was made to invite bids
from contractors operating in Somalia, the cost to complete the entire
project roads was estimated to be US$48.5 million compared with the
appraisal estimate of US$26.4 million. Completion of the antire project
was no longer feasibleo Since the road had been completed to a point
approximately 14 km short of a large town, Nabadid, and some of the
earthworks had been done on this section, the Association agreed to
participate in the financing of this section using the uncommitted funds in
the Credit.
3.05      In view of the size of the proposed work (14 km) it was agreed
that the Government would invite bids from other contractors, both local
and foreign, who were operating in Somalia. Four contractors were invited
to bid and two responded. The lowest bidder, was awarded the contract in
the amount of US$3.00 million, about US$215,000 per km. This was lower
than the initial contract which amounted to about US$344,000 per km. A
further problem was that the African Development Fund (ADF) could not
participate as the contractor was from a country which is not a member of
the Fund. This was resolved by ADF agreeing to finance a larger share of
the other project components and the remaining cofinancers financing the
civil works contract. The contractor agreed to commence work on March 1,
1984. All work was completed on January 22, 1985.

3.06      The original contractor's 12-month maintenance period expired in
August 1982, but the Government did not accept the work because of some
cracking of the pavement. The consultants reported that an inspection in
June 1983 showed that all the cracks had disappeared and the final
maintenance certificate was issued on July 18, 1983.
3.07      Despite the problems encountered, the reduced project was
completed to a satisfactory standard, although 3-j years behind SAR
schedule. The original design called for a 70-km road from Hargeisa to
Nabadid, a 44-km road Nabadid to Borama, and an 18-km link Nabadid to Tug
Wajali, a total of 132 km. By completion in January 1985, only the first
70-km section Hargeisa to Nabadid was completed.
Iuplementation Schedule
3.08      A comparison is presented in Table 1 between the expected and
actual dates for various implementation activities. All components of the
project were delayed beyond the appraisal estimates. The initial contract
for the road construction was awarded only three ivonths later than
anticipated but mobilization was slow resulting in a delay of fourteen
months from the target date for the commencement of work. The completion
of the construction work was approximately 4 years behind schedule
primarily due to hostilities in the area (para. 3.02). Other components of
the project followed the same pattern as the contract for construction.
3.09      In regard to the second contract for the road construction an
unreasonable length of time was taken by the Government in the award of the
contract. The original contractor invoked force majeure in December 1980
and the initial meeting of the co-financers and the Government was held in
May 1981 to determine the future of the project.   However, two years
passed and the contract was not awarded until May 1983. The construction
did not commence until March 1984 but this was beyond the power of the
Government (para. 3.05).
Meprting
3.10      The supervising consultant prepared monthly progress reports
throughout their periods of engagement, in addition to two versions of the
final report. Government itself did not prepare any periodic progress
reports. The consultants reporting system, and the Banks supervision
reports, has made it possible to reconstruct the major events in the
execution of this project.

The cofinancing arrangements had to be adjusted at various points
during project implementation. These adjustments were caused partly by the
change of contractor, and partly by the fact that some of the funding
agencies suspended disbursements as a result of Governments default on
prior loans (para. 3.13). In June 1983, the consultants prepared the
following cost estimates to complete the civil work contract including
settlement of the original contractor's claims:
US$
(a) Covstruction                               3,255,356

AD! was not in a position to finance the revised contract, since the
contractor was from a non-member country, but agreed to finance a larger
share of original contractor's claims and the total amount for construction
supervision, except for the Governmert's share.

3.12      In November 1984, it became clear that no disbursements would
take place from IDB. An agreement was reached between GOS, IDB and IDA
under which IDA would take over IDB's share of the cost for the revised
contract. A revised financing plan based on updated cost estimates was
drawn up in March 1985:

3.13      Out of a total share of US$867,000 from the AFESD, only about
US$250,000 had reached the contractor (mainly advance payment) by June 1984
when the AFESD suspended disbursements due to default on the part of
Government on other loans. The overall final cost of each credit component
is given in Table 2 and the actual contribution from the various
co-financers is shown in Table 2, Attachment 1.
Feasibility Study -  Dinsor-Bsrdera-Gelib load
3.14      The 1974-78 Development Program included the upgrading of the
existing fair-weather road joining Dinsor to Gelib. The Third Highway
Project provided for a feasibility study on this route and, subject to the
findings of this study, the detailed engineering.
3.15      During April 1977 the Association suggested to the Government
that it prepare a shortlist of possible consulting firms. In mid-August
1977, the Government proposed, and the Aiciation approved, a shortlist of
five firms. In October the Government sought Association's agreement to
the Somali Consulting Agency forming a joint venture with one of the
shortlisted firms with a view to developing its local consulting services.
The Association responded by agreeing with the proposal as long as the
short-listed firm took prime responsibility. Proposals were invited during
October 1977 to be submitted by January 10, 1978. The Government evaluated
the proposals in February 1978. The Association agreed with the
evaluations. However, in April 1978 the Planning Commission reviewed the
evaluation and reversed the two leading firms. The Association did an
independent evaluation and agreed with the first evaluation and reiterated
its earlier position. The Chairman of the Planning Commission advised the
Association that another committee would be set up to re-evaluate the
proposals so as to come to an agreed view within the Government.
Eventually the Government selected the original firm and a contract was
signed on November 16, 1978 and the study started in mid-January 1979. The
study was thus delayed approximately 15 months.



- 8 -
3.16      The study was to be carried out in two phases.  The first phase
covered the Gelib-Dujuma segment (110 km) and was completed in September
1979. It revealed that the economic justification rested heavily on the
developmental benefits due to the construction of a proposed dam at
Bardera. The economic return was estimated at 16X (with dam) and 8%
without. The draft final report for the entire proposed road was received
in June 1980 and the final report in September 1980. An analysis of the
final report by the Association indicated that in the "without' case the
E.R.R. for the three sections of road ranged from 1% to 6%, and in the
"with" case the range was from 3% to 11%. The conclusion was that there
was no economic justification for the project and detailed engineering was
not done.
Technical Assistance and  achineshop  uipnt
3.17      The% Government retained the same consulting firm for this
component of the project as was being used for the supervision of the
construction works. Financing was supplied entirely by the AFESD. The
contract with the consultants was signed on December 20, 1980.
3.18      The main thrust of the technical assistance component of the
project was to improve the road maintenance capability of the CED. This
was to be accomplished by setting up a continuous program of road and
traffic data collection including a road inventory; maintenance planning
including equipment management and control; an assessment of manpower
needs; and on-the-job and classroom training of staff. In addition,
equipment was to be provided for the machineshop at C$D headquarters. The
7-man technical assistance team consisted of a team leader, one
construction engineer, one maintenance engineer, three workshop
superintendents and one administration officer.
3,19      The first tranche of the equipment was ordered immediately and
the balance procured at a later date. All equipment was installed in the
machineshop. In regard to the technical assistance it can be stated that
overall the results were less than satisfactory, but possibly an
improvement over the original position. This does not necessarily indicate
that the consultants were not competent but rather is an indication that
the approach to training leaves much to be desired. Training of Somali
personnel could only be realised on an on-the-job basis because tae small
number of Somali engineers and technicians did not suffice to organize full
time training classes. However, the number of mechanics, skilled and
semi-skilled laborers employed at the workshop warranted the introduction
of training classes and a program for the training of apprentices. The
Borrower indicated that despite the shortcomings, the training programs
served as useful purpose in that counterpart staff and trainees did, in
fact, acquire some useful knowledge even though it fell short of the
ambitious targets.
3.20      In brief, the borrower expressed the view that the weaknesses of
the training fell into the following categories:
(a) no financial incentive for the counterparts/participants - thus
the most capable and competent trainees did not always volunteer;
(b) as a result of the foregoing the counterparts/participants did
not stay on the job after the consultant/trainer completed his
tour of duty;



- 9 -
(c) no follow-up - it was felt that the consultant/trainer should
return to the country after a stipulated period of time. This
would allow the trainees to work on their own to experience their
own successes and failures and to review them with the
instructor; and
(d) in certain instances the consulting firms, for various reasons,
would replace a competent instructor with one of lesser capacity.
3.21      The borrower felt that in future projects provision should be
made for the Association to provide an incentive payment to trainees. In
this way competition would be created for the training; more persons would
volurnteer; and the best would be selected for the positions.
Perforuance of Consultanto and Contractors
3.22      The original contractor was slow in mobilizing and the site
management was not satisfactory. However, the contractor took steps to
improve the management and the quality of the works was good (para. 3.02).
The second contractor, while delayed initially due to non-payment of the
advance payments, completed the contract slightly ahead of schedule. The
quality of the work was satisfactory. The supervising consultants
performed satisfactorily during the first contract. During the second
contract, however, the supervision team experienced difficulties in the
performance of their duties (quality of staff, etc). Before any damage was
done, the Borrower expressed dissatisfaction to the consultants' head
office. As a result, a senior engineer of the firm visited Somalia in July
1984 and rectified the situation.
Costs
3.19      Actual costs, as seen in Table 2, was US$30.22 million compared
with the appraisal estimate of US$30.0 million. A meaningful comparison
cannot be made, however, as the project was revised and only 70 km of road
was constructed out of the 132 km in the original design. In addition, due
to hostilities, the original contractor withdrew (para. 3.02) and the
contract was awarded to a second contractor after a delay of several years.
IV. Institutional Development
4.01      The CED, under the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, is
responsible for constructing and maintaining roads, and also for
constructing ports and airports which are maintained by other Government
organizations. Technical assistance and professional and sub-professional
training elements of the First and Second Highway Projects have contributed
to increasing CED's planning and operational capability. The Third Highway
Project thus included a technical assistance component as a continuation of
this effort, although the emphasis was on road maintenance. The long term
effect of the technical assistance under the three highway projects is less
than satisfactory. The main reason for this is probably the fact that the
salary structure for the civil service is such that it has been very
difficult to attract local staff to remain in the service for any length of
time. Furthermore, the actual number of engineers graduating from the
University is not sufficient compared with the demand for such personnel in
the country as a whole.

V.  WONOM[C REEALUATION
Objectives
5.01      The appraisal report states that:  "Somalia's road
development objectives include upgrading the primary road system,
which is comprised mostly of earth and gravel roads, in order to
overcome serious traffic interruptions during rains, enable roads
to carry livestock traffic, and reduce high vehicle operating
costs. The Government also aims to improve the maintenance of
its rapidly expanding paved network."
5.02      The project was designed to "assist in attaining these
objectives by financing the construction of high priority road
sections included in the 1974-78 Development Program and to
further strengthen the institution responsible for road
maintenance."
Methodology
5.03      The economic reevaluation for the civil works component
was carried out by comparing the "with" and "without" the project
scenarios. The road sections to be constructed and evaluated in
the SAR were the following: (a) Hargeisa-Nabadid (69 kim) with an
ERR of 24%; (b) Nabadid-Borama (44 km) with an ERR of 19%; and
(c) Nabadid-Tug Wajale (19 km) with an ERR of 21%. However, due
to the hostilities and difficulties in the project area (para.
3.02) only the Hargeisa-Nabadid road was constructed.
Construction works started two years later than anticipated and
took six rather than three years to complete. As a result the
first year that benefits were reaped was 1985 rather than 1980.
The final cost of the completed civil works amounted to US$24.5
million compared with the appraisal estimate of US$25.3 million
(Table 2). The actual construction cost per km was US$349,000,
or an increase of 82% over the appraisal estimate.
5.04      The appraisal applied a 5% growth rate to traffic from
the expected opening year of the road (1980) to 1989, and 4% per
annum thereafter. The value of non-livestock generated traffic
comprised less than 3% of the total benefits as per S4R. For the
purpose of this economic evaluation, it was assumed that: (a)
the economic life of the project is 20 years as per S&R; (b) the
growth rate will be 5. per annum for the first ten years and 4%
thereafter; and (c) the security situation will improve* The
base-line traffic volume for the opening year of the road (1985)
is 191 vpd as compared to 268 vpd in the appraisal report.



- 11 -
5.05      The most recent estimate for non-livestock traffic
level (191 vpd) in 1985, the opening year of the road, is less
than the appraisal forecast (268 vpd) by about 29% (Table 3).
This is largely a reflection of the hostilities in the project
area. As for the traffic composition in 1985, trucks have the
largest share (49%) while buses have the smallest (21X)
(Table 3).
5.06      The growth rate used for livestock benefits is 4X per
annum as per the SAR The most recent estimate of livestock
trucked over the Hargeisa-Nabadid road and exported through the
Port of Berbera was 40,000 head of cattle and about 1.000,0001/
sheep and goats. The combined gross weight of this livestock Is
28.0 million Kg. (Tables 4 and 5).
Economic Reevaluation
5.07      As in the SAR, on the cost side construction and
supervision costs were taken into account. The benefits
considered are: (a) livestock traffic: consists of trucking
livestock in a situation where it was previously walked.
Livestock was not trucked before the road construction because
the bad road would have caused bruises to the livestock and also
the distance walked reduced the revenue from livestock exports.
Since the walk is avoided, livestock lose less weight. In the
present analysis, a 6% weight loss savings was considered as
coapared with 12X at appraisal because little over half of the
road was completed; (b) vehicle operating cost savings (VOC)s
with the opening of the road vehicles operating costs are lower.
This benefit also includes 6 km of reduction in road length as
per SAR Recent estimates of vehicle operating cost savings are
similar to those calculated at appraisal (Table 6); (c) value of
generated traffic: as in the SAR, about two percent of total
benefit was computed; and (d) savings in road maintenance cost:
considered as the sum of (i) the difference in routine
maintenance 'with' and "without" road improvement; (ii) savings
in cancelling of the regravelling operation that would otherwise
have had to take place every four years; and (iii) the cost of
resealing of the new road every six years on average.
1/ The most recent livestock count indicates that about 60,000
head of cattle and 1.5 million of sbeep and goats was
transported through the Port of Berbera. Since two-thlrds of
these originated west of Hargeisa, the project area, the
figures used in the reevaluation are 40,000 head of cattle
and 1.0 million sheep and goats.



- 12 -
5.08      About 70 km were completed which roughly comprises the
Hargaisa-Nabadid road section of the project (para. 5.03). The
reevaluated ERR for the Hargeisa-Nabadid road section is an
adequate 11% (Table 7) as compared to 24% at appraisal. The main
reasons for the reduced ERR are: (i) actual cost per km was
82% higher than the appraisal estimate (para. 5.03); and (ii) the
most recent estimate of non-livestock traffic is 29% lower than
in SAR (para. 5.05).
5.09      The sensitivity analysis shows that in case of a
reduction of benefits by 20% the ERR would drop to 9%, indicating
a marginal project.
5.10      The road has a first year return of 8% compared with
10% at appraisal, both discounted at 102. This would indicate
that the project was marginally premature.
5.11      The project also included other smaller components such
as technical assistance, machine shop equipment and a feasibility
study. As in the SAR, no ERR was calculated for these items.
5.12      In summary, the SAR targets for the project were not
achieved because of the hostilities in the project area. That
the priority road section Hargeisa-Nabadid was completed at all
and with an adequate rate of return, should be regarded as an
accomplishment.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
A. Performance of the Borrower
6.01      Sections 3.02 and 3.06 of the Development Credit
Agreement called for the employment of suitable consultants and
for the appolntment of qualified and competent persons for
certain positions within the Civil Engineering Department. The
Borrower complied with these covenants.
6.02      Section 4.02 called for the collection of data required
for planning of maintenance and improvement and extension of its
highway system. This was only done in a sporadic manner. The
same section called for measures to ensure that axel loading did
not exceed the design standards of the highways. This was not
done. Section 4.03 required the highway system to be adequately
maintained and that adequate funds be included in the budget for
this purpose. The quality and quantity of road maintenance has
been less than satisfactory.
6.03      The delay of two years between the decision to proceed
with a reduced project scope and the award of the contract was
much too long (para. 3.09).
B. Performance of the Association and Lessons Learned
6.04           During the initial stage of the project there was
only one supervision mission per year. However as mobilization,
and hence construction, were delayed the lack of missions
probably was not serious. In the latter stages of construction
the supervision should have been more frequent. The Borrower
felt that there was a lack of continuity in supervision due to
the many changes in Bank staff.
6.05      Four cofinanciers participated in the project.  This
resulted in many problems which delayed the execution (para.
3.05). It is still uncertain whether the second contractor will
receive full payment for his work due to unresolved issues
between Government and one of the cofinanciers.
6.06      The training and technical assistance component was not
successful (para. 3.19). In future projects, IDA should ensure
that the training program is made sufficiently attractive and
that there is a suitable follow-up program for personnel
trained (career planning, overseas training opportunities,
provision of official transport and accommodation, field
allowances, etc.).



- 14 -
6.07      Despite the difficulties encountered the reduced
project was completed to satisfactory standards, with an
adequate rate of return, but 5 years behind schedule.                                  I

1/ These costs include (i) the demobilization claim from the original contractor
($2.65 million), and (ii) outstanding payments, due to the contractor for the
revised contract from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development
($0.65 million). Interest on such late payments are calculated up to March
31, 1985.
2/ The feasibility study of Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib road indicated that upgrading
this road was not economically justified, and the detailed engineering of the
road was therefore not undertaken.

there were supposed to be 210 vpd, which at a growth rate of 5X p.a.
would reach 268 vpd in 1985, the actual opening year of the road.
2/ Actual traffic in 1985, the opening year of the road, was 250 vpd.
However 59 trucks were deducted for livestock traffic. The 191
vehicles include normal and generated traffic.

TELEX RECEIVED FROM MR. ALI AHMED FARAH, DIRECTOR GENERAL, CED
29 April, 1986
Att: Mr. Yukinori Watanabe
Director,
Operations Evaluation Department
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Somalia
Third Highway Project (Credit 699-SO)
We acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letter dated 27/2/86 which was
received here on 22/3/86 together with the Project Completion Report of
Somalia Third Highway Project.
After having read the Project Completion Report, the Borrower agrees the
text contained in the report. Meanwhile, the breakdowns of the financing
plan printed on page 6 and 7 is difficult for us to follow, mainly because
the breakdown of our disbursement percentage are in various currencies such
as So.Sh., US Dollar, and D.M., where as disbursement percentage on page 6
and 7 of the report are in US Dollars, certainly we are not implying that
the breakdown of the financing plan on page 6 and 7 are not correct, but
since these tables contain breakdowns of US Dollars only and since world
monetary was fluctuating during the long period of project implementation
which we have no data for it, it is simply difficult for us to follow the
breakdowns on page 6 and 7 of the report. However, table 2 of the report
which is showing total cost of each item of the credit is closely in"
agreement with our records of the credit.
In view of the above, we feel obliged to submit to you the records of our
breakdowns of the financing plan of the Credit 699-SO for yoxr perusal as
