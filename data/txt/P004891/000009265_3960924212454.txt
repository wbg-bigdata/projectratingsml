PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY 'ROJECT (LOAN 1683-AL)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.       The purpose of the project was to support the Government's policy
to improve the non-industrial sectors of the economy within a broad plan of
decentralization and regional development. This was to have been achieved
through: (a) easing the backlog in modernization and rehabilitation of
the road network; (b) improving road maintenance, including the
establishment of a road maintenance organization; (c) reconstructing
inadequate road sections that hampered regional economic development;
(d) improving the institutional framework and the number and
qualifications of public works staff; and (e) preparing road development
plans and improving planning capabilities (para. 1.03). Even though not
all these actions were completed as planned, the project successfully met
sub--sector objectives and priorities set by the Government. The
uncompleted actions, in general, have been further pursued under the
ongoing Fourth Highway Iroject (loan 1892-AL) and the proposed Fifth
Highway Project.
2.       The project was completed three years behind schedule.  Civil
works did not begin as planned partly on account of delays in contracting
and obtaining contract approvals and partly as a result of a major
earthquake not far from the La Chiffa - Berrouaghia road reconstruction
project component. Subsequently, landslides imposed serious implementation
constraints on this major project component, culminating in substantial
increases in work quantities and costs and eventually requiring design
modifications.
3.       The road maintenance component reached many of its oblectives.  A
force account mainitenance organization was progressively formed with annual
work targets increased as capacity increased. Equipment was procured at a
lower cost than anticipated. However, record keeping lagged behind
physical progress so data are lacking to quantify the rate of improvement.
Technical assistance was also provided at a lower cost than planned, due
largely to a reduction in the scope of the training program. Training of
mechanics and equipment operators was to have expanded ongoing training,
which had been started under the Second Highway Project (loan 1407-AL), by
establishing a new (second) training center. The plan for the second
center was cancelled although the remaining part of the program was
continued both under the project and under the Fourth Highway Project (loan
1892-AL).
4.       The strengthening of MPW's road planning capability was one oi the
project's key institutional objectives. Reorganization in the early 1980s



- vi -
resulted in transfer of staff to regions and public firms, which detracted
from the progress that was being made toward building up that capability.
In addition, contrary to expectations at appraisal, the Government decided
to terminate direct technical assistance to civil servants and to redirect
it to public agencies who were contracted by MPW to perform specific
services, such as LNTP (investigations and testing) and SAETI (studies and
detailed engineering). International consulting firms, contracted by MPW
for studies under the project, assisted in starting programs of data
gathering for planming purposes, such as preparation of road inventories,
systematic nationwide traffic counting, preparation of guidelines for
feasibility studies and updating of vehicles operating costs. All of these
were sub-components of the technical assistance component foreseen at the
time of appraisal, so considerable progress was made in spite of the total
technical assistance being reduced to about half of what had originally
been planned.
5.       Total project cost increased by less than 202 in local curren"y
but only 2Z in US dollar equivalent because of the rise of the dollar
exchange rate during implementation. The local currency cost increase was
primarily due to a cost overrun in the main component (La Chiffa -
Berrouaghia road) partially offset by cost reductions for the pavement
strengthening, maintenance and technical assistance components.
6.       Points of particular interest highlighted in the project
completion report are:
(a)  Pavement strengthening and road improvement projects were
based on feasibility studies carried out under previous
(mainly Bank-assisted) projects (paras. 2.01, 2.02 and 3.11).
(b) The project faced greater geotechnical and geological
-    problems than anticipated which resulted in implementation
difficulties leading to redesign of the major construction
component. Greater attention needs to be paid to
geotechnical and material considerations in road construction
and improvement projects in mountainous areas. Substantial
cost increases during construction resulted in a lower
economic return (paras 3.10, 3.15 and 3.26).
(c) Reorganization and decentralization, including transfer of
staff to public firms, adversely affected the planning
capacity of MPW. The separation of regional branches of
public road contractors into separate independent firms in
1983 also had an adverse impact on project execution
(paras. 3.18 and 3.21).
(d) Where a traffic-counting program or other traffic studies are
envisaged in a project, the procurement of related equipment
and provision of operating funds should be included in the
project to avoid delays (paras 3.22 and 3.27).



- vii -
(e) Where feasible, provision for road closures should be made on
road construction or improvement jobs involving heavy
earLhworks in mountainous terrain (para. 3.26).
(f) Adequate allowance should be made in future implementation
schedules to allow for the Government's lengthy and
cumbersome procurement procedures (para. 3.27).
g)   The Government opposes direct foreign technical assistance to
civil servants and, as a result, such assistance can only be
provided through para-statal enterprises such as SAETr and
LNTP (paras 4.01 and 5.03).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1683-AL)
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.01     The road network of Algeria is currently estimated at around
80,000 km. Half of this consists of the main highways, which are
classified as national roads (NR) and regional roads (CW). According to
the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) the main network evolved during the
first part of the 1980s as follows;
Length (km)                 Year 1980                Year 1985

Sub-total                32=,211                  34,967
Unpaved                                6,951                    9,226
TOTAL                    39,162                   44,193
These. rsults reflect the improvements achieved through better maintenance
and road rehabilitation, and through new development.  During the period
1980-85, some 450 km of major routes were modernized and pavement
strengthening and rehabilitation was car'ried out over about 3,000 km of
national and some 4,500 km of regional roads. These developments show the
high priority given to the highway subsector and are consistent with the
objecti_res defined during preparation and appraisal of the Third Highway
Project.
1.02     MPW manages the main road network at the central level.  At the
start of the project regional directorates (DIEs), under control of the
regional government authorities (Wilayas), provided technical services.
Road maintenance and development of national roads (NR) was financed
through the MPW budget while regional roads (CW) were financed by the
Wilayas. MPW was responsible for transport infrastructure (highways,
ports, and airports), whereas the DIEs' responsibility extended to housing
ard urban development. Since the 1970s, the Government has followed a
policy of decentralization, delegating greater responsibility to Wilaya
authorities. Reorganization of the regional directorates took place in the
early 1980s, leading to the establishment of basic infrastructure
directorates (DIBs) with responsibilities corresponding to those of MPW.
Procurement and disbursements related to Bank-assisted highway projects
were increasingly processed at the regional level. This required adequate
st&ffing at the regional level, at the very least a director and
sub-directors for maintenance and new construction backed by engineers or



senior technicians. in ench maintenanc.! sub-division (typically 3 to 5 per
Wilaya) as well as engineers and technicians to manage the equipment pool,
its mechanics anid equipmenit operators. Although a significant effort had
been made to match the regional directorates needs, those needs increased
substantially along' witLh the increase in the number of Wilayas from 15 in
1975, tc 3L in 1980, to 48 in 1985, particularly with regards to
experienced staff.
1.03     The Third Highway Project planned to support:
(a) a two-year slice of a five-year program (1990-84) for
improving road maintenance;
(b)  a two-year tranche of a road pavement rehabilitation program
for strengthening about 270 km of paved roads;
(c)  construction works for improving NRI section La
Chiffa-Berrouaghia (51 km);
(d) training for road maintenance; and
(e) technical assistance for improving MPW's planning capability.
1.C4     Prior to implementation of the project, the public road
contractors, which were responsible to MPW, were engaged mainly with new
construction and little concerned with road maintenance. MPW, in
consequence, aimed at filling the gap by developing its force-account
capacity for road maintenance. The force-account system was considerably
strengthened under the project by equipment acquisition and related
training. Although no specific physical annual targets were developed at
the time of appraisal, medium term targets were taken from earlier studies
by consultants. Each Wilaya's annual program was formulated considering
its increasing capacity in terms of equipment and manpower and was
developing satisfactorily until MPW underwent institutional reform at the
end of 1983. Under this reform, the equipment pools were eliminated and
all the equipment and staff transferred to regional parastatal firms. The
highway sub-sector was unprepared for the abrupt change to a contract
maintenance system and th.ere has been some regression in maintenance
capacity due to loss of direct control of the maintenance work forces
without compensating improvement in planning and control of contracted
operations, particularly at the sub-division level. In addition almost all
forms of reporting on maintenance performance collapsed.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     The Third Highway Project was identified and prepared through
feasibility and institutional studies carried out for MPW, mainly as part
of the Bank-assisted First Highway Project (loan 912-AL, 1973). These
studies, which were aimed at developing a five-year road maintenance
program, included: (a) a general study on maintenance; (b) a survey of
DIE equipment pools; and (c) a feasibility study, based on the above, of
an improved maintenance program. The proposed program was evaluated by KPW
and the Bank in the light of the absorptive capacity of existing
institutional arrangements.



-3 -
2.02     The pavement strengthening component was prepared on the basis of
a highway master plan study, feasibility studies and final design, also
carried out under the First Highway Project. In addition to the 270 km
pavement strengthening program, already studied at the time of appraisal
and the improvement of the NRl between La Chiffa and Berrouaghia, MPW also
asked the Bank to consider several new road sections in the eastern part of
the country. These included the improvement of the NR27 between Jijel and
Constantine, the El Kantour pass on the NR3 between Constantine and Annaba
and the Kherrata Gorge on the NR'1 between Bejaia and Setif. These projects
were not accepted by the Bank on account of insufficiently advanced
preparation. The NR9 improvement was included later in the Fourth Highway
Project (loan 1893-AL, 1980) following completion of further detailed
studies, while the NR27 improvement was financed in part by the European
Investment Bank.
2.03     As detailed engineering and bidding documents were available at
the time of appraisal, an early start on procurement procedures was
expected, and actually prequalification started in April 1979. Technical
assistance for work supervision was planned for NRl construction works
because of their complexity.  In the pavement strengthening component, DIB
engineering staff were to be responsible for construction supervision.
2.04     The scope of technical assistance for improving MPW planning
capacity, including specific studies needed, were defined in detail at
appraisal, however a detailed work program and corresponding terms of
reference were left to be prepared during project implementation.
l
2.05     During negotiations, MPW undertook full responsibility for
implementation of all components and also agreed to fund the maintenance
program up to levels agreed with the Bank. The recurring issue of fair bid
evaluati8ns between local public contractors and other contractors was also
discussed. The Algerian regulations providing that local public
contractors would not be required to provide performance bonds,. and would
be entitled to an advance payment amounting to 15% of total contract while
other contractors would be granted 10%, were accepted by the Bank on
condition that they be clearly stated in the bid documents.
2.06     A loan of US$126.0 million was approved by the Board of QAe:cutive
Directors on April 10, 1979, signed on May 16, 1979, and became effective
on September 13, 1979.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Maintenance Program
Equipment and Spare Parts
3.01     Bids for the first tranche of equipment were submitted on
August 15, 1979. The great number of items and suppliers, as well as
shortage of staff, led to lengthy bid evaluation by MPW. In many cases,
bid validity expired before awards were made and MPW had to enter into
negotiations on cost increases. Most of the equipment (90%) was awarded in
January 1980 with Bank approval. Delivery started in early October



-4-
1980--ten moniths later than scheduled--and was completed on March 1981.
With Bank approval the bidding and procurement for the remaining equipment
was managed by DIBs under grotuped purchases. The bids were received in
March 1981 and evaluated by October 1981. Deliveries were started by the
end of 1981, anld cornpleted March 1982. The Bank also approved a contract
for delivery of 120 imported ]ight vehicles, on the basis of a negotiated
contract. At appraisal, plans had called for equipment to be fully
operational in 1981.  This target was achieved only for the first main
tranche of equipment.
Training
3.02     The training component continued activities begun under the Second
Highway Project (loan 1407-AL, 1977). This second phase started in
October 1980, 12 months behind schedule, and was completed by December 1982
after a major revision in scope. The component was designed to finance
operations of an existing training center in Bethioua (Arzew) and to
establish a second one in Batna. Because of a serious backlog in the
ccnstruction of facilities and lack of available infrastructure, and in
view of potential duplication with other training programs being developed
by a newly formed Ministry of Vocational Training, MPW later decided
against development of the Batna site.
3.03     The training center at Bethioua was run with the assistance of
consultants, who were engaged about one year behind the original schedule.
The objectives were to train 114 site mechanics, 114 workshop mechanics,
and 24 instructors (half for equipment operators, and half for site
mechanics). The results achieved as of December 1982 were as follows:
80 site mechanics plus 3 assistants, 48 workshop mechanics, 48 equipment
operators and 20 instructors trained by 10 newly-graduated (under the
Second Highway Project) local instructors. Only 89 trainees for site
mechanics, and 73 for workshop mechanics started the courses, implying that
the training center had been run only at 70-80% of its capacity. Although
bclow its full capacity, the training center performed good results, with a
high rate of graduates for site mechanics and equipment operators. MPW
requested the Bank to continue assistance to the Bethioua center under the
Fourth Highway Project.
Financing and Management
3.04     As agreed in a suppleirantal letter, the Government increased
substantially allocations for national and regional road maintenance to
ensure that new equipment would be kept fully operational and to cover
future renewal costs, materials, and labor. Agreement was reached on a
1980 allocation of DA 143 million for national roads and DA 84 million for
regional roads (in 1979 prices). With a price escalation averaging 10% per
year for road maintenance activities, the budgets in equivalent current
prices would have had to be increased as shown in the table below, which
compares the originally proposed requirements to actual allocations and
expenditures.

Proposed Budget Requirements
National roads                160              175
Regional roads                 90              100

Allocations
National roads                240              260
Regional roads                130              130

Expenditures
National roads                220              230
Regional roads                 100             110
320             340
The actual allocations and expenditures were much higher, particularly
those for national roads.  The latter was in part a result of 5,500 km of
regional roads being reclassified as national roads during the period
1979-81.- However, the total targets set out in the supplemental letter on
maintenance budgets were substantially exceeded. Subsequently, from 1981
to 1984 th-. funding situation for road maintenance remained unchanged in
real terms but there have again been substantial increases in funds in 1985
and 1986.
3.05    =MPW distributed national road funds ander its direct control, to
the DIBs in charge of road maintenance execution. Fund allocations were
based on maintenance needs, according to traffic and surface conditions.
However, there was no efficient monitoring sysLem for compiling accurate
outputs and costs. MPW only started to develop a road maintenance
monitoring system during the course of the Third and Fourth Highway
Projects. In the Fifth Highway Project, planning of maintenance activities
will be developed for seven pilot regional Cl.-torates9 under the
direction of a special unit within the National Public Works Laboratory
(LNTP) acting on behalf of MPW.
3.06     On the whole, the road maintenance component reached many of its
objectives. A force-account maintenance was progressively formed with
annual work targets increased as capacity increased. However, record
keeping lagged behind physical progress so data are lacking to quantify the
rates of progress towards the eventual medium term goals envisaged at
appraisal, and costs have remained high.
B. Pavement Strengthening
3.07     The sub-projects approved by the Bank for inclusion into the
pavement strengthening program totaled 195 km. The remaining 75 km
identified at appraisal (RN7, Sidi Bel Abbes to Mascara and RN8, Tablat to
Bir Ghbalou) were eventually financed entirely with local resources when it



- 6 -
became evident that due to cost overruns loan funds would not be sufficient
to include all of the works for Bank financing. The sections included in
the project were all located in the eastern part of the country:
NR  3 - El Khroub - Ain Touta (127 km)
NR 10 - Ouled Rahmoun - Ain Be'ide (20 km)
NR 16 - El Hadjar - Bouchegouf (26 km)
NR 26 - Akbou - NR15 junction (22 km).
The program was divided into three lots: Lot 1 grouping NR3 and NR10, Lot
2 for NR16, and Lot 3 for NR26. Eighteen bids were received on
February 21, 1980, and the works were awarded on July 1980 as follows:
A foreign contractor, Lots I and 2 (24 months); and
An Algerian contractor, Lot 3 (18 months).
The initial contract cost amounted to DA 205 million (with taxes),
DA 177 million for the foreign firm and DA 28 million for the local firm
respectively. The share of taxes was 10% of total cost for the local
contractor, and 14% for foreign contractor. The Bank approved the awards
proposed by the Government. Works supervision was planned to be handled by
the DIBs with progress reporting, after on-site visits, by MPW staff.
3.08     The lengthy contract approval procedures in Algeria prevented the
works from'starting as planned. The local contractor, with no foreign
exchange transfer to negotiate, was given a start-up notification by
November 1980, and started in December 1980, 11 months later than planned
at appraisal. Contract approval for the foreign contractor was first
ielayed because works had to be carried out in three separate Wilayas.
Uader new regulations, three distinct contract sub-lots had to be reviewed
and approved by the corresponding Wilaya. That bottleneck was further
co.upounded by a last minute reversal of the Ministry of Finance's position
on the foreign exchange percentage (FINEX) proposed by the contractor.
Final approval was not obtained until October 1981. Notification to
proceed was given in November 1981, with six months for mobilization which
was completed by June 1982, and actual work began in July 1982.
3.09     The local contractor started works in December 1980 under
supervision of the Bejaia DIB. Progress was slow due to additional works
(unforeseen at the bidding stage) needed to prevent sections of the road
from being flooded by a parallel river. The contract was fully completed
by October 1982, six months behind contract schedule.
3.10     The foreign contractor started works in July 1982.  Supervision
for the Annaba sub-lot (NR 16) and Batna sub-lot (NR 3) was performed by
DIBs. In Oum El Bouaghi, a new Wilaya, there was no local capacity for
supervision and outside technical assistance had to be brought in. A
French consulting firm, was chosen with Bank approval, and started its
assistance in late October 1982. The works were completed by November 1983
for the Oum El Bouaghi sub-lot, March 1984 for Annaba, and May 1984 for
Batna. Additional costs for the Annaba subcontract accrued because wadi
gravel was unavailable and had to be substituted with crushed stone. Some
minor realignments in the Batna and Oum El Bouaghi subcontracts required



- 7 
unexpected rock excavation. Also, transport costs were underestimated. In
the Oum El Bouaghi subcontract, the quarry had to be changed because of
low-grade materials. Better preparation of the design studies with more
attention to geotechnical and materials considerations would have avoided
most of these difficulties.
C. Road NR l/Chiffa-Berrouaghia Modernization
Project Description
3.11     The NRl section linking La Chiffa to Berrouaghia through Medea was
included under the project for significant improvements in alignment and in
pavement structure. The feasibility and detailed engineering studies
pLcepared under the First Highway Project (loan 912-AL) were completed by
May 1979. These were carried out by a French consulting firm. The entire
component (51.4 km) was divided into 4 sections.  Section 1 (4.5 km),
starting from NR 42 junction, was to be strengthened to an asphalt concrete
pavement standard. All the other sections were to be repaved with double
bituminous surface treatment. Section 2 (8.9 km), along the Chiffa river
canyon, was to be realigned and widened. This involved difficult earthwork
construction with steep slopes and rock excavation, bridges, walls, and
semi-viaducts. Section 3 (15.2 km), which was adjacent to Medea, traversed
an area with poor geotechnical characteristics and needed pavement
rehabilitation, road widening, realignment, new bridges, and other
structurEs.  Section 4 (22.8 km), between Medea and Berrouaghia, needed
pavement rehabilitation and some realignment through deep cuts. All works
were supposed to be carried out under traffic.
Procurement of Works
3.12     Civil works were contracted through international competitive
bidding in compliance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement.
Prequalification started in April 1979, and tendering was completed in
November 1979. On the first round of bidding, MPW decided to award the
works, which were divided into two lots, to two separate contractors one
foreign and the other algerian. The two contractors entered into a joint
venture agreement under which each agreed to take full responsibility for
all works and to compltue,C the partner in case of failure.  Under the
actual final contracts, the local firm was awarded the pavement structures,
drainage (paved ditches, culverts, etc....), and secondary structures
(walls, cantilevered sections), and the foreign firm th3 earthworks, main
bridges, and transport of materials. The contract approval process lasted
from May to November 1980. Both contracts were approved, notified, and the
contractors given the go-ahead to start in late November 1980, six months
later than originally planned. The contract was expected to take
36 months, with the condition that the works would be carried out with
interruptions in traffic not exceeding 20 minutes.
Supervision
3.13     Supervision of works was to be carried out by MPW local services
(DIB of Medea) with geotechnical assistance from LNTP as well as separate
technical assistance. Proposals and selection of a consultant for



-8-
technical assistance ended on October 13, 1980, with an award to the same
consulting firm as had prepared the detailed engineering. The contract was
approved January 31, 1981, and notified on March 14, 1981 before the date
cf actual start of work by the contractors.
Implementation of Civil Works
3.14     The mobilization of the two contractors and their installation on
site was delayed six months beyond the scheduled period due to two
concurrent causes:
- a major earthquake that hit El Asnam in October 1980 engaged the
local contractor extensively in rescue and reconstruction
efforts; while
- administrative procedures relating to the import of equipment by
foreign contractors, delayed their foreign partners.
Not until November 1981 were full operations started up, with a revised
implementation schedule prepared in February 1982 which tried to maintain
the December 1983 completion date, but subject to confirmation in early
1983.
3.15     New construction and road widening in the canyon section and in
the mountainous terrain further south, led to major landslides which
blocked the road and disrupted traffic. This was due to poorer
geological conditions than had been anticipated. The large resulting
increase in earthwork quantities, aggravated by the need to flatten cut
slopes, led MPW in November 1982, to request the French consultant to
restudy the project and-propose practical alternatives. Early in 1983,
the consultant submitted a report recommending that two short tunnel
sections in the La Chiffa Canyon be constructed. These tunnel sections
had earller been excluded from the project on the grounds of being
uneconomic. The report also recommended increased use of riverside
cantilever structures when widening the road, so as to reduce cutting
into the slopes. MPW accepted these recommendations and also decided to
improve horizontal geometry on certain road sections on which
low-standards had originally been retained, and to add a bridge over the
SNTF rail crossing. Economic reevaluation, completed in June 1983,
produced an 18% IRR compared to the appraisal estimate of 20%.
3.16     During the 1982 construction operations, the foreign contractor
progressed satisfactorily on earthworks and main bridges, in spite of the
quantity increases. However, pavement work, drainage work and
construction of structures for which the local firm was responsible, were
lagging behind. Although some of these works had, to a certain extent,
to wait for completion of the earthworks, this pattern continued
throughuut the project and evidenced a weakness discussed further below.
3.17     The revisions to the project design and increases in work
quantities led MPW to seek, through the DIB Medea, to renegotiate
unit-prices and contract conditions. In the former they were successful
with the foreign firm; the algerian firm, whose work quantities were less
affected, maintained its unit-prices. The revised contract agreement
recognized the need to close the La Chiffa-Medea road section (closed
from May 1983 to January 1984) it also:



- provided for a six-month contract extension; to May 1984 for the
foreign contractor and to June 30, 1984 for the local
contractor; and
- added the two tunnels (628m), with a 12 month schedule for this
work, to the foreign firm's contract.
The amendment was approved on November 6, 1983 with a revised schedule
calling for contract completion by December 1984. Tunnel borings started
November 30, 1983. The Government requested an extension of the loan
closing date from June 30, 1982 to December 31, 1984. The Bank agreed to
extend the closing date to June 1984. Although the Government intended to
finance the foreign cost overruns, the increase of the US dollar exchange
rate made this unnecessary as a lower foreign exchange rate applied to the
contract amendment. The initial disbursement rate of 45% of total cost
thus remained.
3.18     By the end of 1983, most earthworks (about 4 million cubic-meters)
had been completed. Most main bridge work had also been completed. The
foreign contractor's good performance was achieved through a three-shift,
24-hour work schedule. On the other hand, the local firm's drainage works
were far behind schedule, jeopardizing slope stability and completed
pavement works. Subbase colirses were only 50% completed, and base courses
25%. This slow pace led MPW/DIB Medea to pass part of the construction of
walls and cantilevers on to the foreign partner. Although the canyon
subsection was reopened to traffic at the start of 1984, little progress
had been made on La Chiffa-Medea section pavement in spite of the
eight-month traffic clQsure. The underlying reasons for this delay was the
1983 reorganization which led to splitting the local firm into separate
regional firms which became independent of the parent firm based in
Algiers. The division of capital assets and staff between the firms
seriously impaired the regional contractor's capability. MPW, recognizing
this, had to obtain reenforcement from the parent firm and some of its
other branches.
3.19     In 1984, MPW decided to change the planned double surface
treatment into an asphalt concrete overlay because of higher traffic
expectations for the opening year, which was now behind schedule compared
to the appraisal estimate. The foreign contractor continued to make
satisfactory progress. By the end of June, earthworks were almost fully
completed, all main structures (except the tunnels) were finished, and
although drainage was still behind schedule, pavement work was finally
progressing satisfactorily, until a two-month cut in bitumen delivery in
late May 1984 slowed progress. At the specific request of the Minister,
the contractors concentrated on completing the La Chiffa-Medea section by
the end of October 1984. To accelerate work on that section, another part
of the local firm's contract was transferred to the foreign firm, resulting
in a second amendment. The two tunnels were put into service on
October 29, 1984. However, it became evident that the contracts would not
be completed within six months after the closing date of the loan, so in
January 1985 the Bank agreed to a second extension of the loan closing date
from June 1984 to June 1985, and requested the Government to submit a final
implementation schedule.



- 10 -
3.20     Since most of the works were completed by end-1984, MPW decided
not to extend the foreign consultant's assistance, but to supervise
remaining works on force account under DiB/Medea. The implementation
schedule which was agreed in December 1984, when the second extension of
loan closure was granted, was not followed in 1985. An unusually wet
winter (1984/85) delayed pavement works on the Medea-Berrouaghia section.
The local contractor's organizational problems aggrevated by further
asphalt shortages delayed progress for the entire year. Pavement works
were not completed until November 1985, and minor ancillary works in
March 1986. The Bank subsequently granted a third extension of the loan
closing date, from June 30 to December 31, 1985 to permit final
disbursements under the loan.
D. Technical Assistance
3.21     Apart from the training component for the maintenance program and
supervision of construction works, consultant services under the project
were to assist KPW in road maintenance and development planning. A
detailed scope of a program estimated to require about a thousand
man-months of consultant services was defined at appraisal. However, two
factors contributed to a considerable reduction in total servicea during
project implementation: (a) reorganization of MPW stemming from
implementation of a longer-standing decentralization policy of the
Government, resulted in MPW's headquarters staff being transfered to
regions,-projects and public firms, leaving only directors and
sub-directors at headquarters and seriously affected in-house, national
highway planning capability which was to have benefitted from the technical
assistance; and (b) the Government decided that diredt technical assistance
to Ministry Staff (civil servants) would no longer be acceptable, so that
technical assistance had to be redirected to specialized agencies who MPW
contracted to perform specific services, such as LNTP (investigations and
testing) and SAETI (studies and detailed engineering). Results of services
performed by or for these agencies, were disseminated to regions.
3.22     To improve road planning, MPW requested support for preparing:
(a) road vehicle operating costs; (b) a methodology for road improvement
studies (including the start of standard recording of road inventory data);
and (c) a comprehensive traffic counting system covering the main network
(national roads and regional roads). MPW decided at first to entrust the
works to the local public consulting firm which, through a joint venture,
was receiving assistance from an international consultant. In October
1980, the Government found the work program unsatisfactory and decided to
request proposals internationally. In July 1981, it selected another
international consultant, with Bank approval, to work with staff in LNTP.
Even though contract approval was still pending, these consultants started
work on November 1981. Final contract approval was granted in April 1982,
and vehicle operating cost and road feasibility study user's manuals were
delivered in 1983. The traffic-counting system was designed in 1982 and
staff were trained on-site. The bidding procedure for counting equipment
was started by MEW in late 1982, but two years were needed for full
delivery and on-site installation. The first annual campaign for traffic
counts was therefore not implemented until 1985. Under the system, the
overall paved network has been divided into 2,000 sections. Half of the



M 11 -
sections are surveyed every year, so that by end-1986 results on the total
network will be available.
3.23     MPW also planned to carry out an East-West corridor study
(1,200 km) to cope with the high traffic prospects in the next 20 years.
These studies were to be carried out in two phases:
(a) Phase A would recommend a choice between corridor
alternatives and propose a rough implementation phasing; and
(b) Phase B would assess the feasibility of alternative
engineering solutions within the recommended corridor,
recommend a phased implementation schedule and produce final
designs for the first priority sections.
3.24     Requests for proposals were issued in March 1981, proposals were
received on June 1981, and evaluation ended November 1981, with MPW
awarding the east lot to a French consulting firm, and the west lot to a
U.S. consulting firm. For the center lot, MPW selected the local
consultant, supported by a foreign firm, to ensure continuity in subsequent
phases of the expressway corridor program. This selection raised a
financing issue, since the local firm could net incur direct foreign
exchange costs on behalf of its foreign partner. Therefore, in June 1982
the Bank approved an amendment of the Loan Agreament to finance 60% of
total consultant fees for this work instead of 100% of foreign
expenditures. Phase A was completed in February 1984. However, in view of
lower tian expected investment levels for the 1985-89 five-year plan, MPW
postponed Phase B to give priority to maintenance.
3.25     In April 1982, feasibility and detailed engineering studies-for
pavement strengthening of sections to be implemented under a subsequent
Bank-assisted highway project were included under the project. The
Government selected a french firm for the Oran-Remchi section (110 km).
Studies were completed in 1982. Studies for other road sections, including
modernization of the NR16 between Souk Atisas and Negrine (330 km), were
undertaken entirely with local financing.
E. Project Implementation Schedule
3.26     The actual ana expected project implementation schedule is shown
in Table 1. The main component of the project, NR 1, La Chiffa-
Berrouaghia modernization, required five years for construction compared
with the two and one-half years expected at appraisal. Neither the effects
of the 1980 earthquake, nor the problems associated with the organizational
changes (split-up) of the local firms could have been anticipated. In
retrospect, however, the need for better geotechnical studies is clear
(para. 3.15) and the attempt to conduct significant earthworks in
mountainous terrain without providing for road closure is over optimistic.
3.27     Other project components also suffered from delays, mainly because
of lengthy tenders and contract approvals. Procedures for the foreign
contractors took longer because of foreign exchange approvals from the
Ministry of Finance (FINEX).  Finally, the traffic-count system fell four



- 12 
years behind schedule because procuremient of related equipment and
arrangements for provision of operating funds had not been included under
the project.
IV.  PROJECT COST AND DISBURSEMENTS
gpjject Cost
4.01     Actual project costs compared with appraisal estimates are shown
in Tables 2 (DA million) and 3 (US$ million). The total project cost in
local currency was increased by less than 20%, and in US dollar equivalent
by only 2% because of the rise of the dollar exchange rate during
implementation. The total cost overrun in local currency, which amounted
to DA 185 million, was primarily due to an overrun of DA 262 million (61%)
in the main component, NRI/La Chiffa-Berrouaghia. This was partially
offset by cost reductions of DA 39 million (20%) for the maintenance
component, DA 19 million (7%) for the pavement strengthening component, and
DA 19 million (47%) for the consultant services component. Cost reduction
for the maintenance component resulted from acquisition of less expensive
equipment and cancellation of the proposed Batna Training Center. Cost
reduction for the pavement strengthening component resulted from
rehabilitation of only 195 km of the 270 km of roads expected at the time
of project appraisal. The average unit cost of pavement strengthening
increased by 30% in local currency (from DA 1.1 to DA 1.4 in million/km),
but only by 11% in equivalent US dollar (from US$270,000 to
US$300,000/km). Cost reductions for consultant services resulted from
reduced scope of studies and technical assistance but project supervision
was not affected. Phase B of the feasibility study and final design of the
East-West corridor was never begun (para. 3.21). Despite MPW's continuing
need for~external support, the Government has opposed direct technical
assistance to the ministry in favor of training and assistance to
enterprises such as SAETI and LNTP.
4.02     Modernization of NRl/La Chiffa-Berroughia, amounted to 60% of
total project cost, compared with 45% at appraisal. In November 1979
prices, the cost of the construction work on which bids were based, would
have amounted to DA 424 miliion, and cost escalation to another
DA 34 million.  Thus the total cost of DA 458 million would have exceeded
the appraisal estimate (DA 428 million) by only 7% had it not been for
additional work quantities (about DA 120 million) and projec. additions
(about DA 112 million). In summary, the incremental costs compared with
the initial contract cost break down as follows: 8.0% for cost escalation,
28.3% for added quantities, and 26.4% for extra work, totalling about 55%.
T'he small portion for cost escalation reflects the reduction in initial
contract prices renegotiated in 1983 between MPW and the contractors in
response to changes in volumes and implementation conditions (e.g.,
extended contract period, traffic closure). The final economic cost of the
project should include the actual construction cost as well as the economic
loss incurred by road users in 1983 during traffic closure of La
Chiffa-Medea section, which had not been planned at appraisal and which
resulted in an average increase in trip length of more than 80km. This
additional cost is estimated at about DA 150 million, thereby raising the
overall cosL to about twice the initial contract cost.  The total cost for



- 13 -
NRl work supervision, including amendment for time extension, amounted to
DA 9.0 Billion for consultant services, provided by a French consultant,
DA 3.8 million for LNTP services, and unknown force-account costs (DIB
Medea). Project supervision costs amounted to only 2 to 3% of the total
construction cost of DA 690 million.
4.03     Foreign exchange expenditures actually incurred by the Government
on contract commitments remained under the appraisal estimate by 3.6% in
Algerian Dinars, and 17.3% in US dollars. This was because a portion of
coastruction works, equipment supply (crushing plants), and studies which
had been carried out by local contractors were not eligible for direct
foreign payments under local regulations. Had these been carried out by
foreign contractors, the total foreign expenditures would have exceeded the
appraisal estimate (US0126 million) by at least 10%, reaching about
US$140 million.
Disbursement
4.04     Planned and actual disbursements are shown in Table 4.  Actual
disbursements lagged far behind the appraisal schedule because of delays in
procurement, contract approvals, and implementation of works. By
June 30, 1983, (the original loan closing date), actual disbursements were
only 50% of expected disbursements. There were three extensions of closing
date: from June 1983 to June 1984, then to June 1985, and finally to
December 1985. The loan was fully disbursed by August 1, 1986.
4.05     The Loan Agreement defined five distinct project components:
Part A. for maintenance equipment; Part B for road rehabilitation (pavement
strengthening); Part C for NRl/La Chiffa-Berroughia modernization; Part D
for equipment and technical assistance to training centers; and Part E for
technicatI assistance for work supervision and studies. The loan fund
allocation and the percentage costs eligible for financing by the Bank were
fixed by category as follows:
Loan Amount                   (X) of costs

V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01    -Reorganization of regional directorates, previously responsible
fon housing as well as transport infrastructure, led to the creation of
D!Bs responsible for transport infrastructure exclusively. This took place
while the Third Highway Project was under implementation thereby allowing
the DIBs to give the necessary priority to the highway sector. The
development of adequate force account capacity for road maintenance,
supported by the Third and subsequent Fourth Highway Projects, was
successful but was la'.er interrupted by a major institutional reform. By
the end of 1983, DIB equipment and work forces were transferred to, or
transformed into, regional parastatal road construction enterprises. Road
maintenance previously performed by force account would henceforth be
handled by contract. The proposed Fifth Highway Project will assist in
making best use of the new system, particularly through the introduction of
lo-cal c .t.titive bidding procedures for maintenance contracts.
5.02     As part of decentralization, decision makirng was steadily
transferred froM the central level to .he regional authorities. At the
saie ti.wme, however, the number of Wilayas had been sharply increased, from
15 inr 1975, to 31 in 1980, and 48 in 1985. The newer ones often lacked
adequate staff and needed temporary assistance. The same decentralization
process divided the large nationwide public construction firms, based in
Algiers or major regional cities, into smaller firms. The reorganization,
placed a burden on the new firms who no longer had access to support from
their parent organizations and the results were felt on the construction of
the \NRl and other road projects.  The follow-on Fifth Highway Project will
focus on eliminating institutional difficulties related to the recent
reorgani.zation.

5.03     The procurement and contract approval p.rocedures were
time-consu.ming and caused particular delays in approval of foreign
contracLors.  This is mAinly because the foreigrn exchange lshate ot the
contracts had to be reviewed by the Ministry of Finance.  Also, ;a 'ipeci a
inter-minigsterial commission ("rommission mixte") srrenepd al]  for4i.gn
technical assistance.  In tact-, the G,overnment oppo.-es direct foreifgn
technical assistance to ministries and, as a result, such teclunical
assistance can only be provided through para-stata] entcrprises  such .s
SAETI and LNTP.
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUAT1ON
6.01     An economic reevaluation has been prepared for each road
construction component as well as for the improved road maintenance
program. The maintenance component was only the first tranche of a
five-year program (1980-84), with the second tranche implemented under the
subsequent Fourth Highway Project. Although this program was implemented
successfully, it was affected by the reorganization of road maintenance
activities beginning at the end of 1983. The re-evaluation of the improved
road maintenance program has therefore taken into account the full
incremental costs of the program and its impact on the condition of the
road network. Road construction and maintenance costs were adjusted to
1984 prices by applying deflators related to gross fixed investment in
Algeria and estimated by Bank services. Economic costs were defined as
total costs less local taxes. They included supervision costs when
identified. Details of the economic reevaluation are given in Annex 1 for
the pavement strengthening program, Annex 2 for the NRI, La
Chiffa-Berrouaghia, and Annex 3 for the road maintenance component.
Pavement_-Strengthening
6.02     Using 1979 base year estimates, the appraisal methodology applied
average annual traffic growth rates of 10% up to 19S3, and 8% thereafter.
For the economic reevaluation, traffic forecasts were established using
average annual growth rates of 8% during 1980-85 and 3% thereafter. These
rates were applied to the 1985 traffic counts to obtain the ten-year
traffic data required for the economic reevaluation. victual opening year
traffic volumes are within 5% of the appraisal estimates for the NR3 and
NR3/10 and about 30% higher for the NR16 and NR26. Actual traffic volumes
in 1985 range from 4,500 vpd on the NR3/10 to 5,400 vpd on the NR16.
According to the pavement strengthening implementation schedule, the first
year of service life was 1982 for the NR 26 section, and 1984 for the other
sections. Recurrent costs for normal maintenance in the project scenario
were updated to 1984 prices. For an average year of service life
(10 years), the standard maintenance cost has been reevaluated at 20,000
DA/km net of taxes. Half of that has been allocated to pavement works with
effort increasing from 5% in the opening year to 3007a in Year 10. The
appraisal methodology assumed that in order to maintain the initial service
level in the without project scenario, the recurrent maintenance costs over
10 years would increase exponentially over the period with cumulated costs

coadii.lon (roighIness) were derived from 1984 estimates prepared for MPN.
GLven the tratfic distributionx by vehicle types on the various sections,
the average  fincremental cost per one million veh. km for 100 am/km of
toughness variation has been estinmated to range from DA 10,000 to 11,000.
E,asei oYk expected road surface conditions with and without the project, the
annual road-user benefits were then derived and combined with maintenance
benetfits.  The economirc reevaluation of each subcomponent gave the
following results:

m
Although slightly below appraisal expectations, the ERS were acceptable and
consistent with the nature of the road improvements. The ERS are lower
because of higher pavement rehabilitation costs than expected at appraisal.
Minor alignment improvements were not reflected in user benefits.
NRJ (La. Chiffa-Berrouaghia) Improvement
6.04     Traffic volumes counted in 1985 are 5% to 10% below the levels
forecast at appraisal, namely about 6,250 vpd between La Chiffa and Medea
section and 5,200 vpd between Medea and Berrouaghia (Annex 2). The volume
of light vehicles is lower than the appraisal estimates, but this is
cotnterbalanced by higher volume of heavy vehicles. The appraisal dssumed
that traffic would increase at about 8% per year due to expected industrial
and regional development in the plateau areas south of Medea and which are
served by the NRI trunk road. The same growth scenario has been adopted
for the economic reevaluation. The first year of service life for La
Chiff.a-4edea section is 1984, and for Medea-Berrouaghia 1985.
6.05     At appraisal, the vehicle operating cost savings expected from the
project aiere estimated per traffic unit (veh. km) by vehicle types and for
five subsections. Savings per traffic unit to be realized in the first
year of service life were updated at 1984 economic prices. Those unit
savings are expected to increase in the future by 2% per year because of



- 17 -
increasing traffic volumes and hence increasing congestion in the without
project scenario. In addition to the road user benefits expected from the
originally designed project, improvements derived from additional works
were estimated as equivalent to a 1% reduction in the total road length.
The additional project works are also likely to reduce future maintenance
costs by reducing rite possibility of landslides. However, no additional
maintenance cost savings have been included in the economic reevaluation.
6.06     The economic reevaluation, which takes into account the 1983
traffic closure of eight months and the corresponding economic loss, shows
an ER of about 8.5% compared to the appraisal estimate of 20%. This result
reflects the major increase in construction costs during implementation as
well as the effects of the unforeseen closure of the road to traffic in
1983.  If t'z effects of the road closure are not included in the
re-evaluz.tLictE.. the ER would increase to about 12%. A further sensitivity
analysis, 9i"3*; assumes a doubling of incremental congestion costs with
increases  e .tiit vehicle operating cost savings of 4% per year instead of
2%, would raise the ER to just over 10%. Although only a marginal return,
the project obviously has important indirect effects on economic
development by improving accessibility on the main trunk route linking the
coastal plain with the inland plateau areas and the deeper south. The
project may also have had some impact on diverting traffic from other
routes between the coastal area and the interior. However, the appraisal
did not consider such benefits and no data were available to make an
estimate of possible diverted traffic benefits during the re-evaluation.
Road Maintenance Program
6.07     The economic re-evaluation of the improved road maintenance
progranvi,has been undertaken by assessing the impact of improved maintenance
levels on the paved road network during the period 1980-85. The
classification of the road network according to traffic range and surface
condition was established for 198G and for 1985 based on MPW data.
Allowance was made for the effects on the road network of substantial
levels of road investment during the 1980-85 period including some 450 km
of modernization and about 4500 km of rehabilitation and paving of primary
and secondary roads. After all-,-tnce was made for these improvements, the
without project scenario assumes that in general roads would deteriorate
from good to poor condition over about a 10-year period, an assumption used
in the appraisal methodology. Total road user savings were tstimated for
1985 based on the number of vehicle-kms travelled in each road condition
category and annual benefits from 1981 onwards were assumed to increase
progressively during the period. The estimated ER of the improved program
is about 300%. Although estimated at appraisal, benefits related to
avoided rehabilitation were not included in the re-evaluation. The revised
ER is comparable to the appraisal estimate which was estimated at over 200%.
Overall Results
6.08     The revised ER for all three quantifiable components is evaluated
at about 160%, approximately twice the average ER estimated at appriasal.
This is due to the higher ER on the road maintenance component than that
estimated at appraisal.

VII.  PERFORMANCE BY THE GOVERNMENT
7.01     Most of the loan covenants were directed at committing the
Government to (i) respect implementation schedules and agreed standards,
and (ii) furnish adequate funds and staff. The problems which arose in
respecting implementation schedules have been discussed previously for each
component. The only change in standards was on the RN-1 project component,
fo- reasons given in para 3.14, and was accepted by the Bank in the light
of prevailing conditions. Adequate funds for project financed works was
never a problem. On the point of providing adequate staff, particularly
for maintenance and training, MPW consistently gave priority to filling
regional staffing needs and those of the construction enterprises, with
engineers and technicians trained in its own schools. The amplification of
the number of wilayas and the expanding needs of staff for new construction
however, created a time lag between demand and supply. The Government's
efforts nonetheless should be considered as satisfactory.
7.02     The Loan Covenant requiring the Government to control vehicle
dimensions and axle loads to conform to values used for design has in
essence been met through a high degree of regulation of the trucking
industry, including truck sizes. Although no load enforcement measures are
in effect, recent surveys indicate that the incidence of axles loaded in
excess of the 13 ton legal limit is negligible.
7.03     The weakest aspect of the Government's performance has been in
delays during the bid evaluation process and that of contract approval. In
part this is attributable to a system of detailed engineering which leaves
final construction plans to be produced by the contractor. This in turn
led contractors to submit qualified bids which required negotiations with
the lower bidders to ascertain the final lowest offer once qualifying
conditions were resolved. These negotiations lengthened the bid evaluation
periods. Subsequent approvals, first by a central bid commission and then
by the Ministry of Finance, the latter of the foreign exchange percentage
requested by the contractor, further prolonged the time between bid
submission and contract approval. Lengthy discussions have been held
between Bank missions and the Government culminating in late 1985 in
agreement to follow Bank guidelines and procedures on future Bank financed
projects. It is expected that this will result in swifter approvals of
contracts.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     Execution of The Third Highway Project was fully consistent with
the objectives and priorities the Government had set for the highway
subsector. Over the last six years, 1980-85, the Government invested
DA 13 billion on National Ro,as, of which DA 3 billion for rehabilitation
(3,000 km), DA 7 billion for improvement (400 km), and DA 3 billion for
expressway development (100 km). Government efforts have been assisted by
Bank support through the Second, Third, and Fourth Highway Projects. The
Second Project improved the NR 5 Boudouaou-Lakhdaria section (40 km) with a
total project cost of DA 660 million. The Third Project supported
rehabilitation (195 km) at a cost of DA 275 million and upgraded the NRl/La



- 19 -
Chiffa-Berrouaghia section (51 km) at a cost of DA 700 million. With the
contribution of the ongoing Fourth Highway Project, the Bank will have
participated in about 20 of total investment for national roads during
l98085, exclusive of expressways.
8.02     The original project implementation schedule was too ambitious in
light of the time-consuming procedures required in Algeria for tender,
procurement, and contraCt approval. Similar problems occurred on. previous
road construction projects: slippage in implementation with time and cost
overruns, unplanned work extensions, and asphalt shortages. Although MPW
was not fully responsible for these delays and changes, project preparation
and management should be strengthened in order to minimize these problems.
8.03     Project risks are invariably higher for complex construction works
than for maintenance And rehabilitation works. While the economic
viability of the maintenance and rehabilitation components cannot be
questioned, the economic return on the major construction component under
the project has proved to be marginal because of substantial increases in
construction costs. For major construction projects, more attention will
have to be paid to final designs with more in-depth analysis of
geotechnical and geological risks. However, Government policy in the
highway subsector is now clearly oriented towards stepping up
rehabilitation of the existing network and increasing the efficiency of
road maintenance operations, objectives which are being supported by the
proposed Fifth Highway Project.
8.04     The development of force-account maintenance capabilities which
was the objective of the Third and Fourth Highway Projects is now
reoriented towards a system of contractual maintenance. New roles and
competition among regional firms should have a positive impact on
construction and maintenance in terms of both quality and cost. Bank
assistance has helped to develop the capabilities of local contractors by
stimulating competition and encouraging the establishment of joint
ventures. However, most local firms that were previously part of large
nationwide organizations are now too small to handle major contracts and
participation of foreign contractors will still be needed in the future for
major and complex works.

Note (a): Traffic closure of La Chiffa-Medea SeCtiOn in 1983 (8 months)
caused disruption to about 5,350 vld. Trips had been either rerouted or
cancelled. Given that the lengthier rerouting through Khemis Miliana
would have increased the average trip length by about 90 km, it is
assumed that the incremental cost or economic loss corresponds to an
equivalent of about DA 146 million.
Note (b): First year of service is considered as 1984 for La Chiffa-Medec
section, and 1985 for Medea-Berrouaghia section.

Note (a): Travel time savings are n?t included in VOC. They were estimated at
202 of VOC at appraisal.
Note (b): Incremental VCC estimated here refer to first year of service life.
They will increase during service life, because of increasing traffic (8% per
year) and hence congestion. Assumptions of 2 and 4% growth will be considered,
which means that over 20 years actual unit VOC will be increased by  n% or 100S
respectively (25,000 to 30,000 v/d).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1683-AL)
Economic Re-Evaluation of the
Road Maintenance Component
1.       Based on data supplied by MPW and estimates derived by Bank
missions, a classification of the paved road network (RN, CW), according to
traffic range and surface condition is shown in Table 1. The network
length covered by the project increased from about 32,250 km in 1980 to
about 35,000 km in 1985. Traffic growth during the period in terms of
vehicle-kms increased at an average rate of 10% per year.
2.       Road surface condition corresponds to MPW estimtes derived from
Wilaya district reports. The distribution of the network according to road
surface condition in the with and without scenarios takes into account
actual road investments during the period 1980-85, namely:
(a) about 450 km of modernization including expressways (100 km),
and about 3,050 km of pavement strengthening on national
roads (RN); and
(b)  about 2,750 km of pavement rehabilitation, and 1,740 km of
new pavement, on regional roads (CW).
3.       After allowance was made for these improvements, it is assumed
that in the without project scenario roads generally deteriorate from good
to fair condition over a 10-year period in line with the appraisal
methodology.
4.       An average roughness is assumed for thai three major surface types:
(a) 2,000 mm/km for good; (b) 3,000 mm/km for fair; and (c) 4,000 mm/km for
poor. Excess vehicle operating costs compared with an ideal level of 1,800
mm/km are shown in Table 2-A, and the vehicle-kms in each surface category
are shown in Table 2-B for 1985. By comparing the two scenarios, annual
road user benefits have been estimated at DA 944.4 million in 1985. The
first year of implemention of the improved program was 1981, and benefits
are assumed to increase progressively through 1985 as follows:
Road User Benefits             (DA million)
1981                        188.9
1982                        377.8
1983                        566.7
1984                        755.6
1985                        944.4

5.       The incremental costs of the maintenance include the costs of the
additional equipment and training and the incremental operating
expenditures related to this additional equipment. As maintenance
expenditures include a provision of about 202 for equipment depreciation,
the latter has been deducted from the incremental operating costs.
Equipment and training costs amounted to US$36.5 million (DA 183 million)
under the Third Highway Project in 1981, and US$18.7 million
(DA 94 million) under the Fourth Highway Project in 1983. The stream of
the project costs are shown in Table 2-C.
6.       The economic reevaluation of the improved program shows an ER of
about 300X:
